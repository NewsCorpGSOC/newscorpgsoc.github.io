Romanians cast ballots in parliamentary election as turmoil in presidential race grips the nation	BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — Romanians are casting ballots in a parliamentary election on Sunday sandwiched between a two-round presidential race, the first round of which has plunged the European Union and NATO member country into unprecedented turmoil following allegations of electoral violations and Russian interference. Sunday’s vote will elect a new government and prime minister and determine the formation of the country’s 466-seat legislature. Romanians who are abroad have been able to vote since Saturday. The legislative vote comes a week after the first round of a presidential race that saw a controversial far-right populist who was polling in single digits win the most votes. Calin Georgescu, 62, is due to face reformist Elena Lasconi of the Save Romania Union party, or USR, in a Dec. 8 runoff. Georgescu’s success, which many have attributed to his rapid rise in popularity on the social media platform TikTok, has triggered nightly protests throughout Romania by those who oppose his past remarks praising Romanian fascist leaders and Russian President Vladimir Putin and view him as a threat to democracy. Many observers believe the presidential outcome indicates a sharp shift from Romania’s mainstream parties to more populist anti-establishment parties, whose voices have found fertile ground amid high inflation, high cost of living and a sluggish economy. Alexandru Rizescu, a 24-year-old medical student, says he was surprised by the result in the first-round presidential ballot and that it’s an 'obvious sign' Europe at large is shifting towards far-right populism. 'Most of us are sick of these big parties, but now we have to think about the … lesser evil,' he said. 'If Georgescu becomes president, with a favorable parliament, it’s going to be wild.' According to a report by Expert Forum, a Bucharest-based think tank, Georgescu’s TikTok account before last week's vote saw an explosion of engagement, which it said appeared 'sudden and artificial, similar to his polling results.' Without naming Georgescu, who declared zero campaign spending, Romania’s top defense body said Thursday that 'a presidential candidate benefited from massive exposure due to preferential treatment' granted by TikTok. Romania has become a 'priority target for hostile actions' by Russia, it added. The Kremlin denies it is meddling. The same day, the Constitutional Court requested a recount of all 9.4 million votes after a presidential candidate who obtained 1%, filed a complaint alleging the USR had violated electoral laws against campaign activities on polling day. The Central Election Bureau approved the request and said scanned reports were due to be sent in by Sunday night. On Friday, the court postponed a decision until Monday on whether to annul the vote. Cristian Andrei, a political consultant based in Bucharest, says Sunday’s ballot compared to what many surveys had predicted could be reshaped by Georgescu's success, with far-right parties possibly obtaining record highs. 'The impact of the surprise in last Sunday’s presidential election will be significant, and we are going to wake up in a new political reality,' he told The Associated Press. 'Georgescu voters will speak again and will reshape how we look at the political Romanian spectrum from now on and probably forever.' 'We are going to wake up on Monday in a new political reality in Romania,' he added. 'The most probable scenario will be a difficult-to-build majority in the parliament to support and endorse a new government.' Despite the two main opposition parties — which have dominated post-communist politics in Romania — the Social Democratic Party, PSD, and the National Liberal Party, PNL, formed an unlikely coalition in 2021 which has become increasingly strained. A small ethnic Hungarian party exited the Cabinet last year after a power-sharing dispute. While the presidential role in Romania has significant decision-making powers in areas such as national security and foreign policy, the prime minister is the head of the nation’s government. Recent surveys have suggested the top three parties in Sunday’s race will be the PSD, the far-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians and the PNL. After rising to the political scene eight years ago on an anti-corruption ticket, the USR’s popularity has diminished in recent years, but could garner the next most votes. More minor parties that may not pass the 5% threshold to enter parliament include the pro-EU reformist REPER party and the liberal-conservative Force of the Right. Some have predicted that the far-right nationalist S.O.S Romania party, and the recently formed and little-known Party of Young People, which has backed Georgescu, could pass the threshold. Silviu Safta, a 30-year-old retail manager in Bucharest, said that Georgescu topping the polls was 'a surprise for everyone, except for the 2 million people that voted for him,' and that he's skeptical whether Sunday's parliamentary vote will follow the same populist tilt. 'I think Romanians will be more informed about their elections and ... their candidates,' he said. 'I’m a little bit skeptical about the results, but I hope that democracy will win.'	https://apnews.com/article/romania-election-europe-far-right-da223dff415a0fa333bea0b1ccdb0adb	2024-11-30T20:01:58-08:00	
Left behind in Kenya, children of British soldiers struggle to find their identity	NANYUKI, Kenya (AP) — Margaret Wandia became pregnant after a week-long relationship with a British soldier training near her community in Kenya. They met while she worked at a bar in her early 20s. She knew little about him. He left her with a biracial child. Now that son is 26, and he is part of an effort by a Kenyan lawyer to take a number of such children to Britain. The goal is to confront authorities over hundreds of such cases reported over the years, and to find the fathers and seek their support. It is a long shot after years of attempts by human rights groups to hold the British military and its personnel accountable for their actions during weeks of training in Kenya — including alleged rapes — and the children they leave behind. The countries’ $44 million defense cooperation agreement was renewed in 2021. It allows up to 10,000 British forces to train for eight weeks in Kenya every year. Kenya’s biracial children are part of broader concerns about the British mission, notably the persistent allegations of rape of local girls and women. Like many biracial children in largely conservative Kenya, Wandia's son, Louise Gitonga, said he has felt excluded by society and left out of education and employment opportunities for being 'too white.' 'I have an identity crisis that has driven me to alcoholism,' the unemployed Gitonga told The Associated Press at his home in the central town of Nanyuki. 'Everywhere I pass, people call me a white man. Others call me an albino. These names cause me a great deal of pain and hurt.' His mother recalled taking him to boarding school and being asked to pay higher fees for her white child. She later married a local farmer, Paul Wachira, who acknowledged the challenges of raising a biracial child. 'At times, I had to hide him from the rest of the family during gatherings to avoid many questions, as he looked very different from his siblings,' Wachira said. Kenyan lawyer Kelvin Kubai represents 10 such children of visiting British forces. He asserted that not all of their parents' relationships were consensual. In collaboration with a British law firm he declined to name, he hopes to take some of the children to Britain next year and go to court. 'You know, such children do not know the circumstances under which they were born,' Kubai said. He hopes they'll obtain citizenship. According to British law, children born to British citizens are eligible for British citizenship and care of both parents if they are below 18. Seven of the children Kubai represents are under 18. For those older than 18, the trip is a quest for identity and support. Kubai is also raising money — $4,600 so far — to conduct DNA testing to help find the children’s fathers. The identity crisis affects children born to white fathers. Kubai said he has yet to come across children of Black British fathers. 'They would not be easy to spot and not face discrimination,' he said. A British High Commission spokesperson in a statement to the AP said it and the British military training mission in Kenya 'cooperate fully with local child support authorities where there are claims relating to paternity.' Those authorities didn't respond to questions. But Kenyan mothers and civil society groups have long said British authorities have been little or no help. Jenerica Namoru, 29, has a 5-year-old after dating a British man with the training mission. The man’s name appears on the birth certificate as the father after he consented and shared his documentation for the process. Namoru said the man initially accepted the child and communicated with her but refused to send financial support. She sought help at the British Army Training Unit Kenya offices. She said they wouldn’t listen. 'At times, they even blocked me from entering the gate,' she said. She's now being represented by Kubai. Biracial children in the area around the British training site date back to the 1960s when Kenya was under British rule. Those born decades ago are also part of current efforts to seek justice and support. David Mwangi Macharia, 68, bears the nickname 'British' due to his light skin color. He said his mother had a relationship with a British soldier. He works as a night guard and part-time mason after dropping out of primary school due to being ridiculed and discriminated against. '(Kenyans) always think that I cannot do menial jobs despite the fact that I am not educated,' Macharia said. He has even found it difficult to get along with his darker-skinned siblings. Attempts to hold visiting British forces accountable have long gained little traction, Kenyans say. Marion Mutugi, a commissioner with the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights, said the relationships between British soldiers and local women range from consensual to transactional to forced. The commission says it has documented over 200 rape cases involving British troops between 1983 and 2003, and it continues to collect data. Britain's defense ministry dismissed the rape cases as 'not genuine,' and an investigation by the Royal Military Police in 2007 did not lead to compensation or justice for the victims, the KNCHR said in a report to Kenya's parliament protesting a past renewal of the countries' defense agreement. '(Authorities) also interfere with investigations by compromising the local community. The human rights defenders on the ground are threatened and intimidated by both the BATUK and the Kenyan forces and Kenyan officials to ensure that justice is not reached,' Mutugi said. 'Our take at the commission was that they wanted to put a Band-Aid on a wound instead of lacerating, dealing with it and operating on it,' the commissioner added. The British High Commission has said it was looking into the allegations. Kenyan authorities have never responded to the allegations. The most well-known case is that of Agnes Wanjiru, was killed in 2012 after an evening in the company of British soldiers. An inquest in 2019 concluded that Wanjiru was murdered by British soldiers but no suspect has been charged. A public hearing by the Kenyan parliament's defense committee, which started in May, has revived investigations. Kubai said he hopes to provide Kenyan children of British soldiers a much-needed sense of identity. 'What we are bringing in the UK court is not just the issue of rape, it is the issue of these children who happen to be prisoners of an identity they did not chose for themselves,' he said. ___ For more on Africa and development: https://apnews.com/hub/africa-pulse ___ The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

AP PHOTOS: A Japanese artist finds solace and global fans with intricate leaf-cutting	TOKYO (AP) — A frog holding a taro-leaf umbrella. A parade of frolicking animals. An Ukiyo-e style Mount Fuji. Giant waves. A Japanese artist who goes by the name Lito carves these delicate designs on fallen leaves, giving life back to them. The world of Lito’s delicate art, which he began in 2020 and posts on social media almost daily, has won fans from around the world. The leaf art has also given him solace after earlier struggles with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and a purpose in life — the joy of making people happy with his art. He enjoys working at night. From a pile of leaves treated with a wrinkle-free chemical, he picks one and places it on a cutting board. First, he outlines the design on the leaf with a pen in his right hand. Then he takes a design knife in his left hand and starts cutting the leaf carefully. Slowly, the leaf begins to take the shape of a frog carrying an umbrella — a simple design he demonstrated in a recent interview with The Associated Press. More complex, highly intensive work on a single leaf can take more than eight hours to complete. His leaf-cutting works include titles such as 'Scrolls of Frolicking Animals,' 'Leaf Aquarium,' and 'Thirty-six Views of Mt. Fuji: The Great Wave off Kanagawa.' Each piece includes his own twists, and often uses animals. 'I would rather finish it in one go when I am focused,' Lito, 38, said. He didn't want to disclose his real name for personal reasons. Since his childhood, Lito says he has had high levels of concentration and patience. But he had trouble fitting into what was considered the norm at school or at work, despite all his efforts. He struggled to interpret others' feelings and to avoid confrontations. After years of difficulty, he went to a hospital at age 30 and was told he has ADHD, a diagnosis that he felt explained why he has always done things differently. He saw no point in forcing himself to do things the same way as other people, and began to adjust his life. In early 2020, Lito came across the art of leaf cutting. He saw it as the perfect use of his patience and concentration. Word of his skills has spread across social media, and he has published books on his leaf-cutting work. He holds a near monthly solo exhibition in various places in Japan. 'If I can make people happy by doing what I am doing, I want to do more. That’s my driving force for what's next,' Lito says.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-leaf-art-ukiyoe-adhd-lito-1050a215cb11ffdf45ad19e1ec2ea02a	2024-11-30T19:49:27-08:00	
Japan's popular Princess Aiko turns 23 with her future as a royal in doubt	TOKYO (AP) — Japan’s popular Princess Aiko turned 23 on Sunday, as she takes on more official duties even while her future in the imperial family remains in doubt. Aiko, the only child of Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako, graduated from university earlier this year and has since been participating in official duties and palace rituals while working at the Red Cross Society, according to the Imperial Household Agency. But Japanese law requires her to renounce her royal status and leave the family if she marries outside the imperial family. The vast majority of Japan’s public supports changing the law to allow her to remain a royal and become emperor, but conservatives in the governing party insist on keeping male-only succession. Japan’s rapidly dwindling imperial family has only 16 members, including four men. Aiko was to mark her birthday with her parents at the imperial palace in Tokyo. The IHA also released several photos of Aiko, including one of her standing by a persimmon tree at a palace garden. Another showed her holding pieces of traditional hand-crafted washi paper that she made at a workshop during her first solo official trip in October to the National Sports Festival in Japan’s southwestern prefecture of Saga. The 1947 Imperial House Law, which largely preserves conservative prewar family values, allows only males to take the throne and forces female royals who marry outside the family to give up their status. With only one young male member, that puts the survival of the 2,000-year-old monarchy in jeopardy. The youngest male member of the imperial family, Prince Hisahito — Aiko's 18-year-old cousin — is currently the last heir apparent, posing a major problem for the system. The government is looking for a way to keep the succession stable without relying on women, such as allowing the family to adopt new male members from former noble families that lost their status after World War II. Aiko's own views on the topic are unknown. She's only had one full news conference, when she reached adulthood. Last month, the United Nations women’s rights committee in Geneva issued a report that called for the Japanese government to allow a female emperor, among other issues hindering gender equality in the country. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi dismissed the report 'regrettable' and 'inappropriate.' He said the imperial succession is a matter of fundamental national identity and that it is not covered by constitutional basic rights. Crown Prince Akishino, Aiko's uncle, was asked about the succession debate at a news conference marking his 59th birthday Saturday, and replied that members of the royal family are 'living humans' and that the palace officials who support their daily lives should know how it affects them. At her work at the Japanese Red Cross Society, Aiko is assigned to volunteer training program, the IHA said. On weekends, it said, the princess enjoys taking walks with her parents and playing volleyball, tennis and badminton with palace officials.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-princess-aiko-birthday-succession-emperor-5efd5d1f56ab436e30d44856bc713fdb	2024-11-30T19:36:19-08:00	
Senegal demands answers as the West African country commemorates a French colonial massacre	THIAROYE-SUR-MER, Senegal (AP) — Biram Senghor regularly goes to pay his respects at a military cemetery in Thiaroye, a fishing village near Senegal’s capital Dakar, bowing in front of a different grave each time. The 86-year-old has no way of knowing which grave belongs to his father, M’Bap Senghor, one of likely hundreds of West African riflemen who fought for France during World War II but were killed on Dec. 1, 1944 by the French army after demanding unpaid wages. In this cemetery where they are supposedly buried, all the graves are anonymous and the exact location of the remains is unknown, as is the number of victims. The true scale and circumstances of the killings remain unclear as Senegal commemorates the 80th anniversary of the massacre on Sunday, threatening to reignite smoldering tensions between France and the former colony. 'I have been fighting to get answers for over 80 years,' said Biram Senghor. '(French President Emmanuel) Macron cannot do what the other French presidents before him did; France has to repent.' The West Africans were members of the unit called 'Tirailleurs Sénégalais,' a corps of colonial infantry in the French Army that fought in both World Wars. According to historians, there were disputes over unpaid wages in the days before the massacre and on Dec. 1, French troops turned on the unarmed African soldiers and shot them dead. For decades, French authorities tried to minimize what had happened in Thiaroye. Reports by the French military shortly after the massacre determined that 35 West African soldiers were killed in response to a 'mutiny.' Other reports by the French army mention 70 deaths. But today, many French and Senegalese historians agree the true death toll is likely in the hundreds, with some speaking of almost 400 soldiers killed, based on estimates of the number of riflemen present at the camp on the day of the massacre. On Thursday, Macron officially recognized the events of Thiaroye as a massacre for the first time in a letter to Senegal’s President Diomaye Faye, which was seen by The Associated Press. 'France must recognize that on that day, the confrontation between soldiers and riflemen who demanded their full legitimate wages be paid, triggered a chain of events that resulted in a massacre,' read Macron’s letter. But many historians dispute the idea of a confrontation between the French soldiers and the riflemen. 'What happened on December 1st was the execution of unarmed soldiers,' said Martin Mourre, a French historian and author of Thiaroye 1944, History and Memory of a Colonial Massacre. He points to the fact that no weapons were mentioned during the trial of the African riflemen accused of mutiny and the absence of any injuries among the French soldiers as evidence that no confrontation took place. In his letter to the Senegalese president, Macron did not mention the number of soldiers killed. The controversies and unknowns about the massacre are in part due to a lack of transparency by French authorities regarding the military reports and testimonies. In 2014, French President Francois Hollande handed over the European nation’s archives on Thiaroye to Macky Sall, then-president of Senegal. But historians say that key documents, including ones indicating the site of the mass graves and the number of West African soldiers present at the camp on the day of the massacre, are still missing. It is unclear if France holds such archives or if they even exist. Macron’s office and the French foreign ministry did not respond to requests for comment. Additionally, very little was done by the Senegalese authorities under former president Sall to allow historians to delve into the historical documents. 'The archives remained inaccessible until this year, for obscure reasons,' says Mourre. Mamadou Diouf, a Senegalese historian who heads the commemoration committee for the Thiaroye massacre this year, says Sall did not show much interest in the subject in order to avoid diplomatic tensions with France. But Senegal’s President Bassirou Diomaye Faye, who was elected in March in part on a promise of redefining Senegal’s relationship with the former colonizer, has vowed to regain control of the historical narrative on Thiaroye. His administration has organized major commemorations of the massacre from Dec. 1 to April 2025 across the country. 'The authorities' goal behind the major commemorations is to make Thiaroye part of Senegal’s national story,' said Babacar Ndiaye, political analyst at the Wathi think tank, which focuses on political and economic issues in West Africa. 'It will be talked about a lot on television, in the press and most importantly on social media,' he adds. 'This will reach a younger audience who might know little about the events of Thiaroye.' The 80th anniversary of the massacre comes as France’s influence is declining in the region, with Paris losing its sway in its former West African colonies. French troops have been ousted in recent years from Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso after years of fighting Islamic extremists alongside regional troops. Earlier this week, Chad, one of the last countries in the region in which France had maintained a large military presence, ended a military cooperation agreement with Paris. France still has around 350 troops in Senegal, mainly in a supportive role. Asked about their continued presence, Faye suggested it is not be something the Senegalese would want. 'Historically, France enslaved, colonized and stayed here,' he said. 'Obviously, I think that when you reverse the roles a little, you will have a hard time conceiving that another army — of China, Russia, Senegal, or any other country — could have a military base in France.' ___ Associated Press writer Sylvie Corbet in Paris, France, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/senegal-france-thiaroye-colonial-massacre-tirailleurs-76db7190dcbc12349ff0d6ade82309b3	2024-11-30T19:24:03-08:00	
A landmark climate change case will open at the top UN court as island nations fear rising seas	THE HAGUE (AP) — The top United Nations court will take up the largest case in its history on Monday, when it opens two weeks of hearings into what countries worldwide are legally required to do to combat climate change and help vulnerable nations fight its devastating impact. After years of lobbying by island nations who fear they could simply disappear under rising sea waters, the U.N. General Assembly asked the International Court of Justice last year for an opinion on 'the obligations of States in respect of climate change.' 'We want the court to confirm that the conduct that has wrecked the climate is unlawful,' Margaretha Wewerinke-Singh, who is leading the legal team for the Pacific island nation of Vanuatu, told The Associated Press. In the decade up to 2023, sea levels have risen by a global average of around 4.3 centimeters (1.7 inches), with parts of the Pacific rising higher still. The world has also warmed 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times because of the burning of fossil fuels. Vanuatu is one of a group of small states pushing for international legal intervention in the climate crisis. 'We live on the front lines of climate change impact. We are witnesses to the destruction of our lands, our livelihoods, our culture and our human rights,' Vanuatu’s climate change envoy Ralph Regenvanu told reporters ahead of the hearing. Any decision by the court would be non-binding advice and unable to directly force wealthy nations into action to help struggling countries. Yet it would be more than just a powerful symbol since it could serve as the basis for other legal actions, including domestic lawsuits. On Sunday, ahead of the hearing, advocacy groups will bring together environmental organizations from around the world. Pacific Islands Students Fighting Climate Change — who first developed the idea of requesting an advisory opinion — together with World Youth for Climate Justice plan an afternoon of speeches, music and discussions. From Monday, the Hague-based court will hear from 99 countries and more than a dozen intergovernmental organizations over two weeks. It’s the largest lineup in the institution’s nearly 80-year history. Last month at the United Nations’ annual climate meeting, countries cobbled together an agreement on how rich countries can support poor countries in the face of climate disasters. Wealthy countries have agreed to pool together at least $300 billion a year by 2035 but the total is short of the $1.3 trillion that experts, and threatened nations, said is needed. 'For our generation and for the Pacific Islands, the climate crisis is an existential threat. It is a matter of survival, and the world’s biggest economies are not taking this crisis seriously. We need the ICJ to protect the rights of people at the front lines,' Vishal Prasad, of Pacific Islands Students Fighting Climate Change, told reporters in a briefing. Fifteen judges from around the world will seek to answer two questions: What are countries obliged to do under international law to protect the climate and environment from human-caused greenhouse gas emissions? And what are the legal consequences for governments where their acts, or lack of action, have significantly harmed the climate and environment? The second question makes particular reference to 'small island developing States' likely to be hardest hit by climate change and to 'members of 'the present and future generations affected by the adverse effects of climate change.' The judges were even briefed on the science behind rising global temperatures by the U.N.’s climate change body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, ahead of the hearings. The case at the ICJ follows a number of rulings around the world ordering governments to do more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In May, a U.N. tribunal on maritime law said that carbon emissions qualify as marine pollution and countries must take steps to adapt to and mitigate their adverse effects. That ruling came a month after Europe’s highest human rights court said that countries must better protect their people from the consequences of climate change, in a landmark judgment that could have implications across the continent. The ICJ’s host country of The Netherlands made history when a court ruled in 2015 that protection from the potentially devastating effects of climate change is a human right and that the government has a duty to protect its citizens. The judgment was upheld in 2019 by the Dutch Supreme Court.	https://apnews.com/article/un-court-climate-global-warming-island-nations-35d35cb3c8a49b980ce458d27cb24844	2024-11-30T19:10:00-08:00

Limit on plastic production still under debate as treaty talks come to a close	BUSAN, South Korea (AP) — Negotiations on a plastic pollution accord are drawing to a close Sunday, as nations continue debating whether to tackle the exponential growth of plastic production. A battle over whether to limit the amount of plastic that companies are allowed to produce is the most contentious. The latest draft of the treaty, released Sunday afternoon after negotiators spent all of Saturday trying to reach agreement behind closed doors, leaves the question to be settled in open session. It includes multiple options for several key sections. For the proposal to limit production, that includes a compromise that would set a target at a later conference and an option to drop the idea altogether. The draft's options also include possible language to ban some plastic products that are single use or contain toxic chemicals, as well as less stringent options. It would also require parties to the treaty to improve the design of plastic products, so they don't release microplastics and can be recycled. Countries could adopt these provisions or make changes when they meet later Sunday. Delegates from Senegal and Ghana said the new draft is too weak. At a press conference earlier in the day, Panama and Fiji said that if other nations won't join them in standing up for the ambition this treaty requires, they should 'get out' of their way. They were joined by representatives from Mexico, France, Rwanda and the European Union, who together said they would do everything possible in the final hours to push a treaty forward that will solve the crisis. 'We are already doing waste management efforts back home,' said Sivendra Michael, Fiji's secretary for the environment and climate change. 'This treaty has to be bigger than all of us. It’s about saving this planet. It’s about saving humanity. And so that’s why we are here, still having hope, pushing. And we will push right until the end, until the time we’re supposed to leave Busan.' Their meeting concludes Sunday or early Monday in Busan, South Korea. A growing number of countries said in Busan that they want to address the total amount of plastic produced on Earth. A senior member of the U.S. delegation told The Associated Press on Saturday that the country supports having an article in the treaty that limits the world's supply of plastic. But for some plastic-producing and oil and gas countries, that crosses a red line. They want a treaty that focuses on better management of plastic waste and recycling. Currently for any proposal to make it into the treaty, every nation must agree to it. India, Saudi Arabia and others have insisted it remain that way. Olga Givernet, France's minister delegate for energy, said she's worried about a small group of countries continuing to obstruct progress. 'It may be a minority, but still, still we have to be all together,' she said. Rwanda's lead negotiator, Juliet Kabera, said there is still time to find common ground, but her country will only accept a treaty that has the strength, ambition and accountability to solve the crisis. Ed Shepherd, representing the Business Coalition for a Global Plastics Treaty, attended the press conference in support. The coalition includes about 270 businesses and financial institutions. He said businesses want global rules, and it's 'clear we need to use less plastic.' Every year, the world produces more than 400 million tons of new plastic. Plastic production could climb about 70% by 2040 without policy changes. Canada called for 'bold, decisive action' Sunday morning. The statement was on behalf of the countries that have hosted negotiating meetings, which are the governments of Uruguay, France, Kenya, Canada and South Korea. 'The time for incremental progress is over,' it says. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Greek city of Thessaloniki gets new metro system with driverless trains after years of delays	THESSALONIKI, Greece (AP) — The metro system in the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki opened Saturday featuring driverless trains, and tens of thousands of people braved blustery, rainy weather to wait outside the stations to try them out. The single 13-station subway line was jammed with passengers eager to get a taste of the city’s new transport system. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, flanked by President Katerina Sadkellaropoulou and Transport Minister Christos Staikouras, pressed a blue button to begin the operation of a system that was a long time coming. Mitsotakis said the first appropriations for exploratory digging were part of the 1976 budget. In 1999, a banner on the entrance of the city’s international trade fair proclaimed that 'the metro is soon coming near you.' Years of court battles that saw contracts canceled, real estate disputes and a fight over the placement of a station near important archaeological discoveries, derailed the project. When the first carriages arrived in 2019 the previous government staged an 'inauguration' with the carriages sitting on cement stands. The delays pushed the cost of the project to over 3 billion euros, Staikouras said. Passengers entering the Eleftherios Venizelos station in the city center can take a look at some of the more than 300,000 artifacts dug up by archaeologists. Deep underground, remains of the city’s busiest street in the 6th century were found. This was a busy thoroughfare with many shops, archaeologists say. Many objected to, and loudly protested, the temporary removal of many of the findings in order to complete the tunneling and build the station. Antiquities are also displayed outside a nearby station, under protective glass. Officials said the operation of the line will mean 57,000 fewer cars per day in this traffic-choked city, with an expected 254,000 passengers using the system daily in the city of more than 300,000 and more than a million when including the suburbs. It's the second largest metropolitan area in Greece. An eastward extension of the line with five additional stations is scheduled to open in 2025. A westward extension is planned. But it will likely take several more years for the metro to reach the city’s busy Macedonia Airport. ___ Nellas reported from Athens, Greece	https://apnews.com/article/thessaloniki-metro-antiquities-delays-4c1fc3bb705f9b7bc118aa64e2bd758b	2024-11-30T12:04:43-08:00	
Regional Spanish leader who botched flood response faces another big march demanding his resignation	VALENCIA, Spain (AP) — Tens of thousands of Spaniards marched on Saturday in the streets of Valencia a month after devastating floods to demand the resignation of the regional officials who bungled the emergency response. The protest was the second major march of its kind asking for Valencia regional president Carlos Mazón to step down. He has refused to do so while making changes to his Cabinet and appointing a retired general to lead the cleanup effort. Many citizens and flood survivors are angry for what they consider the negligent or inept handling of the flash floods that created major flooding on Oct. 29-30. At least 230 people died, while thousands of homes and vehicles were destroyed or ruined. Mazón’s administration didn't issue flood alerts to people’s cellphones until flooding had already started in some areas. Saturday’s march culminated with people playing the shrill alert they received on their phones in unison. Authorities were then overwhelmed with the scope of the damage and took days to scale up rescue and recovery efforts. The cleanup of the layers of mud left by the rushing waters continues.	https://apnews.com/article/spain-floods-march-demand-resignation-valencia-leader-37355642412ca7d7b980eed91629b5c3	2024-11-30T11:59:31-08:00	
Trump wants pardoned real estate developer Charles Kushner to be ambassador to France	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump said Saturday that he wants real estate developer Charles Kushner, father of Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, to serve as ambassador to France. Trump made the announcement in a Truth Social post, calling Charles Kushner 'a tremendous business leader, philanthropist, &amp; dealmaker.' Kushner is the founder of Kushner Companies, a real estate firm. Jared Kushner is a former White House senior adviser to Trump who is married to Trump’s eldest daughter, Ivanka. The elder Kushner was pardoned by Trump in December 2020 after pleading guilty years earlier to tax evasion and making illegal campaign donations. Prosecutors alleged that after Charles Kushner discovered his brother-in-law was cooperating with federal authorities in an investigation, he hatched a scheme for revenge and intimidation. Kushner hired a prostitute to lure his brother-in-law, then arranged to have the encounter in a New Jersey motel room recorded with a hidden camera and the recording sent to his own sister, the man’s wife, prosecutors said. Kushner eventually pleaded guilty to 18 counts including tax evasion and witness tampering. He was sentenced in 2005 to two years in prison — the most he could receive under a plea deal, but less than what Chris Christie, the U.S. attorney for New Jersey at the time and later governor and Republican presidential candidate, had sought. Christie has blamed Jared Kushner for his firing from Trump’s transition team in 2016, and has called Charles Kushner’s offenses 'one of the most loathsome, disgusting crimes that I prosecuted when I was U.S. attorney.' Trump and the elder Kushner knew each other from real estate circles and their children were married in 2009. ___ Tucker reported from Newtown, Pennsylvania.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-france-ambassador-charles-kushner-pardon-c3835be92b1fbd1dffcd05707cba9f52	2024-11-30T10:42:54-08:00	
Trump threatens 100% tariff on the BRIC bloc of nations if they act to undermine US dollar	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday threatened 100% tariffs against a bloc of nine nations if they act to undermine the U.S. dollar. His threat was directed at countries in the so-called BRIC alliance, which consists of Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates. Turkey, Azerbaijan and Malaysia have applied to become members and several other countries have expressed interest in joining. While the U.S. dollar is by far the most-used currency in global business and has survived past challenges to its preeminence, members of the alliance and other developing nations say they are fed up with America’s dominance of the global financial system. The dollar represents roughly 58% of the world’s foreign exchange reserves, according to the IMF and major commodities like oil are still primarily bought and sold using dollars. The dollar's dominance is threatened, however, with BRICS' growing share of GDP and the alliance's intent to trade in non-dollar currencies — a process known as de-dollarization. Trump, in a Truth Social post, said: 'We require a commitment from these Countries that they will neither create a new BRICS Currency, nor back any other Currency to replace the mighty U.S. Dollar or, they will face 100% Tariffs, and should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful U.S. Economy.' At a summit of BRIC nations in October, Russian President Vladimir Putin accused the U.S. of 'weaponizing' the dollar and described it as a 'big mistake.' 'It’s not us who refuse to use the dollar,' Putin said at the time. 'But if they don’t let us work, what can we do? We are forced to search for alternatives.' Russia has specifically pushed for the creation of a new payment system that would offer an alternative to the global bank messaging network, SWIFT, and allow Moscow to dodge Western sanctions and trade with partners. Trump said there is 'no chance' BRIC will replace the U.S. dollar in global trade and any country that tries to make that happen 'should wave goodbye to America.' Research shows that the U.S. dollar's role as the primary global reserve currency is not threatened in the near future. An Atlantic Council model that assesses the dollar’s place as the primary global reserve currency states the dollar is 'secure in the near and medium term' and continues to dominate other currencies. Trump's latest tariff threat comes after he threatened to slap 25% tariffs on everything imported from Mexico and Canada, and an additional 10% tax on goods from China, as a way to force the countries to do more to halt the flow of illegal immigration and drugs into the U.S. He has since held a call with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who said Thursday she is confident that a tariff war with the United States can be averted. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau returned home Saturday after meeting Trump, without assurances the president-elect will back away from threatened tariffs on Canada.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-dollar-dominance-brics-treasury-8572985f41754fe008b98f38180945c3	2024-11-30T10:08:33-08:00	
East African summit urges peace in eastern Congo but its leader skips talks	ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) — East African heads of state made another push for peace in eastern Congo on Saturday but its prospects remained bleak following a regional summit that was marked by the Congolese president's absence and an early departure of his Rwandan counterpart. A communique read at the end of the closed-door meeting of the East African Community in Arusha, Tanzania, only stated the need to combine regional and broader peace initiatives for sustainable peace in eastern Congo. Violence has reemerged in one of the world's most protracted conflicts in eastern Congo, where Congo’s government accused the Rwanda-backed M23 rebel group of 'ethnic cleansing' in mineral-rich areas close to Rwanda's border. Rwandan President Paul Kagame left shortly after the closed-door meeting in Arusha. There was no official explanation for Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi's absence at the summit. Congo alleges that Rwanda has been involved in war crimes in the east, and U.S. and U.N. experts accuse it of giving military backing to M23. Rwanda denies the claim, but in February admitted that it has troops and missile systems in eastern Congo to safeguard its security, pointing to a buildup of Congolese forces near the border. U.N. experts estimate there are up to 4,000 Rwandan forces in Congo. A July truce brokered by the United States and Angola has reduced the fighting between Rwandan and Congolese forces, but fighting between M23 and other militias continues. Other leaders at the summit were Presidents Salva Kiir of South Sudan, Samia Suluhu Hassan of Tanzania, William Ruto of Kenya, Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and Hassan Sheikh Mohamud of Somalia. Burundi was represented by its vice president. Ruto was elected as the new chairperson of the EAC Summit, succeeding Kiir. 'Our focus must be on increasing competitiveness, promoting value-added production and boosting intra-regional trade to create jobs and transform our economies,' Ruto said. He also urged member states to remain committed to the timely disbursement of statutory contributions to sustain the bloc’s operations.	https://apnews.com/article/tanzania-eac-congo-summit-rwanda-b7224598fceee271424b154361a4367a	2024-11-30T08:07:40-08:00

Zelenskyy says NATO offer for Ukraine-controlled territory could end 'hot stage' of war	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — An offer of NATO membership to territory under Kyiv’s control would end 'the hot stage of the war' in Ukraine, but any proposal to join the military alliance should be extended to all parts of the country that fall under internationally recognized borders, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a broadcast interview. Zelenskyy’s remarks on Friday signaled a possible way forward to the difficult path Ukraine faces to future NATO membership. At their summit in Washington in July, the 32 members declared Ukraine on an 'irreversible' path to membership. However, one obstacle to moving forward has been the view that Ukraine’s borders would need to be clearly demarcated before it could join so that there can be no mistaking where the alliance’s pact of mutual defense would come into effect. 'You can’t give an invitation to just one part of a country,' Zelenskyy said in an excerpt of the interview with Sky News. 'Why? Because thus you would recognize that Ukraine is only that territory of Ukraine and the other one is Russia.' Under the Ukrainian Constitution, Ukraine can't recognize territory occupied by Russia as Russian. 'So legally, by law, we have no right to recognize the occupied territory as territory of Russia,' he said. Since the start of the war in 2022, Russia has been expending huge amounts of weaponry and human life to make small-but-steady territorial gains to the nearly one-fifth of Ukraine it already controls in east and southern Ukraine. 'If we want to stop the hot stage of the war, we should take under the NATO umbrella the territory of Ukraine that we have under our control. That’s what we need to do, fast. And then Ukraine can get back the other part of its territory diplomatically,' he said. An invitation for Ukraine to join NATO is one key point of Zelenskyy’s 'victory plan,' which he presented to Western allies and the Ukrainian people in October. The plan is seen as a way for Ukraine to strengthen its hand in any negotiations with Moscow. Earlier this week, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said that the alliance 'needs to go further' to support Ukraine in its fight against Russia's invasion. Military aid to Kyiv and steps toward ending the war are expected to be high on the agenda when NATO members' foreign ministers meet in Brussels for a two-day gathering starting on Dec. 3. However, any decision for Ukraine to join the military alliance would require a lengthier process and the agreement of all member states. There is also uncertainty as to the foreign policy stance of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. While Trump vowed on the campaign trail to end Russia's invasion of Ukraine in a single day, he hasn't publicly discussed how this could happen. Trump also announced Wednesday that Keith Kellogg, an 80-year-old, highly decorated retired three-star general, would serve as his special envoy for Ukraine and Russia. In April, Kellog wrote that 'bringing the Russia-Ukraine war to a close will require strong, America First leadership to deliver a peace deal and immediately end the hostilities between the two warring parties.' Meanwhile, during his only campaign debate with U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump twice refused to directly answer a question about whether he wanted Ukraine to win the war — raising concerns that Kyiv could be forced to accept unfavorable terms in any negotiations. Zelenskyy’s statement comes as Ukraine faces increasing pressure along the 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line. In its latest report, Washington-based think tank the Institute for the Study of War said Saturday that Russian forces had recently advanced near Kupiansk, in Toretsk, and near Pokrovsk and Velyka Novosilka, a key logistics route for the Ukrainian military. At least four people were killed Saturday when a Russian missile hit Ukraine's Dnipropetrovsk region, Zelenskyy said in a post on Telegram. Dnipropetrovsk Gov. Serhiy Lysak said that the strike also wounded at least 21 people, of which eight were in a serious condition. Ukraine’s air force announced Saturday that the country had come under attack from 10 Russian drones, of which eight were shot down over the Kyiv, Cherkasy, Kirovohrad, Dnipropetrovsk and Kherson regions. One drone returned to Russian-occupied territory, while the final drone disappeared from radar, often a sign of the use of electronic defenses. Meanwhile, the Russian Defense Ministry said that 11 Ukrainian drones had been shot down by the country’s air defense systems. Both the mayor of Sochi, Andrey Proshunin, and the head of Russia’s Dagestan region, Sergey Melikov, both in Russia’s southwest, said that drones had been destroyed in their regions overnight. No casualties were reported. On Friday, the Ukrainian president announced a number of changes to military leadership, saying that changes in personnel management were needed to improve the situation on the battlefield. Gen. Mykhailo Drapatyi, who led the defense of Kharkiv during Russia’s new offensive on Ukraine’s second-largest city this year, was appointed the new head of Ukraine’s Ground Forces. Oleh Apostol was named as the new deputy commander-in-chief responsible for improving military training. Ukraine's top military commander, Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi, also announced Friday that he would bolster units in Donetsk, Pokrovsk and Kurakhove with additional reserves, ammunition, weapons and military equipment. ___ Katie Marie Davies contributed to this report from Manchester, England. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-zelenskyy-nato-92069fae6a05fc03d6fb2643ecbb4b2a	2024-11-30T02:50:15-08:00	
Israel says it struck Hezbollah weapons smuggling sites in Syria, testing a fragile ceasefire	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli aircraft struck Hezbollah weapons smuggling sites along Syria's border with Lebanon, the Israeli military said Saturday, testing a fragile, days-old ceasefire that halted months of fighting between the sides but has seen continued sporadic fire. The military said it struck sites that had been used to smuggle weapons from Syria to Lebanon after the ceasefire took effect, which the military said was a violation of its terms. There was no immediate comment from Syrian authorities or activists monitoring the conflict in that country. Hezbollah also did not immediately comment. Israeli aircraft have struck Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, citing ceasefire violations, several times since the truce began on Wednesday. The ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah does not address the war in Gaza, where fighting rages on. On Saturday, an Israeli strike on a car killed five people, according to Muneer Alboursh, a senior Palestinian health official, who said the toll included three employees of the food charity World Central Kitchen. The charity could not immediately be reached for comment and made no mention of the incident on its social media. The Israeli military said it struck a vehicle carrying a militant involved in Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack. It said it was looking into the reported ties to WCK, but said the car was unmarked and had not coordinated aid delivery with the military as charities have done during the war. At Nasser Hospital in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, a woman held up an employee badge bearing the WCK logo, the word 'contractor' and the name of one of the men said to have been killed in the strike. A heap of belongings — burned phones, a watch and stickers with the WCK logo — lay splayed on the hospital floor. An Israeli strike in April on a WCK convoy killed seven of its workers, most of them foreigners. The Israeli military said it was a mistake. The Israeli strike in Syria came as insurgents there breached the country's largest city, Aleppo, in a shock offensive that added fresh uncertainty to a region reeling from multiple wars. The truce between Israel and the Iran-backed Hezbollah, brokered by the United States and France, calls for an initial two-month ceasefire in which the militants are to withdraw north of Lebanon's Litani River and Israeli forces are to return to their side of the border. The repeated bursts of violence — with no reports of serious casualties — reflected the uneasy nature of the ceasefire that otherwise appeared to hold. While Israel has accused Hezbollah of violating the ceasefire, Lebanon has also accused Israel of the same in the days since it took effect. Many Lebanese, some of the 1.2 million displaced in the conflict, were streaming south to their homes, despite warnings by the Israeli and Lebanese militaries to stay away from certain areas. Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency reported that an Israeli drone attacked a car in the southern village of Majdal Zoun. Lebanon’s Health Ministry said three people were wounded, including a 7-year-old child. Majdal Zoun, near the Mediterranean Sea, is close to where Israeli troops still have a presence. The military said earlier Saturday that its forces, who remain in southern Lebanon until they withdraw gradually over the 60-day period, had been operating to distance 'suspects' in the region, without elaborating, and said troops had located and seized weapons found hidden in a mosque. Israel says it reserves the right under the ceasefire to strike against any perceived violations. Israel has made returning the tens of thousands of displaced Israelis home the goal of the war with Hezbollah but Israelis, concerned Hezbollah was not deterred and could still attack northern communities, have been apprehensive about returning home. Hezbollah began attacking Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, in solidarity with the Palestinian militant group Hamas and its assault on southern Israel the day before. Israel and Hezbollah kept up a low-level conflict of cross-border fire for nearly a year, until Israel escalated its fight with a sophisticated attack that detonated hundreds of pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah fighters. It followed that up with an intense aerial bombardment campaign against Hezbollah assets, killing many of its top leaders including longtime chief Hassan Nasrallah, and it launched a ground invasion in early October. More than 3,760 people have been killed by Israeli fire in Lebanon during the conflict, many of them civilians, according to Lebanese health officials. The fighting killed more than 70 people in Israel — over half of them civilians — as well as dozens of Israeli soldiers fighting in southern Lebanon. The war in Gaza was triggered by Hamas' October 2023 attack, when militants killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians and took some 250 hostage. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed more than 44,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants in their count but say more than half the dead were women and children. ___ Mroue reported from Beirut and Shurafa from Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-lebanon-hezbollah-iran-news-11-30-2024-506c8f976ad62afcf2a0ec977a8b6451	2024-11-30T01:33:01-08:00	
Counting begins in Ireland's election as 3 parties battle for top place	DUBLIN (AP) — Vote counting was underway Saturday in Ireland’s national election after an exit poll suggested the contest is a close-fought race among the country’s three largest political parties. Ballot boxes were opened at 9 a.m. at count centers across the country, kicking off long hours, or even days, of tallying the results. If the exit poll is borne out, that could be followed by days or weeks of negotiations to form a coalition government. The exit poll suggested voters’ support is split widely among the three big parties — Fine Gael, Fianna Fail and Sinn Fein — as well as several smaller parties and an assortment of independents ranging from the left to the far right. The poll said center-right party Fine Gael was the first choice of 21% of voters, and another center-right party, Fianna Fail, of 19.5%. The two parties governed in coalition before the election. Left-of-center opposition party Sinn Fein was at 21.1% in the poll. Pollster Ipsos B&amp;A asked 5,018 voters across the country how they had cast their ballots. The survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 1.4 percentage points. The figures only give an indication and don’t reveal which parties will form the next government. Ireland uses a complex system of proportional representation in which each of the country’s 43 constituencies elects several lawmakers and voters rank candidates in order of preference. As a result, it can take some time for full results to be known. Fianna Fail politician Michael McGrath, a former finance minister and now a European Union official, said 'a number of different parties and groups will have to be involved' in forming a government. 'I hope it is a stable government that has the prospect of lasting the five years because of the challenges we are facing in Ireland and throughout the European Union,' he told the PA news agency at a count in Cork, southwest Ireland. 'Let’s allow the picture to emerge over the days ahead.' The result will show whether Ireland bucks the global trend of incumbents being ousted by disgruntled voters after years of pandemic, international instability and cost-of-living pressures. The cost of living — especially Ireland’s acute housing crisis — was a dominant topic in the three-week campaign, alongside immigration, which has become an emotive and challenging issue in a country of 5.4 million people long defined by emigration. The outgoing government was led by the two parties that have dominated Irish politics for the past century: Fine Gael and Fianna Fail. They have similar policies but are longtime rivals with origins on opposing sides of Ireland’s 1920s civil war. After the 2020 election ended in a virtual dead heat, they formed a coalition. Before polling day, analysts said the most likely outcome was another Fine Gael-Fianna Fail coalition. That remains a likely option, but the parties would need the support of smaller groups or independents to achieve a majority in the 174-seat Dail, the lower house of Parliament. Sinn Fein achieved a stunning breakthrough in the 2020 election, topping the popular vote, but was shut out of government because Fianna Fail and Fine Gael refused to work with it, citing its leftist policies and historic ties with militant group the Irish Republican Army during three decades of violence in Northern Ireland. Though Sinn Fein, which aims to reunite Northern Ireland with the independent Republic of Ireland, could become the largest party in the Dail, it may struggle to get enough coalition partners to form a government. During the election campaign, both Fine Gael and Fianna Fail maintained they would not go into government with it. The party, which had urged people to vote for change, hailed the result after the exit poll was released. 'There is every chance that Sinn Fein will emerge from these elections as the largest political party,' Sinn Fein director of elections Matt Carthy told broadcaster RTE on Friday night. ___ Lawless reported from London.	https://apnews.com/article/ireland-election-vote-count-results-4e717dd614c3529783767e952d1ab967	2024-11-30T00:53:38-08:00	
Vietnam approves $67 billion high-speed railway project between Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh city	HANOI, Vietnam (AP) — Vietnam on Saturday approved the construction of a high-speed railway connecting the capital Hanoi in the north to Ho Chi Minh city in the south at an estimated cost of $67 billion. The ambitious railway line will stretch 1,541 kilometers (957 miles) between the Vietnamese capital and the financial capital in the south. The new train is expected to travel at speeds of up to 350 kph (217 mph), reducing the journey from the current 30 hours to just five hours. The decision was taken by Vietnam's National Assembly, its parliament. Construction is expected to begin in 2027 and Vietnam hopes that the first trains will start operating by 2035. But the country has been beleaguered by delays to its previous infrastructure projects. The train will pass through 20 provinces and cities, with 23 passenger stations and five freight stations along the way. It will transport both people and goods and will also service defense purposes, state media said. Deputy Minister of Transport Nguyen Danh Huy said that the project was a response to growing transport needs, and that several studies had underscored the need for faster options on the north-south corridor, state media said. 'This project is pivotal for restructuring transport shares and serves as a cornerstone for Vietnam’s leap into a new era of growth,' he said. State media said that Vietnam will prioritize domestic funding for the project but may consider foreign loans if they are affordable and not restrictive.	https://apnews.com/article/vietnam-high-speed-train-102fcade1e996d34cb46133e21502649	2024-11-30T00:48:31-08:00	
8 arrested after blast disrupts Kosovo water and power supplies	PRISTINA, Kosovo (AP) — A powerful explosion damaged a water canal and temporarily cut water and power supplies to Kosovo’s cities, the prime minister said Saturday, blaming groups supported by Serbia. At least eight people were arrested. Prime Minister Albin Kurti said the blast on Friday in Vrage, 60 kilometers (37 miles) north of capital Pristina, disrupted the supply of water to some cities and major power plants. It followed two other explosions in previous days on buildings of a police station and local authorities in the same area in the north of the country, mostly populated by the ethnic Serb minority. About 15 to 20 kilograms (30 to 45 pounds) of explosives were used to damage the critical infrastructure, according to Kosovo police chief Gazmend Hoxha. Kurti blamed 'official Belgrade and its criminal structures led by Milan Radoičić, supported by Serb institutions and Serbia President Aleksandar Vučić.' Radoičić, a politician and wealthy businessman with ties to Serbia’s ruling populist party and Vučić, was among 45 people charged in Kosovo in connection with a gunfight last year in which a Kosovar police officer was killed following an incursion by heavily armed Serb gunmen. Only three Serbs have been arrested and the others are at large, including Radoičić, who Pristina says is protected by Belgrade. Kosovo police have detained eight people suspected of being part of the attack, according to Interior Minister Xhelal Svecla. A big cache of weaponry, ammunition, military and police uniforms, cash and other items were confiscated at 10 locations in the north. Serbia Foreign Minister Marko Đurić condemned Friday's explosion but also criticized Kurti’s 'ethnonationalist regime' rushing 'to point fingers at Belgrade without evidence.' 'We believe that such premature accusations are a deliberate diversion,' Đurić said. 'These baseless allegations undermine efforts for constructive dialogue and serve only to escalate tensions in an already delicate situation.' The European Union and the United States strongly denounced the explosion and demanded that the perpetrators are brought to justice. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell spoke on the phone with Kurti to condemn the 'despicable act of sabotage on Kosovo’s critical civilian infrastructure' and he called 'on all stakeholders to cooperate fully with the Kosovo authorities.' The U.S. Embassy in Pristina said that 'these violent actions have no place in a democratic society, and those responsible for these criminal attacks against the legitimate authorities of the Republic of Kosovo should be held accountable.' Kosovo President Vjosa Osmani, who canceled a trip to Brunei because of the incidents, met with diplomatic representatives of Western powers and the EU to express her concern that such 'attacks aim not only at destabilizing Kosovo but also represent a serious threat to the stability of the whole region.' Kosovo-Serbia relations remain tense despite efforts by the international community to normalize them. Kosovo was a Serbian province until NATO’s 78-day bombing campaign in 1999 ended a war between Serbian government forces and ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo, which left about 13,000 dead, mainly ethnic Albanians, and pushed Serbian forces out. Kosovo proclaimed independence in 2008 which is not recognized by Belgrade. Brussels and Washington are urging both sides to implement agreements that Vučić and Kurti reached in February and March last year. They include a commitment by Kosovo to establish an Association of the Serb-Majority Municipalities. Serbia is also expected to deliver on the de facto recognition of Kosovo, which Belgrade still considers its province. The NATO-led international peacekeepers known as KFOR have increased their presence in Kosovo after last year’s tensions. KFOR has been providing security to the water pipe and to the surrounding areas since Friday night, according to a statement. ___ Llazar Semini reported from Tirana, Albania.

Taiwan's president departs for Pacific visit with a two-day stop in the US. China isn't happy	TAOYUAN, Taiwan (AP) — Taiwan's president departed Saturday for his trip to the South Pacific that will include a two-day transit in the U.S., his first since assuming office, though few details about his itinerary were made public. The planned stopovers in Hawaii and the territory of Guam have already drawn fierce criticism from Bejing, which claims Taiwan as its own territory and objects to official exchanges between it and the U.S., the island's biggest backer and military provider. Lai Ching-te will go on a weeklong trip to visit the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu and Palau — three diplomatic allies of the self-governed island in the Pacific. 'I want to use the values of democracy, peace, and prosperity to continue to expand our cooperation with our allies, to deepen our partnership and let the world see Taiwan not just as a model of democracy, but a vital power in promoting the world's peace and stability, and prosperous development,' he said at the Taoyuan International Airport, ahead of his departure. Though Taiwan retains strong contacts with dozens of other nations, it has only 12 formal diplomatic allies. The self-ruled democracy has recently been facing increasing pressure from China. It is unclear whether Lai will meet with any members of the incoming U.S. administration during his transit. President-elect Donald Trump said in an interview with Bloomberg in July that Taiwan should pay for its defense. The island has purchased billions of dollars of defense weaponry from the U.S. He also evaded answering whether he would defend the island from Chinese military action. While the U.S. is obligated to help the island defend itself under the Taiwan Relations Act, it has maintained a position of strategic ambiguity over whether it would ever get involved if Taiwan were to be invaded by China. A second Trump administration is expected to test U.S.-China relations even more than the Republican’s first term, when the U.S. imposed tariffs on more than $360 billion in Chinese products. Taiwan is one of the main sources of tension in the bilateral relationship. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said on Friday if the U.S. wanted to maintain peace in the Taiwan Strait, it is important for it to handle the Taiwan issue 'with utmost caution, clearly opposing Taiwan independence and supporting China’s peaceful reunification.' She also said China firmly opposes any form of official interaction between the U.S. and Taiwan, including visits by Taiwan’s leaders to the U.S. for any reason. When former Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen went to the U.S. last year as part of a transit to Latin America, it drew vocal opposition from China. Tsai met with the former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy at the time. The Chinese military also launched drills around Taiwan last year as a 'stern warning' over what it called collusion between 'separatists and foreign forces' days after Lai, then Taiwan’s vice president, stopped over in the U.S. China also strongly objects to leading American politicians visiting the island as it views any official contact with foreign governments and Taiwan as an infringement on its claims of sovereignty over Taiwan.

More than 100 arrested as Georgian police clash with protesters over suspension of EU talks	TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — More than 100 demonstrators were arrested overnight in Georgia as protesters clashed with police following the government’s decision to suspend negotiations to join the European Union, the country’s Interior Ministry said Saturday. It was the second straight night of protests after Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze of the country’s ruling Georgian Dream party announced the decision the previous day. Demonstrators faced off against police late Friday in a number of major Georgian cities, including the capital, Tbilisi, and the Black Sea port of Batumi. The Associated Press saw protesters in Tbilisi being chased and beaten by police as demonstrators rallied in front of the country's parliament building. Riot police used water cannons to push protesters away from the building and later moved to force them farther back along Rustaveli Avenue, the city’s main boulevard. Police also used heavy force against members of the media and used loudspeakers to shout profanities and insults at the crowds. Georgian Dream’s disputed victory in the country’s Oct. 26 parliamentary election, which was widely seen as a referendum on Georgia’s aspirations to join the European Union, has sparked massive demonstrations and led to an opposition boycott of the parliament. The opposition has said that the vote was rigged with the help of Russia, Georgia’s former imperial master, with Moscow hoping to keep Tbilisi in its orbit. Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili joined protesters on Thursday after accusing the government of declaring war on its own people. In an address to the nation Friday, she urged police not to use force against protesters. 'This is evident in every way — no one is willing to accept a Russified Georgia, a Georgia deprived of its constitution, or a Georgia in the hands of an illegitimate government and parliament,' Zourabichvili said. 'That is why so many of you are out here today: I see you. I see you on Rustaveli Avenue and in cities across Georgia: Batumi, Kutaisi, Zugdidi, Akhmeta, Lagodekhi, Telavi. It is unprecedented for citizens of Georgia to rise up simultaneously and spontaneously in this way.' Kobakhidze, the prime minister, characterized the protests Saturday as 'violent demonstrations.' He said that unspecified 'foreign entities' wished to see the 'Ukrainization' of Georgia with a 'Maidan-style scenario' – a reference to Ukraine’s 2014 Maidan revolution. Kobakhidze also said that Georgia remained committed to European integration. 'Once again, we pledge to the Georgian public, which expressed solid trust in us during the Oct. 26 elections, that no one will shake the peace and stability of Georgia,' he said. 'Despite artificial barriers, Georgia will persistently continue its progress toward European integration.' The government’s announcement that it was suspending negotiations to join the EU came hours after the European Parliament adopted a resolution that condemned last month’s vote as neither free nor fair. It said the election represented another manifestation of Georgia’s continued democratic backsliding 'for which the ruling Georgian Dream party is fully responsible.' European election observers said October’s vote took place in a divisive atmosphere marked by instances of bribery, double voting and physical violence. The EU granted Georgia candidate status in December 2023 on condition that it meet the bloc’s recommendations, but put its accession on hold and cut financial support earlier this year after the passage of a 'foreign influence' law widely seen as a blow to democratic freedoms. EU lawmakers urged a rerun of the parliamentary vote within a year under thorough international supervision and by an independent election administration. They also called on the EU to impose sanctions and limit formal contacts with the Georgian government. The Georgian prime minister fired back, denouncing what he described as a 'cascade of insults' from the EU politicians and declaring that 'the ill-wishers of our country have turned the European Parliament into a blunt weapon of blackmail against Georgia, which is a great disgrace for the European Union.' Kobakhidze also said Georgia would reject any budgetary grants from the EU until the end of 2028. Critics have accused Georgian Dream — established by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia — of becoming increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow. The party recently pushed through laws similar to those used by the Kremlin to crack down on freedom of speech and LGBTQ+ rights.	https://apnews.com/article/georgia-cabinet-election-russia-european-union-kobakhidze-89aaec17654432e35a11b5226ca2d3bb	2024-11-30T00:33:20-08:00	
Syrian insurgents are inside Aleppo in a major setback for Assad as government forces regroup	BEIRUT (AP) — Thousands of Syrian insurgents fanned out inside Aleppo in vehicles with improvised armor and pickups, deploying to landmarks such as the old citadel on Saturday, a day after they entered Syria's largest city facing little resistance from government troops, according to residents and fighters. Witnesses said two airstrikes on the city's edge late Friday targeted insurgent reinforcements and hit near residential areas. A war monitor said 20 fighters were killed. Syria's armed forces said in a statement Saturday that to absorb the large attack on Aleppo and save lives, it has redeployed and is preparing for a counterattack. The statement acknowledged that insurgents entered large parts of the city but said they have not established bases or checkpoints. Insurgents were filmed outside police headquarters, in the city center, and outside the Aleppo Citadel. They tore down posters of Syrian President Bashar Assad, stepping on some and burning others. The surprise takeover is a huge embarrassment for Assad, who managed to regain total control of the city in 2016, after expelling insurgents and thousands of civilians from its eastern neighborhoods following a grueling military campaign in which his forces were backed by Russia, Iran and its allied groups. Aleppo has not been attacked by opposition forces since then. The 2016 battle for Aleppo was a turning point in the war between Syrian government forces and rebel fighters after 2011 protests against Assad’s rule turned into an all-out war. The push into Aleppo followed weeks of simmering low-level violence, including government attacks on opposition-held areas. Turkey, which has backed Syrian opposition groups, failed in its diplomatic efforts to prevent the Syrian government attacks, which were seen as a violation of a 2019 agreement sponsored by Russia, Turkey and Iran to freeze the line of the conflict. The offensive came as Iran-linked groups, primarily Lebanon’s Hezbollah, which has backed Syrian government forces since 2015, have been preoccupied with their own battles at home. A ceasefire in Hezbollah’s two-month war with Israel took effect Wednesday, the day the Syrian opposition factions announced their offensive. Israel has also escalated its attacks against Hezbollah and Iran-linked targets in Syria during the last 70 days. Insurgents raise flag over Aleppo Citadel A witness in Aleppo said government troops remained in the city's airport and at a military academy but most of the forces have already filed out of the city from the south. Syrian Kurdish forces remained in two neighborhoods. The redeployment 'is a temporary measure and (the military central command and armed forces) will work to guarantee the security and peace of all our people in Aleppo,' the military statement said. Speaking from the heart of the city in Saadallah Aljabri square, opposition fighter Mohammad Al Abdo, said it was his first time back in Aleppo in 13 years, when his older brother was killed at the start of the war. 'God willing, the rest of Aleppo province will be liberated' from government forces, he said. There was light traffic in the city center on Saturday. Opposition fighters fired in the air in celebration but there was no sign of clashes or government troops presence. Abdulkafi Alhamdo, an teacher who fled Aleppo in 2016 and returned Friday night after hearing the insurgents were inside, described 'mixed feelings of pain, sadness and old memories.' 'As I entered Aleppo, I kept telling myself this is impossible! How did this happen?' He said he strolled through the city at night, visiting the citadel, where the insurgents raised their flags, a major square and the university of Aleppo, as well as the last spot he was in before he was forced to leave for the countryside. 'I walked in (the empty) streets of Aleppo, shouting, ‘People, people of Aleppo. We are your sons,’' Alhamdo told The Associated Press in a series of messages. The insurgents launched their shock offensive in the Aleppo and Idlib countryside on Wednesday and wrestled control of dozens of villages and towns before entering Aleppo on Friday. The pro-government Al-Watan newspaper reported airstrikes on the edge of Aleppo city targeting rebel supply lines. It posted a video of a missile landing on a gathering of fighters and vehicles, in a street lined with trees and buildings. City hospitals are full Twenty fighters were killed in the airstrikes, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Aleppo residents reported clashes and gunfire. Some fled the fighting. Schools and government offices were closed Saturday as most people stayed indoors, according to Sham FM radio, a pro-government station. Bakeries were open. Witnesses said the insurgents deployed security forces around the city to prevent any acts of violence or looting. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said the city's airport has been shut and all flights suspended. On Friday, Aleppo's two key public hospitals were reportedly full of patients while many private facilities closed, OCHA said. In social media posts, the insurgents were pictured outside of Aleppo Citadel, the medieval palace in the old city center, and one of the largest in the world. In cellphone videos, they recorded themselves having conversations with residents they visited at home, seeking to reassure them they will cause no harm. The Syrian Kurdish-led administration in the country's east said nearly 3,000 people, most of them students, had arrived in their areas after fleeing the fighting in Aleppo, which has a sizeable Kurdish population. State media reported that a number of 'terrorists,' including sleeper cells, infiltrated parts of the city. Government troops chased them and arrested a number who posed for pictures near city landmarks, state media said. On a state TV morning show Saturday, commentators said army reinforcements and Russia’s assistance will repel the 'terrorist groups,' blaming Turkey for supporting the insurgents’ push into Aleppo and Idlib provinces. Russia’s state news agency Tass quoted Oleg Ignasyuk, a Russian Defense Ministry official coordinating in Syria, as saying that Russian warplanes targeted and killed 200 militants who launched the offensive in the northwest on Friday. It provided no further details. —— Associated Press writer Albert Aji in Damascus contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-insurgents-aleppo-iran-russia-turkey-abff93e4f415ebfd827d49b1a90818e8	2024-11-30T00:19:39-08:00	
In Bolivia's scrappy highlands, proud Indigenous Cholas take the runway by storm	VIACHA, Bolivia (AP) — In the huddled markets, sprawling farms and pulsing parties of Viacha, a town southeast of Bolivia’s capital, it's typical for women to sport bowler hats, tiered skirts and fringed shawls. What's less typical is for the fashion spotlight to turn to these outfits — worn by 'Cholas,' Indigenous women from the highland Altiplano. But late Friday in Viacha, some 22 kilometers (13 miles) from Bolivia's capital of La Paz — over 12,000 feet (3,650 meters) above sea level — awe-struck teenage boys and proud mothers throbbed the main square as the town’s dirt roadway was briefly transformed into a runway. One by one, the girls from Viacha — mostly students between 15-25 years old — strutted down the catwalk to a surprising soundtrack of early 2000s American pop music. Street vendors hawked hot dogs and empanadas. Supporters cheered in Spanish and the Indigenous Aymaran language. Wearing glittering shoes and brightly colored, bunched-out skirts called 'polleras,' the amateur models of all heights and sizes twirled, tipped their hats and threw sultry glances at the crowd. 'Years ago, people would associate these skirts with the fields, they'd look down on us as rural peasants,' said Rogelia Canaviri, 42, who couldn't stop smiling as she watched her daughter, Carolina, stride down the runway in dangling pearl earrings, the sequins on her layer-cake red skirt catching the stage lights. 'It's something I'm proud of, to see my daughter and her friends enjoy what I've worn for work my whole life,' she said, pointing to the wool shawl, velvet hat and lower-key beige pollera she had on — the same clothes, she said, she still wears to milk her cows and sell her cheese at open-air markets. Her own mother did the same. Generations ago, the Aymara were subject to waves of conquest and dispossession, first by the Inca, then by the Spanish, who forced the Indigenous communities to abandon their traditional way of dressing and adopt the style then-popular in the court of Seville. Legend has it that the jaunty felt bowler hat became critical to the get-up after being introduced by British railway workers in the 1920s. Bolivia's whiter, more affluent population has used 'Chola' — and its diminutive, 'Cholita' — as dismissive racial epithets. But in recent decades that stigma has dissipated, with Indigenous Aymara proudly reclaiming the word and younger Bolivians rediscovering the charm of their mothers' and grandmothers' vibrant garments. 'I think the ‘Cholita’ has become something very interesting, very exciting in our current context,' said Brittany Cantuta Valeria, 21, a first-time model, her hat brimmed upward and cheeks flushed a reddish gold. 'We’re now at the point of being respected because of everything that’s been implemented, so I wear this to have fun, to show off, to go to parties and dances. I have nothing to do with working the fields.' Most of the girls parading onstage Friday, in the show organized by the Viacha municipality, grew up during the tenure of former leftist President Evo Morales (2006-2019), the country’s first-ever Indigenous president whose championing of Bolivia's Indigenous majority earned him fervent support across the cinderblock and adobe homes of the Altiplano. Morales instituted a new constitution, which, among other things, expanded recognition for Bolivia’s 36 ethnic groups. He promoted the teaching of Indigenous languages and boosted state funding for folkloric arts. More Chola runway shows and beauty contests cropped up, widening the reach of Bolivia's native highland culture. But fashion fanfare was largely limited to La Paz, the seat of the government. Before Friday, the town of Viacha, like most of the other villages across these austere mountain-rimmed plains, had never taken its turn on the runway. 'I was really nervous but I realized this is the first time for all of us,' said 15-year-old Tomasa Ramirez. 'I feel so pretty. Now I know it’s my dream to be a Cholita model.' With Bolivia's economic crisis closing like a vise on families whose money has diminished in value while the cost of food has doubled, many girls said walking the show was no easy feat. Top-notch velvet hats and shawls made from vicuña wool with silk fringes can fetch thousands of dollars. Polleras cost a few hundred dollars. Then there's the jewelry — ideally made of real gold, pearls and diamonds when worn to these kinds of formal events. 'This year there was no way I could have real ones,' said Julieta Mamani, 16, pointing to her gold-colored earrings. 'I hope things will be different next year.' Watching her 24-year-old daughter pose for selfies in her elaborate skirt, Canaviri, the dairy farmer, has another hope. 'I hope she doesn't like wearing pants,' she said of her daughter. 'I tried on pants once in my life, and I felt naked. Never again.'	https://apnews.com/article/bolivia-indigenous-morales-andean-aymara-fashion-a1d8b5bfa1414bd54fa2ef1ae181cf65	2024-11-29T21:59:16-08:00	
Fishers at a Lebanese port hope ceasefire with Israel means normal life is returning	TYRE, Lebanon (AP) — The ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah brought hope for normality back to many in southern Lebanon on Friday, including fishermen who have long launched their single-engine wooden boats into the Mediterranean at dawn. During the last two months of its year fighting Hezbollah, Israel imposed a siege on southern Lebanon that kept hundreds of fishers at this ancient Phoenician port on shore, upending their lives and the industry. While less important than destruction and displacement, the port siege cut many people off from the key ingredients for traditional Lebanese dishes like sayadiyeh — fish and rice boiled in fish sauce — or fried and grilled fish eaten with dips such as hummus and tabbouleh or fattoush salads. The loss of fish damaged a deep association with home, but now the possibility of renewed Lebanese fishing on the country's southern coast is helping fuel hope for a brighter future. On Friday, a few boats went out close to the shore as fishers in the port worked on the nets of small boats painted white, blue or red. Hussein Sukmani, 55, said Friday that he was considering going to sea in coming days but was waiting to see how things unfold. He hasn't dared set sail since the Israel-Hezbollah war dramatically intensified on Sept. 23. 'They were days of fear and horror,' he said. 'They were the most difficult days of our lives.' A week ago, a drone strike killed two young fishers in the city as they prepared their nets on the coast, and some fishermen said Friday that the Lebanese army told them that they if headed out it would be at their own risk . Among those who sailed near the coast on Friday was Walid Darwish, who returned to the port with two plastic boxes filled with mullet. 'Today is the first time that we sail,' Darwish said, adding that fishers had missed the prime season in October and November. 'We lost it,' he said. The Israeli army barred any boats from an area 50 kilometers (31 miles) from the border in October and has not said whether the warning is still in effect. Sukmani said that most of the 700 fishers who work on the 270 boats at the port have not sailed out of concern since then. The area around the port is a predominantly Christian neighborhood that has been spared much of the airstrikes on other parts of Tyre that leveled buildings in this city. In peaceful times, the port is a major tourist attraction, beloved by Lebanese and foreigners who come for the views, the restaurants and the beaches. On Friday, Mohammed Hammoud walked along the coast of Tyre carrying his fishing rod. 'It is enough that someone is able to stand in this beautiful area,' he said, pointing to the white sands. 'Fishing is everything for me,' added Hammoud, who went to fish several times in the area north of the city of Sidon that was not part of the siege. In the old market of Tyre, Gilbert Spiridon watched from inside his shop as people came to buy freshly brought fish. Before the war, it took hours to sell all his fish to people from around Lebanon. 'All I wish is that the war has ended and we are back on track to the old good days,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-hezbollah-tyre-fishers-1eb9dad3ab8f0f5dae73db12a17f1a94	2024-11-29T20:46:05-08:00	
Romania's parliamentary vote risks being overshadowed by presidential race chaos	BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — Hundreds of protesters gathered in Bucharest after a far-right populist unexpectedly won the first round of a presidential race, plunging Romania into turmoil just days before the country holds parliamentary elections. 'Better to be dead than a fascist,' one placard reads. Sunday's ballot will determine a new government and prime minister to lead the European Union and NATO member country. However, the vote is sandwiched between the two rounds of the presidential race and is overshadowed by controversies and chaos following the outcome of the first vote. Despite polling at less than 10% before the first round, a far-right politician who has praised Romanian fascist leaders and Russian President Vladimir Putin won the most votes in the Nov. 24 ballot. Calin Georgescu is due to face reformist Elena Lasconi of the Save Romania Union party in a Dec. 8 runoff. 'He’s pro-Russia, pro-Putin, and we, the people — and especially the young people — we are supporting democracy,' said Sebastian Marin, an 18-year-old student who attended a protest on Wednesday in the capital. 'It’s really important for people to mobilize.' Georgescu's success, which many have attributed to his rapid rise in popularity on the social media platform TikTok, has triggered nightly protests throughout Romania by those who oppose his past remarks and view him as a threat to democracy. According to a report by Expert Forum, a Bucharest-based think tank, Georgescu’s TikTok account has had an explosion which it said 'appears sudden and artificial, similar to his polling results.' Without naming Georgescu, who declared zero campaign spending, Romania’s top defense body said on Thursday that 'a presidential candidate benefited from massive exposure due to preferential treatment' granted by TikTok. Romania has become a 'priority target for hostile actions' by Russia, it added. The Kremlin denies it is meddling. The same day, the Constitutional Court requested a recount of all 9.4 million votes after a former presidential candidate who obtained 1%, lodged a complaint alleging the Save Romania Union had violated electoral laws against campaign activities on polling day. The Central Election Bureau approved the request and said scanned reports were due to be sent in by 10.00 p.m. Sunday. On Friday, the court postponed a decision until Monday on whether to annul the vote. Opposite the government headquarters, people of all ages, but mostly young people, could be heard chanting: 'Democracy saves Romania!' 'I find it a bit worrying that these elections are so close together,' Andrei Ienculescu-Popovici, a 28-year-old computer programmer, told The Associated Press. 'At the moment, almost no one talks about the parliamentary elections … it has become a non-topic.' He said he is suspicious of the unprecedented decision to recount the vote, which pro-democracy groups and Save Romania Union have complained is not transparent enough. 'These are strange and unprecedented times for our young and fragile democracy ... this move will probably only benefit the extreme right-wing parties,' he said. A protest in Bucharest on Friday organized by the 'Corruption Kills' community, demanded 'that the votes be recounted with independent observers and cameras' and accused the Constitutional Court of 'once again attacking democracy' in the interest of a specific party. It is the first time in Romania’s 35-year post-communist history that the leftist Social Democratic Party did not have a candidate in a presidential runoff. Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu resigned as party leader after he lost to Lasconi by a wafer-thin 2,740 votes, and Nicolae Ciuca also resigned as leader of the center-right National Liberal Party after obtaining just 8.7%. While the presidential role in Romania has significant decision-making powers in areas such as national security and foreign policy, the prime minister is the head of the nation’s government. Sunday’s vote will determine the formation of the country’s 466-seat legislature. 'The most important vote is the parliamentary one, not the presidential one, they decide who really runs the country,' said Ienculescu-Popovici. 'We were perceived as being one of the most stable and trustworthy allies, and I fear current events might unravel that.' Since 2021, Romania’s two biggest parties — the Social Democrats and the National Liberal Party — formed an unlikely coalition, which has become bitterly strained. A small ethnic Hungarian party exited the cabinet last year following disputes over a power-sharing agreement. Like many countries throughout Europe or even the U.S., anti-incumbency sentiment is running high in Romania, which has experienced high inflation and cost of living, has a large budget deficit, and a sluggish economy. It has bolstered support for far-right populist parties. Recent surveys have suggested the top three parties in Sunday’s race will be the PSD; the far-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, and the PNL. After rising to the political scene eight years ago on an anti-corruption ticket, the Save Romania Union's popularity has waned in recent years but could garner the next most votes. More minor parties that may not pass the 5% threshold to enter parliament include the pro-EU reformist REPER party and the liberal-conservative Force of the Right. Some have predicted that the far-right nationalist S.O.S Romania party, and the recently formed and little-known Party of Young People, which has backed Georgescu, could pass the threshold. Romania's Minister of Energy Sebastian Burduja told the AP: 'Nobody saw this coming … and I mean nobody.' He added that the far-right Alliance for the Union of Romanians gaining more power in parliament after Sunday’s race, and Georgescu winning the final presidential vote, 'is a very real concern.' After the unpredictable presidential vote and the confusion surrounding it, many political observers are reluctant to predict the outcome of the parliamentary vote. Claudiu Tufis, an associate professor of political science at the University of Bucharest, says Sunday’s vote could see strong anti-establishment turnout for far-right populism, which could win as much as 30-40% of the ballot and 'polarize the population even more.' 'People who voted for Georgescu seem to really enjoy the victory in this first round ... they have a lot more courage to say who they are and be proud of their vote,' he said. 'We’ve had people who are really angry at the governing party, and they voted for the opposition, only this time, the governing parties were actually the two main parties.'	https://apnews.com/article/romania-elections-parliament-georgescu-europe-42548c4841392bd7a504761752e0970c	2024-11-29T20:26:48-08:00	
Stealth destroyer to be home for 1st hypersonic weapon on a US warship	The U.S. Navy is transforming a costly flub into a potent weapon with the first shipborne hypersonic weapon, which is being retrofitted aboard the first of its three stealthy destroyers. The USS Zumwalt is at a Mississippi shipyard where workers have installed missile tubes that replace twin turrets from a gun system that was never activated because it was too expensive. Once the system is complete, the Zumwalt will provide a platform for conducting fast, precision strikes from greater distances, adding to the usefulness of the warship. 'It was a costly blunder but the Navy could take victory from the jaws of defeat here, and get some utility out of them by making them into a hypersonic platform,' said Bryan Clark, a defense analyst at the Hudson Institute. The U.S. has had several types of hypersonic weapons in development for the past two decades, but recent tests by both Russia and China have added pressure to the U.S. military to hasten their production. Hypersonic weapons travel beyond Mach 5, five times the speed of sound, with added maneuverability making them harder to shoot down. Last year, The Washington Post reported that among the documents leaked by former Massachusetts Air National Guard member Jack Teixeira was a defense department briefing that confirmed China had recently tested an intermediate-range hypersonic weapon called the DF-27. While the Pentagon had previously acknowledged the weapon's development, it had not recognized its testing. One of the U.S. programs in development and planned for the Zumwalt is 'Conventional Prompt Strike.' It would launch like a ballistic missile and then release a hypersonic glide vehicle that would travel at speeds seven to eight times faster than the speed of sound before hitting the target. The weapon system is being developed jointly by the Navy and Army. Each of the Zumwalt-class destroyers would be equipped with four missile tubes, each with three of the missiles for a total of 12 hypersonic weapons per ship. In choosing the Zumwalt, the Navy is attempting to add to the usefulness of a $7.5 billion warship that is considered by critics to be an expensive mistake despite serving as a test platform for multiple innovations. The Zumwalt was envisioned as providing land-attack capability with an Advanced Gun System with rocket-assisted projectiles to open the way for Marines to charge ashore. But the system featuring 155 mm guns hidden in stealthy turrets was canceled because each of the rocket-assisted projectiles cost between $800,000 and $1 million. Despite the stain on its reputation, the three Zumwalt-class destroyers remain the Navy’s most advanced surface warship in terms of new technologies. Those innovations include electric propulsion, an angular shape to minimize radar signature, an unconventional wave-piercing hull, automated fire and damage control and a composite deckhouse that hides radar and other sensors. The Zumwalt arrived at the Huntington Ingalls Industries shipyard in Pascagoula, Mississippi, in August 2023 and was removed from the water for the complex work of integrating the new weapon system. It is due to be undocked this week in preparation for the next round of tests and its return to the fleet, shipyard spokeswoman Kimberly Aguillard said. A U.S. hypersonic weapon was successfully tested over the summer and development of the missiles is continuing. The Navy wants to begin testing the system aboard the Zumwalt in 2027 or 2028, according to the Navy. The U.S. weapon system will come at a steep price. It would cost nearly $18 billion to buy 300 of the weapons and maintain them over 20 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Critics say there is too little bang for the buck. 'This particular missile costs more than a dozen tanks. All it gets you is a precise non-nuclear explosion, some place far far away. Is it really worth the money? The answer is most of the time the missile costs much more than any target you can destroy with it,' said Loren Thompson, a longtime military analyst in Washington, D.C. But they provide the capability for Navy vessels to strike an enemy from a distance of thousands of kilometers — outside the range of most enemy weapons — and there is no effective defense against them, said retired Navy Rear Adm. Ray Spicer, CEO of the U.S. Naval Institute, a think tank, and former commander of an aircraft carrier strike force. Conventional missiles that cost less aren’t much of a bargain if they are unable to reach their targets, Spicer said, adding the U.S. military really has no choice but to pursue them. 'The adversary has them. We never want to be outdone,' he said. The U.S. is accelerating development because hypersonics have been identified as vital to U.S. national security with 'survivable and lethal capabilities,' said James Weber, principal director for hypersonics in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Critical Technologies. 'Fielding new capabilities that are based on hypersonic technologies is a priority for the defense department to sustain and strengthen our integrated deterrence, and to build enduring advantages,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/navy-hypersonic-weapon-zumwalt-china-russia-ec3272a36042796518aec665a4e65df3	2024-11-29T20:06:23-08:00	
How Brazilian police say Bolsonaro plotted a coup to stay in office	SAO PAULO (AP) — Brazil's Federal Police in late November formally accused far-right former President Jair Bolsonaro and 36 others of planning a coup to keep him in office. The agency described a multi-step scheme, substantiated by evidence and testimony, in an 884-page report. The plan included systematically sowing distrust of the electoral system among the populace, drafting a decree to give the plot a veneer of legal basis, pressuring top military brass to go along with the plan, and inciting a riot in the capital. Prosecutor-General Paulo Gonet will now decide whether to formally charge the accused parties, toss the investigation or request more testimony to understand each person’s participation in different parts of the alleged plot before deciding who stands trial on which counts. Bolsonaro and his main allies have denied any wrongdoing or involvement and accuse the authorities of political persecution. Here is a breakdown of the plan's key elements as laid out in the report and how they are supposedly connected. Sowing doubt about Brazil’s voting system Police allege that efforts to disseminate fake news about Brazil’s electronic voting system began in 2019, Bolsonaro’s first year in office, but were conducted more strategically and intensively as his 2022 reelection bid drew near. Police say so-called 'digital militias' comprised of thousands of social media accounts linked to pro-Bolsonaro propaganda, as well as other prominent right-wing influencers and politicians, spread propaganda claiming the voting system could be tampered with. Bolsonaro also openly expressed admiration for Brazil’s military dictatorship (1964-1985), which he claimed saved the country from communism. The narrative of an impending illegitimate election defeat helped Bolsonaro rally tens of thousands of supporters to multiple street demonstrations and also muster many to set up camp outside military barracks and headquarters to pressure leaders. Three months before the election, Bolsonaro invited dozens of diplomats to the presidential palace for a nationally televised meeting in which he presented supposed vulnerabilities of the voting system, without providing any evidence. Following Bolsonaro’s loss in 2022 to leftist Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Bolsonaro's Liberal Party questioned results at the country's top electoral court, arguing voting devices made in specific years could have permitted fraud. The electoral court swiftly dismissed the claims. 'They spread false studies on the vulnerabilities of the electronic voting machines through the Liberal Party, in an attempt to create a factual basis for a presidential decree' that would set the coup in motion, the report says. A draft decree to set the coup in motion In January 2023, Brazilian police found a draft decree in the home of Bolsonaro’s former justice minister Anderson Torres. It was one of many versions drafted either at the far-right leader's behest or with his knowledge, police say. The former president presented the document, unsigned, to the commanders of the three divisions of the armed forces on Dec. 7, seeking their support. Investigators say the draft decree shows Bolsonaro and his allies sought to create a committee to probe alleged fraud and crimes in the October 2022 vote, so they could later suspend the powers of the nation’s top electoral court and possibly convene a new election. The navy’s commander was ready to comply with the decree, but army and air force leaders objected to any plan that would prevent Lula's inauguration, the report said. Those refusals are why the plan did not go ahead, according to witnesses who spoke to investigators. Many legal experts including say evidence that former president presented the draft to military leaders and supported for different versions of the document are very damaging. '(The goal) was to unduly intervene in elections,' said Luiz Henrique Machado, a law professor at the IDP university in the capital Brasilia. 'In Brazil, it is the electoral prosecutors' office and the top electoral court that have the final word about electoral legislation.' In an interview with website UOL published Thursday, Bolsonaro said he discussed with military leaders moves including decreeing a state of emergency and other exceptional measures that would have suspended the rule of law for the public good. He said such measures are provided for by the constitution, so there is nothing unseemly about evaluating those options. 'What is being said is absurd. For my part, there has never been any discussion of a coup,' Bolsonaro told journalists in Brasilia on Monday. Plan to assassinate the president-elect On Nov. 19, Brazil's Federal Police arrested four army special operations officers and a federal police officer accused of plotting in 2022 to assassinate Lula, vice-president-elect Geraldo Alckmin and Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes. The arrested men were all mentioned in a police report that was unsealed later. The assassination plan sought to leave Bolsonaro's ticket as the only remaining valid one in the 2022 runoff, police say. As for de Moraes, he led a five-year probe into fake news and threats against Supreme Court justices, which has led some far-right allies and supporters being barred from social media and even imprisoned. In early 2023, he presided over the nation’s top electoral court when it declared Bolsonaro ineligible for office until 2030 over abuse of power related to a meeting he convened with foreign ambassadors to spread lies about the voting system. Gen. Walter Braga Netto, Bolsonaro’s 2022 running mate and former defense minister, greenlit the assassination plan at a meeting with the plotters inside his home, investigators added. Federal Police portray the retired general as one of the plot's leaders, also involved in pressuring military leaders to sign onto the coup. Braga Netto said in a statement on Tuesday that he never plotted a coup. He added that several of the documents seized from one of his aides, including 'writings, drafts and media reports' were 'preparatory material to answer media requests and to prepare for testimony in congressional hearings.' The police report contains no indication that any attempt to assassinate Lula or Alckmin was put into motion. However, investigators found messages and documents indicating that the plotters were monitoring and following de Moraes at the time. Police said they found evidence that retired Brig. Gen. Mário Fernandes, one of the officers arrested who had been serving as interim general secretary of the presidency, also visited the protest camps outside military installations, including at the army headquarters in Brasilia. Investigators said they have evidence that he gave instructions and financial support to the protesters. Jan. 8 uprising Federal Police linked Bolsonaro and some of his top ministers to the Jan. 8, 2023 riot in which supporters of the former president, many of whom had been camped outside army headquarters for months, ransacked the Supreme Court, Congress and presidential palace in Brasilia. The protesters had pleaded for the armed forces to keep the leftist leader out of office and their uprising — which came after Lula was sworn in — was an attempt to force military intervention and oust the new president, police say. The riot appears in the report as one of several 'other actions to pressure the army commander to join the coup d’etat.' Police also say that Brig. Gen. Fernandes sent a message in November 2022 to Gen. Marco Antônio Freire Gomes, then the Army's commander, discussing the need for a 'triggering event' for a coup. Defendants, including Bolsonaro, have argued that the riot was an isolated event, and many legal experts have noted that the report's evidence of a connection between it and a broader plot is tenuous. 'It is clear that the alleged coup plotters had contacts with people camped outside military barracks, people who were there on Jan. 8. But how much of that contact was transformed into planning, coordination, stimulus for those people to take public buildings that day? That is to be debated, it is going to be discussed in the process and the collection of more evidence,' said João Pedro Pádua, a professor of criminal law proceedings at the Universidade Federal Fluminense in Rio de Janeiro. Bolsonaro left for the United States days before Lula’s inauguration on Jan. 1, 2023 and stayed there three months, keeping a low profile. The police report alleges he was avoiding possible imprisonment related to the coup plot and awaiting the fallout from the uprising. ___ Hughes reported from Rio de Janeiro. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/bolsonaro-brazil-coup-legal-woes-report-43bae30906925a8dc04e319b901488f8	2024-11-29T19:07:59-08:00	
China sentences journalist detained at meal with Japanese diplomat to 7 years for espionage	BANGKOK (AP) — A court in Beijing on Friday sentenced a prominent Chinese journalist to seven in years in prison for espionage, his family said. Dong Yuyu, a commentator and editor, was taken away by police while meeting a Japanese diplomat at a restaurant in February 2022. He has been in police custody since then. The Beijing Number 2 Intermediate People's Court read the verdict but did not share a copy with Dong's lawyers or family. No announcement was available on the court's website or its Weibo account. The verdict named then-Japanese ambassador Hideo Tarumi and Shanghai-based chief diplomat Masaru Okada as agents belonging to an espionage organization, according the family's statement. Dong had served as the deputy head of the editorial department at Guangming Daily, one of the five major state-owned papers in China. The paper was once considered more liberal than other state-backed papers. Dong also contributed to the Chinese edition of the New York Times. In his published writings, including essays as well as opinion articles, Dong had voiced his support for constitutional democracy and political reform, which later were considered to be against the stance of the Communist Party. He had contacts with foreign diplomats, scholars and other journalists as part of his decades-long career and counted Tarumi, the ambassador, as a friend. Still, his family said he knew he was always watched by state security, and therefore sought to be as open as possible while meeting his Japanese or American contacts. 'With Yuyu’s conviction, every Chinese citizen, when dealing with the Japanese embassy — or perhaps any other foreign embassy and diplomat — will be expected to know that the Chinese government may consider those embassies to be ‘espionage organizations,’' said the family in a statement. 'Every sensible Chinese citizen should be appalled by this reasoning.' The U.S. Ambassador to China, Nicholas Burns, condemned Dong's conviction. 'Punishing Dong for exercising his freedom of speech and the press, guaranteed by the PRC’s constitution for all its citizens, is unjust.'	https://apnews.com/article/china-spying-journalist-sentenced-japanese-diplomat-d50beb4ba4fe794869a51d3b944a7c4c	2024-11-29T18:18:04-08:00	
North Korea's Kim vows steadfast support for Russia’s war in Ukraine	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un vowed his country will 'invariably support' Russia’s war in Ukraine as he met Russia's defense chief, the North’s state media reported Saturday. A Russia military delegation led by Defense Minister Andrei Belousov arrived in North Korea on Friday, amid growing international concern about the two countries’ expanding cooperation after North Korea sent thousands of troops to Russia last month. The official Korean Central News Agency said that Kim and Belousov reached 'a satisfactory consensus' on boosting strategic partnership and defending each country’s sovereignty, security interests and international justice in the face of the rapidly-changing international security environments in a Friday meeting. Kim said that North Korea 'will invariably support the policy of the Russian Federation to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity from the imperialists’ moves for hegemony,' KCNA said. North Korea has supported Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, calling it a defensive response to what both Moscow and Pyongyang call NATO’s 'reckless' eastward advance and U.S.-led moves to stamp out Russia’s position as a powerful state. Kim slammed a U.S. decision earlier in November to let Ukraine strike targets inside Russia with U.S.-supplied longer-range missiles as a direct intervention in the conflict. He called recent Russian strikes on Ukraine 'a timely and effective measure' demonstrate Russia's resolve, KCNA said. According to U.S., Ukrainian and South Korean assessments, North Korea has sent more than 10,000 troops to Russia and some of them have already begun engaging in combat on the frontlines. U.S., South Korean and others say North Korea has also shipped artillery systems, missiles and other conventional weapons to replenish Russia’s exhausted weapons inventory. Both North Korea and Russia haven’t formally confirmed the North Korean troops’ movements, and have steadfastly denied reports of weapons shipments. South Korea, the U.S. and their partners are concerned that Russia could give North Korea advanced weapons technology in return, including help to build more powerful nuclear missiles. Last week, South Korean national security adviser Shin Wonsik told a local SBS TV program that that Seoul assessed that Russia has provided air defense missile systems to North Korea. He said Russia also appeared to have given economic assistance to North Korea and various military technologies, including those needed for the North’s efforts to build a reliable space-based surveillance system. Belousov also met North Korean Defense Minister No Kwang Chol on Friday. During a dinner banquet later the same day, Belousov said the the two countries' strategic partnership was crucial to defend their sovereignty from aggression and the arbitrary actions of imperialists, KCNA said. In June, Kim and Putin signed a treaty requiring both countries to provide immediate military assistance if either is attacked. It's considered the two countries’ biggest defense deal since the end of the Cold War.	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-russia-troops-ukraine-belousov-visit-35a6fd80f64ae2dd01637ed5e5b6451d	2024-11-29T17:30:52-08:00	
What to know about sudden rebel gains in Syria's 13-year war and why it matters	WASHINGTON (AP) — The 13-year civil war in Syria has roared back into prominence with a surprise rebel offensive on Aleppo, one of Syria's largest cities and an ancient business hub. The push is among the rebels' strongest in years in a war whose destabilizing effects have rippled far beyond the country's borders. It was the first opposition attack on Aleppo since 2016, when a brutal air campaign by Russian warplanes helped Syrian President Bashar Assad retake the northwestern city. Intervention by Russia, Iran and Iranian-allied Hezbollah and other groups has allowed Assad to remain in power, within the 70% of Syria under his control. The surge in fighting has raised the prospect of another violent front reopening in the Middle East, at a time when U.S.-backed Israel is fighting Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, both Iranian-allied groups. Robert Ford, the last-serving U.S. ambassador to Syria, pointed to months of Israeli strikes on Syrian and Hezbollah targets in the area, and to Israel’s ceasefire with Hezbollah in Lebanon this week, as factors providing Syria’s rebels with the opportunity to advance. Here's a look at some of the key aspects of the new fighting: Why does the fighting at Aleppo matter? Assad has been at war with opposition forces seeking his overthrow for 13 years, a conflict that's killed an estimated half-million people. Some 6.8 million Syrians have fled the country, a refugee flow that helped change the political map in Europe by fueling anti-immigrant far-right movements. The roughly 30% of the country not under Assad is controlled by a range of opposition forces and foreign troops. The U.S. has about 900 troops in northeast Syria, far from Aleppo, to guard against a resurgence by the Islamic State. Both the U.S. and Israel conduct occasional strikes in Syria against government forces and Iran-allied militias. Turkey has forces in Syria as well, and has influence with the broad alliance of opposition forces storming Aleppo. Coming after years with few sizeable changes in territory between Syria's warring parties, the fighting 'has the potential to be really quite, quite consequential and potentially game-changing,' if Syrian government forces prove unable to hold their ground, said Charles Lister, a longtime Syria analyst with the U.S.-based Middle East Institute. Risks include if Islamic State fighters see it as an opening, Lister said. Ford said the fighting in Aleppo would become more broadly destabilizing if it drew Russia and Turkey — each with its own interests to protect in Syria — into direct heavy fighting against each other. What do we know about the group leading the offensive on Aleppo? The U.S. and U.N. have long designated the opposition force leading the attack at Aleppo — Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, known by its initials HTS — as a terrorist organization. Abu Mohammed al-Golani emerged as the leader of al-Qaida's Syria branch in 2011, in the first months of Syria's war. It was an unwelcome intervention to many in Syria's opposition, who hoped to keep the fight against Assad's brutal rule untainted by violent extremism. Golani and his group early on claimed responsibility for deadly bombings, pledged to attack Western forces, confiscated property from religious minorities and sent religious police to enforce modest dress by women. Golani and HTS have sought to remake themselves in recent years, focusing on promoting civilian government in their territory as well as military action, researcher Aaron Zelin noted. His group broke ties with al-Qaida in 2016. Golani cracked down on some extremist groups in his territory, and increasingly portrays himself as a protector of other religions. That includes last year allowing the first Christian Mass in the city of Idlib in years. By 2018, the Trump administration acknowledged it was no longer directly targeting Golani, Zelin said. But HTS has allowed some wanted armed groups to continue to operate on its territory, and shot at U.S. special forces at least as recently as 2022, he said. What's the history of Aleppo in the war? At the crossroads of trade routes and empires for thousands of years, Aleppo is one of the centers of commerce and culture in the Middle East. Aleppo was home to 2.3 million people before the war. Rebels seized the east side of the city in 2012, and it became the proudest symbol of the advance of armed opposition factions. In 2016, government forces backed by Russian airstrikes laid siege to the city. Russian shells, missiles and crude barrel bombs — fuel canisters or other containers loaded with explosives and metal — methodically leveled neighborhoods. Starving and under siege, rebels surrendered Aleppo that year. The Russian military's entry was the turning point in the war, allowing Assad to stay on in the territory he held. This year, Israeli airstrikes in Aleppo have hit Hezbollah weapons depots and Syrian forces, among other targets, according to an independent monitoring group. Israel rarely acknowledges strikes at Aleppo and other government-held areas of Syria.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-hts-assad-aleppo-fighting-2be43ee530b7932b123a0f26b158ac22	2024-11-29T13:21:07-08:00	
Canadian news publishers sue OpenAI over alleged copyright infringement	OTTAWA, Ontario (AP) — A coalition of Canadian news publishers, including The Canadian Press, Torstar, Globe and Mail, Postmedia and CBC/Radio-Canada, has filed a lawsuit against OpenAI for using news content to train its ChatGPT generative artificial intelligence system. The outlets said in a joint statement on Friday that OpenAI regularly breaches copyright by scraping large amounts of content from Canadian media. 'OpenAI is capitalizing and profiting from the use of this content, without getting permission or compensating content owners,' the statement said. The publishers argue that OpenAI practices undermine the hundreds of millions of dollars invested in journalism, and that content is protected by copyright. 'News media companies welcome technological innovations. However, all participants must follow the law, and any use of intellectual property must be on fair terms,' the statement said. Generative AI can create text, images, videos and computer code based on a simple prompt, but the systems must first study vast amounts of existing content. OpenAI said in a statement that its models are trained on publicly available data. It said they are 'grounded in fair use and related international copyright principles that are fair for creators and support innovation.' The company said it collaborates 'closely with news publishers, including in the display, attribution and links to their content in ChatGPT search' and offers outlets 'easy ways to opt-out should they so desire.' This is the first such case in Canada, though numerous lawsuits are underway in the United States, including a case by the New York Times against OpenAI and Microsoft. Some news organizations have chosen to collaborate rather than fight with OpenAI by signing deals to get compensated for sharing news content that can be used to train its AI systems. The Associated Press is among the news organizations that have made licensing deals over the past year with OpenAI. Others include The Wall Street Journal and New York Post publisher News Corp., The Atlantic, Axel Springer in Germany and Prisa Media in Spain, France’s Le Monde newspaper and the London-based Financial Times. Canada has passed a law requiring Google and Meta to compensate news publishers for the use of their content, but has previously declined to say whether the Online News Act should apply to use by AI systems. In response to that legislation, Meta pulled news from its platforms in Canada, while Google has reached a deal to pay $100 million Canadian (US$ 71 million) to Canadian news outlets.	https://apnews.com/article/canada-news-publishers-lawsuit-chatgpt-3e1790fcf4c9f001f1d32609c4d547af	2024-11-29T09:47:35-08:00	
Trudeau says Trump would raise prices on Americans if he follows through on Canada tariff threat	TORONTO (AP) — Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Friday that if President-elect Donald Trump follows through on this threat to impose sweeping tariffs on Canadian products, he would be raising prices for Americans and hurting American businesses. Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on products from Canada and Mexico if the countries don’t stop what he called the flow of drugs and migrants across southern and northern borders. He said he would impose a 25% tax on all products entering the U.S. from Canada and Mexico as one of his first executive orders. 'It is important to understand that Donald Trump, when he makes statements like that, he plans on carrying them out. There’s no question about it,' Trudeau said to reporters in Prince Edward Island in Atlantic Canada. 'Our responsibility is to point out that he would not just be harming Canadians, who work so well with the United States, but he would actually be raising prices for Americans citizens as well and hurting American industry and business,' he added. Trudeau said Trump got elected because he promised to bring down the cost of groceries but now he's talking about adding 25% to the cost of all kinds of products including potatoes from Prince Edward Island. Those tariffs could essentially blow up the North American trade pact that Trump’s team negotiated during his initial term. Trudeau noted they were able to successfully re-negotiate the deal, which he calls a 'win win' for both countries. 'We can work together as we did previously,' Trudeau said. Trump made the tariff threat Monday while railing against an influx of illegal migrants, even though the numbers at the Canadian border pale in comparison to the southern border. The U.S. Border Patrol made 56,530 arrests at the Mexican border in October alone — and 23,721 arrests at the Canadian one between October 2023 and September 2024. Trump also railed about fentanyl from Mexico and Canada, even though seizures from the Canadian border are few in comparison to the Mexican border. U.S. customs agents seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the Canadian border last fiscal year, compared with 21,100 pounds at the Mexican border. Canadian officials say lumping Canada in with Mexico is unfair but say they are ready to make new investments in border security. 'We’re going to work together to meet some of the concerns,' Trudeau said. 'But ultimately it is through lots of real constructive conversations with President Trump that I am going to have, that will keep us moving forward on the right track for all Canadians.' Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Thursday she is confident that a tariff war with the United States will be averted. Trump posted on social media that he had spoken with her and she had agreed to stop unauthorized migration across the border into the United States. When Trump imposed higher tariffs during his first term in office, other countries responded with retaliatory tariffs of their own. Canada, for instance, announced billions of new duties in 2018 against the U.S. in a tit-for-tat response to new taxes on Canadian steel and aluminum. Canada is already examining possible retaliatory tariffs on certain items from the U.S. should Trump follow through on his threat to impose sweeping tariffs on Canadian products, a senior official told The Associated Press this week. A government official said Canada is preparing for every eventuality and has started thinking about what items to target with tariffs in retaliation. The official stressed no decision has been made. The person spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly. In the U.S., business groups were quick to warn about rapidly escalating inflation. House Democrats put together legislation to strip a president’s ability to unilaterally apply tariffs this drastic, warning that they would likely lead to higher prices for autos, shoes, housing and groceries. Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states. Nearly $3.6 billion Canadian (US$2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border each day. About 60% of U.S. crude oil imports are from Canada, and 85% of U.S. electricity imports are from Canada. Canada is also the largest foreign supplier of steel, aluminum and uranium to the U.S. and has 34 critical minerals and metals that the Pentagon is eager for and investing in for national security. Canada is one of the most trade-dependent countries in the world, and 77% of Canada’s exports go to the U.S. 'Canada has reason to fear because Trump is impulsive, often influenced by the last thing he sees on Fox News,' said Nelson Wiseman, professor emeritus at the University of Toronto. 'He can leverage that by catering to what he thinks will sound and look good to the public rather than to what happens or will happen.'	https://apnews.com/article/canada-us-trudeau-trump-tariffs-4129d793d8e1a60fd6d1f45697901a21	2024-11-29T09:19:00-08:00	
Arrests in North Macedonia after raucous celebrations by members of ethnic Albanian minority	SKOPJE, North Macedonia (AP) — Police in North Macedonia have arrested 10 people following raucous celebrations — allegedly including gunfire — by members of the country's ethnic Albanian minority to mark an Albanian national holiday, officials said Friday. Interior Minister Panche Toshkovski said the suspects, who include several minors, face charges of 'inciting national, racial and religious hatred, discord and intolerance.' If tried and convicted, they face up to five years in prison. Hundreds of people took part in celebrations late Thursday of Albanian Flag Day in North Macedonia's capital, Skopje, and other cities. In Skopje, at least one flag of North Macedonia was hauled down, torn up and set on fire. Local reports said some people taking part in the celebrations had apparently fired bursts of shots in the air with automatic rifles. No injuries were reported. Thursday night's celebrations boosted ethnic tensions in the small Balkan country, which has a sizeable and occasionally restive ethnic Albanian minority. North Macedonia's right-wing government condemned the incidents as a bid to destabilize the country. All political parties, including those representing the ethnic Albanian minority, also issued statements of condemnation. Prime Minister Hristijan Mickoski called the attack on the flag 'an act of aggression,' while Interior Minister Toshkovski said it was 'a direct attack against the state.' 'I appeal to Macedonian citizens, regardless of ethnicity, not to allow these criminal groups ... to destabilize our common homeland,' Mickoski said on Friday. According to the latest census in 2021, ethnic Albanians comprise nearly a third of the country's 1,8 million population. Relations between the Albanian minority and Macedonian majority have been fragile since North Macedonia left the former Yugoslavia in 1991. Ten years later, an armed ethnic Albanian uprising ended with a deal that granted more minority rights. North Macedonia borders to the west with Albania and to the north with Kosovo, most of whose population is ethnic Albanian. Albanian Flag Day celebrates Albania's declaration of independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1912.	https://apnews.com/article/north-macedonia-ethnic-albanians-celebrations-arrests-skopje-0900a16e5aad9f788407f767ba4f110e	2024-11-29T09:03:03-08:00

Israelis are wary of returning to the north because they don't trust the ceasefire with Hezbollah	KIBBUTZ MALKIYA, Israel (AP) — Dean Sweetland casts his gaze over a forlorn street in the Israeli community of Kibbutz Malkiya. Perched on a hill overlooking the border with Lebanon, the town stands mostly empty after being abandoned a year ago. The daycare is closed. The homes are unkempt. Parts of the landscape are ashen from fires sparked by fallen Hezbollah rockets. Even after a tenuous Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire designed to let Israelis return to the north, the mood here is far from celebratory. 'The ceasefire is rubbish,' said Sweetland, a gardener and member of the kibbutz’s civilian security squad. 'Do you expect me to ring around my friends and say, ‘All the families should come home?’ No.' Across the border, Lebanese civilians have jammed roads in a rush to return to homes in the country's south, but most residents of northern Israel have met the ceasefire with suspicion and apprehension. 'Hezbollah could still come back to the border, and who will protect us when they do?' Sweetland asked. Israel’s government seeks to bring the northern reaches of the country back to life, particularly the line of communities directly abutting Lebanon that have played a major role in staking out Israel’s border. But the fear of Hezbollah, a lack of trust in United Nations peacekeeping forces charged with upholding the ceasefire, deep anger at the government and some Israelis' desire to keep rebuilding their lives elsewhere are keeping many from returning immediately. When the truce took effect, about 45,000 Israelis had evacuated from the north. They fled their homes after Hezbollah began firing across the border on Oct. 8, 2023, in solidarity with its ally Hamas in Gaza. That triggered more than a year of cross-border exchanges, with Lebanese villages in the south and Israeli communities facing the border taking the brunt of the pain. During the truce's initial 60-day phase, Hezbollah is supposed to remove its armed presence from a broad band of southern Lebanon where the military says the militant group had been digging in for years by gathering weapons and setting up rocket launch sites and other infrastructure. Under the ceasefire, a U.N. peacekeeping force known as UNIFIL and a beefed-up Lebanese army presence are supposed to ensure Hezbollah doesn’t return. Many residents of northern Israel are skeptical that the peace will hold. Sarah Gould, who evacuated Kibbutz Malkiya at the start of the war with her three kids, said Hezbollah fired on the community up to and just past the minute when the ceasefire took effect early Wednesday. 'So for the government to tell me that Hezbollah is neutralized,' she said, 'it’s a perfect lie.' Residents fear for their safety in the far north In Gaza, where Israel is pushing forward with a war that has killed over 44,000 Palestinians, Israel’s goal is the eradication of Hamas. But in Lebanon, Israel’s aims were limited to pushing Hezbollah away from the border so northern residents could return home. Israeli critics say the government should have kept fighting to outright cripple Hezbollah or to clear out the border area, which is home to hundreds of thousands of Lebanese. 'I won’t even begin to consider going home until I know there’s a dead zone for kilometers across the border,' the 46-year-old Gould said. Some wary Israelis trickled back home Thursday and Friday to areas farther from the border. But communities like Kibbutz Manara, set on a tiny slice of land between Lebanon and Syria, remained ghost towns. Orna Weinberg, 58, who was born and raised in Manara, said it was too early to tell whether the ceasefire would protect the community. Perched above all the other border villages, Manara was uniquely vulnerable to Hezbollah fire throughout the war. Three-quarters of its structures were damaged. In the kibbutz’s communal kitchen and dining hall, ceiling beams have collapsed. The uprooted floorboards are covered with ash from fires that also claimed much of the kibbutz’s cropland. Rocket fragments abound. The torso of a mannequin, a decoy dressed in army green, lies on the ground. Weinberg tried to stay in Manara during the war, but after anti-tank shrapnel damaged her home, soldiers told her to leave. On Thursday, she walked along her street, which looks out directly over a UNIFIL position separating the kibbutz from a line of Lebanese villages that have been decimated by Israeli bombardment and demolitions. Weinberg said UNIFIL hadn’t prevented Hezbollah’s build-up in the past, 'so why would they be able to now?' 'A ceasefire here just gives Hezbollah a chance to rebuild their power and come back to places that they were driven out of,' she said. The truce seemed fragile. Associated Press reporters heard sporadic bursts of gunfire, likely Israeli troops firing at Lebanese attempting to enter the towns. Israel’s military says it is temporarily preventing Lebanese civilians from returning home to a line of towns closest to the border, until the Lebanese military can deploy there in force. Even in less battered communities, no one returns home Though the atmosphere along the border was tense, Malkiya showed signs of peace. With Hezbollah’s rockets stopped, some residents returned briefly to the kibbutz to peer around cautiously. At a vista overlooking the border, where the hulking wreckage of Lebanese villages could made out, a group of around 30 soldiers gathered. Just days ago, they would have made easy targets for Hezbollah fire. Malkiya has sustained less damage than Manara. Still, residents said they would not return immediately. During a year of displacement, many have restarted their lives elsewhere, and the idea of going back to a front-line town on the border is daunting. In Lebanon, where Israeli bombardment and ground assaults drove some 1.2 million people from their homes, some of the displaced crowded into schools-turned-shelters or slept in the streets. In Israel, the government paid for hotels for evacuees and helped accommodate children in new schools. Gould predicted residents would return to the kibbutz only when government subsidies for their lodging dried up — 'not because they want to, but because they feel like they can’t afford an alternative.' 'It’s not just a security issue,' Gould said. 'We’ve spent more than a year rebuilding our lives wherever we landed. It’s a question of having to gather that up and move back somewhere else, somewhere that’s technically our old house but not a home. Nothing feels the same.' It’s unclear if schools in the border communities will have enough students to reopen, Gould said, and her children are already enrolled elsewhere. She’s enjoyed living farther from the border, away from an open war zone. There’s also a deep feeling that the communities were abandoned by the government, Sweetland said. Sweetland is one of roughly 25 civilian security volunteers who stayed throughout the war, braving continual rocket fire to keep the kibbutz afloat. They repaired damaged homes, put out blazes and helped replace the kibbutz generator when it was taken out by Hezbollah fire. They were on their own, with no firefighters or police willing to risk coming, he said. 'We didn’t have any help for months and months and months, and we pleaded, ‘Please help us.’' Sweetland said he will keep watching over the hushed pathways of the once-vibrant community in hopes his neighbors will soon feel safe enough to return. But he predicted it would take months. Weinberg hopes to move back to Manara as soon as possible. On Thursday, she spotted a former neighbor who was about to leave after checking the damage to her home. Weinberg grasped her hand through the car window, asking how she was. The woman grimaced and began to cry. Their hands parted as the car slowly rolled out through the gates and drove away.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-ceasefire-residents-return-8688dd6431960ca8ce9aed4f6e85cb87	2024-11-29T08:13:11-08:00	
Atlantic hurricane season comes to an end, leaving widespread damage in its wake	The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season comes to a close Saturday, bringing to an end a season that saw 11 hurricanes compared to the average seven, and death and destruction hundreds of miles from where storms came ashore on the U.S. Gulf Coast. Meteorologists called it a ' crazy busy ' season, due in part to unusually warm ocean temperatures. Eight hurricanes made landfall, in the U.S., Bermuda, Cuba, the Dominican Republic and Grenada. Here is some of what made the 2024 season stand out: Hurricane Beryl became the first Category 4 hurricane on record to form in the month of June, slamming into the island of Carriacou in Grenada. In Jamaica it went on to destroy crops and houses and left two dead. The last time the island was scraped by a Category 4 hurricane was Dean in 2007, making it 'pretty rare,' said Brian McNoldy, a hurricane researcher at the University of Miami. The storm then intensified into the earliest Category 5 hurricane ever in the Atlantic on July 1. Major hurricanes — Category 3 and above — are not usually seen until September 1, according to the National Hurricane Center. In September, Hurricane Helene caused catastrophic damage across the southeastern U.S. and was the deadliest storm to hit the U.S. mainland since Katrina in 2005. More than 200 people died. North Carolina estimates the storm caused at least $48.8 billion in direct or indirect damages with houses, drinking water systems and farms and forests destroyed. Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia also sustained extensive damage. In October, Hurricane Milton rapidly intensified and the storm’s maximum wind speeds hit a screaming 180 mph, making it one of the strongest hurricanes by wind speed ever recorded in the Gulf of Mexico. The only one stronger by that measure was Hurricane Rita in 2005. The areas where Helene and Milton struck saw as much as three times their usual rainfall for September and October, the heart of the Atlantic hurricane season. For Asheville, Tampa and Orlando, the two-month period was the wettest on record. In November, Hurricane Rafael reached 120 mph and was nearly the strongest November hurricane on record in the Gulf of Mexico, tying with Hurricane Kate in 1985. Rafael made landfall in Cuba and battered the island as it was trying to recover from widespread blackouts caused by Hurricane Oscar in October. Hurricane season and climate change Planet-warming gases like carbon dioxide and methane released by transportation and industry are causing oceans to rapidly warm. Several factors contribute to the formation of hurricanes, but unusually warm oceans allow hurricanes to form and intensify in places and times we don’t normally anticipate, McNoldy said. 'In other words, we never had a storm as strong as Beryl so early in the season anywhere in the Atlantic and we never had a storm as strong as Milton so late in the season in the Gulf of Mexico,' he said. 'I don’t ever point to climate change as causing a specific weather event, but it certainly has its finger on the scale and makes these extreme storms more likely to occur,' said McNoldy. ____ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Middle East latest: 2 children and a woman crushed to death outside Gaza bakery amid food shortage	Two children and a woman were crushed to death Friday as a crowd of Palestinians pushed to get bread at a bakery in the Gaza Strip amid a worsening food crisis in the war-ravaged territory, medical officials said. The bodies of two girls aged 13 and 17 and the 50-year-old woman were taken to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza, where a doctor confirmed that they died from suffocation due to crowding at the al-Banna bakery. Video from The Associated Press showed their bodies placed next to each other on the floor inside the hospital's morgue. The flow of food allowed into Gaza by Israel has fallen to nearly its lowest level of almost 14-month-old war for the past two months, according to Israeli official figures. U.N. and aid officials say hunger and desperation are growing among Gaza’s population, almost all of which relies on humanitarian aid to survive. Osama Abu Laban, the father of one of the girls, wailed over the loss of her life outside the hospital. 'My wife fell when she heard that she (our daughter) was suffocating. She did not yet know that she was dead,' he told the AP. Some bakeries in Gaza were closed for several days last week due to a shortage of flour. AP footage taken last week after they reopened showed large crowds of people cramming together, screaming and pushing, at one bakery in Deir al-Balah. Palestinians across the Gaza Strip are heavily relying on bakeries and charitable kitchens, with many able to only secure one meal a day for their families. In Lebanon, thousands of displaced people began returning to their homes this week after a ceasefire was announced between Israel and the Hezbollah militant group. Many found their homes reduced to rubble after intense Israeli airstrikes over the past two months leveled entire neighborhoods in eastern and southern Lebanon, as well as the southern suburbs of Beirut. Nearly 1.2 million people have been displaced. The truce was the first major sign of progress in the region since war began more than a year ago, triggered by Hamas’ attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. But it does not address the devastating war in Gaza. For Palestinians in Gaza and families of hostages held in the territory, the ceasefire marked another missed opportunity to end fighting that has stretched on for nearly 14 months. More than 44,000 people have been killed and more than 104,000 wounded, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. Israel has destroyed large parts of Gaza and displaced nearly all of its 2.3 million people. Here's the Latest: Hezbollah again starts holding public funerals for its fallen fighters MAARAKEH, Lebanon — Hezbollah held a public funeral in a southern village on Friday for five of its fighters killed during the fighting with Israel. It was the first time the Lebanese militant group held a public funeral since after the war intensified in late September. 'My son is in heaven,' said Zeinab al-Haj holding a bag or roses to toss them on the coffin of her son Ali Hijazi during the ceremony in the village of Maarakeh. Hijazi died of wounds suffered in an airstrike last week. Hezbollah’s last public funeral was held on Sept. 27, the same day the group’s leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike on a southern Beirut’s suburb. 'We are people who are proud of their martyrs,' said Hezbollah’s media chief in south Lebanon Salman Harb. 'Our martyrs are the symbol of our victory by all means.' After a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah went into effect on Wednesday, the group began announcing again its fallen fighters. More funerals are expected in the coming days including the funeral of three more fighters in Maarakeh on Saturday. Hezbollah had announced the death of nearly 500 fighters before Sept. 23, when the war intensified. Since late September, Hezbollah is believed to have lost hundreds of fighters whose funerals will be held whenever their bodies are recovered. Hezbollah is also expected to hold a funeral for Nasrallah and other top officials, including his successor Hashem Safieddine who was killed in an airstrike in early October. Hezbollah chief says the group agreed to the ceasefire deal ‘from a position of strength’ BEIRUT — Hezbollah chief Naim Kassem said on Friday that the militant group will coordinate closely with the Lebanese military to implement the U.S.-brokered ceasefire agreement with Israel that followed nearly 14 months of intense fighting. He also claimed that with the deal, Hezbollah achieved 'a great victory that surpasses the victory of July 2006,' the last time the Iran-backed group was at war with Israel. 'The ceasefire agreement aligns with Lebanese sovereignty and we have accepted it from a position of strength,' he asserted, speaking in a pre-recorded message from an undisclosed location on the third day of the ceasefire. Kassem added there would be no confrontation between Hezbollah fighters and the Lebanese Army. 'Don’t bet on any disagreement or friction between us and the army,' he said. 'The army will be deploying in its country, which is also ours.' Kassem also pledged Hezbollah will help 'with rebuilding and cooperate with the state and all organizations and countries willing to assist Lebanon, aiming to make Lebanon more beautiful than it was.' The World Bank estimates that Lebanon’s financial losses from the conflict — which was initially limited to the border but escalated dramatically in mid-September —exceed $8 billion, further straining a country already reeling from a series of cascading crises since 2019. Israeli military says it struck a site of a Hezbollah rocket launcher in southern Lebanon JERUSALEM — Israel’s military said it struck an area in southern Lebanon where it detected movement of a Hezbollah rocket launcher on Friday, the third day of the ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel. In the statement on the airstrike, the military said it would 'actively enforce violations of the ceasefire agreement.' The strike followed several Israeli military attacks in southern Lebanon earlier in the day, which were reported by the Lebanese state media, and an Israeli drone strike on a Hezbollah weapons depot on Thursday. There was no immediate comment from the Lebanese army, which has accused Israel of breaking the ceasefire several times since it came into effect. Hamas claims attack on Israeli bus in West Bank that wounded 8 people, including 4 soldiers RAMALLAH, West Bank — Hamas claimed responsibility for a shooting attack on an Israeli bus in the occupied West Bank on Friday that wounded eight people, including four soldiers. It was the latest violence to scar the territory as tensions run high 14 months into the Israel-Hamas war. The attacker, who Hamas identified in a statement as Samer Hussein, 46, was killed by Israeli troops shortly after opening fire toward the bus at a junction near the Israeli settlement of Ariel. The military said four soldiers were lightly wounded. Paramedics said three people were critically wounded. Attacks by Palestinian militants on Israelis in the volatile territory have grown more common since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, as Palestinian deaths have also spiked. Israeli fire has killed 796 Palestinians since Oct. 7, 2023, mostly in military raids on Palestinian cities and towns. Attacks by settlers on Palestinians and their property have also increased. Lebanon's state media says Israel carried out several attacks in the south BEIRUT — The Israeli army carried out several attacks in southern Lebanon on Friday, the third day of the ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel, Lebanon’s state media said. Artillery bombardment struck the villages of Markaba, Talusa and Khiyam while four Israeli tanks moved into the western part of Khiyam, the report said, adding that an Israeli tank fired at a house in Nabatiyeh province. Local media also reported that the Israeli army fired on civilians in the nearby village of Bint Jbeil. No casualties were immediately reported and The Associated Press was not immediately able to verify the claims. Israel's and Lebanon's armies did not comment on the alleged attacks. Lebanon politician calls on Hezbollah to work with Lebanese army BEIRUT — The leader of a leading Christian political party in Lebanon has called on Hezbollah to engage with the Lebanese army and devise a plan to dismantle its military infrastructure south and north of the Litani river. In a press conference Friday, Samir Geagea, head of the Lebanese Forces Party, criticized Hezbollah for opening a front with Israel and accused the Shiite militant group of committing a 'major crime' against the Lebanese people. 'We could have done without the martyrdom of more than 4,000 people, the displacement of thousands and the destruction across the country,' Geagea said. 'Despite all these tragedies, Hezbollah continues to talk about a victory using a bizarre and disconnected logic that has no basis in reality.' Geagea’s comments came two days after a U.S.-brokered ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel went into effect. More than 3,900 people have been killed in Lebanon since Israel's conflict with Hezbollah escalated. Geagea, whose Lebanese Forces Party holds the largest bloc in Lebanon’s 128-member parliament, also addressed Lebanon’s presidential deadlock. The country has been without a president for more than two years. Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri has scheduled a session for presidential elections in January. 'Consultations with opposition factions and our allies will begin in the coming days to explore the possibility of agreeing on presidential candidates and bringing them to parliament,' Geagea said. 2 children and a woman crushed to death outside Gaza bakery Two children and a 50-year-old woman were crushed to death Friday as a crowd of Palestinians pushed to get bread at a bakery in the central Gaza town of Deir al-Balah, medical officials said. The flow of food allowed into Gaza by Israel has fallen to nearly its lowest level of the almost 14-month-old war for the past two months, according to Israeli official figures. U.N. and aid officials say hunger and desperation are growing among Gaza’s population, almost all of which relies on humanitarian aid to survive. A doctor at Al-Aqsa Hospital confirmed that the three died from suffocation due to crowding at the al-Banna bakery in Deir al-Balah. Some bakeries in Gaza were closed for several days last week due to a shortage of flour. AP footage taken last week after they reopened showed large crowds of people cramming together, screaming and pushing, at one bakery in Deir al-Balah. Bags of bread now sell in the black market near bakeries for up to $17 each. Palestinians across the Gaza Strip are heavily relying on bakeries and charitable kitchens, with many able to only secure one meal a day for their families. Osama Abu Laban, the father of one of the girls killed Friday, wailed over the loss of her life outside the hospital. 'My wife fell when she heard that she (our daughter) was suffocating. She did not yet know that she was dead,' he told the AP. He added that he had also lost his son, father, uncle, and cousins, all in northern Gaza. Several women gathered inside the morgue to mourn their dead relatives, with one woman screaming 'they went to buy bread, they crushed them.' ___ Read more of the AP's coverage of the Middle East wars: https://apnews.com/hub/mideast-wars	https://apnews.com/article/israel-gaza-hamas-war-latest-29-november-2024-841bab5c3c9cbc1c0bc7f94b5d4cae56	2024-11-29T03:46:10-08:00	
Family returns to Lebanon to find a crater where their 50-year-old home once stood	BAALBEK, Lebanon (AP) — In eastern Lebanon's city of Baalbek, the Jawhari family gathered around a gaping crater where their home once stood, tears streaming as they tried to make sense of the destruction. 'It is heart-breaking. A heartache that there is no way we will ever recover from,' said Lina Jawhari, her voice breaking as she hugged relatives who came to support the family. 'Our world turned upside down in a second.' The home, which was a gathering place for generations, was reduced to rubble by an Israeli airstrike on Nov. 1, leaving behind shattered memories and twisted fragments of a once-vibrant life. The family, like thousands of Lebanese, were returning to check on their properties after the U.S.-mediated ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah went into effect early Wednesday. Intense Israeli airstrikes over the past two months leveled entire neighborhoods in eastern and southern Lebanon, as well as the southern suburbs of Beirut, which are predominantly Shiite areas of Lebanon where Hezbollah has a strong base of support. Nearly 1.2 million people have been displaced. The airstrikes have left a massive trail of destruction across the country. A photo of the Jawhari family's home — taken on a phone by Louay Mustafa, Lina’s nephew — is a visual reminder of what had been. As the family sifted through the rubble, each fragment recovered called them to gather around it. A worn letter sparked a collective cheer, while a photo of their late father triggered sobs. Reda Jawhari had built the house for his family and was a craftsman who left behind a legacy of metalwork. The sisters cried and hoped to find a piece of the mosque-church structure built by their father. Minutes later, they lifted a mangled piece of metal from the debris. They clung to it, determined to preserve a piece of his legacy. 'Different generations were raised with love... Our life was music, dance, dabke (traditional dance). This is what the house is made up of. And suddenly, they destroyed our world. Our world turned upside down in a second. It is inconceivable. It is inconceivable,' Lina said. Despite their determination, the pain of losing their home and the memories tied to it remains raw. Rouba Jawhari, one of four sisters, had one regret. 'We are sad that we did not take my mom and dad’s photos with us. If only we took the photos,' she said, clutching an ID card and a bag of photos and letters recovered from the rubble. 'It didn’t cross our mind. We thought it’s two weeks and we will be back.' The airstrike that obliterated the Jawhari home came without warning, striking at 1:30 p.m. on what was otherwise an ordinary Friday. Their neighbor, Ali Wehbe, also lost his home. He had stepped out for food a few minutes before the missile hit and rushed back to find his brother searching for him under the rubble. 'Every brick holds a memory,' he said, gesturing to what remained of his library. 'Under every book you would find a story.'	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-return-destroyed-family-home-e147e2ae416986cb75ae9fd00be347d0	2024-11-29T03:23:56-08:00	
Protesters in Serbia hold 15-minute blockade for 15 victims of roof collapse, demanding justice	BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Protesters in Serbia stood in silence for 15 minutes on Friday for the victims of a roof collapse four weeks ago in a northern city, seeking to keep up pressure on the populist authorities to punish those responsible for the tragedy. Traffic was blocked for a third week in a row at various spots in several Serbian cities and towns, including in the northern city of Novi Sad where the concrete outer roof at the central railway station smashed down on people on Nov. 1 without warning. Initially 14 people died and three were injured but one more person later died in hospital. The railway station building was renovated twice in recent years. Many in Serbia believe rampant corruption and opaque deals resulted in sloppy work during reconstruction and led to the collapse of the roof. Street protests and blockades have been held almost daily since the roof crash, demanding justice. Another rally is planned on Sunday in Novi Sad to mark one month since the tragedy. While prosecutors have announced the arrests of 13 people, a Serbian court this week released from detention former government construction minister Goran Vesic. This has fueled widespread skepticism of the ongoing investigation, as the populists control both the police and judiciary. Serbia's authoritarian President Aleksandar Vucic has accused the protesters of being bullies and thugs who used people's deaths for political gains. Scuffles have erupted both in Serbia's parliament and during some of the recent rallies when pro-government protesters showed up to break up the opposition-led blockades. Minor incidents were also reported during Friday's silent protest in Belgrade, the capital city. In Novi Sad, residents held a long black banner for the victims. Some people at the protests in other cities held white roses or posters with a red handprint, telling the authorities they have 'blood on their hands.' Opposition parties have repeatedly called for the resignation of Serbia’s prime minister and his government, as well as access to full documentation in the train station building and other infrastructure projects with Chinese state companies. The station in Novi Sad was originally built in 1964. Its renovation was part of a bigger project with China and Hungary to build a high-speed railway between Belgrade and Budapest.	https://apnews.com/article/serbia-roof-collapse-protest-novi-sad-station-76c599b237a4e3052039f0c3b1bfde2f	2024-11-29T03:21:37-08:00	
Thousands of workers march across Italy in general strike demanding better pay and services	MILAN (AP) — Thousands of teachers, health care workers, trash collectors and others walked off their jobs across Italy on Friday to protest a decline in spending power, persistently low salaries and government policies they say have weakened public services. Italy’s most powerful trade unions called the eight-hour strike and mobilized marches in cities across the country to target Premier Giorgia Meloni’s latest budget that they say penalizes schools, health care and other services. They also are pressing for a more equitable distribution of profits from private companies to workers. 'These protests don’t just speak to the government,’’ Maurizio Landini, head of the powerful CGIL conglomerate, told reporters in Bologna. 'They speak also to entrepreneurs, managers and businesses, who in these years have made profits like never before.' The strike forced ITA airlines to cancel dozens of domestic and international flights, and hit schools, hospitals and local transport. Unions called for an eight-hour strike but Transport Minister Matteo Salvini imposed an injunction limiting the strike in the transport sector to four hours. It was the first general strike since last November. Unions faced possible sanctions for involving the health care and justice sectors, which have staged strikes recently. The Italian railway, which also has been the target of recent labor actions, was exempted. Italy’s health care sector has been suffering staffing shortages that has forced the hiring of nurses from abroad, with care in the poorer south particularly lagging that in the more prosperous north. 'There are many people who go abroad because the salaries are too low,’’ said Anna Salsa, a member of the UIL health care union, at the demonstration in Rome. 'We are forced to do double shifts to give the minimal levels of essential care.' Protesters also cited persistent increases in the cost of basic necessities. Despite indications that inflation is cooling, the Codacons consumer protection lobby said that grocery costs for a family of four have risen by 238 euro ($251) a year in 2024 compared with last year, forcing many families to reduce their consumption. While starting salaries in Italy are aligned with the rest of Europe, pay increases do not keep pace, said Maurizio Del Conte, a labor law expert at Milan’s Bocconi University. As a result, Italy’s gross median salary of 35,000 euros (nearly $37,000) a year is at the low end of European averages, well behind its G7 partners in France and Germany. He noted that such protests are historically more influential when engaging center-left governments, which are friendly to unions, rather than conservative governments, such as Meloni's far-right-led government. ___ Paolo Santalucia contributed from Rome.	https://apnews.com/article/italy-labor-strike-services-meloni-budget-unions-0c14a99aba5e17f03bd4cb63dc6cb3f9	2024-11-29T03:07:17-08:00	
Senior figure with Scholz's ex-allies quits over 'D-Day' paper on German government collapse	BERLIN (AP) — A senior figure in the party whose departure from Chancellor Olaf Scholz's coalition three weeks ago put Germany on the road to an early election resigned Friday in a furor over an internal document discussing how the party could leave the government, a presentation whose title referred to 'D-Day.' Bijan Djir-Sarai of the pro-business Free Democrats said he was quitting as general secretary, the official responsible for day-to-day political strategy and election planning. He said he was 'taking the political responsibility in order to head off damage to my credibility and that of the Free Democrats.' The affair threatens to complicate further the Free Democrats' campaign for an election in which polls already suggest they risk falling short of the 5% support needed to keep any seats in parliament. Scholz fired Christian Lindner, the Free Democrats' leader, as finance minister on Nov. 6 as a long-running dispute in his three-party coalition over how to revitalize Germany's stagnant economy came to a head. The Free Democrats quit the government, leaving Scholz without a parliamentary majority. Scholz plans to call a confidence vote on Dec. 16. He is expected to lose, paving the way for an election on Feb. 23. Scholz and Lindner have traded blame for the collapse of the coalition, a combination of the chancellor's center-left Social Democrats, the environmentalist Greens and the Free Democrats that had long been notorious for infighting. After the coalition collapsed, German media reported on an internal strategy document which they said set out plans by the Free Democrats to end the government. On Nov. 18, Djir-Sarai denied that the term 'D-Day' — a reference to the Allied landings in France in 1944 that helped liberate Europe from Nazi Germany's rule — had been used. But on Thursday, the Free Democrats released what they said was a working document drawn up by a lower-level official on questions of how the party could communicate a possible departure from the government. It is headed 'D-Day process scenario and measures' and contains a reference to the 'beginning of the open battle' as one stage in the communication effort. That language drew criticism even from within the party. Djir-Sarai said in his brief resignation statement that he had not known of the internal document at the time of his denial and had unwittingly given false information. He apologized. The party said the paper was first drawn up on Oct. 24 and was last updated on Nov. 5, the version it released.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-election-free-democrats-resignation-dday-djirsarai-b85630b66301ba75b1017e11a777e848	2024-11-29T02:21:48-08:00	
Iran to begin enriching uranium with thousands of advanced centrifuges, UN watchdog says	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran will begin enriching uranium with thousands of advanced centrifuges at its two main nuclear facilities at Fordo and Natanz, the United Nations' nuclear watchdog said Friday, further raising tensions over Tehran's program as it enriches at near weapons-grade levels. The notice from the International Atomic Energy Agency only mentioned Iran enriching uranium with new centrifuges to 5% purity, far lower than the 60% it currently does — likely signaling that it still wants to negotiate with the West and the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump. However, it remains unclear how Trump will approach Iran once he enters office, particularly as it continues to threaten to attack Israel amid its war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip and just after a ceasefire started in its campaign in Lebanon. Trump withdrew America from the accord in 2018, setting in motion a series of attacks and incidents across the wider Mideast. Iran's mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment over the IAEA's report. Tehran had threatened to rapidly advance its program after the Board of Governors at the IAEA condemned Iran at a meeting in November for failing to cooperate fully with the agency. In a statement, the IAEA outlined the plans Iran informed it of, which include feeding uranium into multiple cascades of its advanced IR-2M, IR-4 and IR-6 centrifuges. Cascades are a group of centrifuges that spin uranium gas together to more quickly enrich the uranium. Each of these advanced classes of centrifuges enrich uranium faster than Iran’s baseline IR-1 centrifuges, which have been the workhorse of the country’s atomic program. The IAEA did not elaborate on how many machines would be in each cascade but Iran has put around 160 centrifuges into a single cascade in the past. It's unclear if Iran has begun feeding the uranium yet into the centrifuges. Tehran so far has been vague about its plans. But starting the enrichment at 5% gives Tehran both leverage at negotiations with the West and another way to dial up the pressure if they don't like what they hear. Weapons-grade levels of enrichment are around 90%. Since the collapse of Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers following the U.S.’ unilateral withdrawal from the accord in 2018, it has pursued nuclear enrichment just below weapons-grade levels. U.S. intelligence agencies and others assess that Iran has yet to begin a weapons program. Iran, as a signatory to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, has pledged to allow the IAEA to visit its atomic sites to ensure its program is peaceful. Tehran also had agreed to additional oversight from the IAEA as part of the 2015 nuclear deal, which saw sanctions lifted in exchange for drastically limiting its program. However, for years Iran has curtailed inspectors’ access to sites while also not fully answering questions about other sites where nuclear material has been found in the past after the deal's collapse. Iranian officials in recent months, including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian, had signaled a willingness to negotiate with the West. But Iran also has launched two attacks on Israel amid the war. Kazem Gharibabadi, an Iranian diplomat, said in a post on the social platform that he met with EU diplomat Enrique Mora, criticizing Europe as being 'self-centered' while having 'irresponsible behavior.' 'With regard to the nuclear issue of Iran, Europe has failed to be a serious player due to lack of self-confidence and responsibility,' Gharibabadi wrote. For his part, Mora described having a 'frank discussion' with Gharibabadi and another Iranian diplomat. Those talks included 'Iran’s military support to Russia that has to stop, the nuclear issue that needs a diplomatic solution, regional tensions (important to avoid further escalation from all sides) and human rights,' he wrote on X. ___ Associated Press writer Jamey Keaten in Geneva contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-nuclear-iaea-mideast-wars-israel-7450481f9e42ea5b786c5d672ec382a1	2024-11-29T02:15:51-08:00	
Inflation rose to 2.3% in Europe. That won't stop the central bank from cutting interest rates	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — Inflation in the 20 countries that use the euro currency rose in November — but that likely won’t stop the European Central Bank from cutting interest rates as the prospect of new U.S. tariffs from the incoming Trump administration adds to the gloom over weak growth. The European Union’s harmonized index of consumer prices stood up 2.3% in the year to November, up from 2.0% in October, the EU statistics agency Eurostat reported Friday. Energy prices fell 1.9% from a year ago, but that was offset by price increases of 3.9% in the services sector, a broad category including haircuts, medical treatment, hotels and restaurants, and sports and entertainment. Inflation has come down a long way from the peak of 10.6% in October 2022 as the ECB quickly raised rates to cool off price rises. It then started cutting them in June as worries about growth came into sharper focus. High central bank benchmark rates combat inflation by influencing borrowing costs throughout the economy. Higher rates make buying things on credit — whether a car, a house or a new factory — more expensive and thus reduce demand for goods and take pressure off prices. However, higher rates can also dampen growth. Growth worries got new emphasis after surveys of purchasing managers compiled by S&amp;P Global showed the eurozone economy was contracting in October. On top of that come concerns about how U.S. trade policy under incoming President Donald Trump, including possible new tariffs, or import taxes on imported goods, might affect Europe’s export-dependent economy. Trump takes office Jan. 20. The eurozone’s economic output is expected to grow 0.8% for all of this year and 1.3% next year, according to the European Commission’s most recent forecast. All that has meant the discussion about the Dec. 12 ECB meeting has focused not on whether the Frankfurt-based bank’s rate council will cut rates, but by how much. Market discussion has included the possibility of a larger than usual half-point cut in the benchmark rate, currently 3.25%. Inflation in Germany, the eurozone’s largest economy, held steady at 2.4%. That 'will strengthen opposition against a 50 basis point cut,' said Carsten Brzeski, global chief of macro at ING bank, using financial jargon for a half-percentage-point cut. The ECB sets interest rate policy for the European Union member countries that have joined the euro currency.	https://apnews.com/article/ecb-european-central-bank-eurozone-economy-inflation-d84aca91a80813ec3193e4df6d0bcac5	2024-11-29T01:41:05-08:00	
British lawmakers give initial approval to a bill to allow terminally ill adults to end their lives	LONDON (AP) — British lawmakers gave initial approval on Friday to a bill to help terminally ill adults end their lives in England and Wales, following an impassioned debate that saw people sharing personal stories of loss and suffering. Members of Parliament approved the assisted dying bill by a 330-275 vote, signaling their approval in principle for the bill, which will undergo further scrutiny before it goes to a final vote. Friday's vote came after hours of debate — emotional at times — that touched on issues of ethics, faith and law. There was no braying and shouting that often marks debates in the House of Commons and speeches were considered respectfully and heard in silence. 'Let’s be clear, we’re not talking about a choice between life or death, we are talking about giving dying people a choice about how to die,' the bill’s main sponsor, Kim Leadbeater, said as she presented the bill to a packed chamber. Supporters said the law would provide dignity to the dying and prevent suffering, while protecting the vulnerable. Opponents said the disabled and elderly were at risk of being coerced, directly or indirectly, to end their lives to save money or relieve the burden on family members. Others called for the improvement of palliative care to ease suffering as an alternative. The proposed bill would allow adults over the age of 18 who are expected to have fewer than six months to live to request and be provided help to end their life, subject to several safeguards. They would have to be capable of taking the fatal drugs themselves, and two independent doctors and a High Court judge will have to sign off on any decision. The bill will not apply to Scotland or Northern Ireland. Backers of the bill told heart-wrenching stories about constituents and family members who suffered in the final months of their lives and dying people who committed suicide in secret because it is currently a crime for anyone to provide assistance. Danny Kruger, who led the argument against the bill, cautioned lawmakers not to back a 'state suicide service.' He argued that no amount of safeguards will stop many vulnerable people feeling the pressure to make a request to end their lives. Kruger voiced his disappointment at the outcome but said there's a chance lawmakers will reject the bill when it comes back for a vote in the next few months. Some of those voting in favor said they only did so to examine the details further and could potentially vote against it in the future. 'I still think we can stop it,' he said. Although the bill was proposed by Leadbeater, a member of the ruling center-left Labour Party, it was an open vote with alliances formed across the political divide. The government is widely expected to come up in the next few months with assessments on how assisted dying will be funded and how it would impact the U.K.'s state-funded National Health Service, hospice care and the legal system. Prime Minister Keir Starmer did not show his hand ahead of the vote, but backed the change. Others in his Cabinet, including Health Secretary Wes Streeting and the Justice Minister Shabana Mahmood, voted against. There were similar divisions across other political parties. Long-time British campaigner Esther Rantzen, who is terminally ill with lung cancer and played a leading role in advocating the need for a vote on assisted dying, voiced her joy at the 'wonderful' outcome and said it will give people an 'equal choice.' When diagnosed with her terminal illness, Rantzen said she would travel to Switzerland to bring an end to her life, where the law allows assisted dying for non-residents. Hundreds of people on both sides of the issue gathered outside Parliament on a cold but bright day as the debate continued for nearly five hours. Opponents held signs saying, 'Kill the bill, not the ill,' and, referring to the National Health Service, 'NHS It's cradle to grave. Not 'til old, inconvenient or expensive!' The group Dignity in Dying, many wearing pink winter hats, led supporters as they clutched signs saying 'Giving me choice over my death,' and 'You can't cure death. Please make it fear free.' Backers of the measure erupted in cheers when the result was announced and hugged each other. 'It’s a relief, it’s history, finally we are getting towards having a society that shows love and compassion above the need to just keep people alive,' said Joshua Cook, 33, who has Huntington’s disease, an incurable neurodegenerative disease. Other countries that have legalized assisted suicide include Australia, Belgium, Canada and parts of the United States, with regulations on who is eligible varying by jurisdiction. Assisted suicide is different from euthanasia, allowed in the Netherlands and Canada, which involves health care practitioners administering a lethal injection at the patient's request in specific circumstances.	https://apnews.com/article/britain-assisted-dying-debate-legalizing-0bc2de13d41fe6d62753935e91dfb0f8	2024-11-29T01:20:57-08:00	
Syria insurgents push their advance toward 2nd largest city Aleppo	BEIRUT (AP) — Thousands of Syrian insurgents pushed on with their advances on government-held areas in the country’s northwest, reaching the outskirts of Syria’s second largest city Aleppo and wrestling control of several strategic towns and villages along the way, activists and fighters said Friday. Syria’s state media said projectiles from insurgents landed in the student accommodations at Aleppo's university, killing four people, including two students. Public transportation to the city has also been diverted from the main highway linking Aleppo to the capital Damascus to avoid clashes, state-controlled media reported. Fighters also advanced on the town of Saraqab, in northwestern Idlib province, a strategic area that would secure supply lines to Aleppo. This week's advances were one of the largest by opposition factions, led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, and comes after weeks of low simmering violence. It is most intense fighting in northwestern Syria since 2020, when government forces seized areas previously controlled by opposition fighters. Syria’s Armed Forces said the insurgents are violating a 2019 agreement that de-escalated fighting in the area, which has been the last remaining opposition stronghold for years. State media reported airstrikes on insurgents’ positions in Aleppo countryside. The insurgents reported that fighters have wrestled controlled of the Scientific Research Center neighborhood, on the western outskirts of Aleppo city. It is the closest the rebels have come to Aleppo city since they were ousted from its eastern side in 2016. Russia and Iran had helped Syrian government forces reclaim control of all of Aleppo that year, after a gruelling military campaign and a siege that lasted for weeks. The battle for Aleppo was a turning point in the war between Syrian government forces and rebel fighters since the 2011 protests against Bashar Assad’s rule turned into an all-out war. The war monitor Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said dozens of fighters from both sides have been killed in the battle that started Wednesday. The insurgents have seized control of more than 50 villages in their advance, which seem to have caught the government forces unprepared. Insurgents posted videos online showing they were using drones in their advance, a new weapon they had not had previously in the earlier stages of their confrontation with government forces. It was not clear to what extent the drones were used on the battleground. Aid groups said the fighting has displaced thousands of families, and forced some services to be suspended. The opposition fighters said their offensive will allow the return of thousands of displaced people who were forced to flee government bombardment in recent weeks. The offensive also came as Iran-linked groups, who had backed Syrian government forces since 2015, have been preoccupied with their own battle at home. Israel and Hezbollah, the lead group in the Iran-backed alliance, have been locked in a war that escalated since September. A cease-fire was announced Wednesday, the day the Syrian opposition factions announced their offensive. Israel has also escalated its attacks against Hezbollah and Iran-linked targets in Syria during the last 70 days. Russia, along with Iran, backed Syrian government forces soon after the anti-government protests in 2011 turned into a war. Turkey has backed an array of opposition forces and established military presence in parts of northwestern Syria. Meanwhile, the United States has supported Syrian Kurdish forces fighting Islamic State militants largely in the east of the country.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-attack-clashes-aleppo-9c07da6f83036f34d4b18a479de9d085	2024-11-29T01:20:34-08:00	
Amazon workers in India join Black Friday strike action for better wages and working conditions	NEW DELHI (AP) — Amazon staff in India have joined strike action calling for better wages and working conditions as the company prepares for one of the busiest shopping periods of the year . About 200 warehouse workers and delivery drivers rallied in the capital, New Delhi, under a ``Make Amazon Pay' banner. Some donned masks of Amazon chief Jeff Bezos and joined hands against the Seattle-based company’s practices. The walkout on Black Friday, which starts one of the biggest shopping weekends of the year, was repeated at Amazon warehouses in other countries as workers called for higher wages, better working conditions, and union rights. There was no immediate statement by Amazon India. 'Our basic salary is 10,000 rupees ($120), which should be at least 25,000 rupees ($295),' said Manish Kumar, 25, a warehouse worker who joined the New Dehli protest. 'And the environment there is to work under pressure,' he added. Nitesh Das, a union leader, said the workers took to the streets because they want the government to take up their cause. A statement from the Amazon India Workers Union said similar protests are planned in other parts of India as well as in other countries, including the United States, Germany, Japan, and Brazil. The demonstrations will call on Amazon to pay its workers fairly, respect their right to join unions, and commit to environmental sustainability, it said. The union said it would submit a memorandum highlighting its demands to India’s Labor Minister Mansukh Mandaviya. The gig economy has become huge in India due to its fast economic growth, but workers face low wages and difficult working conditions. India’s National Human Rights Commission sent a notice to Amazon in June 2023 after local media reports that workers were being made to work without breaks during the peak hot summer season. Amazon India denied the charge.	https://apnews.com/article/amazon-india-workers-strike-pay-protest-b039fb4b0ad7b2a2ca7639d62643b5e4	2024-11-29T01:04:29-08:00	
Malaysian billionaire tycoon Ananda Krishnan dies at age 86	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — Ananda Krishnan, one of Malaysia's richest tycoons with a vast business empire including telecommunications, media, petroleum and real estate, has died. He was 86. His investment holding company, Usaha Tegas, said he passed away peacefully on Thursday and that his family requested privacy. It didn't specify the cause of death. 'Ananda made significant contributions to nation-building and the corporate world. His philanthropic initiatives have touched many lives,' it said in a statement. Ananda was ranked Malaysia’s sixth-richest man by Forbes with a net worth of $5.1 billion (22.6 billion ringgit). Born April 1, 1983, Ananda was a graduate of Harvard Business School who started his career in oil trading before venturing into other sectors. He owned stakes in telecommunications firm Maxis, media company Astro, satellite services firm Measat and oil services provider Bumi Armada, among others. Local media reported that Ananda made most of his wealth during the 1980s and 1990s, making him closely associated with then-Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. He was a founding director of state oil firm Petronas, and the national Bernama news agency reported Friday that he sold the idea of building the 88-story Petronas Twin Towers to Mahathir. Ananda was instructed to lead its construction, transforming a horse racing track into the landmark and forever changing Kuala Lumpur's skyline. Ananda donated to education, the arts, sports and humanitarian causes in Malaysia. The Edge newspaper reported that his fortunes took a hit in 2018 when Indian authorities linked him to a high-profile corruption scandal involving high-ranking government officials. Although arrest warrants were issued in India for him and his former deputy, Ralph Marshall, neither was apprehended or extradited to face charges. Despite his success, Ananda avoided the limelight and shuttled between Malaysia and France, where he resided with his wife, local media reported. His only son is a Buddhist monk in Thailand. His two daughters are not involved in his businesses. Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim paid tribute to Ananda, saying his 'contribution in the corporate world, philanthropy and society will definitely be remembered.'	https://apnews.com/article/malaysia-tycoon-death-ananda-krishnan-obit-1cdae998436c19ab09dcc4e8e9be71c4	2024-11-29T00:14:39-08:00	
Negotiators get closer to agreeing on a plastic pollution treaty	BUSAN, South Korea (AP) — Negotiators working on a treaty to address the global crisis of plastic pollution inched closer to an agreement Friday, with more countries saying they want to address the total plastic on Earth. The most contentious issue of the talks is whether there will be a limit on the amount of plastic that companies are allowed to produce. Panama proposed text for the treaty to address plastic production on Thursday. Juan Carlos Monterrey, head of Panama's delegation, said it's a compromise proposal to build consensus because it does not include a numerical target or production cap. Instead, it says countries would adopt a global target at a later conference of the parties meeting. Support for Panama's proposal quickly grew to over 100 countries. Some plastic-producing and oil and gas countries, including Saudi Arabia, vigorously oppose including plastic production in the treaty, calling it a red line. Russia’s delegation has said if the world is serious about this treaty, negotiators must concentrate on provisions acceptable for all delegations. Luis Vayas Valdivieso, the committee chair from Ecuador, issued a paper on Friday with draft treaty text, condensing the views expressed by negotiators during the week. The treaty article on production has Panama's proposal. The other option is to strike that article. 'This is great! This is great,' Monterrey said as he read the document on his cellphone. 'It is a big show of force, of muscle, for those countries that are ambitious. And also this shows that consensus is still possible,' he said in an interview. Global plastics production is set to reach 736 million tons by 2040, up 70% from 2020, without policy changes, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Environmental organizations demonstrated with signs outside the convention center Friday morning, demanding that negotiators show courage. Many of those organizations want a treaty that addresses both the volume of production and chemicals of concern used in plastic products. The draft treaty text does not contain global, legally-binding controls on any of those chemicals. Countries that oppose such a provision, and plastics industry leaders, have said the treaty is not the proper venue to regulate chemicals. Fiji's delegation said it would not support a treaty without a provision on chemicals of concern. 'The world is watching. The world sees the divide in the room for what it is,' Sivendra Michael, Fiji's permanent secretary for environment and climate change, said at a press conference about the importance of production in the plastics treaty. 'The divide is between those, all of us here, looking to protect the people and the planet and those looking to protect the profits in the interests of the past and present industries.' Anthony Agotha, with the European Union delegation, said the 'time for freedom to pollute should be over.' Graham Forbes, head of the Greenpeace delegation, said the new paper is a 'weak attempt to force us to reach a conclusion and get a treaty for treaty’s sake,' with the only silver lining being the inclusion of a process for achieving a global target to reduce plastic production. Negotiators began meeting Monday in Busan. They split into groups to consider text for treaty articles. By the midpoint of the negotiations, none had agreed to anything. They were having long discussions over topics where there’s more agreement, such as the need to manage plastic waste better. And they hadn't settled on some of the basics of the treaty, such as the scope and definitions. Valdivieso told them Wednesday night their progress was too slow and they had to speed up significantly. The delegations will now discuss Valdivieso's paper and decide whether to agree to the articles. The meeting ends late Sunday or early Monday. U.N. Environment Program Executive Director Inger Andersen said there's still enough time to land an agreement, 'if we work hard.' ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Notre Dame Cathedral unveils its new interior 5 years after devastating fire	PARIS (AP) — After more than five years of frenetic reconstruction work, Notre Dame Cathedral showed its new self to the world Friday, with rebuilt soaring ceilings and creamy good-as-new stonework erasing somber memories of its devastating fire in 2019. Images broadcast live of a site visit by French President Emmanuel Macron showed the inside of the iconic cathedral as worshippers might have experienced it back in medieval times, its wide, open spaces filled with bright light on a crisp and sunny winter’s day that lit up the vibrant colors of the stained-glass windows. Gaping holes that the blaze tore into the vaulted ceilings, leaving charred piles of debris, are gone, now filled in with new stonework. Delicate golden angels look on from the centerpiece of one of the rebuilt ceilings. The cathedral's limestone walls look brand new, cleaned not only of dust from the fire but also of grime that had accumulated for years. The cathedral attracted millions of worshippers and visitors annually before the blaze. Powerful vacuum cleaners were used to first remove toxic dust released when the fire melted the cathedral's lead roofs. Fine layers of latex were then sprayed onto the surfaces and removed a few days later, taking dirt away with them. Macron entered via the cathedral’s giant and intricately carved front doors and stared up at the ceilings in wonder. He was accompanied by his wife, Brigitte, the archbishop of Paris and others. Their visit kicks off a series of events ushering in the reopening of the 12th-century Gothic masterpiece. Macron will return on Dec. 7 to deliver an address and attend the consecration of the new altar during a solemn Mass the following day. Macron's administration is hailing the reconstruction as a symbol of national unity and French can-do.	https://apnews.com/article/paris-notre-dame-macron-fire-reconstruction-0a6c183693b55a55e0dc3a909000cb02	2024-11-28T23:41:55-08:00	
Georgian protesters and police clash after prime minister suspends talks on joining the EU	TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — Police and protesters brutally clashed in Georgia after the country's ruling party suspended negotiations to join the European Union until 2028. Police used water cannons, pepper spray and tear gas late Thursday to disperse protesters who took to the streets following the announcement by Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze of the ruling Georgian Dream party. Georgian Dream claimed victory in last month's parliamentary election that the opposition in the South Caucasus nation dismissed as fraudulent and that has been condemned by European officials. The election on Oct. 26 was widely seen as a referendum on the country’s aspirations to join the European Union and the ruling party had indicated to voters that it would continue to seek membership of the bloc. The interior ministry said it detained 43 people during the protests. President Salome Zourabichvili said the government declared 'war' on its own people and confronted riot police at the protest, asking them whether they served Russia or Georgia. The Georgian president, who has a largely ceremonial role, previously said the ruling party rigged the election with the help of Russia, which previously ruled Georgia from Moscow when it was part of the Soviet Union. She said the decision to suspend EU membership marked the 'conclusion of the constitutional coup which has been unfolding for several weeks.' The government's announcement that it was suspending negotiations to join the EU came hours after the European Parliament adopted a resolution that condemned last month’s vote as neither free nor fair, representing yet another manifestation of the continued democratic backsliding 'for which the ruling Georgian Dream party is fully responsible.' European election observers said October's vote took place in a divisive atmosphere marked by instances of bribery, double voting and physical violence. The EU granted Georgia candidate status in December 2023 on condition that it meet the bloc’s recommendations, but put its accession on hold and cut financial support earlier this year after the passage of a 'foreign influence' law widely seen as a blow to democratic freedoms. EU lawmakers urged a rerun of the parliamentary vote within a year under thorough international supervision and by an independent election administration. They also called on the EU to impose sanctions and limit formal contacts with the Georgian government. The Georgian prime minister fired back, denouncing what he described as a 'cascade of insults' from the EU politicians and declaring that 'the ill-wishers of our country have turned the European Parliament into a blunt weapon of blackmail against Georgia, which is a great disgrace for the European Union.' 'We will continue on our path toward the European Union; however, we will not allow anyone to keep us in a constant state of blackmail and manipulation, which is utterly disrespectful to our country and society,' Kobakhidze said. 'We must clearly show certain European politicians and bureaucrats, who are completely devoid of European values, that they must speak to Georgia with dignity, not through blackmail and insults.' Kobakhidze also said Georgia would reject any budgetary grants from the EU until the end of 2028. Critics have accused Georgian Dream — established by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia — of becoming increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow. The party recently pushed through laws similar to those used by the Kremlin to crack down on freedom of speech and LGBTQ+ rights. The EU suspended Georgia’s membership application process indefinitely in June, after parliament passed a law requiring organizations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as 'pursuing the interest of a foreign power,' similar to a Russian law used to discredit organizations critical of the government.	https://apnews.com/article/georgia-cabinet-election-russia-european-union-kobakhidze-9f6e6f274e61fea2c50bfaba0850f004	2024-11-28T22:50:22-08:00	
Ukrainian energy workers carry out repairs despite Russia's pounding of the country's power grid	On a bright winter day, workers at a Ukrainian thermal power plant repair its heavily damaged equipment as drops of water from melted snow leak through gaping holes in its battered roof. Several weeks earlier, the facility was targeted by a Russian air attack that left scorch marks, shrapnel scars on the walls, and missile fragments scattered across the production floor. 'This is our life now. Workers at a thermal power plant that’s supposed to produce electricity are walking on frozen floors and using firewood to keep warm,' Oleksandr, 52, head of the Production Management Department, told The Associated Press. He spoke on condition that only his first name be used citing security concerns. Repeated Russian strikes on infrastructure have seriously impacted Ukraine's energy sector often resulting in rolling blackouts across the country. On Thursday, Moscow launched another large-scale air attack. Ukrainian authorities said nearly 200 drones and missiles targeted infrastructure, d isrupting power supply to more than a million people. The scale of the ongoing work to fix the sector is huge. Since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, th e G7 and other allied countries have allocated more than $4 billion in energy assistance to Ukraine, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in September. Oleksandr, who works at the power plant operated by Ukraine’s largest private energy company, DTEK, says since the station was first attacked in November 2022, it has been unable to return to full capacity due to continuous strikes that have left critical equipment in ruins. The exact location of the plant visited by the AP, details on the damage and even workers’ last names cannot be disclosed for fear this information could help Russia coordinate future attacks. DTEK operated around 20% of Ukraine’s electricity production before the full-scale invasion, but this figure dropped to 12% since the war broke out. The company says its facilities have been attacked by Russia almost 200 times since 2022. They also say nearly 90% of the company’s infrastructure was destroyed or suffered damage and that was before Russia launched its large-scale attack on Nov 17. Oleksandr says he expects repairs at the station to continue through the winter into next year, and potentially far beyond. Repair efforts at the plant are further complicated by the fact that some critical equipment was manufactured in the Soviet Union and finding parts is now difficult. To mitigate this, some former Soviet countries who are now Ukraine’s allies have helped supply equipment. 'Potentially, Western countries could also help us with equipment, but their power grids have different characteristics,' Oleksandr said. Only half of DTEK’s generating capacities have been restored since the first attacks on its plants in November 2022 until the latest large-scale strike. Earlier this week, the European Commission and the U.S. government a nnounced a donation of $112 million in equipment and construction materials to help DTEK prepare for the winter. With the war in its third year, staff at DTEK’s plant have adapted to the grim reality of their day-to-day existence. They know the protocols by heart. Not everyone can take shelter during an air alert. A minimal crew must remain in the control room to oversee operations, putting themselves at risk of a direct strike. 'You have to sit and wait while monitoring the trajectories of whatever was fired, but the power units keep working so we cannot just leave, we stay in the control room,' said Dmytro, 41, a power unit operator at the plant. Despite the challenges, Dmytro and his colleagues press on, driven by a mission to keep the lights on in their town and region over the winter months. 'Who’ll do it, if not us? I also have family waiting for me at home, but if we all leave and the equipment breaks down, the responsibility will be on our shoulders, the entire city will lose electricity and heating,' he said. 'Some are risking (their lives) at the frontline, while we here have our own energy front.'	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-energy-power-plant-repairs-3490e01e850bd4d1b07d3ae190b6f91c	2024-11-28T22:09:54-08:00	
Ireland votes in a close-run election where incumbents hope to cling on to power	DUBLIN (AP) — Ireland is voting Friday in a parliamentary election that will decide the next government — and will show whether Ireland bucks the global trend of incumbents being ousted by disgruntled voters after years of pandemic, international instability and a cost-of-living pressures. Polls opened at 7 a.m.. (0700GMT), and Ireland’s 3.8 million voters are selecting 174 lawmakers to sit in the Dail, the lower house of parliament. Here’s a look at the parties, the issues and the likely outcome. Who’s running? The outgoing government was led by the two parties who have dominated Irish politics for the past century: Fine Gael and Fianna Fail. They have similar center-right policies but are longtime rivals with origins on opposing sides of Ireland’s 1920s civil war. After the 2020 election ended in a virtual dead heat they formed a coalition, agreeing to share Cabinet posts and take turns as taoiseach, or prime minister. Fianna Fail leader Micheál Martin served as premier for the first half of the term and was replaced by Fine Gael’s Leo Varadkar in December 2022. Varadkar unexpectedly stepped down in March, passing the job to current Taoiseach Simon Harris. Opposition party Sinn Fein achieved a stunning breakthrough in the 2020 election, topping the popular vote, but was shut out of government because Fianna Fail and Fine Gael refused to work with it, citing its leftist policies and historic ties with militant group the Irish Republican Army during three decades of violence in Northern Ireland. Under Ireland’s system of proportional representation, each of the 43 constituencies elects multiple lawmakers, with voters ranking their preferences. That makes it relatively easy for smaller parties and independent candidates with a strong local following to gain seats. This election includes a large crop of independent candidates, ranging from local campaigners to far-right activists and reputed crime boss Gerry 'the Monk' Hutch. What are the main issues? As in many other countries, the cost of living — especially housing — has dominated the campaign. Ireland has an acute housing shortage, the legacy of failing to build enough new homes during the country’s 'Celtic Tiger' boom years and the economic slump that followed the 2008 global financial crisis. 'There was not building during the crisis, and when the crisis receded, offices and hotels were built first,' said John-Mark McCafferty, chief executive of housing and homelessness charity Threshold. The result is soaring house prices, rising rents and growing homelessness. After a decade of economic growth, McCafferty said 'Ireland has resources' — not least 13 billion euros ($13.6 billion) in back taxes the European Union has ordered Apple to pay it — 'but it is trying to address big historic infrastructural deficits.' Tangled up with the housing issue is immigration, a fairly recent challenge to a country long defined by emigration. Recent arrivals include more than 100,000 Ukrainians displaced by war and thousands of people fleeing poverty and conflict in the Middle East and Africa. This country of 5.4 million has struggled to house all the asylum-seekers, leading to tent camps and makeshift accommodation centers that have attracted tension and protests. A stabbing attack on children outside a Dublin school a year ago, in which an Algerian man has been charged, sparked the worst rioting Ireland had seen in decades. Unlike many European countries, Ireland does not have a significant far-right party, but far-right voices on social media seek to drum up hostility to migrants, and anti-immigrant independent candidates are hoping for election in several districts. The issue appears to be hitting support for Sinn Fein, as working-class supporters bristled at its pro-immigration policies. What’s the likely outcome? Opinion polls suggest voters’ support is split into five roughly even chunks — for Fine Gael, Fianna Fail, Sinn Fein, several smaller parties and an assortment of independents. Fine Gael has run a gaffe-prone campaign, Fianna Fail has remained steady in the polls and Sinn Fein says it has momentum, but is unlikely to win power unless the other parties drop their opposition to working with it. Analysts say the most likely outcome is another Fine Gael-Fianna Fail coalition, possibly with a smaller party or a clutch of independents as kingmakers. 'It’s just a question of which minor group is going to be the group that supports the government this time,' said Eoin O’Malley, a political scientist at Dublin City University. 'Coalition-forming is about putting a hue on what is essentially the same middle-of-the-road government every time.' When will we know the results? Polls close Friday at 10 p.m. (2200GMT), when an exit poll will give the first hints about the result. Counting ballots begins on Saturday morning. Full results could take several days, and forming a government days or weeks after that. Harris, who cast his vote in Delgany, south of Dublin, said Irish voters and politicians have 'got a long few days ahead of us.' 'Isn’t it the beauty and the complexity of our system that when the clock strikes 10 o’clock tonight, there’ll be an exit poll but that won’t even tell us the outcome of the election,' he said. ___ Lawless reported from London	https://apnews.com/article/ireland-election-fianna-fail-fine-gael-sinn-fein-987733afb259859d88c84ebb60203b09	2024-11-28T22:07:24-08:00	
China criticizes Taiwanese president's plan to stop in Hawaii and Guam during trip to South Pacific	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te will stop over in Hawaii and Guam during his trip to the South Pacific, drawing criticism from China. Lai is to leave Taiwan on Saturday on a weeklong trip to visit the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu and Palau — three diplomatic allies of the self-governed island. Asked by the AP, Lai's office on Friday confirmed reports that he would make stopovers in the U.S. state of Hawaii and the U.S. territory of Guam. Under pressure from China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory, the island has just 12 formal diplomatic allies. However, it retains strong contacts with dozens of other nations, including the U.S., its main source of diplomatic and military support. Lai's planned stopovers drew criticism from Beijing. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said if the U.S. wants to maintain peace in the Taiwan Strait, it is important for it to handle the Taiwan issue 'with utmost caution, clearly opposing Taiwan independence and supporting China’s peaceful reunification.' Mao said China firmly opposes any form of official interaction between the U.S. and Taiwan, and visits by Taiwan's leaders to the U.S. for any reason. When his predecessor, Tsai Ing-wen, began a stopover in the U.S. on her way to Central America last year, China said it was closely watching and would 'resolutely safeguard our sovereignty and territorial integrity.' The Chinese military also launched drills around Taiwan last year as a 'stern warning' over what it called collusion between 'separatists and foreign forces' days after Lai, then Taiwan's vice president, stopped over in the U.S. China objects strongly to such U.S. stopovers by Taiwan’s leaders, as well as visits to the island by leading American politicians, terming them violations of the U.S. commitment not to afford diplomatic status to Taiwan after Washington switched its formal recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979. With the number of its diplomatic partners declining under Chinese pressure, Taiwan has redoubled efforts to participate in international forums, even from the sidelines.	https://apnews.com/article/taiwan-president-lai-hawaii-guam-c4f9f004912656fe2e7b823cd155eaa3	2024-11-28T21:32:08-08:00	
3 dead, over 80,000 displaced as Malaysia prepares for worst floods in a decade	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — Malaysia prepared on Friday for its worst floods in a decade after heavier-than-expected monsoon rains caused severe flooding that killed three people and displaced more than 80,000. The National Disaster Command Center online portal said Friday that 84,597 people, from more than 25,000 families, across seven states were evacuated to 488 temporary shelters. The northeastern state of Kelantan, bordering Thailand, was the worst affected with 56,029 people evacuated from their homes followed by neighboring Terengganu with 21,264. Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said Thursday that floods this year were expected to the worse than 2014, when more than 250,000 people were displaced and 21 killed. He was quoted by local media as saying that weather forecast indicated that heavy rainfall next month would likely affect more states. He was quoted by New Straits Times as saying that government agencies were prepared to tackle the disaster. Nearly 83,000 personnel and thousands of rescue boats, four-wheel vehicles and life jackets as well as 31 helicopters are ready, he said. The government has also identified 8,481 temporary evacuation centers nationwide that can accommodate over two million people, he said. 'Given the severity of the situation, all parties have been mobilized to ensure the safety and welfare of flood victims,' he was quoted as saying by national Bernama news agency. Floods are common in parts of Malaysia during the annual monsoon season, that starts in November and could last until March. The Meteorological Department has said the country can expect between five and seven episodes of heavy rainfall during this period.	https://apnews.com/article/malaysia-floods-monsoon-rains-08532d729eb70026e968b1ee34b029c6	2024-11-28T21:28:27-08:00	
Russian defense minister visits North Korea for talks with military and political leaders	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov arrived in North Korea on Friday for talks with North Korean military and political leaders as the countries deepen their cooperation over Russia’s war in Ukraine. In announcing the visit, Russia’s Defense Ministry didn’t say whom Belousov would meet or the purpose of the talks. North Korean state media didn’t immediately confirm the visit. Belousov, a former economist, replaced Sergei Shoigu as defense minister in May after Russian President Vladimir Putin started a fifth term in power. Photos released by the Defense Ministry showed Belousov walking alongside North Korean Defense Minister No Kwang Chol on a red carpet at a Pyongyang airport. North Korean military officials were seen clapping under a banner that read, 'Complete support and solidarity with the fighting Russian army and people.' Belousov noted after his arrival that military cooperation between the countries is expanding. He applauded a strategic partnership agreement signed by Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un following their June meeting in Pyongyang, which he said is aimed at reducing tensions by maintaining a 'balance of power' in the region and lowering the risk of war, including with nuclear weapons. The June meeting demonstrated the 'highest level of mutual trust' between the leaders, Belousov said, and 'also the mutual desire of our countries to further expand mutually beneficial cooperation in a complex international environment.' North Korean Defense Minister No also praised the expanding cooperation between the countries’ militaries and reiterated North Korea’s support for Russia’s war in Ukraine, describing it as a 'just struggle to protect the country’s sovereign rights and security interests.' The visit comes days after South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol met with a Ukrainian delegation led by Defense Minister Rustem Umerov in the South Korean capital, Seoul, and called for the two countries to formulate countermeasures in response to North Korea’s dispatch of thousands of troops to Russia to help its fight against Ukraine. Kim in recent months has prioritized relations with Russia as he tries to break out of isolation and strengthen his international footing, embracing the idea of a 'new Cold War.' The United States and its allies have said North Korea has sent more than 10,000 soldiers to Russia in recent weeks and that some of those troops were engaging in combat. North Korea has also been accused of supplying artillery systems, missiles and other military equipment to Russia that may help Putin further extend an almost three-year war. There are also concerns in Seoul that North Korea, in exchange for its troops and arms supplies, could receive Russian technology transfers that could improve its nuclear weapons and missile programs. 'The Russian defense minister doesn’t visit North Korea just to celebrate bilateral ties,' said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul. 'This visit indicates Putin and Kim’s military cooperation in violation of international law is about to increase further.' Yoon’s national security adviser, Shin Wonsik, said in a TV interview last week that Seoul believes that Russia has provided air defense missile systems to North Korea in exchange for sending its troops. Shin said Russia also appears to have given economic assistance to North Korea and various military technologies, including those needed for the North’s efforts to build a reliable space-based surveillance system, which Kim has stressed is crucial for enhancing the threat of nuclear-capable missiles targeting South Korea. Shin didn’t say whether Russia has already transferred sensitive nuclear weapons and ballistic missile technologies to North Korea. Yoon’s office hasn’t said whether the two governments discussed the possibility of South Korea supplying weapons to Ukraine in his talks with Umerov. Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, South Korea has joined U.S.-led sanctions against Moscow and provided humanitarian and financial support to Kyiv. But it has avoided directly supplying arms, citing a longstanding policy of not giving lethal weapons to countries actively engaged in conflicts. Yoon has said his government will take phased countermeasures, linking the level of its response to the degree of Russian-North Korean cooperation. It wasn’t immediately clear whether Belousov will meet with Kim, the North Korean leader. Last year, Kim hosted a Russian delegation led by then-Defense Minister Shoigu and gave him a personal tour of a North Korean arms exhibition, in what outside critics likened to a sales pitch. That event came weeks before Kim traveled to Russia for talks with Putin which sped up military cooperation between the countries. During another meeting in Pyongyang in June this year, Kim and Putin signed a pact stipulating mutual military assistance if either country is attacked, in what was considered the two countries’ biggest defense deal since the end of the Cold War. The Russian report about Belousov’s visit came as South Korea scrambled fighter jets to repel six Russian and five Chinese warplanes that temporarily entered the country’s air defense identification zone around its eastern and southern seas, according to the South’s Joint Chiefs of Staff. It said the Russian and Chinese planes did not breach South Korea’s territorial airspace. South Korea’s Defense Ministry said it held telephone calls with Chinese and Russian defense attaches based in Seoul to protest the flights and urge the countries to prevent recurrences. ___ Associated Press writer Emma Burrows in London contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-russia-defense-minister-andrei-belousov-ukraine-5c0f784ef56ab68482113dfe5419b962	2024-11-28T21:24:40-08:00	
Stripped of citizenship, these Nicaraguans live in limbo scattered across the world	GUATEMALA CITY (AP) — Sergio Mena's life dissolved in hours. After years resisting President Daniel Ortega, the rural activist fled Nicaragua in 2018, joining thousands of protesters fleeing a yearslong crackdown on dissent. Mena returned from exile in neighboring Costa Rica in 2021 to continue protesting, only to be thrown in a prison where he said jailers hung prisoners by their feet and shocked them with electricity. 'We were tortured all the time, physically and psychologically, from the moment we arrived until the very last day,' said Mena, 40. Now in exile in Guatemala, Mena may be out of prison but he's far from free. Upon their release, he and hundreds of religious leaders, students, activists, dissidents and journalists were rendered 'stateless' – stripped of their citizenship, homes and government pensions. The United Nations says that they’re among 4.4 million stateless people worldwide who struggle to find jobs, education and healthcare or even open bank accounts or marry without valid ID documents. 'Statelessness is torture,' said Karina Ambartsoumian-Clough executive director of United Stateless, a U.S.-based organization advocating for the stateless. 'You just legally cease to exist, even if you’re here physically as a human.' Free but unfree In September, Ortega’s government loaded Mena and 134 other prisoners onto the flight that took them to Guatemala. They joined 317 others whom the government has deemed adversaries who no longer deserve legal Nicaraguan identities. The Associated Press spoke to more than 24 Nicaraguan exiles who have been stripped of their citizenship and are trying to chart paths forward. They're scattered across the United States, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Mexico and Spain in limbo as they struggle to recover from physical and psychological trauma, extending the torture many suffered in Nicaragua. The Ortega government did not respond to a request for comment by the AP. The agony of statelessness The majority of stateless people worldwide are born to refugees and migrants in countries that don't offer birthright citizenship, the right to become a citizen if you're born within a country's territory. Many Nicaraguans struggle to scrape together enough money to feed themselves. Others hide away in fear that the Nicaraguan government will someday come for them. Many more reel from watching their lives go up in smoke. For those stranded in the U.S. or seeking respite there, President-elect Donald Trump’s promises to crack down on immigration and asylum have added more uncertainty. Intensifying repression Ortega's government began stripping people of their citizenship early last year. It was in that crackdown that Mena, the member of a rural activist movement, said he was imprisoned. The government claimed that he had participated in drug trafficking and organized crime, which he denies. In February 2023, the government broke international law when it began sending prisoners to the U.S and most recently to Guatemala. Others in exile were stripped of their citizenship without ever having been jailed. Torment beyond borders The Nicaraguan government has not explained why it released Mena and other people from prison, although experts have speculated about the desire to duck international criticism and the costs involved while continuing to maintain a grip on enemies. Mena lives in a hotel in Guatemala City, where he flips through photos of a crumbling jail, scraps of food and his bruised, beaten body – indelible memories of more than two years in prison. His life is painted by constant fear. 'The tentacles of (the Nicaraguan government) still reach here,' he said with tears in his eyes. The Biden administration has offered the Nicaraguans temporary protections and Mena hopes the U.S. government will grant him asylum, but such protections are likely to vanish or be severely restricted under Trump. The Spanish government has offered to provide nationality to some of the stateless exiles, but few have the resources needed to build a new life in Spain, or are confused about the process. Stateless struggle Allan Bermudez, 54, was a university professor in Nicaragua. He was imprisoned after accusations that he was conspiring against the government as Ortega identified universities as hotbeds for antigovernment protests. In February 2023, he was among 222 prisoners loaded onto a flight to the United States with no idea where they were going. While the U.S. government provided Bermudez and others with temporary support, a few days at a hotel, a new phone, $400 and limited access to aid from a group of NGOs, help has since dried up. Today, Bermudez, who has multiple advanced degrees, works at a Dunkin’ Donuts on the fringes of Salisbury, Maryland, struggling to pick up hours. He rents a small room, suffers from chronic heart problems and post-traumatic stress disorder, and has no medical care. 'I haven’t bought my medicine, because if I do, I’ll have nothing to eat,' he said. Back in Nicaragua, his mother had stroke this year. He's struggled to send money home. With his daughter and wife also back home, he’s plagued with anxiety and depression. He applied for asylum in February after living in the U.S. under humanitarian parole offered by the Biden administration, but said he hasn’t heard back. He's put all his hopes into building a life in the U.S. and doesn’t know what he’ll do if asylum doesn't come through. 'I can’t leave, I have my hands tied,' he said. 'All I can do is pray that God helps me.' Lives upended Like Bermudez, hundreds of thousands have fled Nicaragua. Thousands of civil society organizations have been shuttered, their assets seized as the government seeks to silence any dissent. While many of the Nicaraguan exiles hope to one day return to their country, 82-year-old Moises Hassan has given up hope as he hides away in a town in the mountains of Costa Rica. Hassan was once a guerrilla fighter against the Anastasio Somoza dictatorship and then, alongside Ortega, a member of the junta that succeeded it. He built a family and a home with thousands of books, and planned to live out the rest of his days there. He was elected mayor of the capital, Managua, but saw his life and hopes sour when he began to criticize Ortega's anti-democratic moves. He fled the country in 2021. While on a trip to visit his daughter he heard the government was detaining critics, and knew they would come for him. It was no surprise when his name appeared on a list of people who were stripped of their citizenship and home and called traitors. 'The message is ... 'Don't think that just because you're out of the country that you're out of our reach,'' he said. But he said that with his pension seized along with his belongings, it has been a shock to depend on money from his children. He and his wife remain in their corner of Costa Rica, too scared to even go to the capital, where they worry Ortega's agents could track them down. 'I feel like I'm under house arrest,' he said, cradling his worn, now useless Nicaraguan passport. 'I'm a prisoner in my own home.' —— Janetsky reported from Costa Rica and Mexico City.

Desertion threatens to starve Ukraine's forces at a crucial time in its war with Russia	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Desertion is starving the Ukrainian army of desperately needed manpower and crippling its battle plans at a crucial time in its war with Russia, which could put Kyiv at a clear disadvantage in future ceasefire talks. Facing every imaginable shortage, tens of thousands of Ukrainian troops, tired and bereft, have walked away from combat and front-line positions to slide into anonymity, according to soldiers, lawyers and Ukrainian officials. Entire units have abandoned their posts, leaving defensive lines vulnerable and accelerating territorial losses, according to military commanders and soldiers. Some take medical leave and never return, haunted by the traumas of war and demoralized by bleak prospects for victory. Others clash with commanders and refuse to carry out orders, sometimes in the middle of firefights. 'This problem is critical,' said Oleksandr Kovalenko, a Kyiv-based military analyst. 'This is the third year of war, and this problem will only grow.' Although Moscow has also been dealing with desertions, Ukrainians going AWOL have laid bare deeply rooted problems bedeviling their military and how Kyiv is managing the war, from the flawed mobilization drive to the overstretching and hollowing out of front-line units. It comes as the U.S. urges Ukraine to draft more troops, and allow for the conscription of those as young as 18. The Associated Press spoke to two deserters, three lawyers, and a dozen Ukrainian officials and military commanders. Officials and commanders spoke on condition of anonymity to divulge classified information, while one deserter did so because he feared prosecution. 'It is clear that now, frankly speaking, we have already squeezed the maximum out of our people,' said an officer with the 72nd Brigade, who noted that desertion was one of the main reasons Ukraine lost the town of Vuhledar in October. The troops who walk away More than 100,000 soldiers have been charged under Ukraine’s desertion laws since Russia invaded in February 2022, according to the country’s General Prosecutor’s Office. Nearly half have gone AWOL in the last year alone, after Kyiv launched an aggressive and controversial mobilization drive that government officials and military commanders concede has largely failed. It's a staggeringly high number by any measure, as there were an estimated 300,000 Ukrainian soldiers engaged in combat before the mobilization drive began. And the actual number of deserters may be much higher. One lawmaker with knowledge of military matters estimated it could be as high as 200,000. Many deserters don't return after being granted medical leave. Bone-tired by the constancy of war, they are psychologically and emotionally scarred. They feel guilt about being unable to summon the will to fight, anger over how the war effort is being led, and frustration that it seems unwinnable. 'Being quiet about a huge problem only harms our country,' said Serhii Hnezdilov, one of few soldiers to speak publicly about his choice to desert. He was charged shortly after the AP interviewed him in September. Another deserter said he initially left his infantry unit with permission because he needed surgery. By the time his leave was up, he couldn’t bring himself to return. He still has nightmares about the comrades he saw get killed. 'The best way to explain it is imagining you are sitting under incoming fire and from their (Russian) side, it’s 50 shells coming toward you, while from our side, it’s just one. Then you see how your friends are getting torn to pieces, and you realize that any second, it can happen to you,' he said. 'Meanwhile guys (Ukrainian soldiers) 10 kilometers (6 miles) away order you on the radio: ‘Go on, brace yourselves. Everything will be fine,’' he said. Hnezdilov also left to seek medical help. Before undergoing surgery, he announced he was deserting. He said after five years of military service, he saw no hope of ever being demobilized, despite earlier promises by the country’s leadership. 'If there’s no end term (to military service), it turns into a prison – it becomes psychologically hard to find reasons to defend this country,' Hnezdilov said. A growing problem for Kyiv Desertion has turned battle plans into sand that slips through military commanders' fingertips. The AP learned of cases in which defensive lines were severely compromised because entire units defied orders and abandoned their positions. 'Because of a lack of political will and poor management of troops, especially in the infantry, we certainly are not moving in a direction to properly defend the territories that we control now,' Hnezdilov said. Ukraine’s military recorded a deficit of 4,000 troops on the front in September owing largely to deaths, injuries and desertions, according to a lawmaker. Most deserters were among recent recruits. The head of one brigade’s legal service who is in charge of processing desertion cases and forwarding them to law enforcement said he's had many of them. 'The main thing is that they leave combat positions during hostilities and their comrades die because of it. We had several situations when units fled, small or large. They exposed their flanks, and the enemy came to these flanks and killed their brothers in arms, because those who stood on the positions did not know that there was no one else around,' the official said. That is how Vuhledar, a hilltop town that Ukraine defended for two years, was lost in a matter of weeks in October, said the 72nd Brigade officer, who was among the very last to withdraw. The 72nd was already stretched thin in the weeks before Vuhledar fell. Only one line battalion and two rifle battalions held the town near the end, and military leaders even began pulling units from them to support the flanks, the officer said. There should have been 120 men in each of the battalion’s companies, but some companies' ranks dropped to only 10 due to deaths, injuries and desertions, he said. About 20% of the soldiers missing from those companies had gone AWOL. 'The percentage has grown exponentially every month,' he added. Reinforcements were sent once Russia wised up to Ukraine's weakened position and attacked. But then the reinforcements also left, the officer said. Because of this, when one of the 72nd Brigade battalions withdrew, its members were gunned down because they didn't know no one was covering them, he said. Still, the officer harbors no ill will toward deserters. 'At this stage, I do not condemn any of the soldiers from my battalion and others. … Because everyone is just really tired,' he said. Charging deserters Prosecutors and the military would rather not press charges against AWOL soldiers and do so only if they fail to persuade them to return, according to three military officers and a spokesperson for Ukraine’s State Investigative Bureau. Some deserters return, only to leave again. Ukraine's General Staff said soldiers are given psychological support, but it didn't respond to emailed questions about the toll desertions are having on the battlefield. Once soldiers are charged, defending them is tricky, said two lawyers who take such cases. They focus on their clients' psychological state when they left. 'People cannot psychologically cope with the situation they are in, and they are not provided with psychological help,' said attorney Tetyana Ivanova. Soldiers acquitted of desertion due to psychological reasons set a dangerous precedent because 'then almost everyone is justified (to leave), because there are almost no healthy people left (in the infantry),' she said. Soldiers considering deserting have sought her advice. Several were being sent to fight near Vuhledar. 'They would not have taken the territory, they would not have conquered anything, but no one would have returned,' she said.	https://apnews.com/article/deserters-awol-ukraine-russia-war-def676562552d42bc5d593363c9e5ea0	2024-11-28T20:26:47-08:00	
Battered by war and divisions, Lebanon faces a long list of challenges after ceasefire deal	BEIRUT (AP) — Hours after a U.S.-brokered ceasefire to end the war between Israel and Hezbollah went into effect, Lebanon woke up to the sound of celebratory gunfire instead of Israeli airstrikes and drones buzzing overhead. It was a rare moment of respite for Lebanon, as bombs stopped falling after a year of war. Thousands of displaced people joyfully drove back to their towns and villages in southern and eastern Lebanon. But the realization of what lies ahead quickly sank in. Town after town in the south and east as well as parts of Beirut have been destroyed, entire border villages leveled to the ground, and thousands of buildings damaged. The World Bank estimates losses amounting to some $8.5 billion. For the tiny and broken Mediterranean country, which has dealt with compounded calamities for over half a decade, the ceasefire deal has brought more questions than answers. Among them, who will foot the bill for rebuilding? Will Hezbollah fully remove its fighters and arsenals from the south, relocating north of the Litani River — and how will the Lebanese army ensure that it does so? And will Israel ultimately accept the militants being pushed back, battered but not destroyed? Meanwhile, Lebanon’s political paralysis between groups allied and opposed to Hezbollah has only worsened during the war — raising the possibility of instability that could rattle the ceasefire. Anger has grown among some over that they see as the Iran-backed group’s decision to provoke another disastrous war with Israel. Temporary calm or a step toward long-term security? During the 60-day first phase of the ceasefire deal, based on Security Council Resolution 1701, Hezbollah and Israeli forces are to withdraw from south Lebanon, and the Lebanese military is to step in. The Lebanese troops are to ensure that Hezbollah dismantles its facilities and military positions and that it doesn’t try to rebuild. That’s a major point of tension, potentially putting the army in a dangerous confrontation with the more powerful militant group. The army, largely funded by the United States and other Western governments, is a rare point of unity in Lebanon’s tense sectarian power-balancing political system. But it's always tried to avoid friction with Hezbollah, which is backed by a large constituency among Lebanon's Shiite Muslims. Hassan Fadlallah, a Hezbollah lawmaker, told reporters Thursday that the group will cooperate with the army to implement the ceasefire. But he also said the military doesn’t have the capability to defend Lebanon against Israel — a role Hezbollah has long claimed. He said the group would continue in that role. 'Can anyone say if Israel attacks, we watch?' Fadlallah said. 'When Israel attacks our country, we will fight and resist. This is our right.' Mike Azar, a Lebanese commentator, said the army is 'in an impossible position.' 'To suggest that it can disarm or dismantle Hezbollah’s infrastructure is, frankly, absurd,' he said in an online post. A Lebanese military official told The Associated Press that troops’ deployment will be gradual into areas of the south, including those from which Israeli troops withdraw. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of not being cleared to speak to the media. The U.S. and France will also be involved in a monitoring mechanism to make sure Resolution 1701 is implemented. Its viability is really being put to the test — 'if there really is going to be that commitment' by all sides, said Salman Shaikh, who served as political adviser to the U.N. special envoy for Lebanon during the 2006 war, when the resolution was passed. He now runs The Shaikh Group, a mediation and conflict resolution organization. Critics of the deal fear the pressure is far greater on Lebanon, and Israel has more space to attack Hezbollah — which it has vowed to do if it believes Hezbollah isn't abiding by its terms. With U.S. support, Israel has given itself 'almost total freedom to determine when it needs or wants to attack Lebanon again for whatever reason,' said Matt Duss, executive vice president of The Center for International Policy, a Washington-based think tank. Cash-strapped Lebanon needs support for its military and battered country Lebanon since late 2019 has been mired in a crippling financial crisis that pushed millions into poverty, destroyed its banking system, and limited the country to just a few hours of state electricity daily. The Lebanese military has suffered as well, with troops quitting or working second jobs to pay the bills. Yet, the aim of the agreement is for Lebanon to recruit more and deploy an additional 10,000 troops south of the Litani River. Without significant funding, this would be impossible — especially with the huge rebuilding costs Lebanon now faces. The international community in a donor conference in Paris last month pledged $1 billion dollars for Lebanon, including $800 million for humanitarian assistance and $200 million to support the army. But aid groups say none of that funding has materialized yet. Mercy Corps says Lebanon’s gross domestic product shrunk by 6.4% — some $1.15 billion — just in the last two months of the war. The organization is scrambling to secure housing and services for displaced people ahead of the winter. 'The worst civilian impacts could still be ahead,' Laila Al Amine, Mercy Corps' Lebanon country director, said in a statement. A looming question is who will foot the bill. Iran has offered to help, but it's cash-strapped and under Western sanctions. Oil-rich Gulf Arab states, who helped rebuild after the 2006 war, are weary of Lebanon’s political class and not inclined to step in. Growing tensions over Hezbollah at home Even before the war, Hezbollah and its arsenal were a point of contention in Lebanon. Its allies say Hezbollah’s militants are crucial in protecting Lebanon, while critics say its weaponry violates state sovereignty and is used to pressure political opponents. They have long demanded Hezbollah be disarmed. Senior parliamentarian Alain Aoun said Lebanon has a long list of urgent matters to address, including electing a president after over two years of vacuum, securing reconstruction funding and resolving a host of neglected economic issues. 'There are a number of challenges awaiting us,' Aoun told the AP. Hezbollah's opponents were also angered over its decision to unilaterally start firing rockets into northern Israel on Oct. 8, 2023. The group said it was acting in solidarity with its ally Hamas in the Gaza Strip and vowed not to stop until a ceasefire there was reached. Critics say it dragged Lebanon into war and brought Israel’s destructive bombardment. Even some of its allies expressed frustration. Lawmaker Gebran Bassil, who heads a party that for years was Hezbollah’s main Christian ally in government, said in a video posted on X that Hezbollah 'should be at the service of the state,' not the other way around. Hezbollah's top ally Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, who spearheaded negotiation efforts, has long pushed for Hezbollah to decouple its campaign against Israel from the war in Gaza. Now he is calling for parliament to vote for a president in January in order to ease Lebanon’s political gridlock — a move that could put Hezbollah's political power to the test. This is where international funding and political support would also be crucial, says Shaikh. The international community, he said, needs 'to help the Lebanese sort out their issues, which still persist and which are not exclusively just to do with the Israeli actions against them.'	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-hezbollah-israel-ceasefire-crisis-be0df65fa96162ca5ca02da73f172614	2024-11-28T20:04:33-08:00	
Stock market today: Global shares mostly lower, with US markets closed for Thanksgiving	HONG KONG (AP) — Global shares mostly fell on Friday after U.S. markets were closed Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday. France’s CAC 40 was nearly unchanged at 7,178.37 in early trading, while Germany’s DAX edged down 0.1% to 19,407.50. Britain’s FTSE 100 declined less than 0.1% to 8,279.02. Investors were awaiting preliminary inflation data for November for the region using the euro, which may influence the European Central Bank’s future interest rate decisions. The futures for the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average were both 0.3% higher. U.S. markets will reopen for a half day on Friday. In Asian trading, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index fell 0.4% to 38,208.03 after the government reported that inflation in Tokyo, considered an indicator for national trends, was 2.6% in November, up from 1.8% last month mainly due to a surge in fresh food prices. Core inflation, which excludes fresh food prices, rose modestly to 2.2% year-on-year from 1.8% in October. Higher inflation tends to reinforce expectations that the Bank of Japan will push ahead with more increases in its benchmark lending rate. That, in turn, pushes up the value of the Japanese yen, which was trading at 150.02 to the U.S. dollar early Friday. A week earlier it was trading above 155 yen per dollar. The central bank's current policy rate is 0.25%. It only ended a long spell of negative rates in March on the presumption that Japan had largely achieved its 2% inflation target. South Korea’s Kospi lost 2% to 2,455.91 after the central bank cut its benchmark interest rate on Thursday to relieve pressure on its slowing economy. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 edged 0.1% lower to 8,436.20. Chinese markets advanced. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index gained 0.3% to 19,423.61. Meanwhile, the Shanghai Composite index surged 0.9% to 3,326.46. Gains in retailers' stocks drove market gains after a two-day meeting in Beijing focused on promoting consumption ended on Thursday. Shares of Yonghui Superstore, China’s fifth-largest hypermarket chain operator, surged by over 10%. Investors also are looking ahead to a major economic planning meeting that is usually held in December. The holiday Thursday brought a respite in news on President-elect Donald Trump's plans for after he takes office, after markets were rocked earlier in the week by his announcement that he plans to order immediate sharp tariff hikes on imports from Canada, Mexico and China. On Wednesday, the S&amp;P 500 fell 0.4% and the Dow fell 0.3%. The Nasdaq composite, which is heavily weighted with technology stocks, fell 0.6%. In other dealings Friday, U.S. benchmark crude oil lost 16 cents to $68.56 per barrel, while Brent crude, the international standard, fell 37 cents to $72.41 per barrel. The euro rose to $1.0580 from $1.0554.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-rates-tariffs-8575d0c7231225fc8c1fa89285de9a13	2024-11-28T19:39:43-08:00	
AP PHOTOS: Jakarta TNR effort aims to help stray cats like lively Hitam and feisty Aing Maung	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — Hitam, a lively black-and-white stray cat has been spayed and returned to the loving arms of Alvin, a parking attendant in a bustling street in Indonesia's capital. 'I feed her rice and fish every day,' Alvin said. The nimble feline is part of an estimated whopping 700,000 stray cats that roam Jakarta. Trap-neuter-return programs, or TNR, have been spearheaded by community-based groups including Let’s Adopt Indonesia that advocate humane methods to control the cat population. Every weekend, volunteers like 28-year-old Vanya Afreenzha work tirelessly to trap as many stray cats as possible. Armed with cat food, long pole nets and plastic carriers, they roam parks, train stations and public areas where cats can be easily spotted. They then drop them off at a clinic in southern Jakarta to be neutered by qualified veterinarians. During a recent excursion, volunteers trapped 80 cats, including Hitam, and got them spayed or neutered. Among them was a notoriously aggressive female cat that Afreenzha nicknamed Aing Maung, which means 'I am a tiger' in Sundanese. Carolina Fajar, the head of operations at Let’s Adopt Indonesia, says neutering and spaying cats reduces aggression and disruptive behavior and even prevents property damage as the felines scavenge for food and look to mate. 'So how can we handle this without having to get rid of them? Through neutering which lowers their hormonal levels, allowing them to coexist peacefully,' she said. Despite the occasional scratch and resistance from some locals who doubt the effectiveness of TNR, volunteers like Afreenzha remain committed to the cause. She finds solace in helping cats live healthier lives and aiding those abandoned by their owners.

Crew mistakes caused the sinking of a New Zealand navy ship off Samoan coast, inquiry finds	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Mistakes by members of the crew caused a New Zealand navy ship to plow into a reef off the coast of Samoa, where it caught fire and sank, according to the preliminary findings of a military Court of Inquiry released Friday. The ship’s crew did not realize autopilot was engaged, believed something else had gone wrong with the ship, and did not check the HMNZS Manawanui was under manual control as it maintained course toward land, a summary of the inquiry’s first report said. The full report has not been made public. All 75 people on board the vessel evacuated safely as the boat foundered about 1.6 kilometers (a mile) off the coast of Upolu, Samoa, in October. The ship was one of only nine in New Zealand’s navy and was the first the country lost at sea since World War II. Officials did not know the cause of the sinking at the time, and Chief of Navy Rear Admiral Garin Golding ordered a Court of Inquiry to investigate. 'The direct cause of the grounding has been determined as a series of human errors which meant the ship’s autopilot was not disengaged when it should have been,' Golding told reporters in Auckland on Friday. 'Muscle memory from the person in control should have leaned over to that panel and checked whether the screen said autopilot or not.' The crew 'mistakenly believed its failure to respond to direction changes was the result of a thruster control failure,' he said. A number of contributing factors were identified, Golding said, including training, planning, supervision, readiness and risk assessment. The Court of Inquiry is expected to continue until the first quarter of next year. Golding said given human error was identified as the cause, a separate disciplinary process will begin after the inquiry. Three crew members who were on the bridge as the disaster unfolded are likely to face such a process, Golding added. They were the officer in control of the ship, an officer supervising that person, and the ship's commanding officer. The navy chief would not name them. 'I want to reassure the public of New Zealand that we will learn from this situation and that it is on me, as the Chief of Navy, to earn back your trust,' Golding said. In the days after the sinking, New Zealand's Defense Minister gave stinging rebukes of 'misogynistic' online commenters who directed abusive comments at the ship's captain because she was a woman. The specialist dive and hydrographic vessel had been in service for New Zealand since 2019 and was surveying the reef that it ran aground on. The sinking prompted fears in villages along the Samoan coastline near the wreck about damage caused by the ship's diesel spilling into the ocean. New Zealand officials have said since the sinking that most of the fuel burned off in the fire and that no environmental damage has been recorded. The current flow of fuel into the sea was a 'persistent slow leak' which divers are monitoring, Golding said Friday. Specialist equipment is due to be transported from New Zealand to Samoa by sea, departing this week, to remove fuel and other potential pollutants from the ship. New Zealand officials have not made public plans to remove the ship from the reef. 'This has had an impact to our reputation,' Golding said. 'We will own it, fix it and learn from it.'	https://apnews.com/article/zealand-navy-ship-samoa-manawanui-sinking-military-dd9cccaa0739ef98f615cc4969a117b0	2024-11-28T17:06:02-08:00	
South Korean politician calls for investigation of biomass energy material imported from Indonesia	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — A South Korean National Assembly member has called for a moratorium on wood pellet imports from Indonesia and an investigation into their environmental impacts after government data and satellite analysis linked the country's biomass imports to deforestation in Indonesia. 'We should stop imports of wood pellets … and it’s important for our government to investigate exactly what kinds of environmental destruction is occurring on the spot,' Moon Dae-Lim, a lawmaker with South Korea's main liberal opposition Democratic Party, said in recent written responses to questions from The Associated Press. 'Identifying and correcting potential risks in supply chains and value chains is key to a sustainable project.' Biomass can come from organic material like plants, wood and waste, and many coal-fired power plants can be easily modified to burn it alongside coal to make energy. As countries accelerate their energy transitions, demand for biomass is growing: The use of bioenergy has increased an average of about 3% per year between 2010 and 2022, the International Energy Agency said. Experts including the IEA say it’s important for that demand to happen in a sustainable way, such as using waste and crop residue rather than converting forest land to grow bioenergy crops. In South Korea, bioenergy has grown to become the second-largest source of renewable energy and over 80% of its main raw material — energy-dense wood pellets — is dependent on imports, according to a policy report on the state audit authored by Moon and published in October. Data shows that a growing number of those wood pellets come from the vast tropical archipelago nation of Indonesia. In 2023 the country was the third-largest source of wood pellet imports for South Korea behind Vietnam and Russia. Over 60% of biomass made from pristine natural forests destroyed for wood pellet production since 2021 were shipped to South Korea, AP found in an examination of satellite images, company records and Indonesian export data. In the same time frame, Indonesia's wood pellet exports to South Korea jumped from 50 tons to over 68,000 tons. The largest exporter of wood pellets from Indonesia from 2021-2023, according to data Indonesian nongovernmental conservation organization Auriga Nusantara compiled from the Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry database, was Biomasa Jaya Abadi. The wood pellet processing company is located in Gorontalo, near a concession owned by Banyan Tumbuh Lestari. Over 3,000 hectares (7,410 acres) of forest have been razed in a concession owned by Banyan Tumbuh Lestari, from 2021 to 2024, according to satellite analysis shared with AP by international environmental organization Mighty Earth. An additional 2,850 hectares (7,040 acres) were cleared for logging roads. 'If we block the imports of (Biomasa Jaya Abadi's) wood pellets, we can prevent a great deal of forest destructions that happen in Indonesia for the purpose of exporting to South Korea,' Moon said. 'The Korean government’s active responses to forest destructions can also send a message on the importance of sustainability to not only the Indonesian government but also related industries across Asia.' In an email, a spokesperson from Biomasa Jaya Abadi said that it harvested its forest products strictly from within government-designated areas and that it replants trees. 'The company’s wood pellet ecosystem has a very rigorous legality, traceability and compliance procedures put in place to ensure that the company adheres fully to all applicable regulations in Indonesia,' the spokesperson wrote. Environmental activist groups lauded Moon's report and questioning as a step in the right direction for demanding accountability for South Korea's biomass use. 'Moon’s questioning represents a pivotal moment. By highlighting the climate injustice tied to South Korea’s energy policies, these inquiries put pressure on the Korea Forest Service to confront its role in failing to regulate high-risk imports,' said Hansae Song, program lead at South Korea-based nongovernmental organization Solutions for our Climate. 'We hope to see this scrutiny lead to a reevaluation of import standards and compel the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy to rethink its subsidy policies, which currently benefit a narrow group of corporate interests at the expense of global forests.' In responses to question posed by AP, the Korea Forest Service said it had asked the Indonesian government to provide biomass-related data via a South Korean-Indonesia forestry cooperation center in Indonesia. But it hasn’t received an official response as Indonesia’s Ministry of Environment and Forestry was split into the environment ministry and the forest ministry in October. The Korea Forest Service also told AP it had confirmed that Indonesia wood pellets were produced via legal tree-cut procedures in the country. It said it respects other countries’ related domestic policies on tree cuts. 'Each country has rights to govern itself in line with its own economic and environmental policies, and that must be respected,' the Korea Forest Service said. 'If we take unilateral actions on the wood products endorsed by the Indonesian government, there are concerns about possible diplomatic and trade disputes erupting. Thus, we ask for the Indonesian government to confirm relevant data and validity of certifications of legality.' Indonesia's Ministry of Forestry did not respond to requests for interview or comment from AP.

Canada sues Google over alleged anticompetitive practices in online ads	TORONTO (AP) — Canada's antitrust watchdog said Thursday it is suing Google over alleged anticompetitive conduct in the tech giant’s online advertising business and wants the company to sell off two of its ad tech services and pay a penalty. The Competition Bureau said that such action is necessary because an investigation into Google found that the company 'unlawfully' tied together its ad tech tools to maintain its dominant market position. The matter is now headed for the Competition Tribunal, a quasi-judicial body that hears cases brought forward by the competition commissioner about non-compliance with the Competition Act. The bureau is asking the tribunal to order Google to sell its publisher ad server, DoubleClick for Publishers, and its ad exchange, AdX. It estimates Google holds a market share of 90% in publisher ad servers, 70% in advertiser networks, 60% in demand-side platforms and 50% in ad exchanges. This dominance, the bureau said, has discouraged competition from rivals, inhibited innovation, inflated advertising costs and reduced publisher revenues. 'Google has abused its dominant position in online advertising in Canada by engaging in conduct that locks market participants into using its own ad tech tools, excluding competitors, and distorting the competitive process,' Matthew Boswell, Commissioner of Competition, said in a statement. Google, however, maintains the online advertising market is a highly competitive sector. Dan Taylor, Google’s vice president of global ads, said in a statement that the bureau’s complaint 'ignores the intense competition where ad buyers and sellers have plenty of choice.' The statement added that Google intends to defend itself against the allegation. U.S. regulators want a federal judge to break up Google to prevent the company from continuing to squash competition through its dominant search engine after a court found it had maintained an abusive monopoly over the past decade. The proposed breakup, floated in a 23-page document filed this month by the U.S. Department of Justice, calls for sweeping punishments that would include a sale of Google’s industry-leading Chrome web browser and impose restrictions to prevent Android from favoring its own search engine.	https://apnews.com/article/canada-google-lawsuit-bd591eef7c624c59e065cf6740f0da64	2024-11-28T14:41:26-08:00	
Displaced families in Lebanon who return home are faced with piles of rubble	HANOUIYEH, Lebanon (AP) — During their 37 years of marriage, Mariam Kourani and her husband ran a butcher shop in southern Lebanon, started a business selling serving containers and opened a small restaurant. An Israeli airstrike in late September destroyed it all. Walking through the rubble of what used to be her house and restaurant in the village of Hanouiyeh, Kourani, 56, watched as her son-in-law picked up some of his young daughter's clothes and toys from the ruins. 'This was my house, my dreams and my hard work,' she said, holding back tears. She pointed to one of the serving containers she used to sell, and estimated her family’s total losses at $120,000. Kourani is among the tens of thousands of residents who have started streaming back into southern Lebanon to check on their homes after the U.S.-mediated ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah went into effect early Wednesday. Intense Israeli airstrikes over the past two months leveled entire neighborhoods in eastern and southern Lebanon, and in the southern suburbs of Beirut, which are predominantly Shiite areas of Lebanon where Hezbollah has a strong base of support. Nearly 1.2 million people have been displaced. Like Kourani, many are returning home to find that their homes are gone. The World Bank said earlier this month that housing has been the hardest hit sector with almost 100,000 units partially or fully damaged during the 14-month war, which intensified in late September. It estimated the damage at $3.2 billion. Who will pay for the reconstruction is unclear. Iran has offered to help, but it’s under Western sanctions and its economy has suffered. Kourani said Hezbollah members have told her those who lost a house during the war will be given a place to stay until their homes are rebuilt. After spending thousands of dollars in rent for the two months the family was displaced in the village of Qarnayel in Mount Lebanon, Kourani said her priority is to fix their butcher shop across the street so they can start earning money. 'We are starting from below zero,' she said. A history of loss Ali Saleh lost his home in 2006, during the 34-day war between Israel and Hezbollah. He was able to rebuild when the gulf nation of Qatar funded the reconstruction of several areas in southern Lebanon. On Wednesday, Saleh drove to his hometown near the border with Israel, only to find that it had happened again: his two-story home was destroyed. 'All the memories are gone,' he said, as he smoked a cigarette. The 59-year-old man drove back with his wife and three of his six children hoping to find a place to stay close to his hometown of Aita al-Shaab, a village that witnessed some of the most intense fighting. 'It is a disaster-stricken village,' he said. In the ancient city of Baalbek in eastern Lebanon, 34-year-old Souad al-Outa walked around what was left of her home, shocked. She knew her neighborhood had been badly hit like many other parts of this city, a designated UNESCO World Heritage site famous for its ancient Roman ruins. She was not prepared for the devastation she saw when she went back on Thursday. A strike earlier this month killed multiple people in the street nearby, she said, including several of her husband's relatives. 'I feel like my heart has come out of its place,' she said as she looked around what used to be her children’s bedroom. 'We had a beautiful life here.' Homes can be rebuilt About 170 kilometers (105 miles) southwest of there, in the village of Qana near the port city of Tyre, Abu Ahmad Salameh stood in what was left of several buildings that belonged to his family. He was able to pull two carpets from under the rubble. 'All this damage can be rebuilt. This is our land and we will stay here no matter what,' Salameh said. 'It is painful to see the destruction. These are the homes of my parents, grandparents, daughter and my house.' He said that when the area was struck about two weeks ago, Hezbollah fighters found a safe full of jewelry and cash in the rubble of his house, and returned it to his family. Back in Hanouiyeh, Kourani said the family left their home in the early afternoon on Sept. 23, the day the war intensified, and moved in with relatives a few miles away. Shortly after they got there, they received a call saying that their house had been destroyed. As the Israeli airstrikes increased, they fled north to Qarnayel, where they rented an apartment for 1,000 a month in addition to $250 for electricity and water. Once the ceasefire went into effect, she drove back home with her husband, son and her daughter’s family. They spent the night with relatives. Despite everything, Kourani said she is embarrassed to speak about her material losses at a time when thousands of people have been killed, including friends and relatives and Hezbollah fighters among them. 'Israel has filled our land with blood. Our big loss is our men,' she said. ___ Associated Press writer Lujain Jo in Baalbek, Lebanon, contributed reporting.	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-hezbollah-war-displaced-ruins-1e55cd00486ad84ba7df830e7264af68	2024-11-28T10:48:43-08:00	
Mexican president says she is confident that a tariff war with the US can be averted	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Thursday she is confident that a tariff war with the United States can be averted. But her statement — the day after she held a phone call with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump — did not make clear who had offered what. 'There will be no potential tariff war,' Sheinbaum said flatly when asked about the issue at her daily morning news briefing. On Wednesday, Trump wrote that Sheinbaum had agreed to stop unauthorized migration across the border into the United States. She wrote on her social media accounts the same day that 'migrants and caravans are taken care of before they reach the border.' But whether that constituted a promise, a pledge or a simple statement of reality remains unclear. In recent years, migrants who have been unable to obtain permission to cross Mexico have joined together in caravans to walk or hitchhike north toward the U.S. border, seeking safety in numbers. In fact, apart from the first caravans in 2018 and 2019 — which were provided buses to ride part of the way north — no caravan has ever reached the border walking or hitchhiking in any cohesive way. For years, migrant caravans have often been blocked, harassed or prevented from hitching rides by Mexican police and migration agents. They have also frequently been rounded up or returned to areas near the Guatemalan border. So, Sheinbaum's statement appears to reflect a reality that has been true for some time. U.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday said he hoped Trump would rethink his plan to impose tariffs on Mexico and Canada, saying it could 'screw up' relationships with close allies. 'I hope he rethinks it. I think it’s a counterproductive thing to do,' he told reporters in Nantucket, Massachusetts. Trump had earlier threatened to impose 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada until those countries satisfactorily stop illegal immigration and the flow of illegal drugs such as fentanyl into the United States. He also said Chinese imports would face additional tariffs of 10% until Beijing cracks down on the production of materials used in making fentanyl. Despite Sheinbaum's confidence — she described the phone conversation with Trump as 'excellent' — many Mexicans worry that U.S. tariffs could affect a wide range of iconic Mexican products and threaten entire regional economies. In western Mexico, no crop supplies an income for so many small growers as avocados, and Mexico is the main supplier of the fruit for the U.S. market. But avocado growers, pickers and packers worry that U.S. consumers, faced with 25% higher prices, may just skip the guacamole. And earlier this week, Sheinbaum said Mexico was preparing a list of retaliatory tariffs if Trump went ahead with his plans for import duties. If Mexico, Canada and China faced the additional tariffs proposed by Trump on all goods imported to the United States, that could be roughly equal to $266 billion in tax collections, a number that does not assume any disruptions in trade or retaliatory moves by other countries. The cost of those taxes would likely be borne by U.S. families, importers and domestic and foreign companies in the form of higher prices or lower profits. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-us-trump-tariffs-trade-aa0bb32d874a785ce7460b36808b53e1	2024-11-28T08:59:18-08:00

Avocados, tequila and other iconic Mexican products are jeopardized by Trump's tariff threats	URUAPAN, Mexico (AP) — Mexicans are worried that threats by Donald Trump to impose 25% tariffs could affect a wide range of iconic Mexican products and threaten entire regional economies. In western Mexico, no crop supplies an income for so many small growers as avocados. But avocado growers, pickers and packers worry that U.S. consumers, faced with 25% higher prices, may just skip the guacamole. 'I think that when there is an increase in the price for any product, demand declines,' said avocado grower Enrique Espinoza. Orchards like his are the economic lifeblood in the western Mexico state of Michoacan. 'It would be a tragedy if they closed down (the border) on us,' he said. Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration — when he said he would impose tariffs — couldn't come at a worse time: It's around when Mexico starts shipping crates of the green fruit north for Super Bowl Sunday, the annual peak of consumption. José Luis Arroyo Sandoval, a manager at an avocado packing house in Michoacan, says the economy would be affected. 'Work for us could decrease because it won't be quite so attractive to export,' Arroyo said, 'because avocados would get expensive, and avocados are already expensive.' It may not just be Mexican producers who are affected; U.S. consumers may also be howling. Mexican business leader Gina Diez Barroso told a news conference Tuesday that one U.S. agriculture official told her he had never had as many complaints as when the U.S. government halted import inspections on Mexican avocados in 2022. 'Never in his life had he had so much chaos in his office, because they halted Mexican avocados,' Diez Barroso said. Espinoza agrees that consumers are likely to share the pain. 'The gringos need avocados, it is a good product, and I don't think they are going to stop consuming it,' he said. Rather, the reverse effect has him worried; if Mexico retaliates with its own tariffs, as President Claudia Sheinbaum has suggested, Mexicans will face not just a drop in income, but high prices for U.S. products like corn, which is a main supply of feed for animals in Mexico. 'There are more poor people here, so in some ways it is going to hit us,' Espinoza said. 'The United States can pay 25% more for Mexican products, very few of us have enough money to pay 25% more for what we import from the United States.' It’s not just the guacamole; Mexican tequila producers have seen a bonanza in the U.S. market. In 2023, the U.S. imported $4.6 billion worth of tequila and $108 million worth of mezcal from Mexico. That has raised cautious concern among tequila producers, including farmers who grow agave on some of the driest, marginal soils that couldn’t support many other crops. 'We are analyzing the statements by the authorities and their reactions, and in the coming days we will establish a position,' the National Tequila Industry Chamber said in a statement. And industry representatives say a drop in the consumption of tequila — America’s third-most popular spirit, behind vodka and pre-mixed cocktails — could affect U.S. bars, restaurants and clubs. 'At the end of the day, tariffs on spirits products from our neighbors to the north and south are going to hurt U.S. consumers and lead to job losses across the U.S. hospitality industry just as these businesses continue their long recovery from the pandemic,' the Distilled Spirits Council of the U.S. said in a statement. The tariffs would probably plunge Mexico into an immediate recession. Mexican financial group Banco Base estimated in a report that for every 1% that Mexican exports increase in price, their volume falls by 1.33% Supposing that Americans might absorb half the impact of the tariffs and just pay higher prices for Mexican goods, they still might reduce their consumption by 12%, Banco Base estimated. 'This would be reflected in a 4.4% drop in gross domestic product,' the bank wrote, adding 'the decline would not just occur in 2025, but would get more serious the longer the tariffs last.' And the tariffs could affect some products that aren’t thought of as particularly Mexican at all. Mexico’s Economy Secretary, Marcelo Ebrard, said Wednesday that 88% percent of all North American pickup trucks come from Mexico, though it was unclear if he meant just parts of the trucks or their final assembly. Ebrard claimed that 25% tariffs would mean U.S. consumers might have to pay $3,000 more per pickup truck. 'It is shooting yourself in the foot,' Ebrard said. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-us-trump-tariffs-avocados-tequila-7729d1b49ccb3f8daefffb29dce5e615	2024-11-28T07:30:10-08:00	
Thousands of displaced Lebanese return from Syria as ceasefire with Israel holds	QUSAIR, Syria (AP) — Thousands of people made the crossing back into Lebanon from Syria on the second day of a ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel, after nearly 14 months of fighting. At the Jousieh border crossing in the Qusair area of Syria’s Homs province, on Lebanon’s northeastern border, bumper-to-bumper cars lined up on Thursday waiting to be cleared for crossing. All four lanes were taken up by cars making their way into Lebanon, while those waiting to cross into Syria had to use an offroad. Of the six border crossings between Lebanon and Syria, two remain functional after Israeli airstrikes forced the others shut. The two countries share a border 375 kilometers (233 miles) long. Over 600,000 people fleeing Lebanon poured into Syria in the past year, most of them after the war between Israel and Hezbollah escalated in mid-September. The cross-border flow was a striking reversal in fortunes given that Lebanon is still hosting more than 1 million Syrian refugees who fled the war in their country that began in 2011. As the ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah took hold early Wednesday, thousands of people began their return to Lebanon. Families packed into vehicles with suitcases, mattresses and blankets, while children clutched backpacks, some wrapped in blankets, as they made their way back to Lebanon Thursday. The mood was mixed with relief and sorrow as many returnees faced the grim reality of returning to their homes that might be destroyed. 'We have been in Syria since Sept. 23, we had to leave our jobs, our homes and our loved ones because of the war,' said Hasan Fliti, a 54-year-old dairy shop owner who is returning to Lebanon with his wife and two children. 'I am happy that there is a ceasefire and there is no more destruction. You are not afraid anymore of the airstrikes to hit.' On the first day of the ceasefire, more than 2,000 people crossed into Lebanon, a Syrian security official at the Jousieh border told The Associated Press. On Thursday, more than 4,000 crossed back into Lebanon and the number continues to rise. The hall at the border was filled with families waiting to get their passports or IDs stamped. Some smoked, others sat on their luggage, waiting for clearance as the flow of returnees steadily increased. Among them was 37-year-old Wafa Wehbe, who had sought refuge with her family in Syria for more than a month. 'My house is gone, but it is an indescribable feeling to go back,' she said. 'There’s a tragic sensation for the martyrs who had to die. The children are mourning.' Wehbe’s home in Khiyam, located in an area still under Israeli control, was destroyed, but she said she will now stay at her sister’s. 'I am also going back to mourn our martyrs. They died fighting at the frontlines.' Ghinwa Arzouni, who had sought refuge in Homs from southern Lebanon, said the journey home is both a relief and a challenge. 'We’re excited to go back, but I am afraid of the trip, it’s a long way back,' she said. 'Our house in the south is okay, it might have broken glass but will have to get there first to inspect for ourselves. We hope to return to Syria as tourists and not displaced.'	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-ceasefire-syria-crossing-displaced-a907d0446c905f860159e69a6a1e38c8	2024-11-28T07:23:17-08:00	
The Vienna sausage stand is more than just a snack stall. Now it has a UNESCO heritage recognition	VIENNA (AP) — The Vienna sausage stand is a place where the street sweeper, the manager, the tourist and the celebrity converge for the same tasty snack. Now it also has the official stamp of approval as part of Austria's heritage. The culture of the humble 'Würstelstand' became this week one of the latest additions to the national list of intangible cultural heritage, overseen by the Austrian UNESCO Commission. It joins the Austrian capital's distinctive wine taverns, or 'Heurigen,' which have been listed since 2019, and the city's famous coffee house culture, which was honored in 2011. The Würstelstand, which can now point to a history going back generations, is more than just a source of greasy gastronomic satisfaction. The street stand is known for bringing people of many classes and backgrounds together and has its own distinctive vocabulary. Meet the 'Haasse,' a coarse boiled sausage, and also the 'Käsekrainer' — a smoked creation infused with cheese that oozes out, also sometimes known as the 'Eitrige,' or 'suppurating' sausage. There is also the 'Oaschpfeiferl,' a spicy peperoni, and the 'Krokodü,' a gherkin. 'Sausage stands have a long history in Vienna,' said Josef Bitzinger, whose Bitzinger Würstelstand is located next to the Albertina museum and just behind the Vienna State Opera. 'Originally it was just a bucket with hot water in which the sausages used to swim,' he said. They were sold from 'small carriages drawn by dogs and bigger ones drawn by horses, later by a VW bus or a tractor to their spot.' The tradition goes back to the pre-World War I days of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, when former soldiers set up mobile cookshops to make a living. The city’s longest-lived stall in a fixed location, Würstelstand Leo, has been serving up sausages since 1928. The stands developed into a bigger institution after wider-ranging permission for fixed stalls was granted in 1969. It was then that the griddle was introduced and the cheesy Käsekrainer invented, Bitzinger said. 'Today that’s already a classic.' The UNESCO designation 'honors the tradition, the hospitality and the diversity of our city,' Mayor Michael Ludwig said in a statement. 'This title is a recognition for all those Viennese who, with their warmth and their charm, make the sausage stands more than just a snack place — a meeting place where joie de vivre and culture come together.' Bitzinger said that 'we have been fighting a long time for this.' 'The special thing about it is that it’s a form of gastronomy everybody can afford,' he said. 'Here the general director and, during the opera ball, a celebrity stands next to a worker and the street sweeper who just finished cleaning the street. That unites people.' ___ Associated Press writer Geir Moulson in Berlin contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/vienna-sausage-stands-unesco-heritage-a4f084f69589ab7f638f7197c7f4190f	2024-11-28T07:07:27-08:00	
Georgia suspends talks on joining the EU for 4 years, accusing the bloc of 'blackmail'	TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — Georgia is suspending talks on its bid to join the European Union for four years, its prime minister said Thursday, in view of what he described as 'blackmail and manipulation' from some of the bloc's politicians. The statement by Irakli Kobakhize came hours after he was reappointed to the job by members of the governing Georgian Dream party after its disputed victory in last month’s parliamentary election that has sparked protests and led to an opposition boycott of parliament. The Oct. 26 election was widely seen as a referendum on the country’s aspirations to join the European Union. The opposition said the vote was rigged under the influence of Russia seeking to keep Georgia in its orbit, and declared a boycott of parliament. European election observers said the balloting took place in a 'divisive' atmosphere marked by instances of bribery, double voting and physical violence. The EU has previously announced that the talks on Georgia’s accession to the bloc had been de-facto halted because of its backsliding on democracy. In Thursday’s statement, Kobakhidze said that while the country will pursue its bid to join the EU, 'it will not to put the issue of opening negotiations with the European Union on the agenda until the end of 2028.' 'Additionally, we are rejecting any budgetary grants from the European Union until the end of 2028,' he added. Earlier Thursday, the European Parliament adopted a resolution that condemned last month’s Georgian parliamentary vote for being neither free nor fair, representing yet another manifestation of the continued democratic backsliding of the country 'for which the ruling Georgian Dream party is fully responsible.' EU lawmakers urged a rerun of the parliamentary vote within a year under thorough international supervision and by an independent election administration. They also called on the EU to impose sanctions and limit formal contacts with the Georgian government. 'We will continue on our path toward the European Union; however, we will not allow anyone to keep us in a constant state of blackmail and manipulation, which is utterly disrespectful to our country and society,' Kobakhidze said. 'We must clearly show certain European politicians and bureaucrats, who are completely devoid of European values, that they must speak to Georgia with dignity, not through blackmail and insults.' The Georgian prime minister denounced what he described as a 'cascade of insults' from the EU politicians, charging that 'the ill-wishers of our country have turned the European Parliament into a blunt weapon of blackmail against Georgia, which is a great disgrace for the European Union.' Critics have accused Georgian Dream — established by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia — of becoming increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow. The party recently pushed through laws similar to those used by the Kremlin to crack down on freedom of speech and LGBTQ+ rights. Speaking in parliament earlier tin the day, Kobakhidze described last month’s parliamentary vote as 'also a referendum between immoral propaganda and traditional values, and our society chose traditional values.' The EU suspended Georgia’s membership application process indefinitely in June after parliament passed a law requiring organizations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as 'pursuing the interest of a foreign power,' similar to a Russian law used to discredit organizations critical of the government. President Salome Zourabichvili, whose six-year term expires next month, has rejected the official results and refused to recognize the parliament’s legitimacy. Zourabichvili was elected by popular vote, but Georgia has approved constitutional changes that abolished the direct election of the president and replaced it with a vote by a 300-seat electoral college consisting of members of parliament, municipal councils and regional legislatures. On Wednesday, the ruling party nominated Mikheil Kavelashvili, a 53-year-old former national team and Premier League player, for the mostly ceremonial presidential post. He is all but certain to win the Dec. 14 vote by the electoral college controlled by the ruling party.	https://apnews.com/article/georgia-cabinet-election-russia-european-union-kobakhidze-1291827f76eac552a2918b4b584fa5a0	2024-11-28T06:34:26-08:00	
Israeli airstrikes leave massive trail of destruction across Lebanon	For more than 60 days, Lebanese have watched stunned as Israeli strikes smashed into buildings, raising giant explosions and palls of smoke in the heart of the capital and other cities. Now, after a ceasefire was reached this week between Israel and the Hezbollah militant group, Lebanese are returning to their homes and viewing the damage. In Beirut’s southern suburbs, an area known as Dahiyeh, entire blocks in some areas are reduced to fields of shattered concrete where high-rise buildings once stood. Associated Press video caught the moment when a screeching rocket smashed into an apartment in Beirut last month, sending out a a plume of fire and sparks. In the southern city of Tyre, a towering bank of black and white smoke rose from the heart of downtown like a storm front and drifted over the Mediterranean Sea after missiles hit. In the southern village of Flawiyeh, a car was left flipped onto its hood amid a grove of trees from the force of a strike. Israel launched its intensified campaign of bombardment in Lebanon in late September, vowing to cripple Hezbollah and stop its barrages into northern Israel after months of more limited cross-border exchanges between the two sides. Those exchanges started when Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel in solidarity with Hamas after its attack on Oct. 7, 2023. The Israeli strikes were heaviest in cities, towns and villages around southern Lebanon and in the southern suburbs of Beirut, where Hezbollah has the strongest presence. But for the first time in years, central Beirut was also regularly shaken by explosions. More than 1.2 million Lebanese fled their homes during more than a year of fighting – as did tens of thousands of Israelis on their side of the border.	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-airstrikes-beirut-hezbollah-damage-7b96d85378f41939948bbf1805664c29	2024-11-28T05:38:04-08:00	
Romanian court orders recount of first-round election won by far-right outsider	BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — A top Romanian court on Thursday asked the official electoral authority to recount and verify all of the ballots cast in the first round of the presidential election, which was won by a far-right outsider candidate, sending shockwaves through the political establishment. The Constitutional Court, or CCR, in Bucharest voted unanimously in favor of the recounting the more than 9.4 million ballots, and said the decision is final. The Central Election Bureau is expected to meet on Thursday afternoon to discuss the request. Calin Georgescu, a little-known, far-right populist, won the first round, beating the incumbent prime minister. Georgescu, who ran independently, was due to face reformist Elena Lasconi, the leader of the Save Romania Union party, or USR, in a Dec. 8. runoff. Georgescu's unexpected success has prompted nightly protests by people who are concerned with previous remarks he's made in praising Romanian fascist and nationalist leaders and Russian President Vladimir Putin, and believe he poses a threat to democracy. The vote recount was prompted by a complaint made by Cristian Terhes, a former presidential candidate of the Romanian National Conservative Party who obtained 1% of the vote, who alleged that the USR had urged people to vote before some diaspora polls had closed on Sunday, saying it violated electoral laws against campaign activities on polling day. After the CCR's ruling, Terhes' press office said in a statement on Facebook that the court ordered the recount 'due to indications of fraud,' and alleged Terhes had 'presented evidence suggesting' that valid votes cast for Ludovic Orban — who had dropped out of the race but remained on the ballot — had been reassigned to Lasconi. It is the first time in Romania’s 35-year post-communist history that the country’s most powerful party, the PSD, didn’t have a candidate in the second round of a presidential race. Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu resigned as PSD party leader after he narrowly lost to Lasconi by just 2,740 votes. Lasconi criticized the CCR's decision, saying 'Extremism is fought by voting, not backstage games.' 'What the CCR is trying to do now is absolutely horrific for a democratic country,' she said. 'I am here to defend democracy and call on the Central Election Bureau to handle the vote recount wisely. The law must be the same for all, not interpreted differently for some.' Lasconi, a former journalist, had told The Associated Press ahead of the first-round vote that she saw corruption as one of Romania’s biggest issues and vowed to tackle it. 'Romania deserves better, not a group of old politicians who use institutions strictly for their personal interest!' Lasconi added in her Thursday statement. The CCR on Thursday also rejected a request by another unsuccessful first-round candidate, Sebastian Popescu, to annul the ballot. Popescu alleged Georgescu — who declared zero campaign spending — had not disclosed financing linked to a massive TikTok campaign, which many have credited for his success. Popescu, who got 0.15% in the first round, also alleged in his appeal that Georgescu had used widespread disinformation and 'defrauded the electoral law by illegally financing the entire electoral campaign, having support from outside the country’s borders, from state entities with the aim of destabilizing Romania.' Georgescu’s account on the Chinese platform TikTok, which has amassed 5.1 million likes and 450,000 followers, gained huge traction in recent weeks. Expert Forum, a Bucharest-based think tank, said in a report that the rapid rise 'appears sudden and artificial, similar to his polling results.' The most visible theme on Georgescu’s TikTok in the last two months 'is peace, more precisely the need for Romania to stop supporting Ukraine in order not to involve Romania in war,' the report stated. Romania’s National Audiovisual Council asked the European Commission this week to investigate TikTok’s role in the Nov. 24 vote. Pavel Popescu, the vice president of Romania’s media regulator Ancom, said he would request TikTok’s suspension on Thursday in Romania if investigations find evidence of 'manipulation of the electoral process.' The AP emailed TikTok’s spokesperson on Thursday asking whether an internal investigation is being carried out into any alleged dubious activity, but did not yet receive a response. Georgescu, who said a network of Romanian volunteers helped his campaign, has denied any wrongdoing. 'They want to ban the right of the Romanian people to speak freely,' he told a local news channel Wednesday, adding the first-round vote 'was perfectly democratic and legitimate.'	https://apnews.com/article/romania-election-president-recount-georgescu-far-right-34f4284d54ea34a841225e2c3a968c6d	2024-11-28T04:22:44-08:00	
A social media ban for under-16s passes the Australian Senate and will soon be a world-first law	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — A social media ban for children under 16 passed the Australian Senate Thursday and will soon become a world-first law. The law will make platforms including TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram liable for fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for systemic failures to prevent children younger than 16 from holding accounts. The Senate passed the bill 34 votes to 19. The House of Representatives on Wednesday overwhelmingly approved the legislation by 102 votes to 13. The House has yet to endorse opposition amendments made in the Senate. But that is a formality since the government has already agreed they will pass. The platforms will have one year to work out how they could implement the ban before penalties are enforced. Meta Platforms, which owns Facebook and Instagram, said the legislation had been 'rushed.' Digital Industry Group Inc., an advocate for the platforms in Australia, said questions remain about the law’s impact on children, its technical foundations and scope. 'The social media ban legislation has been released and passed within a week and, as a result, no one can confidently explain how it will work in practice – the community and platforms are in the dark about what exactly is required of them,' DIGI managing director Sunita Bose said in a statement. The amendments bolster privacy protections. Platforms would not be allowed to compel users to provide government-issued identity documents including passports or driver’s licenses, nor could they demand digital identification through a government system. The House is scheduled to pass the amendments on Friday. Critics of the legislation fear that banning young children from social media will impact the privacy of users who must establish they are older than 16. While the major parties support the ban, many child welfare and mental health advocates are concerned about unintended consequences. Sen. David Shoebridge, from the minority Greens party, said mental health experts agreed that the ban could dangerously isolate many children who used social media to find support. 'This policy will hurt vulnerable young people the most, especially in regional communities and especially the LGBTQI community, by cutting them off,' Shoebridge told the Senate. Opposition Sen. Maria Kovacic said the bill was not radical but necessary. 'The core focus of this legislation is simple: It demands that social media companies take reasonable steps to identify and remove underage users from their platforms,' Kovacic told the Senate. 'This is a responsibility these companies should have been fulfilling long ago, but for too long they have shirked these responsibilities in favor of profit,' she added. Online safety campaigner Sonya Ryan, whose 15-year-old daughter Carly was murdered by a 50-year-old pedophile who pretended to be a teenager online, described the Senate vote as a 'monumental moment in protecting our children from horrendous harms online.' 'It’s too late for my daughter, Carly, and the many other children who have suffered terribly and those who have lost their lives in Australia, but let us stand together on their behalf and embrace this together,' she told the AP in an email. Wayne Holdsworth, whose teenage son Mac took his own life after falling victim to an online sextortion scam, had advocated for the age restriction and took pride in its passage. 'I have always been a proud Australian, but for me subsequent to today’s Senate decision, I am bursting with pride,' Holdsworth told the AP in an email. Christopher Stone, executive director of Suicide Prevention Australia, the governing body for the suicide prevention sector, said the legislation failed to consider positive aspects of social media in supporting young people’s mental health and sense of connection. 'The government is running blindfolded into a brick wall by rushing this legislation. Young Australians deserve evidence-based policies, not decisions made in haste,' Stone said in a statement. The platforms had complained that the law would be unworkable and had urged the Senate to delay the vote until at least June 2025 when a government-commissioned evaluation of age assurance technologies will report on how young children could be excluded. 'Naturally, we respect the laws decided by the Australian Parliament,' Facebook and Instagram owner Meta Platforms said in a statement. 'However, we are concerned about the process which rushed the legislation through while failing to properly consider the evidence, what industry already does to ensure age-appropriate experiences, and the voices of young people.' Critics argue the government is attempting to convince parents it is protecting their children ahead of a general election due by May. The government hopes that voters will reward it for responding to parents’ concerns about their children’s addiction to social media. Some argue the legislation could cause more harm than it prevents. Criticisms include that the legislation was rushed through Parliament without adequate scrutiny, is ineffective, poses privacy risks for all users, and undermines the authority of parents to make decisions for their children. Opponents also argue the ban would isolate children, deprive them of the positive aspects of social media, drive them to the dark web, discourage children too young for social media to report harm, and reduce incentives for platforms to improve online safety. ____ AP Business Writer Kelvin Chan in London contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/australia-social-media-children-ban-safeguarding-harm-accounts-d0cde2603bdbc7167801da1d00ecd056	2024-11-28T03:24:24-08:00	
UK police investigate more than 5 people over alleged abuse by former Harrods boss Al Fayed	LONDON (AP) — Britain's biggest police force has launched an investigation into more than five people who may have assisted the former boss of top-end department store Harrods, Mohamed Al Fayed, carry out more than 100 alleged acts of sexual abuse, including rape, on women and girls. In an update on its investigation late Wednesday, London's Metropolitan Police said it is looking at unidentified individuals who could have enabled Al Fayed between 1977 and 2014. Allegations against Al Fayed have grown since the BBC broadcast claims by several former Harrods employees in September. The Met said another 90 potential victims have come forward, bringing the total to 111. Lawyers representing more than 400 women have come forward, and the number is increasing daily, police said. The Met also confirmed that an an internal review is being carried out into how the force handled claims about Al Fayed while he was alive. Al Fayed, who was never prosecuted, died in 2023, aged 94. 'To anyone who suffered at the hands of Mohammed Al Fayed or others who may not yet have come forward, I know there may be many reasons why you have not felt able to report the crimes committed against you,' said Met Commander Steve Clayman. He said the investigation is ostensibly about 'giving survivors a voice' but that it is 'now pursuing' individuals suspected to have been 'complicit' in Al Fayed's offending. Al Fayed was questioned by detectives in 2008 over the alleged sexual abuse of a 15-year-old, and in 2009 and 2015 police passed files of evidence about him to prosecutors. He was never charged. 'We are aware that past events may have impacted the public’s trust and confidence in our approach, and we are determined to rebuild that trust by addressing these allegations with integrity and thoroughness,' said Clayman. The Egypt-born businessman moved to Britain in the 1960s and bought Harrods in the mid-1980s. Al Fayed sold Harrods in 2010 to a company owned by the state of Qatar through its sovereign wealth fund, the Qatar Investment Authority. The current managing director of Harrods, Michael Ward, has apologized to former employees who said they were sexually assaulted by Al Fayed. Ward said it is clear Al Fayed 'presided over a toxic culture of secrecy, intimidation, fear of repercussion and sexual misconduct.'	https://apnews.com/article/harrods-britain-al-fayed-sex-crimes-7934ac63e4f4736ec2584e7cbf327649	2024-11-28T03:10:39-08:00	
Youth arrested in Germany on suspicion of planning an attack with pipe bombs	BERLIN (AP) — A youth suspected of planning to build pipe bombs to carry out an Islamic extremist attack has been arrested in western Germany, authorities said Thursday. The suspect, whose name and exact age weren't released, was arrested on Tuesday evening, prosecutors in Koblenz said in a statement. He is accused of preparing a serious act of violence. Prosecutors said they believe he became radicalized online and shared propaganda glorifying the actions of the Islamic State group. A search of his home in October found two bayonets and four sections of pipe. Investigators say the suspect planned to produce pipe bombs and use them in an attack. He got instructions on how to produce such bombs from the internet, prosecutors said. Another search of his home this week found 'further utensils' which may have been intended for use in producing an ignition mechanism, they added. There were no indications that the suspect planned an imminent attack. Investigators didn't find any explosives or substances that could be used to make them. A judge on Wednesday ordered the suspect kept in custody pending a possible indictment.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-extremism-suspect-pipe-bombs-arrest-9298a146f1d3ac550c2e7aa1af77ff64	2024-11-28T02:54:06-08:00	
Polish company denies that it broke the law in sending Swiss-made ammunition to Ukraine	WARSAW, Poland (AP) — A Polish company strongly denied any laws were broken when it sent Swiss-made ammunition to Ukraine, after the Swiss government placed some export restrictions on the company over concerns that the ammunition ended up in Ukraine. Switzerland's government said last week it was barring exports to Polish military hardware supplier UMO after concluding that some 645,000 rounds of Swiss-made small-caliber ammunition ended up in Ukraine. The issue is sensitive because Swiss laws on neutrality and the export of war material ban the export or re-export of Swiss-owned or Swiss-made military hardware to countries in conflict. Poland, in contrast, is one of neighboring Ukraine's staunchest allies and has sought to help Kyiv defend itself against Russia's invasion with arms supplies. UMO, which specializes in hardware for the military and police, said it purchased ammunition in 2023 from a Swiss ammunitions provider, SwissP Defence, and later exported the ammunition to Ukraine 'in accordance with the Polish law.' It argued that it did not break Swiss law either, saying that 'the Swiss government handed over control of the goods to Polish law.' 'The information that the Polish company UMO ... in any way violated the provisions of generally applicable law by exporting ammunition purchased from the Swiss manufacturer SWISS P Defence AG to Ukraine is untrue,' UMO said in an email to The Associated Press this week. Fabian Maienfisch, a spokesperson for the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs, also known as SECO, said UMO 'did not honour the contractual commitments it made to the Swiss manufacturer and the ammunition ended up in Ukraine.' 'The investigation showed that the Swiss manufacturer and the Polish company had signed a reseller agreement stating that the Polish company was entitled to resell the ammunition only in Poland,' he said in a statement emailed to the AP. 'For the time being, export requests to the Polish company concerned for general resale are denied, since the risk of diversion to Ukraine is assessed as being too high. However the Polish company can still act as an intermediary for Polish state entities,' the statement added. UMO has since vehemently pushed back, stating it 'always operates within the limits set by the provisions of generally applicable law and in compliance with contracts concluded with its contractors.' The company published its denial on its website and in an emailed statement to the AP. In a statement posted on its website on Tuesday, UMO said that it is 'proud of its role in strengthening the defense and freedom of Ukraine.'	https://apnews.com/article/poland-switzerland-90cdf0434a358861e53427bb41bddca5	2024-11-28T02:34:33-08:00	
Doctor arrested in Germany over patients' deaths now suspected of 8 killings	BERLIN (AP) — A doctor who was arrested in Berlin in August is now suspected of killing eight patients and in some cases trying to cover up the evidence by setting fires, investigators said Thursday. The unidentified doctor, who was part of a nursing service's palliative care team, was suspected at the time of his arrest of killing four elderly patients in June and July and then attempting with mixed success to set fires at their apartments. Police and prosecutors said Thursday that additional cases surfaced when they examined patients' files and carried out forensic examinations of suspected victims, two of whom were exhumed. In the earliest case, he is a suspected of administering a lethal mixture of medicines to a 70-year-old man in January. In a similar case in early April, the alleged victim was a 61-year-old woman. A few weeks later, he is alleged to have killed an 83-year-old man in his room at a Berlin hospice with a mixture of medicines. In the fourth new case, in June, he is alleged to have killed a 70-year-old woman at her apartment and then set a fire. Firefighters were able to prevent the blaze spreading to the rest of the building. The 40-year-old doctor was originally arrested on suspicion of manslaughter, arson and attempted arson. Prosecutors said they are now treating the cases as murder because the suspect appears to have had no motive other than killing the patients. The suspect's name hasn't been released, in keeping with German privacy rules. Prosecutors say he hasn't yet responded to the allegations.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-doctor-police-patient-deaths-de125f5132835539c8477a01671cae6d	2024-11-28T02:15:36-08:00	
Israel launches first airstrike on Lebanon since ceasefire, accusing Hezbollah of breaching truce	BEIRUT (AP) — The Israeli military on Thursday said its warplanes fired on southern Lebanon after detecting Hezbollah activity at a rocket storage facility, the first Israeli airstrike a day after a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah took hold. There was no immediate word on casualties from Israel's aerial attack, which came hours after the Israeli military said it fired on people trying to return to certain areas in southern Lebanon. Israel said they were violating the ceasefire agreement, without providing details. Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency said two people were wounded. The back-to-back incidents stirred unease about the agreement, brokered by the United States and France, which includes an initial two-month ceasefire in which Hezbollah militants are to withdraw north of the Litani River and Israeli forces are to return to their side of the border. The buffer zone would be patrolled by Lebanese troops and U.N. peacekeepers. On Thursday, the second day of a ceasefire after more than a year of bloody conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, Lebanon's state news agency reported that Israeli fire targeted civilians in Markaba, close to the border, without providing further details. Israel said it fired artillery in three other locations near the border. There were no immediate reports of casualties. An Associated Press reporter in northern Israel near the border heard Israeli drones buzzing overhead and the sound of artillery strikes from the Lebanese side. The Israeli military said in a statement that 'several suspects were identified arriving with vehicles to a number of areas in southern Lebanon, breaching the conditions of the ceasefire.' It said troops 'opened fire toward them' and would 'actively enforce violations of the ceasefire agreement.' Israeli officials have said forces will be withdrawn gradually as it ensures that the agreement is being enforced. Israel has warned people not to return to areas where troops are deployed, and says it reserves the right to strike Hezbollah if it violates the terms of the truce. A Lebanese military official said Lebanese troops would gradually deploy in the south as Israeli troops withdraw. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief media. The ceasefire agreement announced late Tuesday ended 14 months of conflict between Israel and Hezbollah that began a day after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack out of Gaza, when the Lebanese militant group began firing rockets, drones and missiles in solidarity. Israel retaliated with airstrikes, and the conflict steadily intensified for nearly a year before boiling over into all-out war in mid-September. The war in Gaza is still raging with no end in sight. More than 3,760 people were killed by Israeli fire in Lebanon during the conflict, many of them civilians, according to Lebanese health officials. The fighting killed more than 70 people in Israel — over half of them civilians — as well as dozens of Israeli soldiers fighting in southern Lebanon. Some 1.2 million people were displaced in Lebanon, and thousands began streaming back to their homes on Wednesday despite warnings from the Lebanese military and the Israeli army to stay out of certain areas. Some 50,000 people were displaced on the Israeli side, but few have returned and the communities near the northern border are still largely deserted. In Menara, an Israeli community on the border with views into Lebanon, around three quarters of homes are damaged, some with collapsed roofs and burnt-out interiors. A few residents could be seen gathering their belongings on Thursday before leaving again. ___ Frankel reported from northern Israel.

Death toll rises to at least 15 after landslides bury 40 homes in eastern Uganda	NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — At least 15 people have died and 113 others are missing after landslides buried homes in six villages in eastern Uganda, police said Thursday. Another 15 injured people have been rescued and admitted to Buluganya Health Center. The Uganda Red Cross Society said Thursday that 13 bodies had been recovered after landslides buried 40 homes and the rescue effort was continuing. Local media reported that authorities expect the death toll could rise to 30. Heavy rains triggered landslides in the mountainous district of Bulambuli, 280 kilometers east of Kampala, the capital, on Wednesday night. Local officials told a journalist in the area that an excavator would be brought to assist in the rescue efforts, but the roads were covered in mud and rain was still falling. The impacted area is about 50 acres with homesteads and farmlands spread downhill. Photos and videos of people digging through mud in search of victims were shared on social media. Some of the houses were completely covered by mud while others only had a roof showing above the ground. The Daily Monitor newspaper reported that most of the bodies recovered so far were those of children. Bulambuli District Woman MP Irene Muloni said that the government intends to relocate residents from the landslide-prone area. 'Waterfalls are everywhere, and the rainfall is excessive. Let people be evacuated immediately,' she said, urging everyone to seek refuge with relatives and 'leave this dangerous place.' The prime minister’s office issued a disaster alert on Wednesday stating that heavy rains across the country had cut off major roads. Two rescue boats capsized on Wednesday during a rescue mission on River Nile where Pakwach bridge was submerged. ____ Follow AP’s Africa coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/africa	https://apnews.com/article/uganda-landslides-bulambuli-1cc52cb3d54fd4997ac18d513619ca4c	2024-11-28T00:23:49-08:00	
Cyprus could become a member of NATO when conditions permit, the country's president says	NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — Cyprus could apply to become a member of NATO once its armed forces receive the necessary training and equipment with U.S. help to bring them up to the standards of the world's premier military alliance, the president of the Mediterranean island nation said Thursday. President Nikos Christodoulides put Cyprus on a trajectory for possible NATO membership, ending weeks of media speculation about his government's intentions following his meeting with President Joe Biden in Washington last month. The development goes against Cyprus' long-held policy of neutrality harking back to the Cold War era, when it walked a political tightrope between Washington and Moscow. Christodoulides said that although Cyprus cannot join NATO at this time because of objections that alliance member Turkey would raise to its potential membership, the Cypriot National Guard shouldn't be denied the opportunity to upgrade its defensive capabilities with U.S. assistance. Turkey, which maintains more than 35,000 troops in the breakaway Turkish Cypriot northern part of ethnically divided Cyprus, doesn’t recognize the island’s government, which is based in the Greek Cypriot southern part. Christodoulides did not elaborate on how Turkish objections could be sidestepped. But the U.N. is currently working to prepare for a resumption of peace talks between the rival sides in Cyprus, which was split in 1974 when Turkey invaded, following a coup by supporters of uniting the island with Greece. Turkey's state-run news agency Anadolu quoted unnamed Turkish Defense Ministry officials as saying that any Cypriot bid for NATO membership is 'an unacceptable development for Turkey,' which would disrupt 'the delicate balance concerning the Cyprus issue and negatively affect' any peace talks. 'Because we don't want the National Guard to lose such opportunities, we're in talks with the U.S. — and we thank them for their positive response — on how the Cyprus Republic can make the best use of these opportunities, so when everything is in its place, the Cyprus Republic can become a member state of NATO,' Christodoulides told The Associated Press. 'The strengthening of the Cyprus Republic's deterrent capabilities is of the utmost importance, and we take advantage of every opportunity, both in the direction of the United States and NATO, but also the European Union,' he added. Christodoulides said Cyprus' geographic location — it's the closest EU member state to the Middle East, at just 182 kilometers (114 miles) from the Lebanese capital, Beirut — has given impetus to planned upgrades to its military infrastructure. He said the government is currently in talks with the U.S. for upgrades to a key air base and with the EU for a naval base. Following his meeting with Biden, Christodoulides told the AP of his government's commitment to expanding defense and security cooperation with the U.S. Cyprus' Andreas Papandreou air base on its southwestern edge is currently hosting a U.S. Marine contingent and a number of V-22 Osprey tiltrotor military transport and cargo aircraft prepositioned to assist in potential evacuations from nearby Lebanon and elsewhere.	https://apnews.com/article/cyprus-nato-president-military-bases-us-45a0311616736a329fad5b4353a69227	2024-11-28T00:19:33-08:00	
Adani fraud allegations rock Indian Parliament as opposition demands probe into billionaire's firms	NEW DELHI (AP) — India’s Parliament was disrupted for a third day Thursday by opposition parties protesting the government’s silence over allegations against billionaire Gautam Adani, who was recently indicted in the U.S. for alleged fraud and a scheme to pay bribes. As Speaker Om Birla convened the powerful lower house of Parliament, opposition members shot up from their seats and crowded the aisles, shouting anti-government slogans. The Congress and other opposition parties have accused the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi of protecting Adani, an Indian coal magnate. 'I don’t appreciate the manner of protest,' Birla said, adjourning the session over the opposition disruptions. The session later resumed but was adjourned for the day with the deadlock between the government and the opposition continuing. Proceedings in Parliament's upper house were also adjourned, and the Congress party was unyielding in its stance. The opposition called for a joint committee to investigate Adani’s companies, which include agriculture, renewable energy, coal and infrastructure. Adani, 62, one of Asia’s richest men, was thrust into the spotlight last week when U.S. prosecutors in New York charged him a nd seven of his associates with securities fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud, and wire fraud. The charges allege that Adani duped investors in a massive solar project in India by concealing that it was being facilitated by bribes. The indictment outlines an alleged scheme to pay about $265 million in bribes to Indian government officials. The Adani Group, in a statement last week, said the allegations by the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission against directors of Adani Green are baseless. 'The charges in the indictment are allegations and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty. All possible legal recourse will be sought,' the statement said. In the absence of a statement by the Indian government, Amit Malviya, the governing Bharatiya Janata Party’s IT head, also said in a post on the social media platform X that the U.S. charges are 'allegations and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty,' which critics interpreted as a show of support by the Modi government for the Adani Group. The controversy has already affected Adani’s interests overseas. Kenya’s president canceled multimillion-dollar deals with the Adani Group for airport modernization and energy projects. Adani will also face scrutiny in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. A Sri Lankan government spokesperson said earlier this week that it is reviewing projects to be implemented by the Adani Group in Sri Lanka. The group was set to invest over $440 million under a 20-year agreement to develop 484 megawatts of wind power in the northeastern regions of Sri Lanka and develop a terminal in the Colombo port. 'We are taking it seriously. The foreign ministry and the finance ministry are inquiring into it. We will take the decision according to the reports of both ministries,' spokesperson Nalinda Jayatissa said, Bangladesh's interim government is reviewing an agreement under which the Adani Group supplies electricity to Bangladesh from a power project in India.	https://apnews.com/article/adani-us-charges-fraud-opposition-parliament-protest-6e57a1e44c63634685361b920044a1e6	2024-11-27T22:40:20-08:00	
High-ranking military official in China placed under investigation, defense ministry says	BEIJING (AP) — China has suspended a high-ranking military official while he is being investigated, its Defense Ministry announced Thursday. The official, Miao Hua, is director of the Political Work Department on the powerful Central Military Commission that oversees the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). He is one of five members of the body that oversees the world’s largest standing military, in addition to China’s leader Xi Jinping, who heads the commission. Defense Ministry spokesperson Wu Qian said Miao is under investigation for 'serious violations of discipline,' which usually alludes to issues of corruption. It is the third recent major shakeup for China’s defense establishment. In June, China announced that former Defense Minister Li Shangfu and his predecessor Wei Fenghe were accused of corruption and expelled from the party. They were being investigated for corruption and bribery, after initially facing suspension. Yet, the high-level investigation is not likely to have any significant consequences, given Xi's tight grip on power. 'Most countries would incur at least some reputational cost to their international reputation were such frequent, high-profile personnel purges to have happened in their own armed forces – but the PRC is no ordinary country,' James Char, a research fellow at the Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies at Nanyang Technological University, in Singapore, said in an email. 'These purges can go on so long as its commander-in-chief approves of them.' In Xi's first term as Party Secretary, he was known for a multi-year campaign against corruption that has brought down numerous high-profile political rivals, and thousands of officials. This has led some to allege a widespread purge of officers suspected of conspiring with outside forces or simply being insufficiently loyal to Xi. Xi's dedication to his anti-corruption campaign has continued throughout his rule. High-ranking officers occupy an elevated position in Chinese politics and can command extensive privileges, official and unofficial. Miao being placed under investigation comes after the Financial Times reported that Defense Minister Dong Jun was under investigation for corruption. Miao's position on the commission, which is a Communist Party committee, outranks Dong and anyone who holds the position of defense minister, as Communist Party positions are more powerful than government institutions in China. Experts say a possible corruption investigation would not be a surprise, given the PLA’s history. In the 1990’s, the PLA was allowed to run businesses as the country opened up during the 'reform and opening up' period, when the country stopped many of its planned economic policies and transitioned to a more market-based economy. Miao has come up through the political department in the military and had served as the political commissar of the PLA’s Navy. He was already fairly senior before Xi came to power in 2012. 'If the investigation is about corruption, it’s not out of line with people’s expectations,' said Tiehlin Yan, deputy director at the Taiwan Center for Security Studies, who studied the PLA. 'It’s very difficult for anyone not to have have blemishes if you were a mid-level or senior cadre in the 1990’s.' Meanwhile, the Defense Ministry spokesperson Wu, said Dong was not under any investigation and called the newspaper report a 'sheer fabrication.' In response to a question about who China’s defense minister was, Wu smiled and raised his hands in a shrug. 'Why do you ask this nonsensical question? I just said this many times: Minister Dong Jun.' ___ This version has corrected the official's name to Hua not Li.	https://apnews.com/article/china-military-official-investigation-4c38fcbf89b8ed8a31c7774ce448d6f5	2024-11-27T22:29:33-08:00	
Russia strikes cities across Ukraine, targeting the country's energy infrastructure	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia is engaged in a massive missile and drone attack against Ukraine’s energy infrastructure Thursday, officials said, as fears mount about Moscow’s intentions to devastate the country's power generation capacity before winter. 'Attacks on energy facilities are happening all over Ukraine,' Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko posted on Facebook. He added that emergency power outages are being implemented nationwide. Explosions were reported in Kyiv, Kharkiv, Rivne, Khmelnytskyi, Lutsk, and many other cities in central and western Ukraine. The head of Ukraine’s presidential office, Andrii Yermak, said in a Telegram post that Russia had stockpiled missiles to strike Ukrainian infrastructure and wage war against civilians during the cold season. 'They were helped by their crazy allies, including from North Korea,' he wrote. One strike happened in the northern Volyn region. Power supply has been limited there, said Ivan Rudnytskyi, the regional military head.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-energy-infrastructure-4fd663599d47898be34aa858dcc48fdb	2024-11-27T22:12:47-08:00	
Swiss 'AI Jesus' project to bridge digital and the divine draws users' praise, as questions remain	LUCERNE, Switzerland (AP) — Would you trust an 'AI Jesus' with your innermost thoughts and troubles? Researchers and religious leaders on Wednesday released findings from a two-month experiment through art in a Catholic chapel in Switzerland, where an avatar of 'Jesus' on a computer screen — tucked into a confessional — took questions by visitors on faith, morality and modern-day woes, and offered responses based on Scripture. The idea, said the chapel’s theological assistant, was to recognize the growing importance of artificial intelligence in human lives, even when it comes to religion, and explore the limits of human trust in a machine. After the two-month run of the 'Deus in Machina' exhibit at Peter’s Chapel starting in late August, some 900 conversations from visitors – some came more than once – were transcribed anonymously. Those behind the project said it was largely a success: Visitors often came out moved or deep in thought, and found it easy to use. A small sign invited visitors to enter a confessional – chosen for its intimacy – and below a lattice screen across which penitent believers would usually speak with a priest, a green light signaled the visitor's turn to speak, and a red one came on when 'AI Jesus' on a computer screen on the other side was responding. Often, a lag time was needed to wait for the response – a testament to the technical complexities. After exiting, nearly 300 visitors filled out questionnaires that informed the report released Wednesday. Of love, war, suffering and solitude Philipp Haslbauer, an IT specialist at the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts who pulled together the technical side of the project, said the AI responsible for taking the role of 'AI Jesus' and generating responses was GPT4o by OpenAI, and an open-source version of the company’s Whisper was used for speech comprehension. The Interactive Avatar from Heygen was used to produce voice and video from a real person, he said. Haslbauer said no specific safeguards were used 'because we observed GPT4o to respond fairly well to controversial topics.' Visitors broached many topics, including true love, the afterlife, feelings of solitude, war and suffering in the world, the existence of God, plus issues like sexual abuse cases in the Catholic Church or its position on homosexuality. Most visitors described themselves as Christians, though agnostics, atheists, Muslims, Buddhists and Taoists took part too, according to a recap of the project released by the Catholic parish of Lucerne. About one-third were German speakers, but 'AI Jesus' — which is conversant in about 100 languages — also had conversations in languages like Chinese, English, French, Hungarian, Italian, Russian and Spanish. ‘Work of the Devil’? 'What was really interesting (was) to see that the people really talked with him in a serious way. They didn’t come to make jokes,' said chapel theologian Marco Schmid, who spearheaded the project. Most visitors were aged 40 to 70, and more Catholics respondents found the experience stimulating than did Protestants, the report showed. Schmid was quick to point out that the 'AI Jesus' – billed as a 'Jesus-like' persona – was an artistic experiment to get people thinking about the intersection between the digital and the divine, not substitute for human interaction or sacramental confessions with a priest, nor was it intended to save pastoral resources. The Catholic Church from the Vatican on down has been wrestling with the challenges – and possible opportunities – presented by the explosion in public interest in AI since generative artificial intelligence captured the world’s attention two years ago when ChatGPT made its debut. The Vatican has appointed a friar from a medieval Franciscan order as its top expert on AI, and a Lutheran church in Bavaria served up sermons delivered by a chatbot last year. Pope Francis, in his annual peace message for this year, pushed for an international treaty to ensure the ethical use of AI technology. Haslbauer acknowledged his own sort of Doubting Thomas moment: He’s sensitive to public reaction and has noted chatter on social media that the project is 'blasphemous' or the 'work of the devil.' 'If you read comments on the internet about it, some are very negative — which is scary,' Haslbauer, whose long-haired look featured as a basis for the image of the virtual Jesus. In a demonstration of the technology in the chapel, Haslbauer queried AI Jesus about its message for a troubled world, and about whether AI could be helpful as a way for people to find God. 'All knowledge and wisdom ultimately come from God,' the chatbot said in a soothing voice, after a pause to respond, and the image briefly crackled. 'If used wisely, AI can indeed be a tool to explore the wonders of creation, deepen our understanding of Scripture, and foster connections among people.' 'Yet it remains essential to seek God with all your heart and soul beyond any technology,' it added. A good side, and Downsides Kenneth Cukier, a journalist, author and expert with the U.S.-based nonprofit group called 'AI and Faith,' said if 'AI Jesus' helps people connect deeper to themselves and the world, it 'has to be a good thing.' 'It will lead to better individuals and a better world,' he said. 'However — and there’s a big however — this does feel a little bit infantile, and pardon my pun, machine-like.' 'The risk is that it pulls people, ultimately, farther away from that which is more meaningful, deeper and authentic in spirituality,' said Cukier, co-author of 'Big Data: A Revolution that Will Transform How We Work, Live and Think.' For Schmid, the exhibit was a pilot project — and he doesn't foresee a second coming of AI Jesus anytime soon. 'For us, it was also clear it was just a limited time that we will expose this Jesus,' he said, adding that any return would need to be done after deeper thought. 'We are discussing ... how we could revive him again,' he said, noting interest from parishes, schoolteachers, researchers and others as the project got media attention in Switzerland and beyond. 'They all are interested and would like to have this AI Jesus. So we have now a little bit to reflect on how we want to continue.' ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Conservative US influencer Candace Owens is barred from New Zealand weeks after a ban from Australia	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — The U.S. conservative political commentor Candace Owens was refused a visa to enter New Zealand for a speaking engagement because she had been banned from another country, immigration officials said Thursday. News of the ruling came weeks after neighboring Australia also rejected her visa request, citing remarks in which she denied Nazi medical experimentation on Jews in concentration camps during World War II. Owens is scheduled to speak at a series of events in several Australian cities and in Auckland, New Zealand, in February and March next year. Tickets remain on sale and there is no acknowledgement on the promoter’s website that she has been refused entry to both countries. The commentator, who has more than 3 million followers on YouTube, is accused by her detractors of promoting conspiracy theories and antisemitism and has ignited firestorms with her remarks opposing Black Lives Matter, feminism, vaccines and immigration. In March, Owens said she had parted ways with the Daily Wire, on which she had hosted an online talk show since 2021, after clashes with its founders over her remarks about Jews and her opposition to U.S. military support for Israel. She was widely criticized for comments in a YouTube video in July that minimized the Holocaust. Owens had promised Australian and New Zealand audiences a discussion of free speech and her Christian faith when she announced the speaking tour in August. But Australian officials banned her from the country in October, with Immigration Minister Tony Burke telling reporters Owens 'has the capacity to incite discord in almost every direction,' citing her remarks about the Holocaust and about Muslims. 'Australia’s national interest is best served when Candace Owens is somewhere else,' Burke said. Australian Jewish groups had urged officials to bar her from the country. New Zealand officials did not refer to Owens’ political views in a statement on Thursday. She was refused an entertainer’s work permit for New Zealand on the ground that visas legally cannot be granted to those who have been excluded from another country, said Jock Gilray, a spokesperson for the immigration agency. Owens and the Australia-based promoter, Rocksman, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.	https://apnews.com/article/candace-owens-zealand-australia-visa-eedd9b2f77a289b44a517719008f9730	2024-11-27T20:12:57-08:00	
AP PHOTOS: Millions of tons of plastic foul the world around us	On a Philippines beach, barefoot children jumped and played on shoals of plastic washed ashore in previous typhoons. Much of the world’s plastic garbage winds up in rivers that eventually carry it into the oceans. Along the way, it’s often ingested by fish, birds and other wildlife, like the trio of coots picking their way through the plastic refuse cluttering a Serbian river. Plastic, a wondrously versatile material that can be contorted into endless shapes useful in everything from construction to packaging, is also a scourge. Its use has exploded in the last half century, and global production is projected to reach 736 million tons by 2040, up 70% from 2020, without policy changes, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Only about 9% of that is recycled, and much of the rest winds up in the world all around us. It’s a problem that nations are trying to tackle in South Korea, where a final round of negotiations are underway on a legally binding treaty aimed at solutions. In Johannesburg, South Africa, a net trapped plastic garbage on the Juksei River, giving volunteers a chance to clean it up. In Jakarta, Indonesia, roadside garbage piled so high it threatened to elbow its way into traffic. And in a New Delhi shanty town, with seemingly every inch of the landscape choked with plastic waste, bags awaited sorting by collectors who hope to resell it. And in Saint-Marc, Haiti, a boy took in an ocean sunset from a perch surrounded by plastic and other garbage. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Stock market today: Asian shares are mixed after Big Tech losses pull Wall Street lower	BANGKOK (AP) — Shares were mixed Thursday in Asia after stocks on Wall Street retreated, weighed down by losses for technology shares. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index gained 0.7% to 38,400.00 and Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 advanced 0.8% to 8,473.30. South Korea's Kospi was unchanged at 2,503.01 after the central bank cut its benchmark interest rate to relieve pressure on the economy. The Bank of Korea cut its key rate by a quarter percentage point to 3% and lowered its outlook for the country’s economic growth from to 2.2% from 2.4% for this year and to 1.9% from 2.1% for 2025. Chinese shares fell as investors sold to lock in profits from recent gains. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index lost 1.3% to 19,344.07 and the Shanghai Composite index fell 0.3% to 3,299.87. U.S. markets will be closed Thursday for Thanksgiving, and will reopen for a half day on Friday. On Wednesday, the S&amp;P 500 fell 0.4% to 5,998.74, even though more stocks in the index notched gains than ended lower. The loss snapped a seven-day winning streak for the benchmark index. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3%, its first loss after five gains, to 44,722.06. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 remain near the all-time highs they set on Tuesday. The Nasdaq composite, which is heavily weighted with technology stocks, fell 0.6% to 19,060.48. Losses for tech heavyweights like Nvidia, Microsoft and Broadcom were the drag on the market. Semiconductor giant Nvidia fell 1.2%. Its huge value gives it outsized influence on market indexes. Microsoft fell 1.2% and Broadcom finished 3.1% lower. Several personal computer makers also helped pull the market lower following their latest earnings reports. HP sank 11.4% after giving investors a weaker-than-expected earnings forecast for its current quarter. Dell slid 12.2% after its latest quarterly revenue fell short of Wall Street forecasts. Gains for financial and health care companies helped temper the market's losses. Berkshire Hathaway rose 0.9% and Merck &amp; Co. added 1.5%. The Commerce Department reported that the U.S. economy expanded at a healthy 2.8% annual pace from July through September, leaving its initial estimate unchanged. The growth was driven by strong consumer spending and a surge in exports. Consumers have been driving economic growth, but the latest round of earnings reports from retailers shows a mixed and more cautious picture. Department store operator Nordstrom fell 8.1% after warning investors about a trend toward weakening sales that started in late October. Clothing retailer Urban Outfitters jumped 18.3% after beating analysts’ third-quarter financial forecasts. Consumers are feeling the pinch of higher prices: The government's personal consumption expenditures index, or PCE, rose to 2.3% in October from 2.1% in September. Overall, inflation has been falling broadly since it peaked more than two years ago. The PCE, which is the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, was just below 7.3% in June of 2022. Another measure of inflation, the consumer price index, peaked at 9.1% at the same time. The latest data suggest the decline in inflation is stalling as it nears the Fed's target of 2%. The central bank started raising its benchmark interest rate from near-zero in early 2022 to a two-decade high by the middle of 2023 and held it there until it began cutting it in September. A second cut followed in November. Wall Street expects a similar quarter-point cut at the central bank's upcoming meeting in December, but President-elect Donald Trump has said he plans to impose sweeping new tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China when he takes office in January. That could raise prices on many products, raising inflation and prompting the Fed to rethink future cuts to interest rates. In other dealings early Thursday, U.S. benchmark crude oil lost 15 cents to $68.57 per barrel, while Brent crude, the international standard, also shed 15 cents to $72.15 per barrel. The dollar rose to 151.56 Japanese yen from 151.12 yen. The euro fell to $1.0555 from $1.0567. ___ AP Business Writers Damian J.

Everything is expensive!' Bolivia faces a shocking economic collapse	EL ALTO, Bolivia (AP) — Fuel is rapidly becoming one of Bolivia’s scarcest commodities. Long lines of vehicles snake for several kilometers outside gas stations all over Bolivia, once South America’s second-largest producer of natural gas. Some of the queues don’t budge for days. While frustration builds, drivers like Victor García now eat, sleep and socialize around their stationary trucks, waiting to buy just a few gallons of diesel — unless the station runs dry. 'We don’t know what’s going to happen, but we’re going to be worse off,' said García, 66, who inched closer to the pump Tuesday as the hours ticked by in El Alto, a bare-bones sprawl beside Bolivia's capital in the Andean altiplano. Bolivia's monthslong fuel crunch comes as the nation's foreign currency reserves plummet, leaving Bolivians unable to find U.S. dollars at banks and exchange houses. Imported goods that were once commonplace have become scarce. The fuel crisis has created a sense that the country is coming undone, disrupting economic activity and everyday life for millions of people, hurting commerce and farm production and sending food prices soaring. Mounting public anger has driven crowds into the streets in recent weeks, piling pressure on leftist President Luis Arce to ease the suffering ahead of a tense election next year. 'We want effective solutions to the shortage of fuel, dollars and the increase in food prices,' said Reinerio Vargas, the vice rector of Gabriel René Moreno Autonomous University in the eastern province of Santa Cruz, where hundreds of desperate truckers and residents flooded main squares Tuesday to vent their anger at Arce’s inaction and demand early elections. In a similar eruption of discontent, protesters shouting 'Everything is expensive!' marched through the streets of the capital, La Paz, last week. Bolivians say Arce's image has suffered not only because of the crisis but also because his government insists that it doesn't exist. 'Diesel sales are in the process of returning to normal,' Economy Minister Marcelo Montenegro said Tuesday. Arce has repeatedly vowed that his government will end the fuel shortages and lower the prices of basic goods by arbitrary deadlines. On Nov. 10, he again promised he would 'resolve this issue' in 10 days. As the deadlines come and go, the black market currency exchange rate has risen to nearly 40% more than the official rate. Arce's office did not respond to interview requests. 'The queues are getting longer and longer,' said 38-year-old driver Ramiro Morales, who needed a bathroom after four hours in line Tuesday but feared losing his place if he went searching for one. 'People are exhausted.' It’s a shocking turnaround for the landlocked nation of 12 million people that was a South American economic success story in the 2000s, when the commodities bonanza generated tens of billions of dollars under the nation’s first Indigenous president, former President Evo Morales. Morales, Arce’s one-time mentor, is his present-day rival in the fight to be the ruling party’s candidate next year. But when the commodities boom ended, prices slumped and gas production dwindled. Now, Bolivia spends an estimated $56 million a week to import most of its gasoline and diesel from Argentina, Paraguay and Russia. Economy Minister Montenegro on Tuesday pledged that the government would continue providing fuel subsidies that critics say it can’t afford. Banners from two years ago boasting that Bolivia’s inflation is the lowest in South America still greet tourists arriving at El Alto International Airport. Now, inflation is among the highest in the region. Fuel shortages prevent farmers from getting their produce to distribution centers and markets, triggering a sharp price hike for food staples. Last week in La Paz and neighboring El Alto, hungry Bolivians jostled in long lines to buy rice after much-delayed shipments finally arrived from Santa Cruz, the country's economic engine some 850 kilometers (528 miles) away. With the diesel shortage affecting everything from the operation of tractors to the sourcing of machinery parts, the shortage is also hurting farmers during the crucial planting season. 'Without diesel, there is no food for 2025,' said Klaus Frerking, the vice president of the Eastern Agricultural Chamber of Bolivia. The prices of potatoes, onions and milk have doubled in El Alto’s main wholesale food market in the past month, vendors said, overshooting the country’s nearly 8% inflation rate. Nervous Bolivians are cutting back on their consumption. 'You have to search a lot to find the cheapest food,' said 67-year-old Angela Mamani, struggling to pull together meals for her six grandchildren at El Alto's open-air market Tuesday. She planned to buy vegetables but didn’t have enough cash and went home empty-handed. This week, Arce's government presented a 2025 budget — with a 12% increase in spending — that drew backlash from lawmakers and business leaders who said it would lead to more debt and more inflation. While the governing Movement Toward Socialism party tears itself apart in the power struggle between Arce and Morales, both politicians have seen the economic morass as a way to strengthen their positions ahead of 2025 elections. 'They deny there are problems. They blame external contexts and conflicts,' said Bolivian economic analyst Gonzalo Chávez. Morales' supporters last month launched 24-day protest partly targeting Arce’s handling of the economy that blocked main roads and stranded commercial shipments, costing the government billions of dollars. Security forces broke up the rallies almost a month ago. But on Tuesday, Arce's government continued to blame Morales' blockades for spawning the ubiquitous fuel lines. 'We need change,' said Geanina García, a 31-year-old architect scouring the grocery hub of El Alto for cheap deals — a once-routine errand that she said had turned into a nightmare. 'People don’t live off politics, they live day to day, off of what they produce and what they earn.' ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/bolivia-fuel-crisis-economy-arce-president-gas-b43cff9dcfebdca40d35aad6911f055f	2024-11-27T19:10:42-08:00	
South Korea's central bank cuts key interest rate to nurse a slower economy	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s central bank lowered its key policy rate for a second straight month and said the country’s economy will grow at a slower pace than it initially anticipated. Following a policy meeting, the Bank of Korea cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point to 3%. The bank lowered its outlook for the country’s economic growth to 2.2% from 2.4% for this year and to 1.9% from 2.1% for 2025. The bank is taking steps to lower borrowing costs despite the lingering effects of high inflation and alarming levels of household debt, as the economy falters. The bank cut its policy rate by a quarter percentage point to 3.25% in October in its first rate cut since May 2020 in the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic. The bank said the country’s trade-dependent economy faces growing uncertainty in global economic trends and inflation that could be impacted by the policies of President-elect Donald Trump and ongoing geopolitical conflicts. Since winning reelection, Trump has vowed to slap huge new tariffs on foreign products entering the United States, including those from Mexico, Canada and China, which he insists will create more domestic jobs and shrink the federal deficit. In a news conference, Bank of Korea Governor Rhee Chang Yong said the bank faced a difficult decision over whether to freeze the rate or lower it. But a bigger-than-expected decline in exports during the last quarter and Trump’s election win moved the needle. 'We had been contemplating the uncertainties that would be brought by the results of the U.S. presidential election, but a ‘red sweep’ where the House and Senate were all won by one side was something we did not anticipate,' Rhee said. Rhee said Trump’s win 'increased the uncertainty in policy, not only for us but for the world,' but said it was too early to predict how Trump’s steps on tariffs would impact South Korean exports. The rate cut could help spur domestic consumption by putting more money into the economy, but is unlikely to reverse the slowdown in exports, which is due to long-term competitiveness issues in key industries that should be addressed through policy changes or restructuring, Rhee said. Rhee said three of the six monetary policy committee members believe that the bank should lower the rate further within the next three months to help revive the sluggish economy. The bank will closely monitor trends in household debt and property prices before considering another cut, he said. The bank said in a statement that South Korea’s economy has been losing momentum due to weak domestic spending, slowing exports and rising unemployment. 'Going forward, domestic consumption will see a mild recovery, but the recovery in exports is likely to be weaker than initially anticipated due to intensifying competition and strengthening of protectionist trade policies in key industries,' it said.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-rate-cut-economy-b216a017303bad26a008ceae870e9111	2024-11-27T17:36:37-08:00	
Ruling may further delay count of Puerto Rico's still-uncertified votes in Nov. 5 elections	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — The U.S. territory of Puerto Rico has yet to produce a certified vote tally for a single district almost a month after holding historic general elections. Then on Wednesday, a judge issued a ruling that sparked an outcry and threatened to further delay the certification process as the Jan. 2 swearing-in looms. The judge, in response to a lawsuit, ordered Puerto Rico’s State Elections Commission to count early votes following ID verification even if the postal address used to request those votes is different from the one in the general voter registration. 'Contrary to what some actors in our society may have encouraged in public opinion, our legal framework in electoral matters is covered with guarantees of reliability, which leave no room for speculation or doubts about the validity of early votes,' Judge Raúl A. Candelario López wrote. The Nov. 21 lawsuit was filed by a dozen voters affiliated with the pro-statehood New Progressive Party, which won the gubernatorial race, according to preliminary results. The ruling noted that those voters alleged 'their rights are being violated since they requested early voting, complied with all the requirements for it, and their votes are being subject to additional requirements without any legal basis.' The judge’s decision angered many including Karla Angleró, electoral commissioner for the opposing Popular Democratic Party, one of Puerto Rico’s two main parties, She said the party would appeal Wednesday’s ruling. In September, Angleró and electoral commissioners from other parties agreed that if they uncovered addresses that didn't match, officials would call people to confirm that they indeed requested an early vote to prevent any fraud. Angleró and other commissioners had recently requested that the elections commission investigate how more than 40 ballots with different residential addresses were requested from the same P.O. box in the southern coastal town of Santa Isabel. 'We’ve been waiting for weeks,' she told reporters on Wednesday of the investigation. Judicial officials already are investigating allegations made before Nov. 2 about electoral crimes including people who said they received confirmations for early voting when they had made no such request. As those investigations continue, workers are certifying ballots with the aim to finish by Dec. 20 or 22, according to Jessika Padilla, alternate president for the elections commission. The aim was to finalize the district of the capital of San Juan on Wednesday, but that was pushed back to Sunday, she told reporters. Numerous obstacles have delayed the certification process, including an increase in write-in votes and a flurry of errors detected in bedside ballots, prompting all electoral commissioners to agree to start counting more than 60,000 such votes from scratch. The delay prompted electoral commissioners last week to temporarily halt the counting of ballots cast in a nonbinding referendum also held Nov. 2 on Puerto Rico’s political status so they could focus on election ballots. Local law dictates the certification process must be completed by Dec. 31.	https://apnews.com/article/puerto-rico-elections-judge-early-voting-79e519c24c9c8bce0011c06048f06b52	2024-11-27T14:55:22-08:00	
The Australian Senate debates the world's first social media ban for children under 16	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — The Australian Senate was debating a ban on children younger than 16 years old from social media Thursday after the House of Representatives overwhelmingly supported the age restriction. The bill that would make platforms including TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram liable for fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for systemic failures to prevent young children from holding accounts. It is likely to be passed by the Senate on Thursday, the Parliament’s final session for the year and potentially the last before elections, which are due within months. The major parties’ support for the ban all but guarantees the legislation will become law. But many child welfare and mental health advocates are concerned about unintended consequences. Unaligned Sen. Jacqui Lambie complained about the limited amount of time the government gave the Senate to debate the age restriction, which she described as 'undercooked.' 'I thought this was a good idea. A lot of people out there thought it was a good idea until we looked at the detail and, let's be honest, there's no detail,' Lambie told the Senate. Opposition Sen. Maria Kovacic said the bill was not radical but necessary. 'The core focus of this legislation is simple: It demands that social media companies take reasonable steps to identify and remove underage users from their platforms,' Kovacic told the Senate. 'This is a responsibility these companies should have been fulfilling long ago, but for too long they have shirked these responsibilities in favor of profit,' she added. Sen. David Shoebridge, from the minor Greens party, said mental health experts agreed that the ban could dangerously isolate many children who used social media to find support. 'This policy will hurt vulnerable young people the most, especially in regional communities and especially the LGBTQI community, by cutting them off,' Shoebridge told the Senate. The House of Representatives on Wednesday overwhelmingly carried the bill 102 votes to 13. Once the legislation becomes law, the platforms would have one year to work out how they could implement the ban before penalties are enforced. The platforms complained that the law would be unworkable, and urged the Senate to delay the vote until at least June next year when a government-commissioned evaluation of age assurance technologies made its report on how young children could be excluded. Critics argue the government is attempting to convince parents it is protecting their children ahead of general elections due by May. The government hopes that voters will reward it for responding to parents' concerns about their children's addiction to social media. Some argue the legislation could cause more harm than it prevents. Criticisms include that the legislation was rushed through Parliament without adequate scrutiny, is ineffective, poses privacy risks for all users, and undermines parental authority to make decisions for their children. Opponents of the bill also argue the ban would isolate children, deprive them of the positive aspects of social media, drive them to the dark web, discourage children too young for social media to report harm and reduce incentives for platforms to improve online safety.	https://apnews.com/article/australia-social-media-ban-children-83aa2ed05334732e794542f00c3590b0	2024-11-27T13:56:43-08:00	
Canada is already examining tariffs on certain US items following Trump's tariff threat	TORONTO (AP) — Canada is already examining possible retaliatory tariffs on certain items from the United States should President-elect Donald Trump follow through on his threat to impose sweeping tariffs on Canadian products, a senior official said Wednesday. Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on products from Canada and Mexico if the countries don't stop what he called the flow of drugs and migrants across southern and northern borders. He said he would impose a 25% tax on all products entering the U.S. from Canada and Mexico as one of his first executive orders. A Canadian government official said Canada is preparing for every eventuality and has started thinking about what items to target with tariffs in retaliation. The official stressed no decision has been made. The person spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly. When Trump imposed higher tariffs during his first term in office, other countries responded with retaliatory tariffs of their own. Canada, for instance, announced billions of new duties in 2018 against the U.S. in a tit-for-tat response to new taxes on Canadian steel and aluminum. Many of the U.S. products were chosen for their political rather than economic impact. For example, Canada imports $3 million worth of yogurt from the U.S. annually and most comes from one plant in Wisconsin, home state of then-House Speaker Paul Ryan. That product was hit with a 10% duty. Another product on the list was whiskey, which comes from Tennessee and Kentucky, the latter of which is the home state of then-Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell. Trump made the threat Monday while railing against an influx of illegal migrants, even though the numbers at Canadian border pale in comparison to the southern border. The U.S. Border Patrol made 56,530 arrests at the Mexican border in October alone — and 23,721 arrests at the Canadian one between October 2023 and September 2024. Canadian officials say lumping Canada in with Mexico is unfair but say they are happy to work with the Trump administration to lower the numbers from Canada. The Canadians are also worried about a influx north of migrants if Trump follows through with his plan for mass deportations. Trump also railed about fentanyl from Mexico and Canada, even though seizures from the Canadian border pale in comparison to the Mexican border. U.S. customs agents seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the Canadian border last fiscal year, compared with 21,100 pounds at the Mexican border. Canadian officials argue their country is not the problem and that tariffs will have severe implications for both countries. Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states. Nearly $3.6 billion Canadian (US$2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border each day. About 60% of U.S. crude oil imports are from Canada, and 85% of U.S. electricity imports are from Canada. Canada is also the largest foreign supplier of steel, aluminum and uranium to the U.S. and has 34 critical minerals and metals that the Pentagon is eager for and investing in for national security. 'Canada is essential to the United States’ domestic energy supply,' Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said. Trump has pledged to cut American energy bills in half within 18 months, something that could be made harder if a 25% premium is added to Canadian oil imports. In 2023, Canadian oil accounted for almost two-thirds of total U.S. oil imports and about one-fifth of the U.S. oil supply. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is holding a emergency virtual meeting on Wednesday with the leaders of Canada's provinces, who want Trudeau to negotiate a bilateral trade deal with the United States that excludes Mexico. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Wednesday that her administration is already working up a list of possible retaliatory tariffs 'if the situation comes to that.'	https://apnews.com/article/canada-trump-tariffs-trudeau-c741393c2f7c7545e9714839cfbbda45	2024-11-27T11:51:34-08:00	
Trump selects longtime adviser Keith Kellogg as special envoy for Ukraine and Russia	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump said Wednesday that he has chosen Keith Kellogg, a highly decorated retired three-star general, to serve as his special envoy for Ukraine and Russia. Kellogg, who is one of the architects of a staunchly conservative policy book that lays out an 'America First' national security agenda for the incoming administration, will come into the role as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine enters its third year in February. Trump made the announcement on his Truth Social account, and said 'He was with me right from the beginning! Together, we will secure PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH, and Make America, and the World, SAFE AGAIN!' Kellogg, an 80 year-old retired Army lieutenant general who has long been Trump’s top adviser on defense issues, served as national security adviser to Vice President Mike Pence, was chief of staff of the National Security Council and then stepped in as an acting security adviser for Trump after Michael Flynn resigned. As special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Kellogg will have to navigate an increasingly untenable war between the two nations. The Biden administration has begun urging Ukraine to quickly increase the size of its military by drafting more troops and revamping its mobilization laws to allow for the conscription of troops as young as 18. The White House has pushed more than $56 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since the start of Russia’s February 2022 invasion and expects to send billions more to Kyiv before Biden leaves office in less than months. Trump has criticized the billions that the Biden administration has poured into Ukraine. Washington has recently stepped up weapons shipments and has forgiven billions in loans provided to Kyiv. The incoming Republican president has said he could end the war in 24 hours, comments that appear to suggest he would press Ukraine to surrender territory that Russia now occupies. As a co-chairman of the American First Policy Institute’s Center for American Security, Kellogg wrote several of the chapters in the group’s policy book. The book, like the Heritage Foundation’s 'Project 2025,' is a move to lay out a Trump national security agenda and avoid the mistakes of 2016 when he entered the White House largely unprepared. Kellogg in April wrote that 'bringing the Russia-Ukraine war to a close will require strong, America First leadership to deliver a peace deal and immediately end the hostilities between the two warring parties.' Trump's proposed national security advisor U.S. Rep. Michael Waltz (R-Fla.) tweeted Wednesday that 'Keith has dedicated his life to defending our great country and is committed to bringing the war in Ukraine to a peaceful resolution.' Kellogg was a character in multiple Trump investigations dating to his first term. He was among the administration officials who listened in on the July 2019 call between Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy in which Trump prodded his Ukrainian counterpart to pursue investigations into the Bidens. The call, which Kellogg would later say did not raise any concerns on his end, was at the center of the first of two House impeachment cases against Trump, who was acquitted by the Senate both times. On Jan. 6, 2021, hours before pro-Trump rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol, Kellogg, who was then Pence’s national security adviser, listened in on a heated call in which Trump told his vice president to object or delay the certification in Congress of President Joe Biden ’s victory. He later told House investigators that he recalled Trump saying to Pence words to the effect of: 'You’re not tough enough to make the call.' ___ Baldor reported from Washington.

Trump's tariffs in his first term did little to alter the economy, but this time could be different	WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump loved to use tariffs on foreign goods during his first presidency. But their impact was barely noticeable in the overall economy, even if their aftershocks were clear in specific industries. The data show they never fully delivered on his promised factory jobs. Nor did they provoke the avalanche of inflation that critics feared. This time, though, his tariff threats might be different. The president-elect is talking about going much bigger — on a potential scale that creates more uncertainty about whether he'll do what he says and what the consequences could be. 'There's going to be a lot more tariffs, I mean, he's pretty clear,' said Michael Stumo, the CEO of Coalition for a Prosperous America, a group that has supported import taxes to help domestic manufacturing. The president-elect posted on social media Monday that on his first day in office he would impose 25% tariffs on all goods imported from Mexico and Canada until those countries satisfactorily stop illegal immigration and the flow of illegal drugs such as fentanyl into the United States. Those tariffs could essentially blow up the North American trade pact that Trump’s team negotiated during his initial term. Chinese imports would face additional tariffs of 10% until Beijing cracks down on the production of materials used in making fentanyl, Trump posted. Democrats and business groups warn of risks from Trump's tariff threats Business groups were quick to warn about rapidly escalating inflation, while Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said she would counter the move with tariffs on U.S. products. House Democrats put together legislation to strip a president’s ability to unilaterally apply tariffs this drastic, warning that they would likely lead to higher prices for autos, shoes, housing and groceries. Sheinbaum said Wednesday that her administration is already working up a list of possible retaliatory tariffs 'if the situation comes to that.' 'The economy department is preparing it,' Sheinbaum said. 'If there are tariffs, Mexico would increase tariffs, it is a technical task about what would also benefit Mexico,' she said, suggesting her country would impose targeted import duties on U.S. goods in sensitive areas. Similarly, the Canadian government has also started to explore retaliatory tariffs if Trump tackes action. House Democrats on Tuesday introduced a bill that would require congressional approval for a president to impose tariffs due to claims of a national emergency, a largely symbolic action given Republicans' coming control of both the House and Senate. 'This legislation would enable Congress to limit this sweeping emergency authority and put in place the necessary Congressional oversight before any president – Democrat or Republican – could indiscriminately raise costs on the American people through tariffs,' said Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Wash. But for Trump, tariffs are now a tested tool that seems less politically controversial even if the mandate he received in November's election largely involved restraining inflation. The tariffs he imposed on China in his first term were continued by President Joe Biden, a Democrat who even expanded tariffs and restrictions on the world's second largest economy. Biden administration officials looked at removing Trump's tariffs in order to bring down inflationary pressures, only to find they were unlikely to help significantly. Tariffs were 'so new and unique that it freaked everybody out in 2017,' said Stumo, but they are now seen as part of the policy toolkit by the United States and other countries. Trump's first term tariffs had a modest impact on economy Trump imposed tariffs on solar panels and washing machines at the start of 2018, moves that might have pushed up prices in those sectors even though they also overlapped with plans to open washing machine plants in Tennessee and South Carolina. His administration also levied tariffs on steel and aluminum, including against allies. He then increased tariffs on China, leading to a trade conflict and a limited 2020 agreement that failed to produce the promised Chinese purchases of U.S. goods. Still, the dispute changed relations with China as more U.S. companies looked for alternative suppliers in other countries. Economic research also found the United States may have sacrificed some of its 'soft power' as the Chinese population began to watch fewer American movies. The Federal Reserve kept inflation roughly on target, but factory construction spending never jumped in a way that suggested a lasting gain in manufacturing jobs. Separate economic research found the tariff war with China did nothing economically for the communities hurt by offshoring, but it did help Trump and Republicans in those communities politically. When Trump first became president in 2017, the federal government collected $34.6 billion in customs, duties and fees. That sum more than doubled under Trump to $70.8 billion in 2019, according to Office of Management and Budget records. While that sum might seem meaningful, it was relatively small compared to the overall economy. America's gross domestic product is now $29.3 trillion, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The total tariffs collected in the United States would equal less than 0.3% of GDP. Trump wants much more far-reaching tariffs going forward The new tariffs being floated by Trump now are dramatically larger and there could be far more significant impacts. If Mexico, Canada, and China faced the additional tariffs proposed by Trump on all goods imported to the United States, that could be roughly equal to $266 billion in tax collections, a number that does not assume any disruptions in trade or retaliatory moves by other countries. The cost of those taxes would likely be borne by U.S. families, importers and domestic and foreign companies in the form of higher prices or lower profits. Former Biden administration officials said they worried that companies could piggyback on Trump's tariffs — if they're imposed — as a rationale to raise their prices. This would mirror price increases by many companies in 2022 that were made possible because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which pushed up food and energy prices and gave the companies cover to further raise their own prices. 'I’m very worried about the total indiscriminate tariffs on more than China — that it gives cover to firms to jack up prices,' said Jen Harris, a former Biden White House official who is now director of the Economy and Society Initiative at the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation. But what Trump didn't really spell out is what might cause him to back down on tariffs and declare a victory. What he is creating instead with his tariff threats is a sense of uncertainty as companies and countries await the details to figure out what all of this could mean. 'We know the key economic policy priorities of the incoming Trump administration, but we don’t know how or when they will be addressed,' said Greg Daco, chief U.S. economist at EY-Parthenon. __ AP writer Mark Stevenson contributed to this report from Mexico City.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-china-mexico-canada-fentanyl-inflation-cf905e75e863511baef959a80ee2eea2	2024-11-27T09:24:21-08:00

White House pressing Ukraine to draft 18-year-olds so it has enough troops to battle Russia	WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden's administration is urging Ukraine to quickly increase the size of its military by drafting more troops and revamping its mobilization laws to allow for the conscription of those as young as 18. A senior Biden administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private consultations, said Wednesday that the outgoing Democratic administration wants Ukraine to lower the mobilization age to 18 from the current age of 25 to help expand the pool of fighting-age men available to help a badly outnumbered Ukraine in its nearly three-year-old war with Russia. The official said 'the pure math' of Ukraine's situation now is that it needs more troops in the fight. Currently Ukraine is not mobilizing or training enough soldiers to replace its battlefield losses while keeping pace with Russia's growing military, the official added. The White House has pushed more than $56 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since the start of Russia's February 2022 invasion and expects to send billions more to Kyiv before Biden leaves office in less than months. But with time running out, the Biden White House is also sharpening its viewpoint that Ukraine has the weaponry it needs and now must dramatically increase its troop levels if it's going to stay in the fight with Russia. The official said the Ukrainians believe they need about 160,000 additional troops, but the U.S. administration believes they probably will need more than that. More than 1 million Ukrainians are now in uniform, including the National Guard and other units. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been hearing concerns from allies in other Western capitals as well that Ukraine has a troop level problem and not an arms problem, according to European officials who requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive diplomatic conversations. The European allies have stressed that the lack of depth means that it may soon become untenable for Ukraine to continue to operate in Russia’s Kursk border region. The situation in Kursk has become further complicated by the arrival of thousands of North Korean troops, who have come to help Moscow try to claw back the land seized in a Ukrainian incursion this year. The stepped-up push on Ukraine to strengthen its fighting ranks comes as Ukraine braces for President-elect Donald Trump to take office on Jan. 20. The Republican said he would bring about a swift end to the war and has raised uncertainty about whether his administration would continue the vital U.S. military support for Ukraine. 'There are no easy answers to Ukraine’s serious manpower shortage, but lowering the draft age would help,' said Bradley Bowman, senior director of the Center on Military and Political Power at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. 'These are obviously difficult decisions for a government and society that has already endured so much due to Russia’s invasion.' Ukraine has taken steps to broaden the pool of draft-eligible men, but the efforts have only scratched the surface against a much larger Russian military. In April, Ukraine’s parliament passed a series of laws, including one lowering its draft-eligible age for men from 27 to 25, aimed at broadening the universe of men who could be called on to join the grinding war. Those laws also did away with some draft exemptions and created an online registry for recruits. They were expected to add about 50,000 troops, far short of what Zelenskyy said at the time was needed. Zelenskyy has consistently stated that he has no plans to lower the mobilization age. A senior Ukrainian official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity, said Ukraine does not have enough equipment to match the scale of its ongoing mobilization efforts. The official said Ukrainian officials see the push to the lower the draft age as part of an effort by some Western partners to deflect attention from their own delays in providing equipment or belated decisions. The official cited as an example the delay in giving Ukraine permission to use longer-range weapons to strike deeper into Russian territory. The Ukrainians do not see lowering the draft age to recruit more soldiers as a substitute for countering Russia’s advantage in equipment and weaponry, the official said. Conscription has been a sensitive matter in Ukraine throughout the war. Russia’s own problems with adequate troop levels and planning early in the war prevented Moscow from taking full advantage of its edge. But the tide has shifted and the U.S. says the Ukrainian shortage can no longer be overlooked. Some Ukrainians have expressed worry that further lowering the minimum conscription age and taking more young adults out of the workforce could backfire by further harming the war-ravaged economy. The senior Biden administration official added that the administration believes that Ukraine can also optimize its current force by more aggressively dealing with soldiers who desert or go absent without leave. ___ AP White House correspondent Zeke Miller and AP writer Hanna Arhirova in Kyiv contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-war-biden-draft-08e3bad195585b7c3d9662819cc5618f	2024-11-27T07:43:55-08:00	
US sanctions more allies of Maduro over alleged post-election crackdown in Venezuela	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — The United States has imposed sanctions on an additional 21 allies of President Nicolás Maduro, accusing them on Wednesday of perpetrating some of the repression with which officials in Venezuela responded to July's disputed presidential election. The security and cabinet-level officials sanctioned by the Department of the Treasury include the head of the nation's corrections agency, the director of an intelligence service and the minister of Maduro’s Office of the President. They joined a list of dozens of sanctioned Venezuelans that includes the head of the country’s high court, ministers and prosecutors. The Biden administration last week recognized Venezuelan opposition candidate Edmundo González as that nation’s 'president-elect.' The U.S. also on Wednesday placed visa restrictions on additional individuals it accused of repressing Venezuelans after the July 28 election. While Maduro declared victory in the election, he and his government have refused to show vote tallies backing his claim. González left Venezuela in September for exile in Spain after a warrant was issued for his arrest in connection with an investigation into the publishing of vote tallies. The former diplomat, who represented the main opposition parties, claimed to have won the presidential election by a wide margin. In September, the U.S. government imposed sanctions against 16 allies of Maduro, accusing them of obstructing the vote and carrying out human rights abuses. The effect of the individual sanctions and visa restrictions announced Wednesday is unclear. Previously punished Maduro loyalists still hold powerful in Venezuela’s government. Venezuelan lawmakers on Tuesday continued the debate over a bill that would catalogue economic sanctions as a crime against humanity and allow the prosecution of anyone who expresses support for the measures.	https://apnews.com/article/us-sanctions-venezuela-maduro-allies-election-3817ae194130232eaae5309603691de1	2024-11-27T07:08:32-08:00	
The UK will consult on sales targets for automakers during the transition to electric vehicles	LONDON (AP) — Britain’s new Labour government will launch a consultation on auto manufacturers' sales targets during the transition to electric vehicles, following the decision by Stellantis, the owner of Vauxhall, to close its van factory in southern England at the potential cost of 1,100 jobs. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told lawmakers Wednesday that the problems encountered by Stellantis in the transition to electric vehicles are not unique, adding that the government will do all it can to prevent the plant's closure. Stellantis blamed its decision Tuesday to close its plant in Luton on the U.K.'s 'stringent' zero-emission vehicle mandate, or ZEV, which sets strict targets for manufacturers. With demand in many parts of the world the world for electric vehicles weaker than anticipated, despite the discounts on offer, it is increasingly expensive for carmakers to turn a profit, especially with sluggish global growth and relatively high interest rates. Other manufacturers across Europe, including Ford and Volkswagen, recently announced plans to close some operations in light of targets they are struggling to meet. The mandate in the U.K. requires major car manufacturers to have zero-emission — in effect, purely electric — vehicles make up 22% of their sales fleet this year, increasing to 28% in 2025 and rising further in subsequent years. If a manufacturer does not hit the targets, it is fined 15,000 pounds ($19,000) for every vehicle that it sells that does not comply with the mandate. The targets were laid out two years ago by the previous Conservative administration, which set a deadline of 2035 for phasing out the sale of new petrol and diesel-powered cars. Reynolds confirmed plans to review the ZEV mandate as part of a consultation on the new Labour government’s plan to ban the sale of new 'purely petrol and diesel' cars by 2030. 'Car manufacturers around the world are battling with increased costs, supply chain issues and changing consumer demand in a highly competitive, fast-evolving market,' he said. In its manifesto for government ahead of the July 4 election, Labour promised a 'phase-out date of 2030 for new cars with internal combustion engines.' That caused industry anxiety over the future of hybrids, which use electric batteries along with petrol or diesel power. 'We will be shortly fast-tracking a consultation on our manifesto commitment to end the sales of new purely petrol and diesel cars by 2030,' Reynolds said. 'But we will use that consultation to engage with industry on the previous government’s ZEV transition mandate and the flexibilities contained within it.' His use of the term 'purely' has been interpreted as suggesting that hybrid vehicles can still be sold after 2030. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, the industry's lobby group in the U.K., insisted that its members remain 'committed to delivering a decarbonised road transport sector' but that the ZEV mandate will cost automakers around 6 billion pounds ($7.5 billion) this year alone. 'We need an urgent review of the automotive market and the regulation intended to drive it,' the group's chief executive Mike Hawes said. 'Not because we want to water down any commitments, but because delivery matters more than notional targets.' Rather than changing the current rules, environmental campaigners suggest the government should make electric vehicles more appealing, potentially by giving new owners tax advantages or reducing the cost of on-street charging via subsidies. 'Chopping and changing policies damages consumer demand and undermines investor confidence,' said Nick Davies, head of climate policy at the London-based Green Alliance.	https://apnews.com/article/stellantis-automakers-electric-vehicles-britain-3aabb665fe0fd3935a370b499a8c5d02	2024-11-27T07:07:49-08:00	
Agribusiness-friendly states in Brazil try to undo forest protections	BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) — Several states in Brazil are trying to rid themselves of rainforest protections, bowing to pressure from cattle ranchers and soybean growers to cut down trees and expand agriculture. Their efforts run counter to those of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who returned to power last year and has made significant strides in curbing Amazon deforestation. They also threaten Brazil’s commitment to halt deforestation by 2030. Loss of forest is the country’s largest source of carbon emissions. 'We are detecting a well-coordinated wave of setbacks. The efforts to reduce deforestation remain highly fragile in some regions,' said Alice Thuault, executive director of Instituto Centro de Vida, an environmental nonprofit based in Mato Grosso state. A coalition of organizations that keeps watch on supply chains, the Accountability Framework initiative (AFi), also referred to the trend as 'a major setback.' Brazil’s nine Amazonian states are crucial for preserving forest. Together, they manage almost 220,000 square miles (564,000 square kilometers) of conservation lands and 12,600 square miles (32,600 square kilometers) of public forests that have no protective designation, a total area roughly the size of Ukraine. In Acre state, a law approved unanimously in August allows the privatization of almost 347 square miles (900 square kilometers) of protected forest, an area approximately the size of New York City. The stated goal is to legalize the status of people who have illegally moved into five forested conservation units. The state and its leading farmers´ organizations are finding common cause with Brazil´s communist party and state lawmaker Edvaldo Magalhães. In a speech in August, he said the new environmental legislation, which also lowers penalties for illegal deforestation, will benefit 40,000 small farmers. He said it will increase protected forest area, although he has not said how. Magalhães didn't return requests for an interview. Acre’s new legislation has garnered strong support from agribusiness organizations, which have long advocated for loosening rainforest protections. 'The more forest, the more poverty,' said Assuero Veronez, president of the Federation of Agriculture and Livestock of Acre, during a speech in the state parliament in April 2023. Veronez, a cattle rancher who migrated from Brazil’s Southeast to Acre, argues that forests don't generate income and they occupy land that could be used for agriculture. 'That hectare of forest — there is soil underneath it. If we cannot remove the forest, we cannot produce,' he said. Veronez did not respond to requests for comment from the Associated Press. Passage of the legislation prompted Acre Environment Secretary Julie Messias to resign. 'The new legislation poses serious risks and may not be constitutional,' Messias said. It's crucial for people to get legal status, but that has to be done consistent with Brazil's laws on forest conservation, she said. Acre Governor Gladson Cameli signed the law, but delayed its implementation until January 1 to evaluate whether it is legally binding. The prospect that the protected areas in Acre could be privatized led to a surge in deforestation, according to a satellite image analysis requested by the AP from the nonprofit Amazon Institute of People and the Environment. From August to October, illegal deforestation in four protected areas surged more than threefold over the year before, to roughly the area of six Central Parks. The damage was much worse in neighboring Rondonia state, where the Assembly and local government are in court seeking to annul 11 conservation units and reduce two others. In two of them alone, Guajara-Mirim and Soldado da Borracha, fires that were deliberately set destroyed a combined area of 668 square miles (1,730 square kilometers), an area slightly larger than Greater London, according to MapBiomas, a network of non-governmental organizations that monitors land use. Rondonia state prosecutor Pablo Viscardi said the fires are the work of people who want to gain legal title to the land. They 'use forest fires to ‘consolidate’ the land-grabbing and/or prevent the regeneration of areas they were expelled from,' he told the AP. In Rondonia and also in neighboring Mato Grosso, authorities have also ended an important piece of environmental legislation. In the historic Soy Moratorium of 2006, traders and oil producers agreed not to buy soy beans grown on recently deforested land. Environmental groups including Greenpeace and U.S. commodity giant companies Cargill, Bunge and ADM were parties. Now the laws in Mato Grosso, Brazil’s largest soybean and beef-producing state, and Rondonia, force traders and oil producers to exit the agreement. Another Amazonian state, Para, is pushing a similar initiative. According to Directa, a law consulting company, the bill closely resembles the ones in Mato Grosso and Rondonia, suggesting a coordinated effort to undermine the soy moratorium. Critics of the moratorium, which include Brazil´s top soy producer associations, argue that the agreement is illegal because it goes beyond Brazil´s anti-deforestation laws. In a statement, the government of Mato Grosso said it ceased incentives under the soy moratorium because the state already enforces 'the world’s strictest environmental regulations' and companies that violate national laws will face penalties, just as they would in other countries. Brazil is the world’s fifth-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, with almost 3% of global emissions, according to Climate Watch, an online platform managed by World Resources Institute. Almost half of Brazil’s carbon emissions come from deforestation. The Amazon is a vital climate regulator, contains the most biodiverse forest in the world plus one-fifth of the world´s freshwater. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

The Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire quiets one front but Gaza sees no end to war	JERUSALEM (AP) — For many across the Middle East, the Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire came as a relief: the first major sign of progress in the region since war began more than a year ago. But for Palestinians in Gaza and families of hostages held in the territory, the news appeared only to inaugurate a newer, grimmer period of the conflict there. For them, it marked yet another missed opportunity to end fighting that has stretched on for nearly 14 months. Palestinians had hoped that any ceasefire deal with Hezbollah would include a truce in Gaza as well. The families of people kidnapped when Hamas-led militants stormed southern Israel in October 2023, meanwhile, wanted part of the agreement to include returning their loved ones. Instead, the ceasefire was confined only to the fighting in Lebanon. 'We feel this is a missed opportunity to tie in the hostages in this agreement that was signed today,' said Ruby Chen, whose son, Itay Chen, was taken hostage from an Israeli military base and has been declared dead. As much as they were intertwined, the two wars have been very different. In Lebanon, Israel said its aim was to drive Hezbollah back from the countries’ shared border and end the militant group's barrages into northern Israel. The ceasefire that took effect Wednesday is intended to do that. In Gaza, Israel’s goals are more sweeping. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been resolute in insisting that Hamas must be completely destroyed and Israel must retain lasting control over parts of the territory. Months of talks have failed to get Netanyahu to back down from those demands — or to convince Hamas to release hostages under those terms. For Palestinians in Gaza, that means continuing misery under an Israeli campaign that has demolished much of the territory and driven almost the entire population from their homes. Hundreds of thousands are going hungry while living in squalid tent cities as the second winter of the war brings cold rains and flooding. 'They agree to a ceasefire in one place and not in the other? Have mercy on the children, the elderly and the women,' said Ahlam Abu Shalabi, living in tent in central Gaza. 'Now it is winter, and all the people are drowning.' Palestinians feel resigned to continued war The war between Israel and Hamas began on Oct. 7, 2023, when militants attacked Israel from Gaza, killing around 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostage. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has rained devastation on the Palestinian territory, killing over 44,000 people, according to local health officials. The officials, who do not distinguish between civilians and fighters in their count, say over half of the dead are women and children. Hezbollah began firing into Israel a day after Hamas' attack in solidarity with the Palestinian militant group. The two sides have exchanged near-daily barrages since. Moving thousands of troops to its northern border, Israel ramped up bombardment of southern Lebanon and launched a ground invasion there two months ago, killing many of Hezbollah’s leaders. Palestinians now fear Israel’s military can return its full focus to Gaza — a point that Netanyahu made as he announced the ceasefire in Lebanon on Tuesday. 'The pressure will be more on Gaza,' said Mamdouh Younis, a displaced man in a central Gaza tent camp. Netanyahu, he said, can now exploit the fact that 'Gaza has become alone, far from all the arenas that were supporting it, especially the Lebanon front.' Israeli troops are already engaged in fierce fighting in Gaza’s north, where a two-month offensive has cut off most aid and caused experts to warn a famine may be underway. Strikes all over the territory regularly kill dozens. In signing onto the ceasefire deal, Hezbollah reversed its long-held position that it wouldn’t stop its barrages across the border unless Israel ends the war in Gaza. 'This could have a psychological impact, as it will further entrench the understanding that Palestinians in Gaza are alone in resisting against their occupiers,' said Tariq Kenney Shawa, a U.S. policy fellow at Al-Shabaka, a Palestinian think tank. Hamas may dig its heels in It also leaves Hamas — its capabilities already severely damaged by Israel’s offensive — to fight alone. Hamas official Osama Hamdan appeared to accept Hezbollah’s new position in an interview Monday. 'Any announcement of a ceasefire is welcome. Hezbollah has stood by our people and made significant sacrifices,' Hamdan told the Lebanese broadcaster Al-Mayadeen, which is seen as politically allied with Hezbollah. Khalil Sayegh, a Palestinian analyst, said the ceasefire could make Hamas even less popular in Gaza, by proving the failure of its gambit that its attack on Israel would rally other militant groups to the fight. 'It’s a moment where we can see the Hamas messaging become weaker and weaker, as they struggle to justify their strategy to the public,' said Sayegh. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Tuesday that the Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire could help force Hamas to the negotiating table because it would show the group that the 'cavalry is not on the way.' But Hamas experts predicted that it would only dig in both on the battlefield and in talks. Hamas has insisted it will only release all the hostages in return for a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. 'I expect Hamas will continue using guerrilla warfare to confront Israeli forces in Gaza as long as they remain,' said Shawa. Hostage families lose hope Dozens of Israelis thronged a major highway in Tel Aviv on Tuesday night, protesting for the return of the hostages as the country waited to hear if a ceasefire in Lebanon had been agreed. Around 100 people taken hostage are still held in Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Most of the other hostages seized by Hamas were released during a ceasefire last year. Ricardo Grichener, the uncle of 23-year-old hostage Omer Wenkert, said the ceasefire with Hezbollah showed how the Israeli government was openly disregarding the hostages. Even though Israel has inflicted greater damage on Hamas in Gaza than on Hezbollah in Lebanon, he said 'the decision to postpone a deal in Gaza and release the hostages is not based on the same military success criteria.' The most recent effort to wind down the war stalled in October. U.S. President Joe Biden said Tuesday he would begin a renewed push, but his administration is now in its waning days after the reelection of former President Donald Trump. 'This ceasefire doesn’t concern our hostages. I believe that Netanyahu forgot about them, and he just wants to keep fighting in Gaza,' said Ifat Kalderon, clutching a photo of her cousin, Ofer Kalderon, who is a hostage and a father to four. 'Ofer yesterday had his 54th birthday. His second birthday in Gaza,' she said. 'It’s unbelievable that he’s still there.' ___ This story has been updated to correct the spelling of Ruby Chen's first name.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-gaza-war-lebanon-ceasefire-hamas-1a091e620e72c0fe341ff9e866237c08	2024-11-27T05:20:29-08:00	
3 Americans held for years in China have been released, the White House says	WASHINGTON (AP) — Three American citizens imprisoned for years by China have been released and are returning to the United States, the White House said Wednesday, announcing a rare diplomatic agreement with Beijing in the final months of the Biden administration. The three are Mark Swidan, Kai Li and John Leung, all of whom had been designated by the U.S. government as wrongfully detained by China. Swidan had been facing a death sentence on drug charges while Li and Leung were imprisoned on espionage charges. 'Soon they will return and be reunited with their families for the first time in many years,' the White House said in a statement. The release comes just two months after China freed David Lin, a Christian pastor from California who had spent nearly 20 years behind bars after being convicted of contract fraud. U.S.-China relations have been roiled for years over major disagreements between the world’s two largest economies on trade, human rights, the production of fentanyl precursors, security issues that include espionage and hacking, China’s aggressiveness toward Taiwan and its smaller neighbors in the South China Sea, and Beijing’s support for Russia’s military-industrial sector. The release of Americans deemed wrongfully detained in China has been a top agenda item in each conversation between the U.S. and China, and Wednesday’s development suggests a willingness by Beijing to engage with the outgoing Democratic administration before Republican President-elect Donald Trump’s return to the White House in January. Trump took significant actions against China on trade and diplomacy during his first term. He has pledged to continue those policies in his second term, leading to unease among many who fear that an all-out trade war will greatly affect the international economy and could spur potential Chinese military action against Taiwan. Still, the two countries have maintained a dialogue that has included a partial restoration of military-to-military contacts. President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping met this month to discuss potential improvements. In a separate but related move, the State Department on Wednesday lowered its travel warning to China to 'level two,' advising U.S. citizens to 'exercise increased caution' from the norm when traveling to the mainland. The alert had previously been at 'level three,' telling Americans they should 'reconsider travel' to China in part because of the 'risk of wrongful detention' of Americans. The new alert removes that wording but retains a warning that the Chinese government 'arbitrarily enforces local laws, including exit bans on U.S. citizens and citizens of other countries, without fair and transparent process under the law.' The Biden administration had raised the cases of the detained Americans with China in multiple meetings over the past several years, including this month when Biden spoke to Xi on during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Peru. Politico was first to report the men’s release, which it said was part of a prisoner swap with the U.S. The White House did not immediately confirm that any Chinese citizens in American custody had been returned home. Senators from both political parties praised the move. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas said he was 'overjoyed' — Swidan's mother lives in Texas — and credited senior Biden administration officials for having 'worked tirelessly to secure this achievement.' Li, a Chinese immigrant who started an export business in the U.S. and lived in New York, was detained in September 2016 after flying into Shanghai. He was placed under surveillance, interrogated without a lawyer and accused of providing state secrets to the FBI. A U.N. working group called his 10-year prison sentence arbitrary and his family has said the charges were politically motivated. Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who said he had worked for years to try to secure Li's release, welcomed the news. 'Even when it felt like there was no hope, we never stopped believing that one day Mr. Li would return home,' Schumer said in a statement. Leung was sentenced last year to life in prison on spying charges. He was detained in 2021, by the local bureau of China’s counterintelligence agency in the southeastern city of Suzhou after China had closed its borders and imposed tight domestic travel restrictions and social controls to fight the spread of COVID-19. After Leung's sentencing, the U.S. recommended — though without citing specific cases — that Americans reconsider traveling to China because of arbitrary law enforcement and exit bans and the risk of wrongful detentions. Swidan had been jailed for the last 12 years on a drug charge and, along with Li and Leung, was considered by the State Department to be wrongfully detained.	https://apnews.com/article/us-china-americans-detained-released-365258f044ec5a650aaeccf33d817d64	2024-11-27T05:07:12-08:00	
Ex-UK Conservative leader William Hague elected Oxford University chancellor, an 800-year-old post	LONDON (AP) — Former U.K. Conservative Party leader William Hague has been elected chancellor of Oxford University, one of the most prestigious positions in British academia, the university said Wednesday. Hague was elected in an online vote by staff and alumni of the 800-year-old university. He will replace Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong, who has held the post since 2003. Hague beat contenders including former Labour Cabinet minister Peter Mandelson and Elish Angiolini, the former top law officer in Scotland. The university said Hague will be inaugurated early next year and will serve a 10-year term. The chancellor is the university’s titular head and presides over key ceremonies, as well as overseeing the election of the vice-chancellor, the university’s day-to-day leader. Hague is an Oxford graduate who began his political career at the Oxford University Conservative Association. Elected Conservative leader at the age of 36 after the party lost power to Labour in 1997, he resigned after the party's thumping election defeat in 2001. Hague said being elected chancellor, a post that stretches back to the 13th century, was 'the greatest honor of my life.' 'What happens at Oxford in the next decade is critical to the success of the U.K.,' he said in a statement.	https://apnews.com/article/oxford-university-chancellor-william-hague-mandelson-angiolini-7c4769141738a58a7c54d988534c1771	2024-11-27T03:43:49-08:00	
Albanian opposition leader released from house arrest but still faces corruption charges	TIRANA, Albania (AP) — An Albanian court on Wednesday released from house arrest former Prime Minister Sali Berisha, who leads the opposition Democratic Party and is charged with corruption. The Special Court for Corruption and Organized Crime, which covers cases involving senior officials and politicians, revoked its order for Berisha's house arrest issued almost a year ago, without giving any reason. In December, Berisha's parliamentary immunity was removed and he was placed under house arrest after he violated an earlier order to report to the court every two weeks. He was also barred from traveling abroad, but that order was struck down last week by the Constitutional Court. During his period of house arrest, Berisha, 80, stayed in his apartment in downtown Tirana. Though he was banned from communicating with other people than his family and lawyers, every evening he gave speeches to small groups of supporters gathered outside his building. Depriving Berisha of communication and physical presence to lead his party was a daily issue in Albania's politics because he’s the leader of the main opposition party. A parliamentary election will take place next spring. A year ago in October, prosecutors publicly put him under investigation for allegedly abusing his post to help his son-in-law, Jamarber Malltezi, privatize public land to build 17 apartment buildings in the capital, Tirana. In September Berisha was formally charged with corruption in connection with a property deal. He has denied the charges, describing them as political repression ordered by Prime Minister Edi Rama of the governing left-wing Socialist Party. Berisha served as Albania’s prime minister from 2005-2013, and as president from 1992-1997. He was re-elected as a lawmaker for the Democratic Party in the 2021 parliamentary elections. The United States government in May 2021 and the United Kingdom in July 2022 barred Berisha and close family members from entering their countries because of his alleged involvement in corruption. Members of the Democratic Party and their supporters in an opposition coalition have been holding protests over the arrests of their leader Berisha and former President Ilir Meta in separate corruption cases, saying the charges are politically motivated. The opposition accuses the government of corruption and wants it to be replaced by a technocratic caretaker Cabinet before the 2025 parliamentary election. The United States and the European Union have urged the opposition to resume dialogue with the government, saying violence won’t help the country integrate into the 27-nation European Union. Earlier in October, Tirana started discussions with the bloc on aligning with the EU on the rule of law, the functioning of democratic institutions and the fight against corruption. Albania aims to join the bloc by 2030, according to Rama. ___ Follow Llazar Semini at https://x.com/lsemini	https://apnews.com/article/sali-berisha-house-arrest-released-albania-corruption-7abd843de671d0bd60a7909217da7f3e	2024-11-27T03:04:45-08:00	
London counter-terrorism police arrest 6 people suspected of links to a banned Kurdish party	LONDON (AP) — British counter-terrorism officers arrested six people Wednesday as part of an investigation into activity linked to the banned Kurdistan Workers Party known as the PKK, police said. Four men and two women arrested in London were detained under the Terrorism Act of 2000, the Metropolitan Police said. The PKK, a separatist movement seeking an independent Kurdish state in southeast Turkey, is on the list of suspected extremist organizations banned by the U.K. 'This activity has come about following a significant investigation and operation into activity we believe is linked to the terrorist group PKK,' Acting Cmdr. Helen Flanagan said. 'These are targeted arrests of those we suspect of being involved in terrorist activity linked to the group.' Police were searching the Kurdish Community Center in the Haringey area of north London and seven other locations across the city. Police said they didn't believe there was a threat to the public.	https://apnews.com/article/london-arrests-kurdistan-workers-party-pkk-turkey-5a0d27d09dad944e4c61eed4f9c4d875	2024-11-27T02:10:52-08:00	
Concerns over housing and immigration make for a volatile campaign in Ireland's election	DUBLIN (AP) — From his poster, there’s not much to distinguish Gerry Hutch from the slew of other independent candidates hoping discontented voters will propel them into Ireland’s parliament in an election on Friday. 'We need change, and I’m your man,' it says. On the streets of Dublin, some voters agree — despite the candidate’s unusual CV. Prosecutors say Gerry 'the Monk' Hutch heads an international crime group involved in robbery and drug smuggling. He was acquitted last year of murdering a gangland rival. This month he was bailed in Spain's Canary Islands on money-laundering charges and allowed to return to Ireland to run for election. 'I’d love if he got in,' said Derek Richardson, an unemployed Dubliner unimpressed by the big-party politicians. 'There’s plenty of other gangsters out there in suits.' Around the world in this record-breaking election year, voters have decided that something in their country is broken, and punished incumbent governments. That sentiment also ripples through the campaign in Ireland, where rival center-right parties Fine Gael and Fianna Fail took turns running the country for a century before forming a coalition administration in 2020. If some voters are turning on them, the anti-politician mood also is hitting left-of-center opposition party Sinn Fein, which not long ago appeared destined for power. With voters set to fill all 174 seats in the Dáil, the lower house of parliament, opinion polls suggest voters’ support is split into five roughly even chunks – for Fine Gael, Fianna Fail, Sinn Fein, several smaller parties and an assortment of independents running the gamut from left-leaning to far right. Restaurant worker Anne-Marie Kerry saw the appeal of independents — even Hutch, the alleged gangster. 'They’re all criminals anyway,' she said. Housing crisis The issue that comes up most on the campaign trail is housing. Apartments and houses are expensive — prices rose by 10% in the year to August — and there are not enough to go around. A housing commission set up by the government says Ireland has a 'housing deficit' of up to 256,000 homes. Rents have soared, and many young teachers, nurses and other key workers can’t afford a place of their own. Eoin O’Malley, associate professor of political science at Dublin City University, said the cost of living squeeze means people in their 20s are 'talking about emigration, even though there are plenty of jobs in Ireland.' 'People are feeling that they can’t settle down so they are going abroad to get their career going,' he said. 'So there’s a fear among middle-class parents that ‘My children will never come back again.’' It’s not just the young who are feeling the pinch. Carole York is 73 and has fought a five-year battle to avoid eviction from the rural home near Waterford, 100 miles (160 kilometers) south of Dublin, that she has turned into a sanctuary for rescued ponies. She says the landlord encouraged her and promised a long-term let, but then decided he wanted her out so he could sell the valuable property. 'There are many, many elderly people who are in a similar position to me, who are just being turfed out because of the way prices of property are just going through the roof in this country,' she said. York says she 'never had the slightest interest in politics until this election.' Now, she’ll be voting for a party that promises to stand up for renters, such as Sinn Fein or the smaller Labour Party. Immigration challenges Immigration has risen up the political agenda as new arrivals transformed a country long defined by emigration. About 20% of Ireland’s population was born outside Ireland, and 120,000 foreigners moved to Ireland in the year to April, the biggest number since 2007. Recent arrivals include more than 100,000 Ukrainians and thousands of people fleeing poverty and conflict in the Middle East and Africa. This country of 5.4 million has struggled to house all the asylum-seekers, leading to tent camps and makeshift accommodation centers that have attracted tension and protests. A stabbing attack on children outside a Dublin school a year ago, in which an Algerian man has been charged, sparked the worst rioting Ireland had seen in decades. Unlike many European countries, Ireland does not have a significant far-right party, but anti-immigrant independent candidates are hoping for election in several districts. Others take a more measured view, including Hutch, who says he supports immigration, but that migrants should work and not 'sponge off' the state. 'The country’s overloaded with refugees, and it’s not right,' said Caroline Alwright, who sells fruit and vegetables in Dublin’s Moore Street outdoor market. 'I’m not racist, by no means, but we have to look after ourselves, because no one is looking after us.' She says she’s voting for an independent candidate, and 'I’ll never be Fine Gael or Fianna Fail again.' Coalition likely The main political parties are trying to defuse the discontent, touting plans to get a grip on immigration and build many more houses. Ireland’s government has one advantage over many others: money, in part from 13 billion euros ($13.6 billion) in back taxes that the European Union ordered Apple to pay Ireland. The government initially opposed that payment, because low taxes are one of the key sweeteners Ireland has used to attract investment from major foreign companies. The threat posed by tariff-loving President-elect Donald Trump to Ireland’s economic model has not come up much on the campaign trail, though Prime Minister Simon Harris has said his Fine Gael party 'is setting aside a very significant amount into future funds to protect our country from any economic shock.' Harris is hoping to remain as prime minister, or taoiseach, but his campaign has been weakened by gaffes. His brusque treatment of a disabled care worker he met last week became the kind of viral political moment that politicians dread. Fianna Fail, led by Deputy Prime Minister Micheál Martin, has the edge in most polls, and the leader looks relaxed on the campaign trail. Encountering handshakes and selfie requests in the shops of Dublin’s affluent Clontarf area, he acknowledged that 'there is a need for new policies' — but not new governing parties. Martin said 'this government has weathered some very significant shocks to the economy,' including the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine. 'But we managed to bring the Irish economy back,' he told The Associated Press. 'Why go back to the starting point again?' Sinn Fein, which aims to reunite the Republic of Ireland and the U.K. territory of Northern Ireland, topped the popular vote at the last election in in 2020 but was shut out of government because neither Fianna Fail nor Fine Gael would work with it, citing its leftist policies and historic links to the Irish Republican Army. In recent months its poll ratings have plunged, due in part to a disconnect with its working-class voters over immigration. Party officials say Sinn Fein has gained momentum during the three-week election campaign, but its path to power remains limited by a lack of coalition partners. Analysts say the most likely election outcome is another Fine Gael-Fianna Fail coalition. Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald insisted the party could win, and implored voters considering independent candidates to think again. 'Do you want a change in government?' she said while campaigning in Dublin. 'If that is what you desire, then Sinn Fein is the party to vote for. 'I want to reassure people that it can happen. I’d go further than that and say, it’s in your hands. It can’t happen without you.'	https://apnews.com/article/ireland-election-housing-immigration-gerry-hutch-harris-3952d0d0e9d71ca2049f253d90d1a99d	2024-11-27T02:03:16-08:00	
Volkswagen and Chinese partner SAIC to sell joint venture plant in west China's Xinjiang	BANGKOK (AP) — Volkswagen and Shanghai's SAIC Motor have agreed to sell a factory in China's far western Xinjiang region that drew criticism due to accusations by western governments of human rights violations. The companies also said Wednesday that they were extending their 40-year-old automaking joint venture until 2040, ahead of schedule, and that the JV will step up its shift to electric vehicles. Volkswagen AG was one of the first foreign investors in China’s auto industry. The 1980s model Santana sedans its JV in Shanghai made formed the basis of taxi fleets in Shanghai and other cities for many years. SAIC, based in Shanghai, says it is the largest automaker in China, turning out 5 million vehicles in 2023. It also has partnerships with General Motors and other automakers. Earlier this year, the Volkswagen Group, which includes Audi and Porsche, said it plans to launch 40 new models in China over the next three years and to have a lineup of 30 EVs by 2030. On Wednesday, it said SAIC Volkswagen plans to launch 18 new models by 2030, including eight EVs. Volkswagen is among many foreign automakers that have been caught flat-footed by an electric vehicle boom in China that has shaken up the market, the world’s largest, over the last three years. The company said the joint venture site in Xinjiang's capital Urumqi will be sold to the Shanghai Motor Vehicle Inspection Center, while preserving the jobs of the roughly 170 people who work there. It said the joint venture has also sold test tracks in Xinjiang's Turpan and in Anting, outside Shanghai. In response to criticism over its operations in Xinjiang, Volkswagen earlier said an audit it commissioned found no evidence of forced labor at the facility, but it was considering options for its future. The plant, operated by a subsidiary of SAIC-VW, began production in 2013 and had a maximum capacity of 50,000 vehicles. It no longer makes vehicles but provides inspections. The restructuring of the VW-SAIC joint venture comes at a time of uncertainty over costs and market access given moves by western governments to impose higher tariffs on electric vehicles imported from China.	https://apnews.com/article/china-germany-vw-auto-tariffs-81f732de6c88fa7f4428e4d036f3bccb	2024-11-27T02:03:14-08:00	
ICC prosecutor requests arrest warrants for the head of Myanmar's military regime	THE HAGUE (AP) — The International Criminal Court’s chief prosecutor asked judges on Wednesday to issue an arrest warrant for the head of Myanmar’s military regime for crimes committed against the country’s Rohingya Muslim minority. Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, who took power from elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi in a coup in 2021, is accused of crimes against humanity for the deportation and persecution of the Rohingya. Nearly a million people were forced into neighboring Bangladesh to escape what has been called an ethnic cleansing campaign involving mass rapes, killings and the torching of homes. From a refugee camp in Bangladesh, the court’s top prosecutor, Karim Khan, said in a statement that he intends to request more warrants for Myanmar's leaders soon. 'In doing so, we will be demonstrating, together with all of our partners, that the Rohingya have not been forgotten. That they, like all people around the world, are entitled to the protection of the law,' the British barrister said. The allegations stem from a counterinsurgency campaign that Myanmar’s military began in August 2017 in response to an insurgent attack. Hlaing, who heads the Myanmar Defense Services, is said to have directed the armed forces of Myanmar, known as the Tatmadaw, as well as national police to attack Rohingya civilians. Khan was in Bangladesh where he met with members of the displaced Rohingya population. About 1 million of the predominately Muslim Rohingya live in Bangladesh as refugees from Myanmar, including about 740,000 who fled in 2017. Rohingyas face widespread discrimination in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, with most denied citizenship. Myanmar's government refuses to recognize the Rohingya as one of the country’s 135 lawful ethnic minorities, instead calling them Bengalis, with the implication that their native land is in Bangladesh and they are illegally settled in Myanmar. Human rights groups applauded the decision to seek a warrant. The dire situation of the Rohingya has received less attention as the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza have grabbed headlines. 'The ICC prosecutor’s decision to seek a warrant against Sr. Gen. Min Aung Hlaing comes amid renewed atrocities against Rohingya civilians that echo those suffered seven years ago. The ICC’s action is an important step toward breaking the cycle of abuses and impunity,' said Maria Elena Vignoli, senior international justice counsel at Human Rights Watch. Zin Mar Aung, foreign minister for Myanmar’s opposition National Unity Government, established by elected lawmakers barred from taking their seats in 2021, said on X that ICC judges should 'swiftly issue the warrant' and that governments should 'act and enforce this warrant to uphold justice and international law.' She posted that the ICC action 'represents a critical moment in Myanmar history.' Thet Swe, a spokesperson for the military regime, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Khan’s request now goes to a panel of three judges who will weigh the evidence provided and determine if a warrant should be issued. There is no deadline for a decision. A request for an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin took less than three weeks in 2023 but judges issued warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his former defense minister and Hamas’ military chief more than six months after Khan asked. Myanmar does not belong to the global court, but Bangladesh does. In 2018 judges at the court ruled the prosecutor could look into crimes which were 'completed' on the territory of a member state, such as forcible deportation. In 2019, Khan’s predecessor, Fatou Bensouda, formally requested to open an investigation into the situation and judges gave the green light for investigations into 'any crime, including any future crime' committed at least partly in Bangladesh or another court member state and linked to the Rohingya. The move paved the way for Khan to pursue crimes beyond forcing men, women and children over the border and into refugee camps. The request comes days after a powerful rebel group seized a key trading town in northeastern Myanmar on the Chinese border, taking control of a lucrative rare earth mining hub in another setback for the military-led government. The military seized power from Aung San Suu Kyi's government in February 2021, triggering intensified fighting with long-established armed militias organized by Myanmar’s ethnic minority groups in its border regions which have struggled for decades for more autonomy. In 2022, the International Court of Justice, the United Nations’ highest court, advanced a separate case against Myanmar brought by Gambia alleging the Southeast Asian nation is responsible for genocide against the Rohingya. Five European countries and Canada have asked the court to back Gambia in the proceedings. ___ AP reporters David Rising from Bangkok and Raf Casert from Brussels contributed	https://apnews.com/article/icc-myanmar-arrest-warrant-military-regime-1184ed9e6197bc4189feb8b22b9b4ee7	2024-11-26T23:51:37-08:00	
Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire appears to hold as Lebanese begin streaming south to their homes	TYRE, Lebanon (AP) — A ceasefire between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah that began Wednesday appeared to be holding, as residents in cars heaped with belongings streamed back toward southern Lebanon despite warnings from the Israeli and Lebanese militaries that they stay away from certain areas. If it holds, the ceasefire would bring an end to nearly 14 months of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, which escalated in mid-September into all-out war and threatened to pull Hezbollah's patron Iran and Israel into a broader conflagration. The deal does not address the war in Gaza. It could give some reprieve to the 1.2 million Lebanese displaced by the fighting and the tens of thousands of Israelis who fled their homes along the border with Lebanon. 'They were a nasty and ugly 60 days,' said Mohammed Kaafarani, 59, who was displaced from the Lebanese village of Bidias. 'We reached a point where there was no place to hide.' The U.S.- and France-brokered deal, approved by Israel late Tuesday, calls for an initial two-month halt to fighting and requires Hezbollah to end its armed presence in southern Lebanon, while Israeli troops are to return to their side of the border. Thousands of additional Lebanese troops and U.N. peacekeepers would deploy in the south, and an international panel headed by the United States would monitor compliance. Israel says it reserves the right to strike Hezbollah should it violate the terms of the deal. Israel is still fighting Hamas militants in Gaza in response to the group’s cross-border raid into southern Israel in October 2023. But President Joe Biden on Tuesday said his administration would make another push in the coming days to try to renew efforts for a deal in the war-ravaged Palestinian enclave. Lebanese are streaming south despite warnings On the highway linking Beirut with south Lebanon, hours after the Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire took hold, thousands of people drove south with their belongings and mattresses tied on top of their cars. Traffic was gridlocked at the northern entrance of the port city of Sidon. 'This is a moment of victory, pride and honor for us, the Shiite sect, and for all of Lebanon,' said Hussein Sweidan, a resident returning to the port city of Tyre. He said he saw the ceasefire as a victory for Hezbollah. Sporadic celebratory gunfire was heard at a main roundabout in the city, as people returning honked the horns of their cars and residents cheered. Israel’s Arabic military spokesperson Avichay Adraee warned displaced Lebanese not to return to evacuated villages in southern Lebanon. Israeli troops were still present in parts of southern Lebanon after Israel launched a ground invasion in October. The Israeli military said forces opened fire to push back a number of vehicles that were entering a restricted area in southern Lebanon. An Israeli security official said Israeli forces remain in their positions hours after the ceasefire began and will only gradually withdraw. He said the pace of the withdrawal and the scheduled return of Lebanese civilians to their homes would depend on whether the deal is implemented and enforced by all sides. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to discuss the deal and its implementation with the media. The Lebanese military asked displaced returning to southern Lebanon to avoid frontline villages and towns near the border where Israeli troops are still present until they withdraw. Residents will return to vast destruction wrought by the Israeli military during its campaign, which flattened villages where the military said it found vast weapons caches and infrastructure it says was meant for Hezbollah to launch an Oct. 7-style attack on northern Israel. More than 3,760 people have been killed by Israeli fire in Lebanon the past 13 months, many of them civilians, according to Lebanese health officials. Hezbollah emerges from the war battered and bloodied, with the reputation it built by fighting Israel to a stalemate in the 2006 war tarnished. Yet its fighters still managed to put up heavy resistance on the ground, slowing Israel’s advance while continuing to fire scores of rockets, missiles and drones across the border each day. Some Israelis are concerned the deal doesn't go far enough In Israel, the mood was far more subdued, with displaced Israelis concerned that the deal did not go far enough to rein in Hezbollah and that it did not address Gaza and the hostages still held there. 'I think it is still not safe to return to our homes because Hezbollah is still close to us,' said Eliyahu Maman, an Israeli displaced from the northern Israeli city of Kiryat Shmona, which is not far from the border with Lebanon and was hit hard by the months of fighting. On Wednesday morning, Kiryat Shmona remained quiet on a cold, rainy day. A handful of people milled about, inspecting damage from earlier rocket attacks, including to the roof of a bus. The town’s shopping mall, which had been hit before, appeared to have new damage, and a rocket was seen stuck in the ground next to an apartment building. The fighting killed more than 70 people in Israel, more than half civilians, as well as dozens of Israeli soldiers fighting in southern Lebanon. A significant return of the displaced to their communities, many of which have suffered extensive damage from rocket fire, could take months. But Israel can claim major victories in the war, including the killing of Hezbollah’s top leader Hassan Nasrallah and most of its senior commanders, as well as the destruction of extensive militant infrastructure. A complex attack involving exploding pagers and walkie-talkies, widely attributed to Israel, appeared to show a remarkable degree of penetration of the secretive militant group. ___ Chehayeb reported from Beirut.

Pakistan ends lockdown of its capital after Imran Khan supporters are dispersed by police	ISLAMABAD (AP) — Authorities reopened roads linking Pakistan's capital with the rest of the country, ending a four-day lockdown, on Wednesday after using tear gas and firing into the air to disperse supporters of imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan who marched to Islamabad to demand his release from prison. 'All roads are being reopened, and the demonstrators have been dispersed,' Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said. Khan’s wife, Bushra Bibi, who was leading the protest, and other demonstrators fled in vehicles when police pushed back against the rallygoers following clashes in which at least seven people were killed. The police operation came hours after thousands of Khan supporters, defying government warnings, broke through a barrier of shipping containers blocking off Islamabad and entered a high-security zone, where they clashed with security forces. Tension has been high in Islamabad since Sunday when supporters of the former prime minister began a 'long march' from the restive northwest to demand his release. Khan has been in a prison for over a year and faces more than 150 criminal cases that his party says are politically motivated. Hundreds of demonstrators have been arrested since Sunday. Bibi and leaders of her husband's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party fled to Mansehra in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where the party still rules. Khan, who remains a popular opposition figure, was ousted in 2022 through a no-confidence vote in Parliament.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-lockdown-islamabad-imran-khan-rally-b172154133ea27ae1e9cb4a6dea42a88	2024-11-26T22:08:09-08:00	
Philippine police file criminal complaints against Sara Duterte and her security aides	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Philippine police officials on Wednesday filed criminal complaints against Vice President Sara Duterte and her security staff for allegedly assaulting authorities and disobeying orders in a recent altercation in Congress. The criminal complaints filed by the Quezon City police were separate from any legal action that may arise after she publicly threatened to have President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., his wife and the speaker of the House of Representatives assassinated if she were killed herself in an unspecified plot. She has not provided details of that plot. A presidential adviser, Larry Gadon, separately filed a Supreme Court petition on Wednesday to disbar the vice president as a lawyer, citing her assassination threats, which he said were 'illegal, immoral and condemnable.' The Marcos administration’s legal offensive against Duterte, her father and their allies is a critical juncture in a conflict that has seethed over the last two years between the two most powerful families in the Philippines. Speaking in a news conference, the vice president broadly denied and played down the criminal complaints, allegations and potential lawsuits against her, including a possible impeachment case and an alleged violation of the country's anti-terror law. She said the government actions were aimed at removing her from office, freezing her properties and bank accounts and barring her from traveling abroad. Duterte said without elaborating that the danger to her life was real but added that the threats she made were not actual and illegal. 'This is really oppression and harassment for remarks taken out of logical context,' Duterte said. She also said in response to a question that she no longer thought a reconciliation with the president was possible. 'I really believe that we have reached a point of no return,' she said. The Department of Justice said it is also looking into potentially seditious remarks by Marcos’s predecessor and the vice president’s father, Rodrigo Duterte, who said in a news conference that the civilian government would only listen if the military voices concerns about corruption and irregularities under the Marcos administration. 'There is a fractured governance. … It is only the military that can correct it,' the former president said Monday night. He said he was not urging the military to rise up against Marcos but only reaffirming the real situation in the Philippines. Still, justice officials said an investigation into the former president's remarks will proceed. The criminal complaints for assaulting, disobeying and grave coercion against police authorities were filed against the vice president and her security staff and other aides before state prosecutors, a police statement said. Such crimes are punishable by a jail term and a fine. The complaints were set off by a chaotic squabble over the weekend in the House of Representatives, where the vice president’s chief of staff, Zuleika Lopez, has been temporarily detained. Legislators accused Lopez of obstructing and not cooperating with a congressional inquiry into alleged misuse of confidential and intelligence funds by the offices of the vice president and the education secretary, which Sara Duterte held. At one point, authorities were ordered to transfer Lopez to a women’s prison outside Congress, causing her to become agitated. The vice president and her staff intervened to oppose the order and Lopez was eventually moved to a government hospital, where she remains confined. 'The rule of law is fundamental to our democratic system. No one, regardless of their position, should be above accountability,' national police chief Gen. Rommel Francisco Marbil said of the criminal complaints against the vice president and her aides. The national police 'remain committed to ensuring the proper execution of lawful orders and protecting public order,' he said. 'Resistance and disobedience to a person in authority not only violates the law but also undermines public trust,' Marbil said. In a separate case, authorities delivered a subpoena to the vice president's office Tuesday, inviting her to answer investigators’ questions about the threats she made over the weekend. Duterte had said she was not making a direct threat but was expressing concerns for her own safety. Marcos said in a televised public address that the vice president’s threats against him, his wife Liza Marcos and House Speaker Martin Romualdez were a criminal plot and vowed to fight them and uphold the rule of law. Marcos ran with Sara Duterte as his vice-presidential running mate in the 2022 elections and both won landslide victories on a campaign call for national unity. In the Philippines, the president and vice president are elected separately, and that has resulted in rival politicians assuming the top political posts in a country with deep political and social divisions. The two leaders and their camps have since fallen out over key differences, including their approaches to China’s aggressive territorial claims i n the disputed South China Sea and views on ex-President Duterte’s anti-drug crackdown, which left thousands of mostly poor suspects dead. Sara Duterte resigned from the Marcos Cabinet in June as education secretary and head of an anti-insurgency body and became one of the most vocal critics of the president, his wife and Romualdez, the president’s cousin who heads a congress that’s dominated by their allies.	https://apnews.com/article/philippine-president-ferdinand-marcos-jr-vice-president-sara-duterte-e703086041eab5eb600cef12f90a87da	2024-11-26T21:38:59-08:00	
Namibia votes and could have its first female leader. But election upsets have shaken the region	WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) — A woman who joined Namibia's underground independence movement in the 1970s is a strong contender to become its first female leader as the country voted Wednesday in a presidential election. Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah, 72, is the current vice president and the ruling SWAPO party's candidate for president. She's already in the lead after special voting among citizens overseas and the armed forces. But SWAPO, which has governed the southern African country and held the presidency for 34 years since independence from apartheid South Africa in 1990, faces growing frustration caused by high unemployment and economic hardship, especially among young people. That is a common theme that has led to momentous election upsets in other countries in the region this year. Voters elsewhere in southern Africa have rejected parties that liberated their nations from colonial or white minority rule in favor of era-ending change to address new problems. In neighboring South Africa, the African National Congress that ruled for three decades since the end of the racist system of apartheid lost its majority in a landmark election result in June. Botswana's ruling party lost in a landslide last month after 58 years in power since independence from Britain, and Mauritius delivered a surprising heavy defeat for its incumbent party this month. Mozambique's long-ruling Frelimo party was declared the winner of an election in October, prompting claims of vote rigging and sparking ongoing violent protests against the party. About 1.4 million people — approximately half the Namibian population — are registered to vote to decide the president and the makeup of Parliament for a five-year term. The country on the southwestern coast of Africa is a former German colony that came under South African control after World War I and its Black majority was later subjected to some of South Africa's apartheid policies. SWAPO was at the forefront of the battle for independence. While Namibia's population is 85% Black, its colonial history is illustrated by large white and biracial communities, and English, German and South Africa's Afrikaans language are all spoken. Nandi-Ndaitwah voted at an elementary school in the capital, Windhoek. She told reporters that one of her party’s key focuses to fight poverty was attracting more foreign investment to a country with diamond and uranium resources, and untapped oil and gas off its coast that is being explored by international energy companies. 'There should be a balance to make sure that the Namibian people, who are the owners of these resources, benefit from them,' she said. Fourteen other candidates are also running for president, including Panduleni Itula, a former dentist who was SWAPO’s closest challenger four years ago when he ran as an independent. He is representing the Independent Patriots for Change party this year. A runoff will be held if a candidate fails to win more than 50% of the votes, which has never happened before in Namibia. Polls close at 9 p.m. (1900 GMT) and results are expected by the weekend. President Hage Geingob died in office in February and his vice president, Nangolo Mbumba, became head of state. While Nandi-Ndaitwah represents the rare chance for a female leader in Africa, SWAPO's popularity has slipped and it won the presidency with its lowest share of the vote ever in the last national election in 2019. Nandi-Ndaitwah, who received part of her education in the then-Soviet Union while in exile during the fight for independence, has promised to create more jobs and tackle the 20% unemployment rate for young people and graduates. She has pledged to spend approximately 85 billion Namibian dollars ($4.7 billion) over the next five years to create more than 500,000 jobs, a goal that her critics call unrealistic. Opposition candidate McHenry Venaani, the leader of the second biggest party in Parliament, said Namibians should recognize it's time for change. 'Botswana has done it, South Africa has done it, Mauritius has done it. Namibia can also bring about change,' he said. 'People have no water, people have no houses, people have no electricity. For 34 years.' Issues affecting women, including reproductive rights, equal pay and health care, are also likely to rank high for voters in a country that has the Kalahari Desert running through its center and the Namib Desert along its coast and has one of the sparsest populations in the world. Just over 3 million people live in Namibia, which is more than twice the size of Germany. Those deserts make it one of the driest countries in southern Africa that's vulnerable to climate shocks, like an El Nino-induced drought that parched the region this year. As a result, Namibian authorities announced they would kill hundreds of wild animals to provide food for hungry people. ___ AP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa	https://apnews.com/article/namibia-election-vote-woman-swapo-da175a3b3021bc19eb1db85d548a0fe0	2024-11-26T21:25:17-08:00	
Stock market today: Losses for Big Tech pull US indexes lower	Technology stocks helped pull stocks lower on Wall Street Wednesday, handing the market its first loss in more than a week. The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.4%, even though more stocks in the index notched gains than ended lower. The loss snapped a seven-day winning streak for the benchmark index. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3%, its first loss after five gains. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 remain near the all-time highs they set on Tuesday. The Nasdaq composite, which is heavily weighted with technology stocks, fell 0.6%. Losses for tech heavyweights like Nvidia, Microsoft and Broadcom were the drag on the market. Semiconductor giant Nvidia fell 1.2%. Its huge value gives it outsized influence on market indexes. Microsoft fell 1.2% and Broadcom finished 3.1% lower. Several personal computer makers also helped pull the market lower following their latest earnings reports. HP sank 11.4% after giving investors a weaker-than-expected earnings forecast for its current quarter. Dell slid 12.2% after its latest quarterly revenue fell short of Wall Street forecasts. Gains for financial and health care companies helped temper the market's losses. Berkshire Hathaway rose 0.9% and Merck &amp; Co. added 1.5%. All told, the S&amp;P 500 fell 22.89 points to 5,998.74, while the Dow dropped 138.25 points to 44,722.06. The Nasdaq fell 115.10 points to 19,060.48. Traders also had their eye on new reports on the economy and inflation Wednesday. The U.S. economy expanded at a healthy 2.8% annual pace from July through September, according to the Commerce Department, leaving its original estimate of third-quarter growth unchanged. The growth was driven by strong consumer spending and a surge in exports. The update followed a report on Tuesday from the Conference Board that said confidence among U.S. consumers improved in November, but not by as much as economists expected. Consumers have been driving economic growth, but the latest round of earnings reports from retailers shows a mixed and more cautious picture. Department store operator Nordstrom fell 8.1% after warning investors about a trend toward weakening sales that started in late October. Clothing retailer Urban Outfitters jumped 18.3% after beating analysts’ third-quarter financial forecasts. Weeks earlier, retail giant Target gave investors a discouraging forecast for the holiday season, while Walmart provided a more encouraging forecast. Consumers, though resilient, are still facing pressure from inflation. The latest update from the U.S. government shows that inflation accelerated last month. The personal consumption expenditures index, or PCE, rose to 2.3% in October from 2.1% in September. Overall, the rate of inflation has been falling broadly since it peaked more than two years ago. The PCE, which is the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, was just below 7.3% in June of 2022. Another measure of inflation, the consumer price index, peaked at 9.1% at the same time. The latest inflation data, though, is a sign that the rate of inflation seems to be stalling as it falls to within range of the Fed's target of 2%. The central bank started raising its benchmark interest rate from near-zero in early 2022 to a two-decade high by the middle of 2023 and held it there in order to tame inflation. The Fed started cutting its benchmark interest rate in September, followed by a second cut in November. Wall Street expects a similar quarter-point cut at the central bank's upcoming meeting in December. 'Today’s data shouldn’t change views of the likely path for disinflation, however bumpy,' said David Alcaly, lead macroeconomic strategist at Lazard Asset Management. 'But a lot of observers, probably including some at the Fed, are looking for reasons to get more hawkish on the outlook given the potential for inflationary policy change like new tariffs.' President-elect Donald Trump has said he plans to impose sweeping new tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China when he takes office in January. That could shock the economy by raising prices on a wide range of goods and accelerating the rate of inflation. Such a shift could prompt the Fed to rethink future cuts to interest rates. Treasury yields slipped in the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.25% from 4.30% late Tuesday. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which more closely follows expected actions by the Fed, fell to 4.22% from 4.25% late Tuesday. U.S. markets will be closed Thursday for Thanksgiving, and will reopen for a half day on Friday.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-trump-tariffs-samsung-873db18423f9be7398aeebbf4a94bef4	2024-11-26T21:22:06-08:00	
Biggest November snowstorm in half century hits Seoul and grounds flights	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — The biggest November snowstorm to hit South Korea’s capital in more than a half century blanketed the capital on Wednesday, grounding hundreds of flights, disrupting commuter traffic and leaving at least two dead. South Korea’s weather agency said 20 to 26 centimeters (7.8 to 10 inches) of snow fell in northern areas of Seoul and nearby areas. The agency said it was the heaviest snowstorm Seoul has experienced in November in 52 years. A storm on Nov. 28, 1972, dumped 12 centimeters (4.7 inches). South Korea’s Yonhap news agency said one person died and four others were injured in a five-vehicle accident in the eastern town of Hongcheon. In the town of Yangju, a tent-type garage collapsed and killed a person who was removing snow, according to South Korea’s Ministry of the Interior and Safety. The snow caused temporary power outages at about 230 homes in the city of Gwangju, near Seoul, according to the Gyeonggi provincial government. The storm blanketed much of the country, with the central, eastern and southwestern regions recording about 10 to 28 centimeters (3.9 to 11 inches) of cover. At least 317 flights were canceled or delayed at airports nationwide, while authorities ordered around 90 ferries to remain at port. They also shut down hundreds of hiking trails. Icy road conditions slowed down the morning commute in Seoul and led to massive crowds at subways, causing delays. Emergency workers across the country responded to fallen trees, road signs and other safety risks. Officials at the Safety Ministry said they couldn't confirm any school closures as of Wednesday afternoon. Visitors dressed in traditional hanbok garb were busy taking photographs at Seoul’s snow-covered medieval palaces while snowmen popped up in playgrounds and schoolyards across the country. The weather agency said snow will continue in most parts of the country until noon Thursday. President Yoon Suk Yeol instructed the safety and transport ministries to mobilize all available relevant personnel and equipment to prevent traffic and other accidents. ___ Associated Press writer Hyung-jin Kim in Seoul, South Korea, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-snowstorm-seoul-november-canceled-flights-235283f04bc17a171e94b476e82ffd8e	2024-11-26T20:38:55-08:00	
Middle East latest: Displaced people return to south Lebanon as ceasefire appears to hold	Long-displaced residents of south Lebanon started returning to their homes hours after a ceasefire between Israel and the Hezbollah militant group took effect early Wednesday morning. The ceasefire has brought relief across the Mediterranean nation, coming after days of some of the most intense airstrikes and clashes since the war began, though many wondered if the agreement to stop fighting would hold. Israel has said it will attack if Hezbollah breaks the ceasefire agreement, which was announced Tuesday. Thousands of people made their way into southern Lebanon, defying a warning from the Israeli military to stay away from previously evacuated areas. At least 42 people were killed by Israeli strikes across Lebanon on Tuesday, according to local authorities. Hezbollah also fired rockets into Israel on Tuesday, triggering air raid sirens in the country’s north. The Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire marks the first major step toward ending the regionwide unrest triggered by Hamas’ attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, but it does not address the devastating war in Gaza. Hezbollah began attacking Israel a day after Hamas’ attack. The fighting in Lebanon escalated into all-out war in September with massive Israeli airstrikes across the country and an Israeli ground invasion of the south. In Gaza, more than 44,000 people have been killed and more than 104,000 wounded in the nearly 14-month war between Israel and Hamas, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. ___ Here's the Latest: Aid groups welcome ceasefire and urge donors to step up BEIRUT — International aid groups welcomed the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah and urge donors to provide funding to help rebuild parts of Lebanon and assist the displaced. The aid groups are concerned about the aftershocks of the war on Lebanon’s already struggling economy. With more than 1.2 million people displaced, they warned that the damage would leave many struggling and without homes. More than 100,000 homes have been either partially or fully destroyed across southern Lebanon, Bekaa and Beirut, the International Rescue Committee said. Mercy Corps said that half of Lebanon’s population now lives below the poverty line. It called on donors to fulfill pledges to support immediate humanitarian efforts and the long-term recovery. 'There will undoubtedly be a great deal of grief and trauma. Many will have no homes to return to, no schools for their children, and livelihoods destroyed,' Norwegian Refugee Council Secretary-General Jan Egeland said. Lebanese who fled to Syria start returning home MASNAA BORDER CROSSING — Among the Lebanese hoping to return home following a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah are thousands who had fled the war to Syria. Families with hastily packed belongings on Wednesday crossed under heavy rain from Syria into eastern Lebanon. The road, heavily damaged by Israeli airstrikes, is under repair. Mariam Mawla, from Bazouria in southern Lebanon, was thrilled to be returning home after two months in Syrian capital Damascus. As she waited in traffic at the crossing, she told The Associated Press that she hoped to find her house intact. 'I heard that there might be some damage, but no matter what, we thank God that we are returning home,' Mawla said. France will work with Netanyahu despite an arrest warrant PARIS — France says it 'intends to continue to work in close collaboration' with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu despite the arrest warrant issued for him by the world’s top war-crimes court. Since the International Criminal Court issued warrants last week, French officials have replied vaguely to questions about whether France would arrest Netanyahu should he visit the country. Prime Minister Michel Barnier told parliament this week that France would 'rigorously' respect its obligations according to international law. The position was echoed by France’s foreign minister in a broadcast interview Wednesday morning. But in a subsequent statement, the French Foreign Ministry argued that Netanyahu and others affected by the court warrants benefit from immunity because Israel is not a member of the court. It said this would be 'taken into consideration if the ICC was to ask us for their arrest and handing over.' The statement cited 'the historic friendship that links France and Israel' and described them as 'two democracies committed to the rule of law and respect for professional and independent justice.' Fighting rages in Gaza as ceasefire takes hold in Lebanon TEL AVIV, Israel — As a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah appears to hold in Lebanon, fighting raged on in the Gaza Strip on Wednesday. The Gaza Health Ministry said 33 bodies had been brought to hospitals over the past 24 hours, raising the death toll in the nearly 14-month-long war to 44,282. The Health Ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count but says more than half of the dead are women and children. The Israeli military said it struck dozens of Hamas sites in hard-hit northern Gaza, including weapons storage facilities and military structures. It said it warned civilians to evacuate the area beforehand. The military has battled for weeks a resurgence of Hamas in the area, which was an early target of Israel’s offensive. The Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire has no direct bearing on the conflict in Gaza, where international mediators have struggled to secure a truce. Israeli forces will only gradually withdraw from Lebanon, official says JERUSALEM — An Israeli security official says Israeli forces remain in their positions hours after a ceasefire took place and will only gradually withdraw from southern Lebanon. The official, speaking Wednesday on condition of anonymity under military briefing rules, would not say when troops would begin the withdrawal but said it would be completed during the 60-day period laid out in the ceasefire agreement. He said the pace of the withdrawal and the scheduled return of Lebanese civilians to their homes would depend on whether the deal is implemented and enforced by all sides. 'We need to see the mechanism is working,' he said. 'It’s a gradual agreement. It’s a gradual withdrawal.' The official said Israeli soldiers were responding to an immediate threat when they opened fire earlier Wednesday at several vehicles approaching a restricted area in Lebanon. There were no reports on casualties. The official said that Israel was prepared to do so again if troops were at risk. 'We will fire when our forces are threatened,' he said. He said non-immediate threats would be reported to the international monitoring committee, but that if no action is taken, 'we will enforce it.' — By Josef Federman Hamas ready to cooperate in efforts to bring about ceasefire in Gaza CAIRO — Hamas says it’s ready to cooperate with any effort to bring about a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, after Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah reached a truce to end months of fighting. The deal does not address the war in Gaza. International mediators have repeatedly failed to bring Israel and Hamas to a deal that would end the brutal, 13-month-long war. In a statement, Hamas repeated it would seek the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, the return of displaced Palestinians and a 'real and complete prisoner exchange deal.' Israel has refused to commit to ending the war under any ceasefire deal and some members of the Israeli government have balked over freeing large number of Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the roughly 100 hostages still held by militants in Gaza. President Joe Biden said Tuesday he hoped for a renewed international push for negotiations in coming days. Lebanon’s caretaker government approves Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire BEIRUT — Lebanon’s caretaker government on Wednesday approved a U.S.-brokered ceasefire between the militant Hezbollah group and Israel. The move was largely a formality but also signaled the government’s commitment to its part in the deal, including deploying Lebanese soldiers along the border with Israel and cooperating with United Nations peacekeepers. 'Today is a new day, where we hope it carries with it peace and stability,' caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati said in a statement following the morning meeting. The agreement is an implementation plan for U.N. Security Council resolution 1701, which was passed in 2006 to end the last Israel-Hezbollah war but never was fully carried out. Its goal was for the Lebanese military to be the exclusive armed presence in southern Lebanon alongside U.N. peacekeepers, and for Hezbollah and Israeli forces to withdraw from the area. According to a copy of the ceasefire agreement provided by the Lebanese government, the Lebanese military would gradually deploy in the south and dismantle unauthorized military infrastructure and weapons production facilities. The United States and France, in addition to UNIFIL peacekeepers, will monitor violations and support the process. German chancellor expresses relief over ceasefire in Lebanon BERLIN — German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has expressed relief over the Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire and called on both sides to stick to the agreement. 'Finally, Hezbollah and Israel have agreed on a ceasefire in Lebanon, brokered by our partners USA and France,' Scholz wrote Wednesday on X. 'It is important that everyone sticks to what has been agreed, so that people on both sides of the border can live in safety again.' Germany is a staunch ally of Israel, but at the same time home to a Lebanese immigrant community of more than 100,000. Lebanese politician who helped broker ceasefire calls for effort to fill the country’s presidency BEIRUT — The speaker of Lebanon’s parliament called for another effort to fill the country’s long-vacant presidency just hours after a ceasefire to halt hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel went into effect. Lebanon has been without a president since October 2022, as its deeply divided parliament has been unable to elect a new head of state. The last effort to elect a president was more than a year ago. Speaker Nabih Berri called for political parties to come together to elect a president 'who unites rather than divides.' 'I call upon you because a moment of truth in which we must unite for the sake of Lebanon has arrived,' Berri said in a televised address. 'This is a test for how we can save Lebanon. How we can build it and how we can bring back life for its constitutional institutions.' The war compounded Lebanon’s economic troubles and worsened tensions between political groups allied and opposed to Hezbollah. Berri spearheaded Lebanon’s negotiation efforts for a U.S.-brokered ceasefire to end the war between Israel and Hezbollah. He’s a top Shiite politician and a key ally of Hezbollah. Iran-backed Iraqi militia vows to continue fighting Israel BAGHDAD — One of the most powerful Iran-backed factions in Iraq said it would continue its operations in support of Gaza despite the Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire. Iraqi militias have repeatedly launched attacks on Israel from Iraq in the nearly 14 months since the Israel-Hamas war broke out. In a statement, the Kataib Hezbollah group said that the ceasefire would not have been possible without the 'resilience of Hezbollah fighters and the failure of the Zionists to achieve their objectives, making the decision solely Lebanese.' The group said that a pause by one member of the so-called Axis of Resistance, which includes Iran-backed groups from Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and Yemen, would not undermine the broader 'unity of fronts' strategy. The militia also said the U.S. had been Israel’s partner 'in all acts of betrayal, killing, destruction and displacement,' and said it 'will eventually have to pay for its actions.' A Lebanese man who's lived through multiple wars says this one has been the worst TYRE, Lebanon — Mohammed Kaafarani has lived through multiple conflicts with Israel. But he says the past two months were the worst of them all. 'They were a nasty and ugly 60 days,' said Kaafarani, 59, who was displaced from the Lebanese village of Bidias, near the southern port city of Tyre. Thousands of displaced people poured into the city Wednesday after a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah went into effect. Kaafarani said the latest war was the most difficult because the bombardment was so intense. 'We reached a point where there was no place to hide. Even buildings were destroyed.' He said Tyre was left almost empty as most of its residents fled. Kaafarani said he hopes his children and grandchildren will have a better future without wars because 'our generation suffered and is still suffering.' 'The last two months were way too long,' said Kaafarani, whose home was badly damaged in the fighting. He vowed to fix it and continue on with life. Some people displaced from northern Israeli towns say they still don’t feel safe enough to return HAIFA, Israel — Some people in Israel who have been displaced by fighting with the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah say the ceasefire deal doesn’t make them feel secure enough to go home. Some 50,000 people have been displaced from a string of cities, towns and villages along Israel’s northern border with Lebanon. Those communities have been pummeled by Hezbollah rocket and drone fire for 13 months, with dozens of houses damaged and in need of rebuilding or rehabilitation. Noy Friedman, who was displaced from the town of Shlomi to the city of Haifa, said she wouldn’t feel safe in her hometown. 'I am also not ready for my family to return to Shlomi,' said Friedman. Many displaced Israelis have been living in hotels since the fighting began in Oct. 2023 or have tried to reestablish their lives in new areas far from the fighting. Returning could take months because of the damage caused to the communities, but also because of the fears many of the displaced still feel. On a cold, rainy Wednesday morning, the hard-hit Israeli town of Kiryat Shmona was quiet. A handful of people milled about, inspecting damage from rocket attacks, including to the roof of a bus. The town’s shopping mall, which had been hit before, appeared to have new damage. A rocket was seen stuck in the ground next to an apartment building. 'I am against the ceasefire,' said Eliyahu Maman, a Kiryat Shmona resident displaced to Haifa who feared Hezbollah could still attack from southern Lebanon. 'I am not ready to return to Kiryat Shmona.' Jordan says ceasefire is ‘an important step’ AMMAN, Jordan — Jordan on Wednesday welcomed the ceasefire between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, saying it should be followed by an international effort to wind down the war in Gaza. In a statement, Jordan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the ceasefire 'an important step.' But it said 'Israeli aggression on Gaza' must be stopped. Jordan expressed support for Lebanon and stressed the importance of fully implementing the ceasefire. Jordan is a close Western ally that made peace with Israel in 1994. But Israel’s devastating offensive in the Gaza Strip, launched after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack, has strained relations. The country has a large Palestinian population which has demonstrated regularly against the war in Gaza. Gaza residents hope for ceasefire after nearly 14 months of grueling war KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip — Palestinians said Wednesday they hoped there would be a ceasefire in Gaza now that Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah agreed to a truce. But some feared that Israel would be more heavy handed with Gaza now that its forces were freed up from the fighting against Hezbollah. 'The situation will be worse, because the pressure will be more on Gaza,' said Mamdouh Yonis, a man currently living in Khan Younis after being displaced from the southern city of Rafah, told The Associated Press. Palestinians in Gaza are desperately waiting for a ceasefire agreement that would end the war between Hamas and Israel. It’s already killed over 44,000 people according to local authorities, who don’t distinguish between combatants and civilians in their count. The war was sparked when Hamas raided southern Israel in Oct. 2023, killing 1,200 and kidnapping 250, about 100 of whom remain in Gaza. International mediation efforts meant to clinch a deal have faltered repeatedly, and the war is now in its 14th month with no end in sight. 'They agree to a ceasefire in one place and not in the other? Have mercy on the children, the elderly and the women. We are sitting in tents and now it is winter,' said Ahlam Abu Shalabi, a woman displaced from Gaza City. Turkey welcomes ceasefire in Lebanon ANKARA, Turkey — Turkey welcomed the ceasefire reached between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, expressing hope that it would lead to a lasting truce. In a statement issued Wednesday, Turkey’s Foreign Ministry also called on the international community to exert pressure on Israel to force it to 'strictly comply with the ceasefire and compensate for the damage it has caused in Lebanon.' The ministry also urged the establishment of 'permanent and comprehensive' ceasefire in Gaza, calling on Israel to 'end its aggressive policies.' Israeli military says it fired at cars in Lebanon after they approached restricted area TEL AVIV, Israel — The Israeli military said Wednesday that its forces opened fire in Lebanon on a number of cars that approached an area it said was restricted, as a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah appeared to take hold. The military said the vehicles drove away. It was not immediately clear if there were any injuries as a result. The Israeli military has warned residents of previously evacuated areas of Lebanon that had been evacuated, but displaced people have been streaming south to their homes. The military said soldiers remained in position in southern Lebanon and that the air force was ready to act if needed. It said Israel’s aerial defense array was also at the ready for any ceasefire violations. France highlights its role in brokering the deal PARIS — France’s foreign minister underlined his country’s role in brokering an agreement that ended fighting between Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah militant group alongside the U.S., saying the deal wouldn’t have been possible without France’s special relationship with its former protectorate. 'It’s a success for French diplomacy and we can be proud,' said the minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, speaking hours after the ceasefire went into effect Wednesday. 'It is true that the United States have a privileged relationship with Israel. But with Lebanon, it’s France that has very old ties, very close ties,' the minister added. 'It would not have been possible to envisage a ceasefire in Lebanon without France being involved on the front line.' France will be involved in monitoring the ceasefire, Barrot noted, with 700 French soldiers deployed as part of the 10,000-strong United Nations peacekeeping force, known as UNIFIL, that has been patrolling the border area between Lebanon and Israel for nearly 50 years. The minister said France will also work to strengthen Lebanese troops that will deploy in the south of the country as part of the ceasefire, although he didn’t specify what that might include. Lebanese military warns people returning homes in south Lebanon to wait for Israeli troops to leave BEIRUT — The Lebanese military asked displaced people returning to southern Lebanon to avoid frontline villages and towns near the border where the Israeli military is still present until the troops withdraw. Thousands of people have been returning to other previously evacuated areas in south Lebanon in defiance of an Israeli warning to avoid all previously evacuated areas. Many of those areas were hit by strikes just hours before the ceasefire took effect. Iran welcomes ceasefire DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Iran welcomed the ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah, Tehran's main militant partner in the Mideast. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei praised the ceasefire in a statement Wednesday morning. Baghaei said that Iran still sought a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. But like Hezbollah, it's dropped the demand that a ceasefire also take place at the same time in the Gaza Strip. He also called for the International Criminal Court to try the 'criminals of the occupying regime,' referring to Israel. The ICC has issued arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel’s former defense minister. Celebrations and relief as displaced people return to Tyre TYRE, Lebanon — Displaced people started returning to the coastal city of Tyre on motorcycles and in cars early Wednesday, defying an Israeli military warning to stay away from previously evacuated areas. Ahmad Husseini said returning to southern Lebanon was an 'indescribable feeling' and praised Speaker of Parliament Nabih Berri, who led Lebanon’s negotiations with Washington. 'He made us and everyone proud.' Husseini, who earlier fled a town near the coastal city, spoke to The Associated Press while in his car with family members. Meanwhile, sporadic celebratory gunfire could be heard at a main roundabout in the city, as people returning honked the horns of cars — some piled with mattresses — and residents cheered. A couple of men shouted slogans praising slain Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in an Israeli airstrike in September. Hussein Sweidan said he sees the ceasefire as a victory for Hezbollah. 'This is a moment of victory, pride and honor for us, the Shia sect, and for all of Lebanon,' he said. Smoke rises over Beirut from overnight strikes BEIRUT — As dawn broke in Beirut, plumes of smoke were visible rising from places hit by Israeli strikes before the ceasefire took effect at 4 a.m. Residents of Lebanon’s capital and its southern suburbs endured the most intense day of strikes since the war began on Tuesday. Lebanon sees quiet, but recovery could be slow BEIRUT — As the ceasefire went into effect early Wednesday, much of Lebanon was quiet for the first time since late September, following weeks of intense overnight strikes in southern and eastern Lebanon. Some celebratory gunshots could be heard in parts of Beirut’s southern suburbs, battered over the past two months. Israel’s Arabic military spokesperson Avichay Adraee has warned displaced Lebanese not to return to their villages in southern Lebanon, but some videos circulating on social media show displaced Lebanese defying these calls and returning to villages in the south near the coastal city of Tyre. Israeli troops are still present in parts of southern Lebanon after Israel launched a ground invasion in October. Lebanese have also been displaced from other parts of the country, notably the southern Beirut suburbs and the eastern Bekaa province. It’s unclear how long it will take cash-strapped Lebanon to rebuild these bombarded neighborhoods. The war has displaced some 1.2 million people, according to the Lebanese government. Israeli military says its evacuation orders in south Lebanon are in still in effect JERUSALEM — As the ceasefire took effect early Wednesday, Israel’s military warned people with homes in areas of south Lebanon that it ordered evacuated to stay away for now. Israeli military spokesman Col. Avichay Adraee issued the warning on the social platform X. 'You are prohibited from heading towards the villages that the IDF has ordered to be evacuated or towards IDF forces in the area,' Adraee wrote, using an acronym for the Israeli military. 'For your safety and the safety of your family members, refrain from moving to the area.' There were no immediate signs of renewed fighting as the ceasefire took hold early Wednesday morning. Ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon begins The ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah militants has begun as a region on edge wonders whether it will hold. The ceasefire announced Tuesday is a major step toward ending nearly 14 months of fighting sparked by the ongoing war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas. Israel has said it will attack if Hezbollah breaks the ceasefire agreement. The ceasefire calls for an initial two-month halt to fighting and requires Hezbollah to end its armed presence in southern Lebanon, while Israeli troops are to return to their side of the border. An international panel led by the United States will monitor compliance. The ceasefire began at 4 a.m. Wednesday, a day after Israel carried out its most intense wave of airstrikes in Beirut since the start of the conflict that in recent weeks turned into all-out war.

An Australia police officer who shocked a 95-year-old woman with a Taser is guilty of manslaughter	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) — A police officer in Australia who shocked a 95-year-old nursing home resident with a Taser was found guilty of her manslaughter on Wednesday. A jury found Sen Const Kristian James Samuel White guilty in the New South Wales Supreme Court in Sydney after 20 hours of deliberation. Clare Nowland, a great-grandmother who had dementia and used a walker, was refusing to put down the steak knife she was holding when White discharged his Taser at her in May 2023. Nowland, a resident of Yallambee Lodge, a nursing home in the town of Cooma , fell backwards after White shocked her. She hit her head and died a week later in hospital. The extraordinary case prompted a high-level internal investigation by state police in New South Wales. It also provoked debate about how officers in the state use Tasers, a device that incapacitates using electricity. Police said at the time of her death that Nowland received her fatal injuries from striking her head on the floor, rather than directly from the device's debilitating electric shock. In video footage played during the Supreme Court trial, 34-year-old White was heard saying 'nah, bugger it' before discharging his weapon, after the officers told Nowland 21 times to put the knife down. White told the jury he had been taught that any person wielding a knife was dangerous, the Guardian reported. But after an eight-day trial, the jury rejected arguments by White's lawyers that his use of the Taser was a proportionate response to the threat posed by Nowland, who weighed about 100 pounds. The prosecutor argued that White's use of the Taser was was 'utterly unnecessary and obviously excessive,' local news outlets said. The charge of manslaughter carries a possible prison term of up to 25 years in jail in New South Wales. White is on bail. Nowland was survived by eight children, 24 grandchildren and 31 great-grandchildren, the Australia's ABC reported.	https://apnews.com/article/kristian-white-police-taser-clare-nowland-australia-c67a6af9dce4d977ad844c43e21ebd47	2024-11-26T17:58:17-08:00	
Australia's House of Representatives passes bill that would ban young children from social media	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Australia’s House of Representatives on Wednesday passed a bill that would ban children younger than 16 years old from social media, leaving it to the Senate to finalize the world-first law. The major parties backed the bill that would make platforms including TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram liable for fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for systemic failures to prevent young children from holding accounts. The legislation passed 102 to 13. If the bill becomes law this week, the platforms would have one year to work out how to implement the age restrictions before the penalties are enforced. Opposition lawmaker Dan Tehan told Parliament the government had agreed to accept amendments in the Senate that would bolster privacy protections. Platforms would not be allowed to compel users to provide government-issued identity documents including passports or driver’s licenses. The platforms also could not demand digital identification through a government system. 'Will it be perfect? No. But is any law perfect? No, it’s not. But if it helps, even if it helps in just the smallest of ways, it will make a huge difference to people’s lives,' Tehan told Parliament. Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said the Senate would debate the bill later Wednesday. The major parties’ support all but guarantees the legislation will pass in the Senate, where no party holds a majority of seats. Lawmakers who were not aligned with either the government or the opposition were most critical of the legislation during debate on Tuesday and Wednesday. Criticisms include that the legislation had been rushed through Parliament without adequate scrutiny, would not work, would create privacy risks for users of all ages and would take away parents’ authority to decide what’s best for their children. Critics also argue the ban would isolate children, deprive them of positive aspects of social media, drive children to the dark web, make children too young for social media reluctant to report harms they encountered and take away incentives for platforms to make online spaces safer. Independent lawmaker Zoe Daniel said the legislation would 'make zero difference to the harms that are inherent to social media.' 'The true object of this legislation is not to make social media safe by design, but to make parents and voters feel like the government is doing something about it,' Daniel told Parliament. 'There is a reason why the government parades this legislation as world-leading, that’s because no other country wants to do it,' she added. T he platforms had asked for the vote on legislation to be delayed until at least June next year when a government-commissioned evaluation of age assurance technologies made its report on how the ban could been enforced. Melbourne resident Wayne Holdsworth, whose 17-year-old son Mac took his own life last year after falling victim to an online sextortion scam, described the bill as 'absolutely essential for the safety of our children.' 'It’s not the only thing that we need to do to protect them because education is the key, but to provide some immediate support for our children and parents to be able to manage this, it’s a great step,' the 65-year-old online safety campaigner told The Associated Press on Tuesday. 'And in my opinion, it’s the greatest time in our country’s history,' he added, referring to the pending legal reform.	https://apnews.com/article/australia-social-media-young-children-bf0ca2aedaf61b71fe335421240e94c4	2024-11-26T14:46:08-08:00	
A look at the Israel-Hezbollah war, by the numbers	JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel has agreed to a ceasefire with Lebanon-based Hezbollah militants after nearly 14 months of cross-border fire that has dealt a heavy blow to both countries. The ceasefire starts early Wednesday and calls for a two-month initial halt in fighting. It would require Hezbollah to end its armed presence in a broad swath of southern Lebanon, while Israeli troops would return to their side of the border. But implementation remains a major question mark. The conflict began on Oct. 8, 2023, a day after Hamas attacked southern Israel, as Hezbollah fired rockets into Israel in solidarity with Hamas and Israel returned fire. Tens of thousands of people were displaced from both sides of the border. Israel launched a more widespread bombardment of Lebanon two months ago, followed by a ground invasion. More than 3,500 people in Lebanon have been killed, many of them civilians. More than 70 have been killed in Israel, over 40 of them civilians. In addition, over 50 Israeli soldiers have been killed in the ground offensive. From entire Lebanese villages demolished to thousands of acres of Israeli farmland burned by Hezbollah rocket fire, the conflict has wreaked destruction on both sides of the border. Here’s a look at the conflict by the numbers.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-war-numbers-hezbollah-military-6f1a651ebba0a88fbdb7ca59a57acd1e	2024-11-26T13:48:36-08:00	
Trump vows tariffs over immigration. What the numbers say about border crossings, drugs and crime	WASHINGTON (AP) — In a Monday evening announcement, President-elect Donald Trump railed against Mexico and Canada, accusing them of allowing thousands of people to enter the U.S. Hitting a familiar theme from the campaign trail and his first term in office, Trump portrayed the country's borders as insecure and immigrants as contributing to crime and the fentanyl crisis. In an announcement that could have stark repercussions, he threatened to impose 25% tariffs on everything coming into the country from those two countries. Trump's anti-immigration rhetoric has resonated with voters concerned about immigration and crime. Yet there's more to the story than Trump's short statement suggested. A look at what the numbers and studies say about border crossings, fentanyl smuggling and whether there's a connection between immigration and crime: Border crossings The number of migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border is a key metric watched intensely by both Republicans and Democrats. U.S. Customs and Border Protection, an arm of the Department of Homeland Security, releases monthly statistics that track everything from drug seizures to cross-border trade. One of the metrics tracked is the number of Border Patrol arrests or encounters each month with people entering the country between the official border crossings — known as the ports of entry. The vast majority of those arrests happen at the southern border. Those numbers have actually been falling this year under the Biden administration. The Border Patrol made 56,530 arrests in October, which is about a four-year low. It hasn't always been like that. The Biden administration struggled to bring down the growing number of migrants coming to the southern border. A little less than a year ago, in December 2023, the Border Patrol made about a quarter of a million arrests along the southern border — an all-time high. Cross-border trade was damaged as border agents were reassigned to help process migrants and train traffic was temporarily shut down. Since then, the numbers of people encountered at the southern border have dropped and stayed down through a combination of stricter enforcement on the Mexican side and asylum restrictions announced earlier this year by the Biden administration. Republicans put a caveat on those numbers. They have frequently accused the Biden administration of using an app called CBP One to let hundreds of thousands of people into the country who otherwise wouldn't be allowed in. They've described the program where 1,450 people a day can schedule an appointment to come into the U.S. as essentially a way to keep the border encounter numbers artificially low. On the northern border, the numbers are much smaller. Border Patrol made 23,721 arrests between October 2023 and September 2024, compared with 10,021 the previous 12 months. Trump also struggled to get a handle on illegal border crossings. Arrests topped 850,000 in 2019, nearly triple the amount two years earlier, though still far below the tally of more than 2 million for two different years under Biden. Drug smuggling Trump and many Republicans have often portrayed the U.S.'s southern border as wide open to drug smuggling. They have also linked immigrants to drug smuggling and accused Mexico of doing little to stop it. Much of America’s fentanyl is smuggled from Mexico. The fentanyl scourge began well before Biden took office. Border seizures have jumped sharply under Biden, which may partly reflect improved detection. About 27,000 pounds (12,247 kilograms) of fentanyl was seized by U.S. authorities in the 2023 government budget year, compared with 2,545 pounds (1,154 kilograms) in 2019, when Trump was president. Cooperation between the Mexican and U.S. governments on fighting drug smuggling undoubtedly suffered under President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who left office at the end of September. Before López Obrador took office in December 2018, the U.S. worked closely with Mexico’s military to take down drug capos. But López Obrador, a nationalist and folksy populist, railed against the violence set off by the drug war waged by his predecessors and the Americans. He proposed addressing the root societal causes of violence found in poverty and a lack of opportunity for young people, in what he called 'hugs, not bullets.' For years, López Obrador denied that Mexico made fentanyl, despite evidence to the contrary, including statements from his own security officials. He blamed U.S. society, where he said families push children out of home too early, for cultivating addicts. It's only two months into the term of President Claudia Sheinbaum but there are signs that she appears more willing to let the military go after the cartels than her predecessor. But while most of the fentanyl comes from Mexico, statistics show that it is Americans who are doing the smuggling across the border. According to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, 86.4% of people sentenced for fentanyl trafficking crimes in a 12-month period ending September 2023 were American citizens. Crime and immigration Trump also has argued that the influx of immigrants is causing a crime surge in the U.S., although statistics show violent crime is on the way down. Texas is the only state that tracks crime by immigration status. A study published by the National Academy of Sciences, based on Texas Department of Public Safety data from 2012 to 2016, found people in the U.S. illegally had 'substantially lower crime rates than native-born citizens and legal immigrants across a range of felony offenses.' While FBI statistics do not separate out crimes by the immigration status of the assailant, there is no evidence of a spike in crime perpetrated by migrants, either along the U.S.-Mexico border or in cities seeing the greatest influx of migrants, like New York. Studies have found that people living in the U.S. illegally are less likely than native-born Americans to have been arrested for violent, drug and property crimes. Some crime is inevitable given the large population of immigrants. There were an estimated 11 million people in the country illegally in January 2022, according to the latest estimate by U.S. Homeland Security Department. In 2022, the Census Bureau estimated the foreign-born population at 46.2 million, or nearly 14% of the total, with most states seeing double-digit percentage increases in the last dozen years. Republicans have highlighted high-profile crimes by immigrants such as the February killing of 22-year-old Laken Riley in Georgia and argued that any crime committed by someone in the country illegally is a crime that shouldn't have happened. A Venezuelan man who entered the country illegally was convicted and sentenced to life in prison this month in Riley's killing. __ Associated Press writer Christopher Sherman in Mexico City contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-immigration-crime-drugs-border-mexico-1528ef9c04f786478184a279ad26abb9	2024-11-26T13:20:11-08:00	
UN Resolution 1701 is at the heart of the Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire. What is it?	BEIRUT (AP) — In 2006, after a bruising monthlong war between Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah militant group, the United Nations Security Council unanimously voted for a resolution to end the conflict and pave the way for lasting security along the border. But while relative calm stood for nearly two decades, Resolution 1701’s terms were never fully enforced. Now, figuring out how to finally enforce it is key to a U.S.-brokered deal that brought a ceasefire Wednesday. In late September, after nearly a year of low-level clashes, the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah spiraled into all-out war and an Israeli ground invasion. As Israeli jets pound deep inside Lebanon and Hezbollah fires rockets deeper into northern Israel, U.N. and diplomatic officials again turned to the 2006 resolution in a bid to end the conflict. Years of deeply divided politics and regionwide geopolitical hostilities have halted substantial progress on its implementation, yet the international community believes Resolution 1701 is still the brightest prospect for long-term stability between Israel and Lebanon. Almost two decades after the last war between Israel and Hezbollah, the United States led shuttle diplomacy efforts between Lebanon and Israel to agree on a ceasefire proposal that renewed commitment to the resolution, this time with an implementation plan to try to reinvigorate the document. What is UNSC Resolution 1701? In 2000, Israel withdrew its forces from most of southern Lebanon along a U.N.-demarcated 'Blue Line' that separated the two countries and the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights, which most of the world considers occupied Syrian territory. U.N. peacekeeping forces in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, increased their presence along the line of withdrawal. Resolution 1701 was supposed to complete Israel’s withdrawal from southern Lebanon and ensure Hezbollah would move north of the Litani River, keeping the area exclusively under the Lebanese military and U.N. peacekeepers. Up to 15,000 U.N. peacekeepers would help to maintain calm, return displaced Lebanese and secure the area alongside the Lebanese military. The goal was long-term security, with land borders eventually demarcated to resolve territorial disputes. The resolution also reaffirmed previous ones that call for the disarmament of all armed groups in Lebanon — Hezbollah among them. 'It was made for a certain situation and context,' Elias Hanna, a retired Lebanese army general, told The Associated Press. 'But as time goes on, the essence of the resolution begins to hollow.' Has Resolution 1701 been implemented? For years, Lebanon and Israel blamed each other for countless violations along the tense frontier. Israel said Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force and growing arsenal remained, and accused the group of using a local environmental organization to spy on troops. Lebanon complained about Israeli military jets and naval ships entering Lebanese territory even when there was no active conflict. 'You had a role of the UNIFIL that slowly eroded like any other peacekeeping with time that has no clear mandate,' said Joseph Bahout, the director of the Issam Fares Institute for Public Policy at the American University of Beirut. 'They don’t have permission to inspect the area without coordinating with the Lebanese army.' UNIFIL for years has urged Israel to withdraw from some territory north of the frontier, but to no avail. In the ongoing war, the peacekeeping mission has accused Israel, as well as Hezbollah, of obstructing and harming its forces and infrastructure. Hezbollah’s power, meanwhile, has grown, both in its arsenal and as a political influence in the Lebanese state. The Iran-backed group was essential in keeping Syrian President Bashar Assad in power when armed opposition groups tried to topple him, and it supports Iran-backed groups in Iraq and Yemen. It has an estimated 150,000 rockets and missiles, including precision-guided missiles pointed at Israel, and has introduced drones into its arsenal. Hanna says Hezbollah 'is something never seen before as a non-state actor' with political and military influence. How do mediators hope to implement 1701 almost two decades later? Israel's security Cabinet approved the ceasefire agreement late Tuesday, according to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office. The ceasefire began at 4 a.m. local time Wednesday. Efforts led by the U.S. and France for the ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah underscored that they still view the resolution as key. For almost a year, Washington has promoted various versions of a deal that would gradually lead to its full implementation. International mediators hope that by boosting financial support for the Lebanese army — which was not a party in the Israel-Hezbollah war — Lebanon can deploy some 6,000 additional troops south of the Litani River to help enforce the resolution. Under the deal, an international monitoring committee headed by the United States would oversee implementation to ensure that Hezbollah and Israel’s withdrawals take place. It is not entirely clear how the committee would work or how potential violations would be reported and dealt with. The circumstances now are far more complicated than in 2006. Some are still skeptical of the resolution's viability given that the political realities and balance of power both regionally and within Lebanon have dramatically changed since then.

Brazil’s Bolsonaro planned and participated in a 2022 coup plot, an unsealed police report alleges	SAO PAULO (AP) — Brazil’s former far-right President Jair Bolsonaro was fully aware of and actively participated in a coup plot to remain in office after his defeat in the 2022 election, according to a Federal Police report unsealed Tuesday. Federal Police last Thursday formally accused Bolsonaro and 36 other people of attempting a coup. They sent their 884-page report to the Supreme Court, which lifted the seal. The unsealed document provides a first glimpse of several testimonies that describe the former president as one of the key leaders of the plot, and not a mere observer. 'The evidence collected throughout the investigation shows unequivocally that then-President Jair Messias Bolsonaro planned, acted and was directly and effectively aware of the actions of the criminal organization aiming to launch a coup d’etat and eliminate the democratic rule of law, which did not take place due to reasons unrelated to his desire,' the document said. At another point, it says: 'Bolsonaro had full awareness and active participation.' Bolsonaro, who had repeatedly alleged without evidence that the country's electronic voting system was prone to fraud, called a meeting in December 2022, during which he presented a draft decree to the commanders of the three divisions of the armed forces, according to the police report, signed by four investigators. The decree would have launched an investigation into suspicions of fraud and crimes related to the October 2022 vote, and suspended the powers of the nation's electoral court. The navy’s commander stood ready to comply, but those from the army and air force objected to any plan that prevented Lula’s inauguration, the report said. Those refusals are why the plan did not go ahead, according to witnesses who spoke to investigators. Bolsonaro never signed the decree to set the final stage of the alleged plan into action. Federal Police say the former president and his allies at first expected to launch the coup d'etat on Dec. 15, 2022. The document also said that top military personnel who stood in the way became targets of online attacks by a pro-Bolsonaro digital militia group. Bolsonaro has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing or awareness of any plot to keep him in power or oust his leftist rival and successor, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. 'No one is going to do a coup with a reserve general and half a dozen other officers. What is being said is absurd. For my part, there has never been any discussion of a coup,' Bolsonaro told journalists in Brazil’s capital Brasilia on Monday. 'If someone came to discuss a coup with me, I’d say, that’s fine, but the day after, how does the world view us?' he added. 'The word ‘coup’ has never been in my dictionary.' The top court has passed the report to Prosecutor-General Paulo Gonet. He will decide whether to formally charge Bolsonaro and put him on trial, or toss the investigation. The former president was formally accused of three crimes: violent elimination of the rule of law, staging a coup d'etat and forming a criminal organization. Rodrigo Rios, a law professor at the PUC university in the city of Curitiba, said Bolsonaro could face at least 11 years in prison if convicted on all charges. 'A woman involved in the Jan. 8 attack on the Supreme Court received a 17-year prison sentence,' Rios told The Associated Press, noting that the former president is more likely to receive 15 years or more if convicted. 'Bolsonaro’s future looks dark.' In the Jan. 8, 2022 riot, his followers ransacked the Supreme Court and presidential palace in Brasilia, seeking to prompt intervention by the army that would oust Lula from power. João Pedro Pádua, a law professor at the Universidade Federal Fluminense in Rio de Janeiro, said Bolsonaro’s defense could argue that actions of planning for a coup d’etat, as many described in the document, shouldn’t be prosecuted as if the group had acted. 'There’s a distinction between preparatory actions and execution actions. Planning is typically a preparatory action,' Pádua said. 'Of course there are some execution actions here, too. Pressure on key military agents is one. But there will be a debate about that.' Pádua added that Bolsonaro faces the biggest risk of conviction on the count of forming a criminal organization, as the document shows evidence that he held several meetings with key allies to discuss the plot. Ahead of the 2022 election, Bolsonaro repeatedly alleged that the election system, which does not use paper ballots, could be tampered with. The top electoral court later ruled that he had abused his power to cast unfounded doubt on the voting system, and ruled him ineligible for office until 2030. Still, he has maintained that he will stand as a candidate in the 2026 race. Since Bolsonaro left office, he has been targeted by several investigations, all of which he has chalked up to political persecution. Federal Police have accused him of smuggling diamond jewelry into Brazil without properly declaring it and directing a subordinate to falsify his and others’ COVID-19 vaccination statuses. Authorities are also investigating whether he incited the Jan. 8, 2022 riot. Bolsonaro had left for the United States days before Lula’s inauguration on Jan. 1, 2023 and stayed there three months, keeping a low profile. The police report unsealed Tuesday alleges he was seeking to avoid possible imprisonment related to the coup plot, and awaiting the uprising that took place a week later. Sen. Flavio Bolsonaro, one of the former president's sons, said Tuesday evening that 'the only path for some normalcy and some balance between the powers is amnesty' for the far-right leader, his allies and his supporters. 'It has to be wide-ranging, general and unrestricted amnesty. I am very convinced of that. It has to include Justice Alexandre de Moraes, too,' Flavio Bolsonaro said during a session at the Senate. He and his allies claim de Moraes has overstepped in the investigations of the former president and want him impeached. De Moraes denies any wrongdoing in the probe and has =insisted he will not leave the investigation even though he was one of the targets of the plot. ___ Hughes reported from Rio de Janeiro.	https://apnews.com/article/brazil-bolsonaro-coup-investigation-8281b3df34426a0b589ad869c2abd696	2024-11-26T11:14:03-08:00	
Trump's threat to impose tariffs could raise prices for consumers, colliding with promise for relief	DETROIT (AP) — If Donald Trump makes good on his threat to slap 25% tariffs on everything imported from Mexico and Canada, the price increases that could follow will collide with his campaign promise to give American families a break from inflation. Economists say companies would have little choice but to pass along the added costs, dramatically raising prices for food, clothing, automobiles, booze and other goods. The president-elect floated the tariff idea, including additional 10% taxes on goods from China, as a way to force the countries to halt the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs into the U.S. But his posts Monday on Truth Social threatening the tariffs on his first day in office could just be a negotiating ploy to get the countries to change behavior. High food prices were a major issue in voters picking Trump over Vice President Kamala Harris, but tariffs almost certainly would push those costs up even further. For instance, the Produce Distributors Association, a Washington trade group, said Tuesday that tariffs will raise prices for fresh fruit and vegetables and hurt U.S. farmers when other countries retaliate. 'Tariffs distort the marketplace and will raise prices along the supply chain, resulting in the consumer paying more at the checkout line,' said Alan Siger, association president. Mexico and Canada are two of the biggest exporters of fresh fruit and vegetables to the U.S. In 2022, Mexico supplied 51% of fresh fruit and 69% of fresh vegetables imported by value into the U.S., while Canada supplied 2% of fresh fruit and 20% of fresh vegetables. Before the election, about 7 in 10 voters said they were very concerned about the cost of food, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 120,000 voters. 'We’ll get them down,' Trump told shoppers during a September visit to a Pennsylvania grocery store. The U.S. is the largest importer of goods in the world, with Mexico, China and Canada its top three suppliers, according to the most recent U.S. Census data. People looking to buy a new vehicle likely would see big price increases as well, at a time when costs have gone up so much that they are out of reach for many. The average price of a new vehicle now runs around $48,000. About 15% of the 15.6 million new vehicles sold in the U.S. last year came from Mexico, while 8% crossed the border from Canada, according to Global Data. Much of the tariffs would get passed along to consumers, unless automakers can somehow quickly find productivity improvements to offset them, said C.J. Finn, U.S. automotive sector leader for PwC, a consulting firm. That means even more consumers 'would potentially get priced out of the activity' of buying a new vehicle, Finn said. Hardest hit would be Volkswagen, Stellantis, General Motors and Ford, Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska wrote Tuesday in a note to investors. Stellantis and VW import about 40% of the vehicles they sell from Canada and Mexico, while it's 30% for GM and 25% for Ford. GM and Stellantis import more than half of their high-profit pickup trucks from the two countries, according to Bernstein. If Trump does impose the tariffs in January, the auto industry would have little time to adjust, putting operating profits at risk for the automakers, Roeska said in an email. 'A 25% tariff on Mexico and Canada would severely cripple the U.S. auto industry,' he said. The tariffs would hurt U.S. industrial production so much that 'we expect this is unlikely to happen in practice,' Roeska said. The tariff threat hit the stocks of some companies that could be particularly hurt, such as auto manufacturers and Constellation Brands, which sells Modelo and other Mexican beer brands in the United States. But the overall market held relatively steady near records as investors saw Trump’s proposal as more of an opening position for negotiations rather than as a definitive policy. It's not clear how long the tariffs would last if they are implemented, but they could force auto executives to move production to the U.S., which could create more jobs in the long run. But Morningstar analyst David Whiston said in the short term automakers probably won't make any moves because they can't quickly change where they build vehicles. To move to the U.S., they would have to buy equipment and revamp their parts supply chain, which can take years. 'I think everyone is going to be in a wait-and-see mode,' Whiston said. Millions of dollars worth of auto parts flow across the borders with Mexico and Canada, and that could raise prices for already costly automobile repairs, Finn said. The Distilled Spirits Council of the U.S. said tariffs on tequila or Canadian whisky won’t boost American jobs because they are distinctive products that can only be made in their country of origin. In 2023, the U.S. imported $4.6 billion worth of tequila and $108 million worth of mezcal from Mexico and $537 million worth of spirits from Canada, the council said. 'At the end of the day, tariffs on spirits products from our neighbors to the north and south are going to hurt U.S. consumers and lead to job losses across the U.S. hospitality industry just as these businesses continue their long recovery from the pandemic,' the council said in a statement. Electronics retailer Best Buy said on its third-quarter earnings conference call that it runs on thin profit margins, so while vendors and the company will shoulder some increases, Best Buy will have to pass tariffs on to customers. 'These are goods that people need, and higher prices are not helpful,' CEO Corie Barry said. Walmart also warned this week that tariffs could force it to raise prices, as did Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who talked with Trump after his call for tariffs, said they had a good conversation about how the countries can work together on the challenges they face. 'This is something that we can do, laying out the facts and moving forward in constructive ways. This is a relationship that we know takes a certain amount of working on and that’s what we’ll do,' Trudeau said. Trump's transition team wouldn't comment on the call. Also Monday, Trump turned his ire to China, saying he has 'had many talks with China about the massive amounts of drugs, in particular Fentanyl, being sent into the United States – But to no avail.' The Chinese Embassy in Washington cautioned on Monday that there will be losers on all sides if there is a trade war. Trump's threats come as arrests for illegally crossing the border from Mexico have been falling. The most recent U.S. numbers for October show arrests remain near four-year lows. But arrests for illegally crossing the border from Canada have been rising over the past two years. Much of America’s fentanyl is smuggled from Mexico. Border seizures of the drug rose sharply under President Joe Biden. The tariffs would also throw into doubt the reliability of the 2020 trade deal brokered in large part by Trump with Canada and Mexico, the USMCA, which replaced NAFTA and is up for review in 2026. Trump transition team officials did not immediately respond to questions about what authority he would use, what he would need to see to prevent the tariffs from being implemented and how they would impact prices in the U.S. Mexico’s Foreign Relations Department and Economy Department also had no immediate reaction to Trump’s statements. ___ Rugaber reported from Washington.

A fugitive wanted in the US for a pair of bombings is arrested in the UK after 20 years on the run	LONDON (AP) — A suspected animal rights extremist wanted in the U.S. for bombings in the San Francisco area was arrested in Britain after more than 20 years on the run from the law, officials said Tuesday. Daniel Andreas San Diego, one of the FBI’s most wanted fugitives, was arrested Monday in a rural area in northern Wales, the National Crime Agency said. He was ordered held in custody after appearing Tuesday in Westminster Magistrates’ Court and faces extradition. San Diego, 46, is charged in the U.S. with planting two bombs that exploded about an hour apart in the early morning of Aug. 28, 2003, on the campus of a biotechnology company in Emeryville, California. He’s also accused of setting off another bomb with nails strapped to it at a nutritional products company in Pleasanton, California, a month later. The bombings didn't injure anyone, but authorities said the bomb at the biotechnology company was intended to harm first responders. A group called Revolutionary Cells-Animal Liberation Brigade claimed responsibility for the bombings, citing the companies’ ties to Huntingdon Life Sciences. Huntingdon was a target of animal rights extremists because of its work with experimental drugs and chemicals on animals while under contract for pharmaceutical, cosmetic and other companies. 'Daniel San Diego’s arrest after more than 20 years as a fugitive for two bombings in the San Francisco area shows that no matter how long it takes, the FBI will find you and hold you accountable,' FBI Director Christopher Wray said in a statement. 'There’s a right way and a wrong way to express your views in our country, and turning to violence and destruction of property is not the right way.' In 2009, San Diego became the first person suspected of domestic terrorism to be added to the FBI’s Most Wanted Terrorist List. A reward of $250,000 (200,000 pounds) was offered for information leading to his arrest. Photos of him appeared on billboards from California to New York, including Times Square, the FBI said. He was featured on the TV program 'America’s Most Wanted' several times. San Diego grew up in an upper-middle class suburb of Marin County north of San Francisco. His father was the city manager of nearby Belvedere, a wealthy enclave. San Diego had worked as a computer network specialist, was a skilled sailor and was known to carry a handgun, the FBI said. The FBI had San Diego under surveillance on Oct. 6, 2003 when he parked his car near downtown San Francisco, and vanished into a transit station — not to be seen again. There had been numerous sightings reported around the world and investigators announced searches at times as far apart as Massachusetts and Hawaii. The NCA said it arrested San Diego at a property near woods in the Conwy area of Wales, a coastal area some 5,000 miles (8,000 kilometers) from San Francisco. No other details were provided.	https://apnews.com/article/us-terrorism-fugitive-caught-wales-70a2543ea03ed245394226795bffd563	2024-11-26T10:18:39-08:00	
Chilean authorities confirm sexual harassment investigation against President Gabriel Boric	SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) — Chilean President Gabriel Boric is under investigation for sexual harassment, authorities confirmed Tuesday after his personal lawyer sought to portray the head of state as a victim of online stalking. The country’s attorney general, Cristián Crisosto, in a statement said prosecutors have opened 'a criminal case related to' allegations filed by an unidentified woman in September. The complaint alleges sexual harassment as well as the leaking of private images. Crisosto did not provide details of the alleged events, or say when or where they took place. Boric, 38, has denied the accusations through his attorney, Jonatan Valenzuela, who in a statement described the president as 'the victim of systematic harassment via email.' The alleged harassment occurred between July 2013 and July 2014, when Boric was an intern in the southern Chilean city of Punta Arenas, near the Patagonia, and was already a well-known figure in national politics thanks to his role in student-led protests a couple of years earlier. Valenzuela said Boric 'never had an emotional or friendly relationship' with the woman and both have not been in communication since July 2014 when she is alleged to have sent the last of dozens of emails, some with explicit images, to the now president. Valenzuela said his team handed authorities all communications between Boric and the woman after learning of her complaint, to 'clarify the status of the president as a victim.'	https://apnews.com/article/chile-president-boric-investigation-sexual-harassment-0ff38114ede08cf110cdbd9ce91c6b82	2024-11-26T10:16:38-08:00	
Carrefour apologizes to Brazil for CEO's remarks, and beef is headed back to its stores	BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) — Brazilian beef was headed back to the shelves of Carrefour-owned grocery stores Tuesday after a brief boycott sparked by remarks from the French company’s chief executive about nations in the South America trade bloc Mercosur. Carrefour CEO Alexandre Bompard apologized to Brazil's Ministry of Agriculture for social media posts in which he said that Mercosur nations had an unfair competitive advantage due to lower environmental and sanitary standards. Bompard was seeking to show support for French farmers angered over a potential trade deal with the bloc, which includes Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay. 'We know that Brazilian agriculture provides high-quality meat, complies with regulations and offers great flavor. If Carrefour France’s communication caused confusion and may have been interpreted as questioning our partnership with Brazilian agriculture or as a criticism of it, we apologize,' Bompard wrote. The Brazilian ministry published his letter on its website Tuesday, along with a statement asserting that the country's agricultural practices are 'of exceptional quality and fully compliant with one of the world’s most stringent environmental legislations.' Atacadao, a Brazilian food warehouse giant owned by Carrefour, said in a statement that it expected beef product restocking to 'normalize' in coming days. Beef giants JBS and Marfrig were among the suppliers that had boycotted the French company. Since last week, French farmers have protested against negotiations for an EU-Mercosur trade deal that would increase agricultural imports to EU countries from South America. French farmers fear it will affect their livelihoods. An initial agreement was reached in 2019, but negotiations have faltered since then due to opposition that also includes some European governments. Brazil’s agribusiness sector also fears that the pending European Union Deforestation Regulation will outlaw the sale of forest-derived products within the EU’s 27-nation bloc if companies can’t prove their goods are not linked to deforestation. Its scope includes soy and cattle, Brazil’s top agricultural exports. Almost half of the country’s cattle is raised in the Amazon region, where 90% of deforested land since 1985 has turned into pasture, according to MapBiomas, a nonprofit network. The date of its implementation remains uncertain. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Albanian opposition supporters block the capital’s streets in an anti-government rally	TIRANA, Albania (AP) — Albanian opposition lawmakers and their supporters Tuesday blocked the capital's main streets for hours accusing the government of corruption and demanding it be replaced by a technocratic caretaker Cabinet until 2025 parliamentary elections. Hundreds of opposition supporters blocked traffic at Tirana’s main intersections accusing the Socialist Party of Prime Minister Edi Rama of corruption, manipulating earlier elections and usurping the powers of the judiciary. Led by lawmakers, opposition supporters — some coming from other cities — were involved in sporadic clashes with anti-riot police trying to clear the streets. Others sat down in the street or tried to push police officers away. 'Rama go away,' was a call repeated by protesters in many places. Hundreds of police officers were deployed to protect government buildings and keep streets clear for traffic and preserve order. They used water guns mounted on trucks to keep protesters away from City Hall and Wilson Square, and tear gas in at least in one case. The conservative Democratic Party and its supporters in an opposition coalition also have been holding protests over the arrests of their leader Sali Berisha and former President Ilir Meta in separate corruption cases, saying the charges are politically motivated. 'The Albanians’ revolt and civil disobedience cannot be stopped,' said the Democrats’ Secretary-General Flamur Noka, the most senior leader while Berisha is under house arrest. Noka stopped talking to journalists out of respect for a prayer heard from the new Muslim mosque nearby. Albania's 2.4 million population is more than half Muslim. They live peacefully alongside Catholic and Orthodox Christians and other smaller religious communities. Albania holds parliamentary elections next spring, which Rama’s Socialists are poised to win, according to polls, partly because the opposition is divided. The United States and the European Union have urged the opposition to resume dialogue with the government, saying violence won’t help the country integrate into the 27-nation European Union. In October, Tirana started discussions with the bloc on how the country aligns with EU stances on the rule of law, the functioning of democratic institutions and the fight against corruption. Albania aims to join the bloc by 2030, according to Rama. ___ Follow Llazar Semini at https://x.com/lsemini	https://apnews.com/article/albania-opposition-protest-corruption-election-df722231a2d93151581b6e7f9723a68d	2024-11-26T08:49:53-08:00	
Gunmen in Central African Republic killed 10 people near a diamond mining town	BANGUI, Central African Republic (AP) — Gunmen in Central African Republic killed six motorcycle taxi drivers and four of their clients near the central diamond mining town of Bria, authorities said Tuesday. The motorcycle taxi drivers and their clients were driving back from a religious ceremony in the town of Ippy to Bria, the capital of the central Haute-Kotto prefecture, when they were ambushed by unidentified gunmen, the member of parliament for Bria, Jacques Tafogo, told The Associated Press. 'They were tied up and killed with their clients and their motorcycles set on fire,' Tafogo told the AP over the phone. 'The town is in psychosis and the army is mobilized with the support of Wagner’s Russian mercenaries.' No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack but the mining town of Bria has been plagued by fighting between the country’s armed forces and the Coalition of Patriots for Change, an anti-government militant group, in recent years. Exports of diamonds from the town are forbidden under the 2003 Kimberley Process, which aims to eliminate the trade of 'blood diamonds' fueling conflicts in Africa. Central African Republic has been in conflict since 2013, when predominantly Muslim rebels seized power and forced then-president François Bozizé from office. A 2019 peace deal only lessened the fighting, and six of the 14 armed groups that signed later left the agreement. The Coalition of Patriots for Change was founded in 2020 in the aftermath of the agreement. Central African Republic is also one of the first countries in which Kremlin-backed Wagner mercenaries established their operations on the pledge of fighting back rebel groups and bringing back peace. But instead of stabilizing the country, Wagner forces have been accused of gross human rights violations and defending the brutal military regime of Faustin-Archange Touadéra, in power since March 2016. 'The army is working on a military operation in the area where the tragedy took place with the support of our Russian allies,' the military police commander of Haute Kotto, Robestin Yamandé, told the AP following the attack in Bria.	https://apnews.com/article/central-african-republic-mining-wagner-cpc-42bf3508ecbda1435c9bb4270a53d179	2024-11-26T08:01:45-08:00	
Making 'Queer' required openness. Daniel Craig was ready	NEW YORK (AP) — Daniel Craig is sitting in the restaurant of the Carlyle Hotel talking about how easy it can be to close yourself off to new experiences. 'We get older and maybe out of fear, we want to control the way we are in our lives. And I think it’s sort of the enemy of art,' Craig says. 'You have to push against it. Whether you have success or not is irrelevant, but you have to try to push against it.' Craig, relaxed and unshaven, has the look of someone who has freed himself of a too snug tuxedo. Part of the abiding tension of his tenure as James Bond was this evident wrestling with the constraints that came along with it. Any such strains, though, would seem now to be completely out the window. Since exiting that role, Craig, 56, has seemed eager to push himself in new directions. He performed 'Macbeth' on Broadway. His drawling detective Benoit Blanc ('Halle Berry!') stole the show in 'Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery.' And now, Craig gives arguably his most transformative performance as the William S. Burroughs avatar Lee in Luca Guadagnino’s tender tale of love and longing in postwar Mexico City, 'Queer.' Since the movie’s Venice Film Festival premiere, it’s been one of the fall’s most talked about performances — for its explicit sex scenes, for its vulnerability and for its extremely un-007-ness. 'The role, they say, must have been a challenge or ‘You’re so brave to do this,’' Craig said in a recent interview alongside Guadagnino. 'I kind of go, ‘Eh, not really.’ It’s why I get up in the morning.' In 'Queer,' which A24 release Wednesday in theaters, Craig again plays a well-traveled, sharply dressed, cocktail-drinking man. But the similarities with his most famous role stop there. Lee is an American expat living in 1950s Mexico City where he, in sweaty, rumpled linen suits, cruises for younger men while juggling an increasingly debilitating drug habit. (No matter what you’ve heard, the most truly unexpected sight in 'Queer' is Daniel Craig as an awkward suitor.) Lee, though, is thunderstruck with infatuation for a poised and prim young man named Allerton (Drew Starkey). The film, adapted by 'Challengers' screenwriter Justin Kuritzkes, proceeds as a love story but also as a profound romantic mystery. Allerton is enigmatic and aloof, and it’s unclear how much he’s embraced his homosexuality. Their evolving relationship is a constant confusion to Lee. 'Queer' becomes consumed not just with the question of their unsettled love, but of the tantalizing possibilities of liberation and the painful, long-term sacrifices of repression. The film, classically filmed on soundstages in Rome’s Cinecittà, is populated with expansive windows and doorways that seem to ask: What doors to yourself, or to life, are you willing to walk through? 'Maybe another portal is his open chest. He just goes, ‘Please come in, come in,’' says Craig. 'It applies to art. It applies to everything. Letting one's self go. If you don’t do it, how can you ever know? That tragedy of not doing that is greater than the embarrassment of doing it. We’re defined by those moments in our lives.' ‘I just recognized so many things within him’ 'Queer' could be such a defining moment for Craig. For his performance, he’s widely expected to land his first Oscar nomination. For Guadagnino, making 'Queer' is especially long in coming. He first read the book – written in the early ‘50s but, by Burroughs’ own wishes, not published until 1985 – when he was 17. For years, Guadagnino, the Italian filmmaker of 'Call Me By Your Name' and 'Challengers,' contemplated 'Queer' as a movie; he even once drafted his own script. In Lee, he saw a poetic figure. 'I’m really interested in the repression of others,' Guadagnino says. 'I realize many, many times I go back to the theme. The idea of being so vulnerable and ready to be. He doesn’t have a sense of pride or a protection of social codes.' While they were making 'Challengers,' released earlier this year, Guadagnino approached Kuritzkes about adapting Burroughs’ novel. There were considerable hurdles. Burroughs never completely finished the novel, so the filmmakers resolved to finish it for him, writing into the movie an extended third-act ayahuasca trip. But adapting 'Queer' also meant leaving room for its unspoken spaces. 'There is so much in the movie that is about the way Lee looks at Allerton and the way Allerton looks at him, and looks away,' says Kuritzkes. 'A lot of that stuff is in the book, but when you’re making the movie, you realize the way Daniel’s face registers Drew’s face tells you what would be communicated in 15 pages of prose.' ‘Open to play' Guadagnino, convinced Craig was right for the role, approached the actor with the script. In Craig, Guadagnino saw someone, he says, who was 'open to play.' Within days, Craig, long an admirer of Guadagnino’s films, was in. 'I just recognized so many things within him,' Craig says. 'Someone who is both repressed and open, and the complicated relationship with love.' Though it inverts the presentation of masculinity many associate with Craig, Lee of 'Queer' is more in line with some of the actor’s earlier work, like 1998’s 'Love Is the Devil.' It’s worth noting, too, that Craig's other major post-Bond movie role, Benoit Blanc, is also gay. (Hugh Grant plays his subtly suggested partner.) For 'Queer,' there was extensive preparation, on accent and movement and Burroughs’ own tortured history. But after months of research, the characterization only really emerged once shooting began. 'I can’t tell you how nervous I was. It was terrifying,' Craig says. 'But something clicked that day, the first day. And Luca said, ‘That’s it.’ I was very nervous to try to expose it, but it became a kind of unfolding of the character. I kind of introduced myself to him.' 'I think Daniel loves the camera in a way that is intimate,' adds Guadagnino. 'Because he knows the camera cannot lie and you can’t lie to the camera. The love you feel from the camera, to me, is not the love of vanity. It’s the love of recording the truth.' Starkey, the 31-year-old 'Outer Banks' actor, was met with the very different challenge of playing a character with few words on the page and a cryptic presence. He theorized that Allerton is in retreat because it’s 'as if you’ve lived your whole life and never seen your own reflection, and someone puts a mirror in front of your face.' 'A question I asked early on was: Is Allerton aware of the game that he’s playing? Is he aware that he may have some power over Lee, and does he like it?' says Starkey. 'Luca’s answer to that was: ‘That’s a very good question.’' Sex scenes in ‘Queer’ and the ‘salacious’ response When 'Queer' premiered in Venice, much of the reception focused on the film’s steamy sex scenes with Craig and Starkey. Guadagnino laments the temptation of the press to be 'salacious.' 'They can’t help themselves,’ he says. 'But we are practical people. People make love. People laugh. People sleep. People inject heroin.' 'Our job is only to make that as truthful as possible, and not shy away from it, not be coy about it,' adds Craig. 'And can we just clear the table forever? When we were shooting the sex scenes it was so funny,' says Guadagnino. 'We had fun. It was fun, light and then, done, let’s move on to the next.' As intimately as Craig and Starkey would be working together, they decided to let their relationship unfold naturally. 'We didn’t, like, grab coffee and have a list of ice-breakers or something,' Starkey says. 'We just started working. We jumped into movement rehearsals and that was a great way to learn how to be free with the other person. It never felt like there any walls up.' Not having walls up was, in many ways, the abiding nature of 'Queer.' And for Craig, it was one of the most rewarding experiences of his career. He and Guadagnino are already planning another film together. 'I don’t have any grand plan for my career. It’s been OK ’til now. It’s been going along,' Craig says, with a grin. 'Then something comes along like this and you find a group of people to have this wonderful experience with. It makes me go: I want to keep acting. I never wanted to give up, but if I could get this again, I’d love to do it.'	https://apnews.com/article/daniel-craig-queer-drew-starkey-luca-guadagnino-5667bc773c1883a143fb2b46a887739e	2024-11-26T06:16:34-08:00	
Childhood cancer patients in Lebanon must battle disease while under fire	BEIRUT (AP) — Carol Zeghayer gripped her IV as she hurried down the brightly lit hallway of Beirut’s children’s cancer center. The 9-year-old's face brightened when she spotted her playmates from the oncology ward. Diagnosed with cancer just months before the conflict between Hezbollah and Israel erupted in October 2023, Carol relies on weekly trips to the center in the Lebanese capital for treatment. But what used to be a 90-minute drive, now takes up to three hours on a mountainous road to skirt the heavy bombardment in south Lebanon, but still not without danger from Israeli airstrikes. The family is just one among many across Lebanon now grappling with the hardships of both illness and war. 'She’s just a child. When they strike, she asks me, ‘Mama, was that far?’' said her mother, Sindus Hamra. The family lives in Hasbaya, a province in southeastern Lebanon where the rumble of Israeli airstrikes has become part of daily life. Just 15 minutes away from their home, in the front-line town of Khiam, Israeli troops and Hezbollah fighters clash amidst relentless bombardments. On the morning of a recent trip to Beirut for her treatment, the family heard a rocket roar and its deafening impact as they left their home. Israeli airstrikes have also hit vehicles along the Damascus-Beirut highway, which Carol and her mother have to cross. The bombardment hasn’t let up even as hopes grew in recent days that a ceasefire might soon be agreed. More than war, Hamra fears that Carol will miss chemotherapy. 'Her situation is very tricky — her cancer can spread to her head,' Hamra said, her eyes filling with tears. Her daughter, diagnosed first with cancer of the lymph nodes and later leukemia, has completed a third of her treatment, with many months still ahead. While Carol's family remains in their home, many in Lebanon have been displaced by an intensified Israeli bombardment that began in late September. Tens of thousands fled their homes in southern and eastern Lebanon, as well as Beirut’s southern suburbs — among them were families with children battling cancer. The Children’s Cancer Center of Lebanon quickly identified each patient’s location to ensure treatments remained uninterrupted, sometimes facilitating them at hospitals closer to the families' new locations, said Zeina El Chami, the center’s fundraising and events executive. During the first days of the escalation, the center admitted some patients for emergency care and kept them there as it was unsafe to send them home, said Dolly Noun, a pediatric hematologist and oncologist. 'They had no place to go,' she added. 'We’ve had patients getting admitted for panic attacks. It has not been easy.' The war has not only deepened the struggles of young patients. 'Many physicians have had to relocate,' Noun said. 'I know physicians, who work here, who haven’t seen their parents in like six weeks because the roads are very dangerous.' Since 2019, Lebanon has been battered by cascading crises — economic collapse, the devastating Beirut port explosion in 2020, and now a relentless war — leaving institutions like the cancer center struggling to secure the funds needed to save lives. 'Cancer waits for no one,' Chami said. The crises have affected the center’s ability to hold fundraising events in recent years, leaving it in urgent need of donations, she added. The facility is currently treating more than 400 patients aged from few days to 18 years old, Chami said. It treats around 60% of children with cancer in Lebanon. For Carol, the war is sometimes a topic of conversation with her friends at the cancer center. Her mother hears her recount hearing the booms and how the house shook. For others, the moments with their friends in the center's playroom provide a brief escape from the grim reality outside. Eight-year-old Mohammad Mousawi darts around the playroom, giggling as he hides objects and books for his playmate to find. Too absorbed by the game, he barely answers questions, before the nurse calls him for his weekly chemotherapy treatment. His family lived in Ghobeiry, a neighborhood in Beirut’s southern suburbs. Their house was marked for destruction in an Israeli evacuation warning weeks ago, his mother said. 'But till now, they haven’t struck it,' said his mother, Suzan Mousawi. 'They have hit (buildings) around it — two behind it and two in front of it.' The family has relocated three times. They first moved to the mountains, but the bitter cold weakened Mohammad’s already fragile immune system. Now they’ve settled in Ain el-Rummaneh, not far from their home in the southern Beirut suburbs known as Dahiyeh, which has come under significant bombardment. As the Israeli military widened the radius of its bombardment, some buildings hit were less than 500 meters (yards) from their current home. The Mousawis have lived their entire lives in Dahiyeh, Suzan Mousawi said, until the war uprooted them. Her parents’ home was bombed. 'All our memories are gone,' she said. Mohammad has 15 weeks of treatment left, and his family is praying it will be successful. But the war has stolen some of their dreams. 'When Mohammad fell ill, we bought a house,' she said. 'It wasn’t big, but it was something. I bought him an electric scooter and set up a pool, telling myself we’d take him there once he finishes treatment.' She fears the house, bought with every penny she had saved, could be lost at any moment. For some families, this kind of conflict is not new. Asinat Al Lahham, a 9-year-old patient of the cancer center, is a refugee whose family fled Syria. 'We escaped one war to another,' Asinat’s mother, Fatima, added. As her father, Aouni, drove home from her chemotherapy treatment weeks ago, an airstrike happened. He cranked up the music in the car, trying to drown out the deafening sound of the attack. Asinat sat in the back seat, clutching her favorite toy. 'I wanted to distract her, to make her hear less of it,' he said. In the medical ward on a recent day, Asinat sat in a chair hooked to an IV drip, negotiating with her doctor. 'Just two or three small pinches,' she pleaded, asking for flavoring for her instant noodles that she is not supposed to have. 'I don’t feel safe … nowhere is safe … not Lebanon, not Syria, not Palestine,' Asinat said. 'The sonic booms are scary, but the noodles make it better,' she added with a mischievous grin. The family has no choice but to stay in Lebanon. Returning to Syria, where their home is gone, would mean giving up Asinat’s treatment. 'We can’t leave here,' her mother said. 'This war, her illness … it’s like there’s no escape.'	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-mideast-wars-children-cancer-15734faad510f820b6cf4947a4e9e8a8	2024-11-26T05:59:35-08:00

Presidents have used immigration 'parole' since the 1950s. Now it could disappear under Trump	MIAMI (AP) — Cuba’s at one of its lowest points since the 1959 revolution, with nationwide scarcity fueling massive emigration, occasional protests and government crackdowns. Gangs control the streets of Haiti’s capital, firing on arriving jets and forcing delays in elections to replace slain President Jovenel Moïse. Nicaragua's president has imprisoned protesters, opposition members and Catholic leaders. Severe shortages and one of the world’s highest inflation rates have helped drive nearly 8 million Venezuelans from the petrostate of 28 million people. Half a million Cubans, Haitian, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans were welcomed by President Joe Biden using a legal tool known as humanitarian parole, granted for seven decades by Republican and Democratic administrations to people unable to use standard immigration routes because of time pressure or their government's poor relations with the U.S. President-elect Donald Trump appears certain to dismantle this legal tool, saying during his campaign that he would end the 'outrageous abuse of parole.' Trump made anti-immigration rhetoric a key part of his campaign, warning that he would kick out hundreds of thousands of migrants who entered the country under Biden programs. 'Get ready to leave because you’re going to be going out real fast,' Trump said. A giant group of people with tenuous legal status formed under Biden and many now expect their protections to vanish with a stroke of a pen. Those protections include Biden's parole efforts; his support for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program; parole for people who entered the country on a border appointment app called CBP One and his expanded use of a law to shield people from deportation — known as Temporary Protected Status. What's the purpose of parole? The U.S. has a thicket of complicated immigration laws that drive many to enter the country illegally but parole allows the president to admit people 'for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit.' Since 1952 it has been ordered 126 times by every president, except for Trump, according to the pro-immigration Cato Institute. The Trump administration could revoke parole for everyone who has it, said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior fellow at the American Immigration Council. Going back is not an option 'All immigrants are fearful,' said Manuel Castaño, a 39-year-old human rights activist from Nicaragua whose parole expires in March 2025 and has requested asylum, a process that can take years. Castaño, who works in building maintenance in South Florida, applied for parole in February 2023 after his uncle sponsored him, a requirement under the law. Less than a month later, he arrived at Miami with his wife and their 13-year-old daughter. He said he was threatened in his country and feared for his and his family in their homeland. 'Going back to Nicaragua is not an option,' he said. A focus on Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans More than a million people have been granted parole under Biden, including tens of thousands of Afghans and Ukrainians. Biden introduced parole for Venezuelans in October 2022 and expanded it in early 2023 to include Cubans, Haitians, and Nicaraguans. These countries refuse to take back most citizens deported from the U.S. Under an aspect of parole known as CHNV, up to 30,000 people from the four countries are accepted monthly. They can obtain work authorization for two years and apply online. The goal of the tool is dissuading migrants from crossing the border illegally. According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, more than 110,240 Cubans, 211,010 Haitians, 93,070 Nicaraguans, and 117,310 Venezuelans were granted parole through the end of October. The team reshaping the policies under Trump is expected to include former acting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement director Tom Homan, as 'border czar;' immigration hardliner Stephen Miller as deputy chief of staff for policy; and South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem as head of the Department of Homeland Security. All have been outspoken opponents of Biden's immigration policies. Kyle Varner, a 39-year-old doctor and real-estate investor from Spokane, Washington, says he has spent $150,000 on plane tickets, housing and other costs for 47 Venezuelans he's sponsored over the last two years. Now he is desperately saving as much money as possible to pay immigration attorneys that could figure out a way for the Venezuelans to stay after Trump takes office. 'I am very alarmed,' Varner said. Legal challenges are certain Mass termination of migrants' two-year parole terms would be subject to legal challenge but the Trump administration could simply halt new admissions and just wait until beneficiaries’ status expired, Reichlin-Melnick said. Another possibility, said Charles Kuck, a former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, is that the Trump administration could find a relatively easy way to deport people granted parole because there are official records of them and their sponsors. 'Those are the easiest people to be in rounding up because the government knows where they live,' said Kuck. Leaving the U.S. before you're expelled That is why Venezuelan Ireswa Lopez is already thinking of leaving the U.S. when her parole expires in March 2025. Lopez, 48, was having a hard time working at a family butcher shop in Venezuela, where food is scarce and water often contaminated. She learned that there was a program to come to the United States legally, and with a cousin's sponsorship she flew to Miami in January 2023. Although she has found a job at an Atlanta children's day care, she says, 'I am leaving.' 'Staying illegally is not in my plans,' she said.	https://apnews.com/article/immigration-humanitarian-parole-chnv-trump-biden-deportation-bdb62fd4883252b81b4cb3122dc57301	2024-11-26T05:47:04-08:00	
Mexico suggests it would impose its own tariffs to retaliate against any Trump tariffs	MEXICO CITY (AP) — President Claudia Sheinbaum suggested Tuesday that Mexico could retaliate with tariffs of its own, after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump threatened to impose 25% import duties on Mexican goods if the country doesn’t stop the flow of drugs and migrants across the border. Sheinbaum said she was willing to engage in talks on the issues, but said drugs were a U.S. problem. 'One tariff would be followed by another in response, and so on until we put at risk common businesses,' Sheinbaum said, referring to U.S. automakers that have plants on both sides of the border. She said Tuesday that Mexico had done a lot to stem the flow of migrants, noting 'caravans of migrants no longer reach the border.' However, Mexico's efforts to fight drugs like the deadly synthetic opioid fentanyl — which is manufactured by Mexican cartels using chemicals imported from China — have weakened in the last year. Sheinbaum said Mexico suffered from an influx of weapons smuggled in from the United States, and said the flow of drugs 'is a problem of public health and consumption in your country’s society.' Sheinbaum also criticized U.S. spending on weapons, saying the money should instead be spent regionally to address the problem of migration. 'If a percentage of what the United States spends on war were dedicated to peace and development, that would address the underlying causes of migration,' she said. Sheinbaum’s bristly response suggests that Trump faces a much different Mexican president than he did in his first term. Back in late 2018, former President Andrés Manuel López Obrador was a charismatic, old-school politician who developed a chummy relationship with Trump. The two were eventually able to strike a bargain in which Mexico helped keep migrants away from the border — and received other countries’ deported migrants — and Trump backed down on the threats. But Sheinbaum, who took office Oct. 1, is a stern leftist ideologue trained in radical student protest movements, and appears less willing to pacify or mollify Trump. 'We negotiate as equals, there is no subordination here, because we are a great nation,' Sheinbaum said, while adding, 'I think we are going to reach an agreement.' But Gabriela Siller, director of economic analysis of the financial group Banco Base, fears the personality clash could escalate things into brinkmanship; Trump clearly hates to lose. 'Trump may have just tossed the threat out there, as he does,' Siller said. 'But Mexico's response, that we're going to respond to you with tariffs, that will make Trump really impose them.' It's not clear how serious Trump’s threat is. The U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement forbids just imposing tariffs on other member countries. And it’s not clear whether the economy could even tolerate sudden levies on imports: Auto plants on both sides of the border rely on each other for parts and components, and some production lines could screech to a halt. 'It is unacceptable and would cause inflation and job losses in Mexico and the United States,' Sheinbaum said, while offering to talk about the issues. 'If tariffs go up, who will it hurt? General Motors,' she said. 'Dialogue is the best path to achieve understanding, peace and prosperity for our two countries,' Sheinbaum said. 'I hope our teams can meet soon.' Late Monday, Trump said he would impose a 25% tax on all products entering the country from Canada and Mexico, and an additional 10% tariff on goods from China, as one of his first executive orders. The tariffs, if implemented, could dramatically raise prices for American consumers on everything from gas to automobiles to agricultural products. The U.S. is the largest importer of goods in the world, with Mexico, China and Canada its top three suppliers, according to the most recent U.S. Census data. Trump made the threats Monday in a pair of posts on his Truth Social site in which he railed against an influx of illegal migrants, even though apprehensions at the southern border have been hovering near four-year lows. 'On January 20th, as one of my many first Executive Orders, I will sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% Tariff on ALL products coming into the United States, and its ridiculous Open Borders,' he wrote. He said the new tariffs would remain in place 'until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country!' 'Both Mexico and Canada have the absolute right and power to easily solve this long simmering problem. We hereby demand that they use this power,' he went on, 'and until such time that they do, it is time for them to pay a very big price!'	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-tariffs-trump-retaliate-sheinbaum-fac0b0c6ee8c425a928418de7332b74a	2024-11-26T05:23:04-08:00	
Russia expels British diplomat after accusing him of spying	MOSCOW (AP) — Russian authorities on Tuesday ordered a British diplomat to leave the country on allegations of spying that the U.K. dismissed as 'baseless' as tensions soar over the conflict in Ukraine. Russia's Federal Security Service, the top domestic security and counterintelligence agency, said in a statement carried by Russian news agencies that the diplomat had provided false personal data while seeking permission to enter the country. The agency, known by its Russian acronym FSB, alleged that he has worked for British intelligence under diplomatic cover, replacing one of the six British diplomats who were expelled from Russia in August. The FSB alleged that the diplomat was involved in 'intelligence and subversive activities that threatened the security of the Russian Federation.' Russia's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said a decision was made to revoke the diplomat's accreditation and he has been ordered to leave the country within two weeks. She said the ministry has summoned the British ambassador to hand over the notice. A spokesperson for the U.K. Foreign Office responded to the Russian statements: 'This is not the first time that Russia has made malicious and baseless accusations against our staff. We will respond in due course.' Russia announced the expulsion of the six British diplomats in September, weeks after it happened. Moscow accused them of spying, allegations rejected by the U.K. as 'completely baseless.' Russia and NATO allies have carried out multiple rounds of mutual expulsions of diplomats as relations have sunk to the lowest levels since the Cold War after the Kremlin sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-uk-diplomat-expulsion-wilkes-fsb-moscow-504c11044664d7dc5dce716f12ef8893	2024-11-26T03:58:16-08:00	
Netanyahu says he supports proposed ceasefire with Lebanon's Hezbollah	JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday recommended his Cabinet approve a United States-brokered ceasefire agreement with Lebanon's Hezbollah, setting the stage for an end to nearly 14 months of fighting linked to the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip. Israel stepped up its bombardment of Lebanon in the hours leading up to the Cabinet meeting, killing at least 23 people, according to local authorities. The military also issued a flurry of evacuation warnings — a sign it aims to keep pummeling Hezbollah in the final hours before any ceasefire takes hold. In a televised statement, Netanyahu said he would present the ceasefire proposal to Cabinet ministers later Tuesday, when they are expected to vote on it. He listed a series of accomplishments against Israel’s enemies across the region in recent months. He said a ceasefire with Hezbollah would further isolate Hamas in Gaza and would allow Israel to turn its focus to Iran — Hezbollah's backer and Israel's biggest threat in the region. He vowed to strike Hezbollah hard if it violates the agreement. 'If Hezbollah breaks the agreement and tries to rearm, we will attack,' he said. 'For every violation, we will attack with might.' It was not immediately clear when the ceasefire would go into effect, and the exact terms of the deal were not released. The deal does not affect Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza, which shows no signs of ending. Lebanese officials have said Hezbollah also supports the deal. If approved by all sides, the deal would be a major step toward ending the Israel-Hezbollah war that has inflamed tensions across the region and raised fears of an even wider conflict between Israel and Hezbollah's patron, Iran. The deal calls for a two-month initial halt in fighting and would require Hezbollah to end its armed presence in a broad swath of southern Lebanon, while Israeli troops would return to their side of the border. Thousands of Lebanese troopsand U.N. peacekeepers would deploy in the south, and an international panel headed by the United States would monitor all sides’ compliance. But implementation remains a major question mark. Israel has demanded the right to act should Hezbollah violate its obligations. Lebanese officials have rejected writing that into the proposal. Israel's Defense Minister Israel Katz insisted on Tuesday that the military would strike Hezbollah if the U.N. peacekeeping force, known as UNIFIL, doesn’t provide 'effective enforcement' of the deal. Bombardment of Beirut's southern suburbs continues Even as Israeli, U.S, Lebanese and international officials have expressed growing optimism over a ceasefire, Israel has continued its campaign in Lebanon, which it says aims to cripple Hezbollah’s military capabilities. An Israeli strike on Tuesday leveled a residential building in the central Beirut district of Basta — the second time in recent days warplanes have hit the crowded area near the city’s downtown. At least seven people were killed and 37 wounded, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry. Three people were killed in a separate strike in Beirut and three in a strike on a Palestinian refugee camp in southern Lebanon. Lebanese state media said another 10 people were killed in the eastern Baalbek province. Israel says it targets Hezbollah fighters and their infrastructure. The evacuation warnings covered many areas, including parts of Beirut that previously have not been targeted. The warnings, coupled with fear that Israel was ratcheting up attacks before a ceasefire, sent residents fleeing. Traffic was gridlocked, and some cars had mattresses tied to them. Dozens of people, some wearing their pajamas, gathered in a central square, huddling under blankets or standing around fires as Israeli drones buzzed loudly overhead. Hezbollah, meanwhile, kept up its rocket fire, triggering air raid sirens across northern Israel. Israeli military spokesman Avichay Adraee issued evacuation warnings for 20 buildings in Beirut's southern suburbs, where Hezbollah has a major presence, as well as a warning for the southern town of Naqoura where UNIFIL is headquartered. UNIFIL spokesperson Andrea Tenenti told The Associated Press that peacekeepers will not evacuate. Other strikes hit in the southern city of Tyre, where the Israeli military said it killed a local Hezbollah commander. The Israeli military also said its ground troops clashed with Hezbollah forces and destroyed rocket launchers in the Slouqi area on the eastern end of the Litani River, a few kilometers (miles) from the Israeli border. Previous ceasefire hopes were dashed Under the ceasefire deal, Hezbollah would be required to move its forces north of the Litani, which in some places is about 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of the border. A ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, the strongest Iranian-backed force in the region, would likely significantly calm regional tensions that have led to fears of a direct, all-out war between Israel and Iran. It’s not clear how the ceasefire will affect the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. Hezbollah had long insisted that it would not agree to a ceasefire until the war in Gaza ends, but it dropped that condition. Hezbollah began firing into northern Israel, saying it was showing support for the Palestinians, a day after Hamas carried out its Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel, triggering the Gaza war. Israel returned fire on Hezbollah, and the two sides have been exchanging barrages ever since. Israel escalated its campaign of bombardment in mid-September and later sent troops into Lebanon, vowing to put an end to Hezbollah fire so tens of thousands of evacuated Israelis could return to their homes. More than 3,760 people have been killed by Israeli fire in Lebanon the past 13 months, many of them civilians, according to Lebanese health officials. The bombardment has driven 1.2 million people from their homes. Israel says it has killed more than 2,000 Hezbollah members. Hezbollah fire has forced some 50,000 Israelis to evacuate in the country’s north, and its rockets have reached as far south in Israel as Tel Aviv. At least 75 people have been killed, more than half of them civilians. More than 50 Israeli soldiers have died in the ground offensive in Lebanon. After previous hopes for a ceasefire were dashed, U.S. officials cautioned that negotiations were not yet complete and noted there could be last-minute hitches that delay or destroy an agreement. 'Nothing is done until everything is done,' White House national security spokesman John Kirby said. While the ceasefire proposal is expected to be approved if Netanyahu brings it to a vote in his security Cabinet, one hard-line member, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, said he would oppose it. He said on X that a deal with Lebanon would be a 'big mistake' and a 'missed historic opportunity to eradicate Hezbollah.' ___ Chehayeb and Mroue reported from Beirut.

Biden administration to loan $6.6B to EV maker Rivian to build Georgia factory that automaker paused	ATLANTA (AP) — President Joe Biden's administration announced Tuesday that the U.S. Department of Energy will make a $6.6 billion loan to Rivian Automotive to build a factory in Georgia that had stalled as the startup electric vehicle maker struggled to become profitable. It's unclear whether the administration can complete the loan before Donald Trump becomes president again in less than two months, or whether the Trump administration might try to claw the money back. Trump previously vowed to end federal electric vehicle tax credits, which are worth up to $7,500 for new zero-emission vehicles and $4,000 for used ones. Rivian made a splash when it went public and began producing large electric R1 SUVs, pickup trucks and delivery vans at a former Mitsubishi factory in Normal, Illinois, in 2021. Months later, the California-based company announced it would build a second, larger, $5 billion plant about 40 miles (64 kilometers) east of Atlanta, near the town of Social Circle. The R1 vehicles cost $70,000 or more. The company plans to produce R2 vehicles, a smaller SUV, in Georgia with lower price tags aimed at a mass market. The first phase of Rivian’s Georgia factory is projected to make 200,000 vehicles a year, with a second phase capable of another 200,000 a year. Eventually, the plant is projected to employ 7,500 workers. But Rivian was unable to meet production and sales targets and rapidly burned through cash. In March, the company said it would pause construction of the Georgia plant. The company said it would begin assembling its R2 SUV in Illinois instead. CEO RJ Scaringe said the move would allow Rivian to start selling the R2 sooner and save $2.25 billion in capital spending. Since then, German automaker Volkswagen AG said in June it would invest $5 billion in Rivian in a joint venture in which Rivian would share software and electrical technology with Volkswagen. The money eased Rivian's cash crunch. Tuesday's announcement throws a lifeline to Rivian's grander plans. The company said its plans to make the R2 and the smaller R3 in Georgia are back on and that production will begin in 2028. 'This loan would enable Rivian to more aggressively scale our U.S. manufacturing footprint for our competitively priced R2 and R3 vehicles that emphasize both capability and affordability,' Scaringe said in a statement. The Department of Energy said the loan would substantially boost electric vehicles made in the United States and support the Biden administration’s goal of having zero-emission vehicles make up half of all new U.S. sales by 2030. 'As one of a few American EV startups with light duty vehicles already on the road, Rivian’s Georgia facility will allow the company to reach production volumes that make its products more cost competitive and accelerate access to international markets,' the department said in a statement. The loan includes $6 billion, plus $600 million in interest that will be rolled into the principal. The money would come from the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, which provides low-interest loans to make fuel-efficient vehicles and components. The program has focused mostly on loans to new battery factories for electric vehicles under Biden but earlier helped finance initial production of the Tesla Model S and Nissan Leaf, two pioneering electric vehicles. The program, created in 2007, requires a 'reasonable prospect of repayment' of the loan. Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff, who has been a vocal supporter of electric vehicle and solar manufacturing in Georgia, hailed Tuesday's announcement as 'yet another historic federal investment in Georgia electric vehicle manufacturing.' Ossoff had asked Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm to support the loan in July. 'Our federal manufacturing incentives are driving economic development across the state of Georgia,' Ossoff said in a statement. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp says his goal is to make Georgia a center of the electric vehicle industry. But the Republican has had a strained relationship with the Biden administration over its industrial policy, even as some studies have found Georgia has netted more electric vehicle investment than any other state. Kemp has long claimed that manufacturers were picking Georgia before Biden's signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act, was passed. Efforts to bring Rivian to Georgia predated the Biden administration and 'our shared vision to bring opportunity to Georgia will remain no matter who resides in the White House or what party controls Congress,' Kemp spokesperson Garrison Douglas said Tuesday. The loan to Rivian could rescue one of the Kemp administration's signature economic development projects even as Biden leaves office. That could put Rivian and Kemp in the position of defending the loan if Trump tries to quash it. State and local governments offered Rivian an incentive package worth an estimated $1.5 billion in 2022. Neighbors opposed to development of the Georgia site mounted legal challenges. State and local governments spent around $125 million to buy and prepare the nearly 2,000-acre (810-hectare) site. The state also has completed most of $50 million in roadwork that it pledged. The pause at Rivian contrasts with rapid construction at Hyundai Motor Group’s $7.6 billion electric vehicle and battery complex near Savannah.

Interpol clamps down on cybercrime and arrests over 1,000 suspects in Africa	DAKAR, Senegal (AP) — Interpol arrested 1,006 suspects in Africa during a massive two-month operation, clamping down on cybercrime that left tens of thousands of victims, including some who were trafficked, and produced millions in financial damages, the global police organization said Tuesday. Operation Serengeti, a joint operation with Afripol, the African Union's police agency, ran from Sept. 2 to Oct. 31 in 19 African countries and targeted criminals behind ransomware, business email compromise, digital extortion and online scams, the agency said in a statement. 'From multi-level marketing scams to credit card fraud on an industrial scale, the increasing volume and sophistication of cybercrime attacks is of serious concern,' said Valdecy Urquiza, the Secretary General of Interpol. Interpol pinpointed 35,000 victims, with cases linked to nearly $193 million in financial losses worldwide, stating that local police authorities and private sector partners, including internet service providers, played a key role in the operation. Jalel Chelba, Afripol’s Executive Director, said in the statement: 'Through Serengeti, Afripol has significantly enhanced support for law enforcement in African Union Member States,' Serengeti’s results were a 'drastic increase' compared to operations in Africa in previous years, Enrique Hernandez Gonzalez, Interpol’s Assistant Director of Cybercrime Operations, told The Associated Press. Interpol’s previous cybercrime operations in Africa had only led to 25 arrests in the last two years. 'Significant progress has been made, with participating countries enhancing their ability to work with intelligence and produce meaningful results,' Gonzalez said. In Kenya, the police made nearly two dozen arrests in an online credit card fraud case linked to losses of $8.6 million. In the West African country of Senegal, officers arrested eight people, including five Chinese nationals, for a $6 million online Ponzi scheme. Chelba said Afripol’s focus now includes emerging threats like Artificial Intelligence-driven malware and advanced cyberattack techniques. Other dismantled networks included a group in Cameroon suspected of using a multi-level marketing scam for human trafficking, an international criminal group in Angola running an illegal virtual casino and a cryptocurrency investment scam in Nigeria, the agency said. Interpol, which has 196 member countries and celebrated its centennial last year, works to help national police forces communicate with each other and track suspects and criminals in fields like counterterrorism, financial crime, child pornography, cybercrime and organized crime. The world’s biggest — if not best-funded — police organization has been grappling with new challenges including a growing caseload of cybercrime and child sex abuse, and increasing divisions among its member countries. Interpol had a total budget of about 176 million euros (about $188 million) last year, compared to more than 200 million euros at the European Union’s police agency, Europol, and some $11 billion at the FBI in the United States.	https://apnews.com/article/interpol-cybercrime-africa-afripol-fraud-serengeti-trafficking-208111329edd3a1a64faf85cc7c0d2c0	2024-11-26T03:02:32-08:00	
Russian journalist convicted of cooperating with a foreign organization and jailed for 4 years	A journalist who once worked as a freelance reporter for the U.S. government-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty was convicted Tuesday by a court in far eastern Russia of cooperating with a foreign organization and sentenced to four years in prison. Nika Novak, 24, was found guilty after a closed trial in the Zabaikalsky Regional Court in the city of Chita of cooperating with a representative of a foreign media outlet and being paid to prepare 'false materials' to discredit the Russian military and government agencies. The court said Novak’s actions were aimed at damaging and destabilizing Russia. The human rights organization Memorial has described Novak as a political prisoner. It’s not clear why Novak was arrested, but she previously did freelance work for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, according to Siberia.Realities, which is part of RFE/RL. She also was the editor-in-chief of Zab.ru, a news site in Chita, a city in eastern Russia that is closer to Japan than Moscow. Novak was arrested in Moscow in December 2023 and sent more than 6,000 kilometers (3,728 miles) east to Chita for her trial. Russia has used foreign agent laws to crack down on freedom of speech and independent media, including RFE/RL. RFE/RL was told by Russian authorities in 2017 to register as a foreign agent, but it has challenged Moscow’s use of foreign agent laws in the European Court of Human Rights. The organization has been fined millions of dollars by Russi and was outlawed in the country in February. Alsu Kurmasheva, a Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty journalist with U.S citizenship was convicted in July of spreading false information about the Russian military and was later released as part of a prisoner swap deal with the West. According to OVD-Info, one of Russia’s leading rights groups that tracks political arrests, more than 1,000 people have been charged in criminal cases related to speaking or acting out against the war in Ukraine. But Memorial noted that Novak previously appeared to have made comments on her social media pages that supported the war. In a post published on her behalf Tuesday on the social media platform Telegram, Novak described being taken to Chita from Moscow’s notorious Lefortovo Prison on a flight that lasted about seven hours. She also said she is not allowed to contact her mother, who is listed as a witness in the case, and suggested her meetings and conversations were wiretapped. 'I feel some pressure, but I try not to lose heart,' she wrote in the post.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-journalist-crackdown-novak-chita-51df15c9594fb9d8ba2e0476a49df8ec	2024-11-26T02:26:33-08:00	
Middle East latest: Israel's Netanyahu announces support for a cease-fire with Hezbollah	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday that he would recommend his Cabinet adopt a United States-brokered ceasefire agreement with Lebanon’s Hezbollah, as Israeli warplanes struck across Lebanon, killing at least 23 people. The Israeli airstrikes and evacuation warnings were in a sign that Netanyahu aims to inflict punishment on Hezbollah in the final moments before any ceasefire takes hold. Hezbollah, meanwhile, had resumed its rocket fire into Israel, triggering air raid sirens across the country's north. More than 3,760 people have been killed by Israeli fire in Lebanon the past 13 months, many of them civilians, according to Lebanese health officials. The bombardment has driven 1.2 million people from their homes. Hezbollah began attacking Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, a day after Hamas’ attack on southern Israel, in support of the Palestinian militant group. That has set off more than a year of fighting escalated into all-out war in September with massive Israeli airstrikes across Lebanon and an Israeli ground invasion of the country’s south. Hezbollah has fired thousands of rockets into Israeli military bases, cities and towns, including some 250 projectiles on Sunday. It’s not clear how the ceasefire will affect the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, where more than 44,000 people have been killed and more than 104,000 wounded in the 13-month war between Israel and Hamas, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. ——— Here's the Latest: Netanyahu recommends his Cabinet approve a Hezbollah cease-fire proposal JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday that he would recommend his Cabinet adopt a United States-brokered ceasefire agreement with Lebanon’s Hezbollah, as Israeli warplanes struck across Lebanon, killing at least 23 people. The Israeli military also issued a flurry of evacuation warnings — a sign it was aiming to inflict punishment on Hezbollah down to the final moments before any ceasefire takes hold. For the first time in the conflict, Israeli ground troops reached parts of Lebanon’s Litani River, a focal point of the emerging deal. In a televised statement, Netanyahu said he would present the ceasefire to Cabinet ministers later on Tuesday, setting the stage for an end to nearly 14 months of fighting. Netanyahu said the vote was expected later Tuesday. It was not immediately clear when the ceasefire would go into effect, and the exact terms of the deal were not released. The deal does not affect Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza, which shows no signs of ending. Israeli strikes in Lebanon’s south and east kill at least 13 people BEIRUT — Lebanon’s state media said Israeli strikes on Tuesday killed at least 10 people in Baalbek province the country’s east. At least three people were killed in the southern city of Tyre when Israel bombed a Palestinian refugee camp, said Mohammed Bikai, a representative of the Fatah group in the area. He said several more people were missing and at least three children were among the wounded. He said the sites struck inside the camp were 'completely civilian places' and included a kitchen that was being used to cook food for displaced people. Israelis protest for a Gaza hostage release deal JERUSALEM — Dozens of Israeli protesters took to a major highway in Tel Aviv on Tuesday evening to call for the return of the hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, as the country awaited news of a potential ceasefire in Lebanon between Israel and Hezbollah. Protesters chanted 'We are all hostages,' and 'Deal now!' waving signs with faces of some of the roughly 100 hostages believed to be still held in Gaza, at least a third of whom are thought to be dead. Most of the other hostages Hamas captured in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack were released during a ceasefire last year. The prospect of a ceasefire deal in Lebanon has raised desperation among the relatives of captives still held in Gaza, who once hoped that the release of hostages from Gaza would be included. Instead of a comprehensive deal, the ceasefire on the table is instead narrowly confined to Lebanon. Dozens of Israelis were also demonstrating against the expected cease-fire, gathering outside Israel’s military headquarters in central Tel Aviv. One of the protesters, Yair Ansbacher, says the deal is merely a return to the failed 2006 U.N. resolution that was meant to uproot Hezbollah from the area. 'Of course that didn’t happen,' he says. 'This agreement is not worth the paper it is written on.' G7 leaders endorse Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire and insist Israel follow international law FIUGGI, Italy — Foreign ministers from the world’s industrialized countries said Tuesday they strongly supported an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah and insisted that Israel comply with international law in its ongoing military operations in the region. At the end of their two-day summit, the ministers didn’t refer directly to the International Criminal Court and its recent arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister over crimes against humanity. Italy had put the ICC warrants on the official meeting agenda, even though the G7 was split on the issue. The U.S., Israel’s closest ally, isn’t a signatory to the court and has called the warrants 'outrageous.' However, the EU’s chief diplomat Josep Borrell said all the other G7 countries were signatories and therefore obliged to respect the warrants. In the end, the final statement adopted by the ministers said Israel, in exercising its right to defend itself, 'must fully comply with its obligations under international law in all circumstances, including international humanitarian law.' And it said all G7 members — Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States – 'reiterate our commitment to international humanitarian law and will comply with our respective obligations.' It stressed that 'there can be no equivalence between the terrorist group Hamas and the State of Israel.' The ICC warrants say there's reason to believe Netanyahu used 'starvation as a method of warfare' by restricting humanitarian aid and intentionally targeted civilians in Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza — charges Israeli officials deny. Israel strikes in central Beirut kill at least 7 people and wound 37 BEIRUT — An Israeli strike on Tuesday levelled a residential building in the central Beirut district of Basta — the second time in recent days warplanes have hit the crowded area near the city’s downtown. At least seven people were killed and 37 wounded in Beirut, according to Lebanon’s Health Ministry. It was not immediately clear if anyone in particular was targeted, though Israel says its airstrikes target Hezbollah officials and assets. The Israeli military spokesman issued a flurry of evacuation warnings for many areas, including areas in Beirut that have not been targeted throughout the war, like the capital’s commercial Hamra district, where many people displaced by the war have been staying. The warnings, coupled with fear that Israel was ratcheting up attacks in Lebanon during the final hours before a ceasefire is reached, sparked panic and sent residents fleeing in their cars to safer areas. In areas close to Hamra, families including women and children were seen running away toward the Mediterranean Sea’s beaches carrying their belongings. Traffic was completely gridlocked as people tried to get away, honking their car horns as Israeli drones buzzed loudly overhead. The Israeli military also issued warnings for 20 more buildings in Beirut’s suburbs to evacuate before they too were struck — a sign it was aiming to inflict punishment on Hezbollah in the final moments before any ceasefire takes hold. Independent Israeli commission blames Netanyahu and others for October 2023 attack TEL AVIV, Israel — The independent civilian commission of inquiry into the October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel has found Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu directly responsible for the failures leading up to the attack, alongside former defense ministers, the army chief and the heads of the security services. The civil commission presented its findings today after a four-month probe in which it heard some 120 witnesses. It was set up by relatives of victims of the Hamas attack, in response to the absence of any state probe. The commission determined that the Israeli government, its army and security services 'failed in their primary mission of protecting the citizens of Israel.' It said Netanyahu was responsible for ignoring 'repeated warnings' ahead of Oct. 7, 2023 for what it described as his appeasing approach over the years toward Hamas, and for 'undermining all decision-making centers, including the cabinet and the National Security Council, in a way that prevented any serious discussion' on security issues. The commission further determined that the military and defense leaders bear blame for ignoring warnings from within the army, and for reducing the army’s presence along the Gaza border while relying excessively on technological means. On the day of the Hamas attack, the report says, the army’s response was both slow and lacking. The civil commission called for the immediate establishment of a state commission of inquiry into the Oct. 7 attack. Netanyahu has opposed launching a state commission of inquiry, arguing that such an investigation should begin only once the war is over. Israeli ground troops in Lebanon reach the Litani River JERUSALEM -- The Israeli military says its ground troops have reached parts of Lebanon’s Litani River — a focal point of the emerging ceasefire. In a statement Tuesday, the army said it had reached the Wadi Slouqi area in southern Lebanon and clashed with Hezbollah forces. Under a proposed ceasefire, Hezbollah would be required to move its forces north of the Litani, which in some places is some 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of the Israeli border. The military says the clashes with Hezbollah took place on the eastern end of the Litani, just a few kilometers (miles) from the border. It is one of the deepest places Israeli forces have reached in a nearly two-month ground operation. The military says soldiers destroyed rocket launchers and missiles and engaged in 'close-quarters combat' with Hezbollah forces. The announcement came hours before Israel’s security Cabinet is expected to approve a ceasefire that would end nearly 14 months of fighting. Israeli airstrikes hit buildings near Beirut airport BEIRUT — Israeli jets Tuesday struck at least six buildings in Beirut’s southern suburbs Tuesday, including one that slammed near the country’s only airport. Large plumes of smoke could be seen around the airport near the Mediterranean coast, which has continued to function despite its location beside the densely populated suburbs where many of Hezbollah’s operations are based. The strikes come hours before Israel’s cabinet was scheduled to meet to discuss a proposal to end the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. The proposal calls for an initial two-month ceasefire during which Israeli forces would withdraw from Lebanon and Hezbollah would end its armed presence along the southern border south of the Litani River. There were no immediate reports of casualties from Tuesday’s airstrikes. EU top diplomat calls for urgent aid to Gaza FIUGGI, Italy — EU top diplomat Josep Borrell, whose term ends Dec. 1, said he proposed to the G7 and Arab ministers who joined in talks on Monday that the U.N. Security Council take up a resolution specifically demanding humanitarian assistance reach Palestinians in Gaza, saying deliveries have been completely impeded. 'The two-state solution will come later. Everything will come later. But we are talking about weeks or days,' for desperate Palestinians, he said. 'Hunger has been used as an arm against people who are completely abandoned.' It was a reference to the main accusation levelled by the International Criminal Court in its arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister. Borrell said the signatories to the court, including six of the seven G7 members, are obliged under international law to respect and implement the court’s decisions. Host Italy put the ICC warrants on the G7 agenda at the last minute, but there was no consensus on the wording of how the G7 would respond given the U.S., Israel’s closest ally, has called the warrants 'outrageous.' Italy, too, has said it respects the court but expressed concern that the warrants were politically motivated and ill-advised given Netanyahu is necessary for any deal to end the conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon. 'Like it or not, the International Criminal Court is a court as powerful as any national court,' Borrell said. 'And if the Europeans don’t support International Criminal Court then there would not be any hope for justice,' he said.

Ukraine says Russian attack sets a new record for the number of drones used	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia launched 188 drones against most regions of Ukraine in a nighttime blitz, the Ukrainian air force said Tuesday, describing it as a record number of drones deployed in a single attack. Most of the drones were intercepted, according to the air force, but apartment buildings and critical infrastructure such as the national power grid were damaged. No casualties were immediately reported in the 17 targeted regions. Russia has been hammering civilian areas of Ukraine with increasingly heavy drone, missile and glide bomb attacks since the middle of the year. At the same time, Russia’s army has largely held the battlefield initiative for the past year and has been pushing hard in the eastern Donetsk region where it is making significant tactical advances, according to Western military analysts. Ukraine faces a difficult winter, with worries about the reliability of the electricity supply amid Russia’s attacks and how much U.S. support it can count on next year after President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January. The air raid alert in the Kyiv region overnight lasted more than seven hours. Russia is trying to unnerve civilians and wear down their appetite for the almost 3-year-old war. The Russian Defense Ministry said Tuesday its forces destroyed 39 Ukrainian drones overnight over Russian regions near the border with Ukraine. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s General Staff said Tuesday that over the past 24 hours roughly half of the clashes along the about 1,000-kilometer (600 mile) front line occurred near Pokrovsk and Kurakhove in the Donetsk region. Ukraine has a critical manpower problem on the front line, and though the Russian army’s gains have been incremental its momentum is adding up as the Ukrainians yield ground. The Russian advance is threatening important supply routes in Donetsk, the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War said late Monday. Ukrainian defenses in Donetsk are not in danger of being overrun, however, the think tank said. It also noted that Russia would need to capture more than 8,000 square kilometers (3,000 square miles) of territory to achieve the Kremlin’s goal of seizing the whole of Donetsk. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-drone-attack-donetsk-4d388b0a02fc3fc785b1a67a6a22ebae	2024-11-26T01:02:12-08:00	
EU top diplomat says Israel has 'no excuses' to refuse a ceasefire with Hezbollah in US-French deal	FIUGGI, Italy (AP) — The European Union’s top diplomat said Tuesday there were 'no excuses' for Israel to refuse to accept a ceasefire with the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, saying all its security concerns had been addressed in the U.S.-French-brokered deal. Josep Borrell, the outgoing EU foreign policy chief, called for increased pressure on Israel to blunt extremists in the government who are refusing to accept the deal. Speaking on the sidelines of a Group of Seven meeting in Italy, Borrell warned that if a ceasefire is not implemented, 'Lebanon will fall apart.' Israeli officials said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s security Cabinet was set to convene Tuesday to discuss a proposed ceasefire. Among the issues that remain is an Israeli demand to reserve the right to act should Hezbollah violate its obligations under the emerging deal. Borrell said under the proposed agreement, the U.S. would chair a ceasefire implementation committee, with France participating at the request of Lebanon. 'On the proposal agreement brokered by the U.S. and France, Israel has all security concerns (addressed),' Borrell told reporters in Fiuggi, Italy. 'There is not an excuse for not implementing a ceasefire. Otherwise, Lebanon will fall apart.' Following the October 2023 Hamas attacks in Israel, months of back-and-forth fighting between Israel and the Iranian-backed Hezbollah have erupted into a full-blown war in recent months, with Israel killing Hezbollah’s main leaders and sending ground forces into southern Lebanon. Israeli bombardment has killed more than 3,500 people in Lebanon and wounded more than 15,000, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. On the Israeli side, about 90 soldiers and nearly 50 civilians have been killed by rockets, drones and missiles in northern Israel and in the fighting on the ground in Lebanon. The G7 meeting of foreign ministers from the world's leading industrialized nations, the last of the Biden administration, was dominated on Monday by the Mideast wars in Gaza and Lebanon. The G7 ministers were joined by the foreign ministers of the 'Arab Quintet,' Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. Borrell, whose term ends Dec. 1, said he proposed to the G7 and Arab ministers that the U.N. Security Council take up a resolution specifically demanding humanitarian assistance reach Palestinians in Gaza, saying deliveries there have been completely impeded. 'The two-state solution will come later. Everything will come later. But we are talking about weeks or days,' for desperate Palestinians, he said. 'Hunger has been used as an arm against people who are completely abandoned.' It was a reference to the main accusation levelled by the International Criminal Court in its arrest warrants against Netanyahu and his former defense minister. Israel has angrily denied the charges, calling them antisemitic and a victory for terrorism and said the charges failed to recognize the country’s right to defend itself. Borrell said the signatories to ICC, including six of the seven G7 members, are obliged under international law to respect and implement the court’s decisions. The U.S. is not a party to the court and has called the arrest warrants 'outrageous.' Host Italy put the ICC warrants on the G7 agenda at the last minute, but there was no consensus on the wording of how the G7 would respond given the position of the U.S., Israel’s closest ally. Italy, too, has said it respects the court but expressed concern that the warrants were politically motivated and ill-advised given Netanyahu is necessary for any deal to end the conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon. 'Like it or not, the International Criminal Court is a court as powerful as any national court,' Borrell said. 'And if the Europeans don’t support International Criminal Court then there would not be any hope for justice.' While the G7 meeting was dominated Monday by the Mideast conflicts, the attention turned Tuesday to Ukraine. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha was on hand and briefed the ministers on Russian attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said. 'We want to repeat, visibly, our solidarity from Italy and the G7,' Tajani told the ministers at the start of Tuesday’s session. 'Support to Kyiv is a priority.' The G7 has been at the forefront of providing military and economic support for Ukraine since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, and G7 members are particularly concerned about how a Trump administration will change the U.S. approach. Trump has criticized the billions of dollars that the Biden administration has poured into Ukraine and has said he could end the war in 24 hours, comments that appear to suggest he would press Ukraine to surrender territory that Russia now occupies. Tensions have only heightened since Russia attacked Ukraine last week with an experimental, hypersonic ballistic missile that escalated the nearly 33-month-old war. Russian President Vladimir Putin said the strike was retaliation for Kyiv’s use of U.S. and British longer-range missiles capable of striking deeper into Russian territory.	https://apnews.com/article/italy-g7-borrell-israel-hezbollah-ukraine-gaza-10f5b6f18853915677911a9601595ce3	2024-11-26T00:56:11-08:00	
Rebel group takes key Myanmar border town and rare earth mining hub in setback for military regime	BANGKOK (AP) — A powerful rebel group has seized a key trading town in northeastern Myanmar on the Chinese border, taking control of a lucrative rare earth mining hub in another setback for the military-led government, according to witnesses. The apparent loss of Kanpaiti to the Kachin Independence Army leaves Myanmar's military in control of only one town with a border crossing, Muse, and deprives it of potential profits from the mines that provide China with rare earth minerals critical for electric motors and wind turbines, as well as high-tech weapons and a broad range of electronics. Neither Col. Naw Bu, the KIA's spokesperson, nor Thet Swe, spokesperson for the military, responded to multiple requests for comment, but several local media outlets reported that Kanpaiti fell last week. The ongoing civil war and military restrictions make travel for journalists nearly impossible, but the reports were confirmed by witnesses by telephone. Video clips circulating on social media, which could not be independently verified, showed what was said to be a KIA member raising the group's flag at the tunnel through the mountain to China. Other clips showed a vast quantity of weapons allegedly captured by the KIA. The military seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021, triggering intensified fighting with long-established armed militias organized by Myanmar’s ethnic minority groups in its border regions which have struggled for decades for more autonomy. The once-mighty armed forces, known as the Tatmadaw, have suffered a series of unprecedented defeats over the past year, especially in areas to the east near the Chinese border and in the western state of Rakhine, after an alliance of three powerful militias launched a coordinated offensive on Oct. 27, 2023. Since then, other militias organized along ethnic lines have joined in, including the KIA in the northern state of Kachin. In Kachin's so-called Special Region 1, where Kanpaiti is located, the KIA since late September has been increasing assaults on a rival ethnic militia, the New Democratic Army-Kachin, which is allied with the government military and had provided border guard forces. The NDA-K also controlled the web of small, unlicensed operations where heavy rare earth elements are mined, then sold directly to China’s big state-owned mining conglomerates or through intermediaries. There are more than 300 unregulated mines in the area, producing most of the $1.4 billion in rare earths for sale to China last year 'at a terrible cost to the environment and local communities,' according to a report issued by London-based environmental group Global Witness in May. It's not clear how much of the profits flowed to the military government, and how much directly to the NDA-K, however, and while the loss of any revenue stream would be bad for the military, the fall of Kanpaiti is not necessarily a game changer for the overall conflict, said Morgan Michaels, a Singapore-based analyst with the International Institute of Strategic Studies who runs its Myanmar Conflict Map project. 'This is another series of embarrassing losses for the regime, but may not significantly affect the regime’s ability to wage war,' he said. 'China had already shut most of the border to dissuade the KIA’s offensives, and the regime is thought to primarily generate revenue through other means than rare earths.' China was able to use its close ties to the regime and the Three Brotherhood Alliance groups to broker a ceasefire in January in northern Shan state, where much of the fighting has been. Hostilities resumed five months later after the ethnic alliance said the military had violated the ceasefire and has shown no signs of stopping, despite intense pressure from Beijing. China has likewise been pushing the KIA in Kachin to end the fighting, which has stopped cross-border trade, to little end. In its September push, the KIA was able to quickly seize four towns in Kachin, with the exception of Kanpaiti, including the NDA-K headquarters of Pang War. KIA forces advanced toward Kanpaiti on Nov. 20, and since consolidating control have called for the hundreds of residents who fled to return, a local community leader said, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of arrest. The report was confirmed by a spokesperson for Kachin Human Rights Watch, which is not affiliated with the New York-based watchdog group of a similar name, and a resident who saw the KIA troops enter the town. Both spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of arrest by authorities. Multiple Kachin-based news outlets and other Myanmar media reported that 300 government troops were able to escape by fleeing into China, then crossing back into Myanmar at the regime-controlled border town of Muse. Kachin Human Rights Watch's spokesperson said he had reports of regime soldiers fleeing to safety, but did not have further details.	https://apnews.com/article/myanmar-rebel-fighting-army-setback-kanpaiti-b9b89e0ffd736e0cedb284543ae1107c	2024-11-26T00:56:10-08:00	
Philippine president and vice president clash in a feud that's testing an Asian democracy	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — A major political storm set off by a bitter feud between the Philippine president and the vice president is testing an Asian democracy that has long been troubled by rowdy politics, poor law enforcement and bareface impunity. Just over two years ago, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and Vice President Sara Duterte won in landslide electoral victories on a campaign battle cry of national unity. But their fragile alliance rapidly floundered over major differences, including their leanings toward either the United States or China, and Marcos’ rejection of the bloody crackdown on illegal drugs launched by his predecessor and Duterte’s father, Rodrigo Duterte. The hostilities came to a head over the weekend when Sara Duterte told reporters she had arranged for Marcos, his wife and his cousin and speaker of the House of Representatives, to be assassinated if she were fatally attacked herself. Marcos went on TV and declared he was ready to fight back. Here are the key figures in the unfolding political crisis: SARA DUTERTE Like her father, ex-President Rodrigo Duterte, the 46-year-old lawyer is a populist politician known for profanity-laced outbursts and temper that often clashed with official decorum. She made the political elites wary but endeared herself to ordinary people in a nation where name recall, political patronage and star-studded campaigns matter more than policy and governance platforms. As a provincial city mayor, Duterte successfully ran as Marcos' running mate in the 2022 race. But soon rifts appeared, including Duterte's opposition to congressional inquiries led by Marcos' allies into the thousands of deaths in the crackdown on drugs during Rodrigo Duterte's presidency 2016-2022. Also being investigated is her alleged misuse of funds while she served as education secretary. When Duterte's chief of staff was temporarily detained by legislators after refusing to cooperate with the inquiry, Duterte made the threats in an online news conference against Marcos, his wife and House Speaker Martin Romualdez. She also accused Marcos’ family of responsibility for the 1983 assassination of an opposition leader, which sparked a 1986 pro-democracy uprising that ousted Ferdinand Marcos, the current president's father. ___ FERDINAND MARCOS JR. Marcos' resounding electoral victory in 2022 was regarded as one of the most stunning reversal of fortunes for his family, which had fled the Philippines following the 1986 army-backed 'people power' revolt and returned years later. He inherited a battered economy, divisive politics and calls for him help prosecute his predecessor for the drug killings, which are being investigated by the International Criminal Court. Rodrigo Duterte has accused Marcos of being a weak leader and a drug addict, accusations the president denied. The new course Marcos chartered for the Philippines broke away with Duterte, who built close ties with China and Russia and antagonized the U.S. Marcos broadened defense ties with Washington and began going public with China’s aggressive actions to claim territory in the disputed South China Sea. In a sign of growing enmity, first lady Liza Araneta-Marcos disclosed her ill-feelings toward Sara Duterte in a radio interview in April. Duterte resigned two months later as Marcos' education secretary and head of an anti-insurgency body. She said last month that her relationship with Marcos had 'gone so toxic' she has imagined 'cutting his head.' Addressing the country on Monday, Marcos said he would fight the vice president’s 'criminal plot' and uphold the rule of law. 'The truth should not be summarily executed,' Marcos said in Tagalog, using a term associated with Rodrigo Duterte’s drug killings. ___ RODRIGO DUTERTE One of Asia’s most unorthodox contemporary leaders until his six-year term ended in 2022, Duterte, 79 and in frail health, has retained a sizable following and remains one of the president's harshest critics. In his decades-long political career, he carved a name for his profanity-laced outbursts and disdain for human rights and the West while nurturing close ties with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian leader Vladimir Putin. He has accused Marcos, his wife and the House speaker of financial anomalies and once warned Marcos could be ousted like his father if they attempt constitutional reforms to allegedly prolong their grip on power. In a news conference on Monday, Duterte asked the military how long it would continue to support a president 'who’s a drug addict.' 'There is a fractured governance … It is only the military who can correct it,' Duterte said, but clarified that he was not calling for a coup. ___ MARTIN ROMUALDEZ Widely speculated to be harboring plans to run for the presidency in 2028, House Speaker Martin Romualdez has been accused by Sara Duterte of trying to destroy her reputation to eliminate a future contender. The 61-year-old member of a wealthy clan in the central Philippines, he has played a crucial role as head of the lower chamber, which is dominated by Marcos' allies. He will be key to handling a possible impeachment complaint against the vice president for the alleged misuse of funds. Addressing the House on Monday, Romualdez stressed that Sara Duterte should be held accountable for the death threats against him, the president and his wife. 'The gravity of such a confession demands accountability. It demands answers. It demands that we, as the representatives of the Filipino people, take a stand to protect our democracy from any and all forms of threats,' Romualdez said. ___ Associated Press video journalist Joeal Calupitan contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/philippines-marcos-duterte-assassination-threats-934fd103e380e1e1b7dad023ecd96ff2	2024-11-26T00:50:49-08:00	
Philippine investigators summon VP Duterte over her public threats against President Marcos	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Philippine authorities handed a subpoena to Vice President Sara Duterte’s office Tuesday, inviting her to answer investigators' questions after she publicly threatened to have the president, his wife and the House of Representatives speaker assassinated if she were killed in an unspecified plot herself. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Monday described her threat as a criminal plot and vowed to fight it and uphold the rule of law in the country in a looming showdown between the country’s two top leaders. The national police and the military expressed alarm and immediately boosted Marcos’s security. National Security Adviser Eduardo Ano said the threats were a national security concern. Duterte, a 46-year-old lawyer, said her remarks were not an actual threat but an expression of concern over her own safety due to unspecified danger to her life. The Marcos administration’s statements against her were 'a farce' and part of efforts to persecute critics like her, Duterte said. The subpoena ordered Duterte to appear before the National Bureau of Investigation on Friday to 'shed light on the investigation for alleged grave threats.' Duterte said Monday she was willing to face an investigation but demanded the Marcos administration also respond to her questions, including alleged irregularities in government. Under Philippine law, such public remarks may constitute a crime of threatening to inflict a wrong on a person or their family and are punishable by a prison term and fine. Relatedly, Justice Undersecretary Jesse Andres said in a statement late Tuesday that investigators were also looking into a potentially seditious remarks by former President Rodrigo Duterte, the father of the vice president. The former president expressed support to the vice president in a news briefing Monday night but said civilians like them would not be taken seriously by the government when they raise issues about corruption and irregularities in government. 'There is a fractured governance,' the former president said. 'It is only the military who can correct it.' Duterte clarified that he was not calling on the military to stage an uprising but stating that the civilian government would only listen when the military speaks. He also asked how long the military could still serve under a commander in chief 'who is a drug addict' — an accusation Duterte has made often and that Marcos has repeatedly denied. Andres said the ex-president's invitation to the military 'to have a part in seeking remedy is bordering on sedition and is legally actionable.' An ongoing investigation would look at the possibility that the separate remarks by the ex-president and his daughter as the incumbent vice president may be '`part and parcel' of the supposed destabilization plot against the administration.' Marcos ran with the younger Duterte as his vice-presidential running mate in 2022 elections and both won landslide victories on a campaign call of national unity. In the Philippines, the two positions are elected separately. The two leaders and their camps, however, soon had a bitter falling out over key differences, including in their approaches to China’s aggressive territorial claims in the disputed South China Sea and views on the elder Duterte's deadly anti-drugs crackdown that left thousands of mostly poor suspect dead. Duterte resigned from the Marcos Cabinet in June as education secretary and head of an anti-insurgency body and became one of the most vocal critics of the president, his wife and his cousin Martin Romualdez, who heads the House of Representatives. The House has been investigating alleged misuse of confidential government funds by Duterte as vice president and when she headed the Department of Education. She has denied any wrongdoing and added such congressional investigations aim to muzzle government critics like her from exposing government corruption and anomalies. Andres said the country's justice system and courts were functioning fully and could address any such concerns.	https://apnews.com/article/philippines-marcos-duterte-threats-d1823282709d0693eb502c8165fbb56f	2024-11-25T21:53:05-08:00	
Police in Bangladesh arrest Hindu leader who leads rallies for minority protection	DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — Police in Bangladesh’s capital have arrested a prominent Hindu leader who has been leading rallies demanding security for Hindus in the overwhelmingly Muslim nation since former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled the country amid a mass uprising in August. Hindus and members of other minority groups say they have faced more attacks than ever since an interim government replaced the ousted prime minister, as Islamist groups have become more prominent and demoralized security agencies have left a security vacuum. The government says the threat to Hindus has been exaggerated. Around 91% of Bangladesh’s population is Muslim, with Hindus making up almost all of the rest. Officials, witnesses and local media reports said that Krishna Das Prabhu, also known as Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari, was arrested in Dhaka’s main airport on Monday while traveling to Chattogram in southeastern Bangladesh. Rezaul Karim Mallik, an official of the Detective Branch of Police, confirmed Prabhu's arrest. Other officials also confirmed but would not provide further details on the charges. Kushal Baran Chakrabarty, who was accompanying Prabhu at the time of his arrest, said that several detectives took the Hindu leader to a police car at the airport. 'Chinmoy Prabhu gave his phone to me as he was forcefully taken to the police car. The police detectives jostled with us to forcefully take his phone and they took it away. We then followed the police car that headed for the headquarters of the Detective Branch at Minto Road in Dhaka,' he said. 'We stayed outside the Detective Branch’s office.' Prabhu faces charges of sedition filed in October after he led a huge rally in Chattogram in which he was accused of disrespecting Bangladesh’s national flag. Dhaka-based leading Prothom Alo daily reported that Prabhu would be produced before a court on Tuesday, and that two other people have been arrested in the case. Since August, Prabhu has led several large rallies demanding safety for the Hindus, as the interim government led by Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus said reports of attacks have been exaggerated. Many in the interim government see the rallies by Hindus as a threat to stability and a ploy to rehabilitate Hasina and her Awami League party. The long-ruling secular party is seen as a protector of the Hindu minority and has close ties to neighboring India. Hundreds of Hasina’s supporters, including many close aides, are believed to have fled to India after her fall. Prabhu is a prominent Hindu leader and a respected figure. He is a member of the Bangladesh Sammilito Sanatan Jagaran Jote group. He is also associated with the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, widely known as the Hare Krishna movement, and acts as a spokesman for the group in Bangladesh. Prabhu's followers took to the streets in Chattogram and Dhaka to demand his release later on Monday. In Dhaka, a mob armed with sticks attacked Hindu protesters on Monday night at Shahbagh intersection near the Dhaka University. Kalbela, a Bengali-language daily, said in a video report on Monday night that the attackers drove the Hindu protesters away from the area. Hasina fled the country on Aug. 5 after a student-led protest morphed into a mass uprising, ending her 15-year rule. The country's security agencies are struggling to keep order as the police agencies remained demoralized after dozens of their members were killed during the mass uprising in July and August.	https://apnews.com/article/bangladesh-prabhu-hindu-leader-arrest-hasina-yunus-40bbfeb0096e0212d220e31966f25d97	2024-11-25T20:36:13-08:00	
Imran Khan supporters breach lockdown in Pakistani capital as government threatens to open fire	ISLAMABAD (AP) — Supporters seeking the release of imprisoned Pakistani former premier Imran Khan on Tuesday broke through a ring of shipping containers locking down the capital Islamabad, battled police, and ignored a government threat to respond with gunfire. Police used tear gas to disperse the crowds and at least one person has died in clashes. Scores more have been injured, including journalists who were attacked by Khan supporters. Dozens of Khan supporters beat a videographer covering the protest for The Associated Press and broke his camera. He sustained head injuries and was being treated in a hospital. Shortly after midnight, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had threatened protesters that police would respond with live fire if protesters fired weapons at them. 'If they again fire bullets, the bullet will be responded with the bullet.' he said. Khan, who has been in jail for over a year and faces more than 150 criminal cases, remains popular. His party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, or PTI, says the cases are politically motivated. Authorities say only courts can order the release of Khan, who was ousted in 2022 through a no-confidence vote in Parliament. He has been imprisoned since his first conviction in a graft case, in August 2023, and has been sentenced in several cases. Khan’s supporters were around 10 km (6.2 miles) from their destination, the city’s Red Zone that houses key government buildings. Naqvi said Khan's party rejected a government offer to rally on the outskirts of the city. In a bid to foil the protest, police have arrested more than 4,000 Khan supporters since Friday and suspended mobile and internet services in some parts of the country. On Thursday, a court prohibited rallies in the capital and Naqvi said anyone violating the ban would be arrested. Travel between Islamabad and other cities has become nearly impossible because of shipping containers blocking the roads. All educational institutions remain closed. Mobile internet services and messaging platforms are experiencing severe disruption in the capital. The PTI relies heavily on social media to demand his release and uses messaging platforms like WhatsApp to share information, including details of events. The violence comes during an official visit by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-lockdown-imran-khan-protest-islamabad-46ea4720c1f4a28326f73f449f21355e	2024-11-25T19:40:50-08:00	
Small Japanese rocket engine explodes during a test but no injuries are reported	TOKYO (AP) — An engine for a new small Japanese rocket reportedly burst into flames Tuesday during a combustion test. The fire, which was followed by an explosion and plumes of white smoke, followed an explosion last year by the same Epsilon S engine during a test, Japan's Kyodo news agency reported. There were no injuries, Kyodo reported, citing the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, which is investigating. Last year's explosion happened after a piece of metal melted and damaged part of the engine, Kyodo said. The Epsilon S rocket is meant to improve Japan's position in the growing satellite launch market.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-rocket-engine-fire-explosion-c58b6bd86941f916bb5fb873c645c519	2024-11-25T18:43:34-08:00	
Stock market today: Global shares mostly fall on worries about Trump's tariffs	TOKYO (AP) — Global shares retreated on Tuesday as worries spread over President-elect Donald Trump's comment that he plans to impose sweeping new tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China as soon as he takes office. France's CAC 40 declined 0.9% in early trading to 7,195.07, while Germany's DAX slipped 0.6% to 19,288.75. Britain's FTSE 100 shed 0.5% to 8,253.24. The futures for the S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were nearly flat. In Asian trading, Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 dropped 0.9% to finish at 38,442.00. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 lost 0.7% to 8,359.40. South Korea's Kospi dipped 0.6% to 2,520.36. Hong Kong's Hang Seng was little changed, inching up less than 0.1% to 19,159.20. The Shanghai Composite fell 0.1% to 3,259.76. On Monday, stocks rose on Wall Street, led by shares likely to benefit from lower interest rates. The S&amp;P 500 climbed 0.3%. The Dow jumped 1% to a new record. The Nasdaq gained 0.3%. Treasury yields eased earlier this week in what some analysts called a 'Bessent bounce' after Trump said he wants Scott Bessent, a hedge fund manager, to be his Treasury Secretary. Bessent, a billionaire, has argued for reducing the U.S. government’s deficit, which is how much more it spends than it takes in through taxes and other revenue. Such an approach could soothe worries on Wall Street that Trump’s policies may lead to a much bigger deficit, which in turn would put upward pressure on Treasury yields and drive prices lower. The Federal Reserve began cutting its main interest rate just a couple months ago from a two-decade high, hoping to keep the job market humming after bringing inflation nearly all the way down to its 2% target. But immediately after Trump’s victory, traders had reduced bets for how many cuts the Fed may deliver next year. They were worried Trump’s preference for lower tax rates and higher spending on the border would balloon the national debt. A U.S. report coming on Wednesday could influence how much the Fed may cut rates. Economists expect it to show that an underlying inflation trend the Fed prefers to use accelerated to 2.8% last month from 2.7% in September. Higher inflation would make the Fed more reluctant to cut rates as deeply or as quickly as it would otherwise. Much focus has been on the resilience of U.S. shoppers, given high prices and still-high interest rates. In other dealings early Tuesday, benchmark U.S. crude added 45 cents to $69.39 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, added 40 cents to $73.88 a barrel. In currency trading, the U.S. dollar slipped to 154.02 Japanese yen from 154.20 yen. The euro rose to $1.0509 from $1.0495.	https://apnews.com/article/stock-markets-rates-tariffs-inflation-932f970544b216da249e33d8c0491ac8	2024-11-25T18:39:51-08:00	
Hong Kong's top court rules in favor of equal inheritance and housing benefits for same-sex couples	HONG KONG (AP) — Hong Kong’s top court on Tuesday upheld earlier rulings that favored subsidized housing benefits and equal inheritance rights for same-sex married couples, in a landmark victory for the city's LGBTQ+ community. The Court of Final Appeal's dismissal of the government's appeals ended some yearslong legal battles over the differential treatment facing same-sex couples married overseas under Hong Kong’s Housing Authority policies and two inheritance laws. The unanimous decisions are expected to have a far-reaching impact on the lives of same-sex couples, who have traditionally had fewer rights compared to their heterosexual counterparts in the global financial hub. Chief Justice Andrew Cheung said in his judgement that exclusionary housing policies were argued to be beneficial to opposite-sex married couples because they increase the supply of subsidized housing for them and thereby support the institution of traditional families. But Cheung said authorities failed to provide evidence showing the potential impact on opposite-sex couples if those policies were relaxed. 'The challenged policies cannot be justified,' he wrote. On the inheritance laws, judges Roberto Ribeiro and Joseph Fok ruled that the disputed provisions are 'discriminatory and unconstitutional' in their written judgement. Hong Kong does not recognize same-sex marriage, prompting some couples to marry elsewhere. Currently, the city only recognizes same-sex marriage for certain purposes such as taxation, civil service benefits and dependent visas. Many of the government’s concessions were won through legal challenges, and the city has seen a growing social acceptance toward same-sex marriage. In September 2023, the top court ruled that the government should provide a framework for recognizing same-sex partnerships. This ruling, along with other successful legal challenges brought by members of the LGBTQ+ community, made Hong Kong the only place in China to grant such recognition for same-sex couples. In separate judgements handed down in 2020 and 2021, a lower court had ruled that the housing policies involved in Tuesday's cases violated the constitutional right to equality, and that excluding same-sex spouses from inheritance law benefits constituted unlawful discrimination. The government had challenged these decisions at the Court of Appeal but subsequently lost in October 2023. It then took the cases to the top court. Nick Infinger, who first launched a judicial review against the Housing Authority in 2018, told reporters that Tuesday's rulings 'acknowledged same-sex couples can love each other and deserve to live together.' 'This is not only fighting for me, for my partner, but this is fighting for all the same-sex couples in Hong Kong,' he said outside the court building. Hong Kong Marriage Equality, a non-governmental organization, said in a statement that the judges' decisions made it clear that discrimination and differential treatment on the grounds of sexual orientation violate human dignity and equality. It called on the government to immediately end the exclusion of same-sex couples from marriage. The top court’s rulings also concluded a long legal journey taken by Henry Li and his late partner, Edgar Ng. After they married in Britain in 2017, Ng bought a subsidized flat as his matrimonial home with Li. The Housing Authority, however, said Li could not be added as an authorized occupant of the flat in the capacity of Ng's family member because same-sex married partners do not fall within its definition of 'spouse.' Ng was also concerned that if he died intestate, his proprieties would not be passed to Li, the court heard. Ng died in 2020 after suffering years of depression. After the rulings, Li posted a message on his Facebook page, saying that although he has lived in pain in the absence of Ng, he has not given up his husband's aspiration to pursue equality. 'Without you by my side, the arguments of the government and the Housing Authority in the cases seemed to become more cruel, causing me even more distress,' he wrote to Ng in the message. 'Our cases have finally reached their conclusion.'	https://apnews.com/article/hong-kong-lgbtq-housing-inheritance-same-sex-ad09f4280d718b6718aba98025293c33	2024-11-25T17:18:00-08:00	
Trump threatens to impose sweeping new tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China on first day in office	NEW YORK (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump is threatening to impose sweeping new tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China as soon as he takes office as part of his efforts to crack down on illegal immigration and drugs. The tariffs, if implemented, could dramatically raise prices on everything from gas to automobiles. The U.S. is the largest importer of goods in the world, with Mexico, China and Canada its top three suppliers, according to the most recent Census data. Trump made the threats in a pair of posts on his Truth Social site Monday evening in which he railed against an influx of illegal migrants, even though southern border crossings have been hovering at a four-year low. 'On January 20th, as one of my many first Executive Orders, I will sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% Tariff on ALL products coming into the United States, and its ridiculous Open Borders,' he wrote, complaining that 'thousands of people are pouring through Mexico and Canada, bringing Crime and Drugs at levels never seen before,' even though violent crime is down from pandemic highs. He said the new tariffs would remain in place 'until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country! ' Trump also turned his ire to China, saying he has 'had many talks with China about the massive amounts of drugs, in particular Fentanyl, being sent into the United States – But to no avail.' 'Until such time as they stop, we will be charging China an additional 10% Tariff, above any additional Tariffs, on all of their many products coming into the United States of America,' he wrote. It is unclear whether Trump will actually go through with the threats or if he is using them as a negotiating tactic before he takes office in the new year. Arrests for illegally crossing the border from Mexico have been falling and remained around four-year lows in October, according to the most recent U.S. numbers The Border Patrol made 56,530 arrests in October, less than one third of the tally from last October. Much of America’s fentanyl is smuggled from Mexico. Border seizures of the drug rose sharply under President Joe Biden, and U.S. officials tallied about 21,900 pounds (12,247 kilograms) of fentanyl seized in the 2024 government budget year, compared with 2,545 pounds (1,154 kilograms) in 2019, when Trump was president. Trump’s nominee for treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, if confirmed, would be one of several officials responsible for imposing tariffs on other nations. He has on several occasions said tariffs are a means of negotiation with other countries. He wrote in a Fox News op-ed last week, before his nomination, that tariffs are 'a useful tool for achieving the president’s foreign policy objectives. Whether it is getting allies to spend more on their own defense, opening foreign markets to U.S. exports, securing cooperation on ending illegal immigration and interdicting fentanyl trafficking, or deterring military aggression, tariffs can play a central role.' If Trump were to move forward with the threatened tariffs, the new taxes would pose an enormous challenge for the economies of Canada and Mexico, in particular. They would also throw into doubt the reliability of the 2020 trade deal brokered in large part by Trump, which is up for review in 2026. Spokespeople for Canada’s ambassador to Washington and its deputy prime minister, Chrystia Freeland, who chairs a special Cabinet committee on Canada-U.S. relations to address concerns about another Trump presidency, did not immediately provide comment. Trump’s promise to launch a mass deportation effort is a top focus for the Cabinet committee, Freeland has said. A senior Canadian official had said before Trump's posts that Canadian officials are expecting Trump to issue executive orders on trade and the border as soon as he assumes office. The official was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Mexico’s Foreign Relations Department and Economy Department also had no immediate reaction to Trump’s statements. Normally such weighty issues are handled by the president at her morning press briefings. ___ Associated Press writers Adriana Gomez Licon in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Robert Gillies in Toronto, Mark Stevenson in Mexico City, Fatima Hussein and Josh Boak in Washington contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china-59239afe12033ca99c65c7a2be0e4f0d	2024-11-25T15:27:17-08:00	
Germany's Merkel recalls Putin's 'power games' and contrasting US presidents in her memoirs	BERLIN (AP) — Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel recalls Vladimir Putin's 'power games' over the years, remembers contrasting meetings with Barack Obama and Donald Trump and says she asked herself whether she could have done more to prevent Brexit, in her memoirs published Tuesday. Merkel, 70, appears to have no significant doubts about the major decisions of her 16 years as German leader, whose major challenges included the global financial crisis, Europe’s debt crisis, the 2015-16 influx of refugees and the COVID-19 pandemic. True to form, her book — titled 'Freedom' — offers a matter-of-fact account of her early life in communist East Germany and her later career in politics, laced with moments of dry wit. Merkel served alongside four U.S. presidents, four French presidents and five British prime ministers. But it is perhaps her dealings with Russian President Putin that have drawn the most scrutiny since she left office in late 2021. Putin's power games Merkel recalls being kept waiting by Putin at the Group of Eight summit she hosted in 2007 — 'if there's one thing I can't stand, it's unpunctuality.' And she recounts a visit to the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi that year in which Putin's labrador appeared during a photo opportunity, although Putin knew she was afraid of dogs. Putin appeared to enjoy the situation, she writes, and she didn't bring it up — keeping as she often did to the motto 'never explain, never complain.' The previous year, she recounts Putin pointing to wooden houses in Siberia and telling her poor people lived there who 'could be easily seduced,' and that similar groups had been encouraged by money from the U.S. government to take part in Ukraine's 'Orange Revolution' of 2004 against attempted election fraud. Putin, she says, added: 'I will never allow something like that in Russia.' Merkel says she was irritated by Putin's 'self-righteousness' in a 2007 speech in Munich in which he turned away from earlier attempts to develop closer ties with the U.S. She said that appearance showed Putin as she knew him, 'as someone who was always on guard against being treated badly and ready to give out at any time, including power games with a dog and making other people wait for him.' 'One could find this all childish and reprehensible, one could shake one's head over it — but that didn't make Russia disappear from the map,' she writes. As she has before, Merkel defends a much-criticized 2015 peace deal for eastern Ukraine that she helped broker and her government's decisions to buy large quantities of natural gas from Russia. And she argues it was right to keep up diplomatic and trade ties with Moscow until she left power, Obama and Trump Merkel concluded after first meeting then-Sen. Obama in 2008 that they could work well together. More than eight years later, during his last visit as president in Nov. 2016, she was one of the people with whom she discussed whether to seek a fourth term. Obama, she says, asked questions but held back with an opinion, and that in itself was helpful. He 'said that Europe could still use me very well, but I should ultimately follow my feelings,' she writes. There was no such warmth with Trump, who had criticized Merkel and Germany in his 2016 campaign. Merkel says she had to seek an 'adequate relationship ... without reacting to all the provocations.' In March 2017, there was an awkward moment when Merkel first visited the Trump White House. Photographers shouted 'handshake!' and Merkel quietly asked Trump: 'Do you want to have a handshake?' There was no response from Trump, who looked ahead with his hands clasped. Merkel faults her own reaction. 'He wanted to create a topic of discussion with his behavior, while I had acted as if I were dealing with an interlocutor behaving normally,' she writes. She adds that Putin apparently 'fascinated' Trump and, in the following years, she had the impression that 'politicians with autocratic and dictatorial traits' beguiled him. Could Brexit have been avoided? Merkel says she tried to help then-Prime Minister David Cameron in the European Union as he faced pressure from British Euroskeptics, but there were limits to what she could do. And, pointing to Cameron's efforts over the years to assuage opponents of the EU, she says the road to Brexit is a textbook example of what can arise from a miscalculation. After Britons voted to leave the EU in 2016, an outcome she calls a 'humiliation' for its other members, she says the question of whether she should have made more concessions to the U.K. 'tortured me.' 'I came to the conclusion that, in view of the political developments inside the country at the time, there would have been no acceptable possibility for me to prevent Britain's way out of the European Union from outside,' Merkel says. Giving up power Merkel was the first German chancellor to leave power at a time of her choosing. She announced in 2018 that she wouldn't seek a fifth term, and says she 'let go at the right point.' She points to three 2019 incidents in which her body shook during public engagements as proof. Merkel says she had herself checked thoroughly and there were no neurological or other findings. An osteopath told her that her body was letting off the tension it had accumulated over years, she adds. 'Freedom' runs to more than 700 pages in its original German edition, published by Kiepenheuer &amp; Witsch. The English edition is being released simultaneously by St. Martin's Press.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-merkel-memoirs-russia-putin-obama-trump-0b4733c43d9628fd925d058799463b15	2024-11-25T14:02:56-08:00	
Israel launches new airstrikes on Lebanon as leaders draw closer to a ceasefire with Hezbollah	BEIRUT (AP) — Israel's military launched airstrikes across Lebanon on Monday, unleashing explosions throughout the country and killing at least 31 while Israeli leaders appeared to be closing in on a negotiated ceasefire with the Hezbollah militant group. Israeli strikes hit commercial and residential buildings in Beirut as well as in the port city of Tyre. Military officials said they targeted areas known as Hezbollah strongholds. They issued evacuation orders for Beirut's southern suburbs, and strikes landed across the city, including meters from a Lebanese police base and the city's largest public park. The barrage came as officials indicated they were nearing agreement on a ceasefire, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's Security Cabinet prepared to discuss an offer on the table. Airstrikes kill at least 31 Massive explosions lit up Lebanon's skies with flashes of orange, sending towering plumes of smoke into the air as Israeli airstrikes pounded Beirut’s southern suburbs. The blasts damaged buildings and left shattered glass and debris scattered across nearby streets. No casualties were reported after many residents fled the targeted sites. Some of the strikes landed close to central Beirut and near Christian neighborhoods and other targets where Israel had issued evacuation warnings, including in Tyre and Nabatiyeh province. Israeli airstrikes also hit the northeast Baalbek-Hermel region without warning. Lebanon’s Health Ministry said that 26 people were killed in southern Lebanon, four in the eastern Baalbek-Hermel province and one in Choueifat, a neighborhood in Beirut's southern suburbs that was not subjected to evacuation warnings on Monday. The deaths brought the total toll to 3,768 killed in Lebanon throughout 13 months of war between Israel and Hezbollah and nearly two months since Israel launched its ground invasion. Many of those killed since the start of the war between Israel and Hezbollah have been civilians, and health officials said some of the recovered bodies were so severely damaged that DNA testing would be required to confirm their identities. Israel says it has killed more than 2,000 Hezbollah members. Lebanon's Health Ministry says the war has displaced 1.2 million people. Israeli ground forces invaded southern Lebanon in early October, meeting heavy resistance in a narrow strip of land along the border. The military had previously exchanged attacks across the border with Hezbollah, an Iran-backed militant group that began firing rockets into Israel the day after the war in Gaza began last year. Lebanese politicians have decried the ongoing airstrikes and said they are impeding U.S.-led ceasefire negotiations. The country's deputy parliament speaker accused Israel of ramping up its bombardment in order to pressure Lebanon to make concessions in indirect ceasefire negotiations with Hezbollah. Elias Bousaab, an ally of the militant group, said the pressure has increased because 'we are close to the hour that is decisive regarding reaching a ceasefire.' Hopes grow for a ceasefire Israeli officials voiced similar optimism about prospects for a ceasefire. Mike Herzog, the country's ambassador to Washington, earlier in the day told Israeli Army Radio that several points had yet to be finalized. Though any deal would require agreement from the government, Herzog said Israel and Hezbollah were 'close to a deal.' 'It can happen within days,' he said. Israeli officials have said the sides are close to an agreement that would include withdrawal of Israeli forces from southern Lebanon and a pullback of Hezbollah fighters from the Israeli border. But several sticking points remain. Two Israeli officials told The Associated Press that Netanyahu’s security Cabinet had scheduled a meeting for Tuesday, but they said it remained unclear whether the Cabinet would vote to approve the deal. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were discussing internal deliberations. Danny Danon, Israel’s U.N. ambassador, told reporters that he expected a ceasefire agreement with Hezbollah to have stages and to be discussed by leaders Monday or Tuesday. Still, he warned, 'it’s not going to happen overnight.' After previous hopes for a ceasefire were dashed, U.S. officials cautioned that negotiations were not yet complete and noted that there could be last-minute hitches that either delay or destroy an agreement. 'Nothing is done until everything is done,' White House national security spokesman John Kirby said. The proposal under discussion to end the fighting calls for an initial two-month ceasefire during which Israeli forces would withdraw from Lebanon and Hezbollah would end its armed presence along the southern border south of the Litani River. The withdrawals would be accompanied by an influx of thousands more Lebanese army troops, who have been largely sidelined in the war, to patrol the border area along with an existing U.N. peacekeeping force. Western diplomats and Israeli officials said Israel is demanding the right to strike in Lebanon if it believes Hezbollah is violating the terms. The Lebanese government has said that such an arrangement would authorize violations of the country's sovereignty. A ceasefire could mark a step toward ending the regionwide war that ballooned after Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. The lack of a ceasefire has emerged as a political liability for Israeli leaders including Netanyahu, particularly while 60,000 Israelis remain away from their homes in the country's north after more than a year of cross-border violence. Hezbollah rockets have reached as far south into Israel as Tel Aviv. At least 75 people have been killed, more than half of them civilians. More than 50 Israeli soldiers died fighting in the ground offensive in Lebanon. The Israeli military said about 250 projectiles were fired Sunday, with some intercepted. A ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, the strongest of Iran’s armed proxies, is expected to significantly calm regional tensions that have led to fears of a direct, all-out war between Israel and Iran. It’s not clear how the ceasefire will affect the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. Hezbollah had long insisted that it would not agree to a ceasefire until the war in Gaza ends, but it dropped that condition. A top Hamas official in Lebanon said the Palestinian militant group would support a ceasefire between its Lebanese ally Hezbollah and Israel, despite Hezbollah’s previous promises to stop the fighting in Lebanon only if the war in Gaza ends. 'Any announcement of a ceasefire is welcome. Hezbollah has stood by our people and made significant sacrifices,' Osama Hamdan of Hamas' political wing told the Lebanese broadcaster Al-Mayadeen, which is seen as politically allied with Hezbollah. While the ceasefire proposal is expected to be approved if Netanyahu brings it to a vote in his security Cabinet, one hard-line member, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, said he would oppose it. He said on X that a deal with Lebanon would be a 'big mistake' and a 'missed historic opportunity to eradicate Hezbollah.' If the ceasefire talks fail, Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said, 'it will mean more destruction and more and more animosity and more dehumanization and more hatred and more bitterness.' Speaking at a G7 meeting in Fiuggi, Italy, the last summit of its kind before U.S. President Joe Biden leaves office, Safadi said such a failure 'will doom the future of the region to more conflict and more killing and more destruction.' ___ Federman reported from Jerusalem and Metz from Rabat, Morocco.

Over 18,000 register to run for Supreme Court seats and federal judges in Mexico's new system	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Over 18,000 people have registered online to run for Supreme Court seats and federal judgeships in Mexico's contentious new selection process, officials said Monday. But a random drawing in the end will determine who gets on the ballot. The ruling party pushed through a constitutional reform in September to make all federal judges stand for election, replacing the system where court employees and lawyers mainly move up through the ranks. Current court employees and their supporters have staged dozens of demonstrations against the reforms, calling them part of a ruling-party campaign to weaken checks and balances and eliminate independent regulatory and oversight bodies. Now, candidates for Supreme Court seats and federal judgeships need only a law degree, a grade point average of 3.2, 'five years of professional experience' and five letters of recommendation from neighbors or friends. That, and some luck in the final drawing. Officials rejected criticism that has called the process rushed or amateurish for the often highly technical posts that can hear cases including intellectual property, organized crime and Constitutional law. 'The results have been spectacular,' said Arturo Zaldivar, a top adviser to President Claudia Sheinbaum. According to the plan, evaluation committees will have just over a month to review thousands of resumes and whittle the field to about 10 candidates or less for each for the 881 judgeships and nine seats on the Supreme Court. Then 1,793 names chosen at random from those selected will appear on the ballot on June 1. Critics warn that many who land on the ballot will be unknowns who perhaps have never argued a case in the courts they seek to run. 'You don’t elect a doctor or a surgeon for an operation based on their popularity, you elect them based on their technical expertise, their ability, their knowledge,' said Sergio Méndez Silva, the legal coordinator for the civic group Foundation for Justice. 'That also applies for a judge.' With candidates now having to run election campaigns, critics warn there's a chance that drug cartels or political parties could finance them to get friendly judges onto the bench. There are also concerns that the evaluation committees deciding who makes the cut for the selection to appear on ballots may not be impartial. Most committee members were appointed by the legislative or executive branches, controlled by the ruling Morena party. Some critics argue that the current justice system, which is riddled with nepotism, corruption and a lack of accountability, needs to be changed. 'We need a justice system that gives results,' said Minerva Martínez Garza, an academic and former head of the human rights commission in the northern border state of Nuevo Leon who has registered to run for a Supreme Court seat. Trials in Mexico can last for years, and the ruling party has added to the growing list of crimes for which bail is not allowed, meaning that a large percentage of the prison population is people awaiting trial. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-judges-elections-supreme-court-5e9464a2617a044b30e3d1bbaa20bf3e	2024-11-25T09:46:52-08:00	
Scuffles in Serbian parliament amid accusations over fatal rail station roof collapse	BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Scuffles and fistfights between ruling party and opposition lawmakers broke out in Serbia’s parliament on Monday, weeks after a deadly rail station roof collapse that ignited tensions in the Balkan state. The opposition wanted to discuss who is responsible for the crash that killed 15 people at the station in the northern city of Novi Sad on Nov. 1, while governing officials, who have a majority in Serbia’s legislature, sought to adopt a bill on next year’s state budget. The opposition displayed a banner showing a red handprint reading 'blood is on your hands,' while the ruling party responded with a banner accusing the opposition of wanting 'war while Serbia wants to work.' Scuffles erupted when the two sides tried to grab each other's banner. Serbia’s parliament speaker Ana Brnabic was quick to accuse the opposition of wanting to come to power by force with help from outside. 'There is not a hint, not a grain of doubt that these are people who are well organized, who were trained quite well, I believe paid well, to create chaos in Serbia and destabilize our country,' she said. Serbia's autocratic President Aleksandar Vucic said on Instagram that the 'daily bullying' and 'the savage behavior' of the opposition would not be tolerated. 'I want to reassure the citizens and tell them that we will respond to their rudeness, rudeness and arrogance with even more work in the future.' he said. 'Today they tried to prevent pensioners from receiving their increased pensions, public sector employees from their increased salaries. They won’t succeed.' Opposition leader Dragan Djilas said the speaker had 'shut down' the parliament by 'refusing to allow a debate on who's responsible for the rail station tragedy.' 'She started with that when she refused to put on the agenda the request of more than 80 members of the opposition for a debate on confidence in the government because of the murder and crime in Novi Sad,' Djilas said. The collapse of the concrete roof raised tensions across the Balkan county, fueling widespread anger toward the government and protests. The rail station, a major hub, was recently renovated as part of a Serbian-Chinese partnership. Critics allege that corruption, poor oversight and inadequate construction work contributed to the tragedy. The collapse became a flashpoint for broader dissatisfaction with Serbia’s authoritarian rule, reflecting growing public demands for transparency while the country undertakes large infrastructure projects, mostly with Chinese state companies.	https://apnews.com/article/serbia-roof-collapse-protest-parliament-67e8b1105277877a49c154cfa271cfe9	2024-11-25T07:12:29-08:00

Two US senators urge FIFA not to pick Saudi Arabia as 2034 World Cup host over human rights risks	GENEVA (AP) — Two United States senators urged FIFA on Monday not to pick Saudi Arabia as the 2034 World Cup host next month in a decision seen as inevitable since last year despite the kingdom’s record on human rights. Democrats Ron Wyden of Oregon and Dick Durbin of Illinois have told FIFA president Gianni Infantino in a letter 'we urge you to seek out a host country with a record of upholding human rights.' Saudi Arabia has been the only candidate for 2034 since FIFA unexpectedly opened a fast-track nomination process in October last year. The contest seemed designed by FIFA for the Saudi bid to win, despite needing to build most of the 15 stadiums needed that risks repeating labor rights issues seen in Qatar over a decade of intense scrutiny before the 2022 World Cup. On Dec. 11, at an online meeting, more than 200 FIFA member federations are expected to jointly endorse by acclamation the Saudi bid plus the only candidate for the 2030 edition. That is a co-hosting plan by Spain, Portugal and Morocco with single games going to Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay. 'Approving Saudi Arabia’s bid this December endangers workers, athletes, tourists, and members of the press, and it runs counter to FIFA’s own human rights policies,' Wyden and Durbin wrote in a letter seen by The Associated Press. 'The kingdom continues to torture dissidents, engage in extrajudicial killings, discriminate against the LGBTQ+ community, oppress women and religious minorities, exploit and abuse foreign workers, and restrict almost all political rights and civil liberties,' the letter claimed. Those concerns were aired by United Nations members at the Human Rights Council in January when Saudi Arabia’s track record was examined. At that session in Geneva, Saudi government officials pointed to dozens of reforms in favor of women and a wider modernizing of its society under the Vision 2030 program pushed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. FIFA’s Infantino has worked to build close ties to the crown prince over several years. The soccer body’s World Cup sponsor deal in April with Saudi state oil firm Aramco signaled a deeper financial relationship ahead of the 2026 edition being co-hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico. FIFA bid rules for World Cup candidates require an assessment of human rights risks for the tournament, but the analysis by law firm Clifford Chance published in July was criticized by NGOs and activists for lacking independence. That report committed Saudi Arabia to working with the UN-backed International Labor Organization but not global rights experts who have limited access to enter the country to work. 'More concerningly,' the senators wrote, 'the Saudis have failed to address how they will uphold labor protections, press freedoms, non-discrimination and inclusion standards. 'We strongly urge FIFA to take all steps necessary to thoroughly re-evaluate Saudi Arabia’s ill-equipped World Cup bid ahead of December and select a rights-respecting host country.' ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer	https://apnews.com/article/fifa-saudi-arabia-world-cup-human-rights-senators-8aa88c2a3a279824ad4f5507b6457a4f	2024-11-25T06:27:18-08:00

Britain targets Russia's 'shadow fleet' with new sanctions package	LONDON (AP) — Britain sanctioned 30 ships in Russia's so-called shadow fleet that have been skirting restrictions to transport billions of dollars of petroleum, the Foreign Office said Monday. It is the biggest sanctions package targeting the fleet of illegitimate and often decrepit ships that are operating illegally to avoid sanctions, the Foreign Office said. The U.K. has now sanctioned 73 tankers, the most of any nation, in efforts to cripple a major funding source for Moscow’s war against Ukraine. 'Russia’s oil revenues are fueling the fires of war and destruction in Ukraine,' Foreign Secretary David Lammy said in Italy at a meeting of G7 foreign ministers. 'We are determined to ensure that both the ships and the enablers of those ships thwarting European and U.K. sanctions are hurt at this time.' Half the ships sanctioned delivered more than 3.4 billion pounds ($4.3 billion) worth of oil and oil products in the past 12 months, a Foreign Office statement said. Two insurers were sanctioned for enabling the fleet. Leaders at the European Political Community summit in July had agreed to tighten sanctions on the fleet.	https://apnews.com/article/uk-sanctions-russia-tankers-oil-ukraine-fd81bf5b67aa438d0da37aa9078d5bdb	2024-11-25T05:31:00-08:00	
Egyptian officials say 17 people are missing after a tourist yacht sank in high waves on Red Sea	CAIRO (AP) — At least 17 people are missing after a tourist yacht sank in the Red Sea following warnings about rough seas, Egyptian officials said Monday. The governor of the Red Sea region, Amr Hanafy, said rescuers saved 28 people from the vessel south of the coastal town of Marsa Alam, and some were airlifted to receive medical treatment. Hanafy said 31 tourists of various nationalities were on board along with 14 crew. The U.K. Foreign Office said it was providing consular support to 'a number of British nationals and their families' after the sinking. There were reports that British citizens were among the missing. The governorate received a report shortly before dawn Monday of a distress call made from the yacht, which had left Marsa Alam for a five-day journey. It was not immediately clear what caused the four-deck, wooden-hulled motor yacht to sink. But the Egyptian Meteorological Authority on Saturday warned about turbulence and high waves on the Red Sea and advised against maritime activity for Sunday and Monday. A person answering the phone at the company that operates the yacht, Dive Pro Liveaboard in Hurghada, Egypt, told The Associated Press they have 'no information' and hung up. According to their website, the Sea Story was built in 2022 and can hold 36 passengers. The Egyptian military was coordinating rescue operations with the governorate. Many tourist companies have stopped or limited traveling on the Red Sea due to the dangers from conflicts in the region. ___ Associated Press writer Brian Melley in London contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/egypt-tourists-sinking-missing-2b0b691e20b7017017a35167a4939ccb	2024-11-25T03:12:26-08:00	
Here’s where ceasefire talks in the war between Israel and Hezbollah have been stuck	BEIRUT (AP) — Diplomats and other officials say there have been several sticking points in ceasefire talks to end the war between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, even as conditions for an agreement appear to be ripe. Israel’s military has killed nearly all of the militant group’s top leaders, but it continues to fire missiles into Israel. Tens of thousands of Israelis who were evacuated from the border months ago are pressuring their government to go home. And the world wants to stop regional conflict from spreading after more than a year of fighting. Following the latest visit to the region by a U.S. mediator, Israel hit central Beirut over the weekend, and Hezbollah responded with its biggest barrage in weeks as each applied pressure to reach a deal. Israel and Hezbollah have exchanged fire almost daily since the day after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, setting off the war in Gaza. Israel launched a widespread bombardment of Lebanon two months ago, then a ground invasion. More than 3,500 people in Lebanon have been killed, many of them civilians. More than 70 have been killed in Israel, over 40 of them civilians. In addition, over 50 Israeli soldiers have been killed in the ground offensive. Here’s a look at the proposal and the sticking points. A proposed two-month ceasefire to start The proposal under discussion to end the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah calls for an initial two-month ceasefire during which Israeli forces would withdraw from Lebanon and Hezbollah would end its armed presence along the southern border south of the Litani River. The withdrawals would be accompanied by an influx of thousands more Lebanese army troops, who have been largely sidelined in the war, to patrol the border area along with an existing U.N. peacekeeping force. An international committee would be set up to monitor implementation of the ceasefire agreement and of U.N. Security Council resolution 1701, which was passed in 2006 to end a monthlong war between Israel and Hezbollah but never fully implemented. Hezbollah never ended its presence in southern Lebanon, while Lebanon said Israel regularly violated its airspace and occupied small patches of its territory. It is not clear whether a new deal would be any more successfully implemented than the one in 2006. Michael Herzog, Israel’s ambassador to Washington, told Israeli Army Radio on Monday that the deal aimed to improve surveillance and enforcement of the previous resolution. While he said there were still certain points that needed to be finalized, a deal was close and could be clinched 'within days.' A U.S. official said negotiations continued to progress on Sunday, but the parties still need to work out some outstanding issues to close the deal. The official, who insisted on anonymity to discuss the private talks, declined to detail the outstanding issues. Israel wants freedom to strike Hezbollah and other disagreements Two Western diplomats described several points of dispute to The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss ongoing negotiations. They said Israel was asking for more guarantees to ensure that Hezbollah’s weapons are removed from the border area. Israeli officials, concerned about the possibility of Hezbollah launching the kind of attack that Hamas carried out from Gaza into southern Israel, have said they would not agree to a ceasefire deal that doesn't explicitly grant them freedom to strike in Lebanon if they believe Hezbollah is violating it. An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to discuss the sensitive talks, said the issue remained a point of contention, although he said the talks were headed in a 'positive direction.' Lebanese officials have said agreeing to such a deal would violate Lebanon’s sovereignty. Hezbollah leader Naim Kassem has said the militant group would not agree to a deal that does not entail a 'complete and comprehensive end to the aggression' and does not protect Lebanon’s sovereignty. Lebanon and Israel have also disagreed over which countries would sit on the international committee overseeing implementation of the deal and Resolution 1701. In a sign of progress, Israel appeared to have dropped its opposition to France, which has remained close with Lebanon since its colonial rule there ended and has recently been at odds with Israel. On Monday, an official familiar with the talks, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were discussing behind-the-scenes negotiations, said that France would be part of the monitoring committee. Lebanon’s deputy parliament speaker, Elias Bousaab, also said Israel had accepted France. But Lebanon has refused to allow Britain, a close ally of Israel. It was unclear Monday if Lebanese officials had dropped their opposition following Israel’s concession. Meanwhile, Israel does not want to enter into negotiations on 13 disputed points along the border as part of a ceasefire deal, the diplomats said. Both sides have an interest in ending the war A ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, the strongest of Iran's armed proxies, is expected to significantly calm regional tensions that have led to fears of war between Israel and Iran directly. It's not clear how it would affect the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. Hezbollah had long insisted that it would not agree to a ceasefire until the war in Gaza ends, but it has now dropped that condition. One diplomat said there are fears that if no ceasefire is reached, the war will expand further into Syria and Iraq as Israel attempts to cut off the supply of weapons from Iran to Hezbollah. Israel has carried out regular airstrikes on Iran-linked groups in Syria and has threatened to strike in Iraq, where Iran-backed militias have periodically launched drone attacks on Israel. Geir Pedersen, the U.N. special envoy for Syria, said during a visit to Damascus on Sunday that ceasefires in Gaza and Lebanon are critical to 'avoid Syria being dragged even further into the conflict.' Meanwhile, analysts say Hezbollah has been weakened but continues to keep up steady fire into Israel, including strikes far from the border. On Sunday, Hezbollah fired about 250 rockets and other projectiles into Israel, wounding seven people in one of the militant group’s heaviest barrages in months, in response to deadly Israeli strikes in Beirut. Violent clashes continue in southern Lebanon as Israeli forces attempt to take control of strategic towns. Israel says its goal in the war with Hezbollah is to enable displaced Israelis to safely return home. In Lebanon, a quarter of the population has been displaced, and parts of the country, particularly in south Lebanon and areas south of the capital Beirut, have been destroyed. In Lebanon, where officials and residents are anxious for war to end, an initial rush of optimism dissipated after the Biden administration’s point man on Israel and Lebanon, Amos Hochstein, left the region last week without a deal. Many now believe no agreement will be reached before President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January. ___ Goldenberg reported from Tel Aviv, Israel.

Georgia's newly elected parliament opens its first session with opposition boycotting	TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — The newly elected Georgian parliament opened its inaugural session Monday as opposition lawmakers and the president boycotted it and thousands of protesters, watched by riot police, rallied outside and accused the ruling party of rigging the vote under Russian influence. The Oct. 26 election that kept the Georgian Dream party in power was widely seen as a referendum on the country’s effort to join the European Union. Opposition parties refused to participate in the parliament's activities, and only 88 lawmakers, all Georgian Dream members, were in the hall as the 150-seat parliament held its first session. Nika Melia, leader of Coalition for Changes, vowed that the opposition 'will do everything to defeat the so-called government, the self-proclaimed government.' 'This is the fight between people fighting for freedom against people who are trying to entrench the deeply authoritarian regime,' he said. President Salome Zourabichvili, who has rejected the official results and refused to recognize the parliament’s legitimacy, didn’t attend the opening session. Zourabichvili, who holds the mostly ceremonial position, said on X that the parliament is unconstitutional because of evidence of electoral fraud and her refusal to open the session as required by the constitution. Zourabichvili has filed a lawsuit at the Constitutional Court, arguing that two fundamental principles guaranteed by the constitution — the secrecy of the vote and its universality — were violated. Zourabichvili was elected by popular vote, but Georgia has approved constitutional changes that abolish the direct election of the president and replace it with a vote by a 300-seat electoral college that consists of members of parliament, municipal councils and members of legislatures of autonomous regions. The parliament on Tuesday is to set a date for the electoral college to vote on a new president. Georgian Dream kept Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze in office and its members voted to allow parliament speaker Shalva Papuashvili to keep his seat. The ruling party also controls all key parliamentary positions. Several thousand protesters, some of them waving Georgian and EU flags, rallied outside the parliament in the pouring rain, facing phalanxes of riot police. 'The government has stolen elections from us,' said student Vakho Sebiskveradze. 'It’s not only about the elections — this is about stealing the European future from the Georgian people, the Georgian nation, and the Georgian youth.' The Central Election Commission said Georgian Dream won about 54% of the vote in October. Its leaders have rejected opposition claims of fraud. European election observers said the balloting took place in a 'divisive' atmosphere marked by instances of bribery, double voting and physical violence. Critics have accused Georgian Dream — established by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia — of becoming increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow. The party recently pushed through laws similar to those used by the Kremlin to crack down on freedom of speech and LGBTQ+ rights. The EU suspended Georgia’s membership application process indefinitely in June after parliament passed a law requiring organizations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as 'pursuing the interest of a foreign power,' similar to a Russian law used to discredit organizations critical of the government. Badri Japaridze, leader of Strong Georgia Coalition, pledged that members of opposition parties elected to parliament will stay away from it. 'We are not going to enter this parliament, we boycott it, we do not acknowledge it,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/georgia-parliament-protest-european-union-russia-1cf767b6fb6ca0fc1584191df6b66b8c	2024-11-25T01:28:09-08:00	
French mass rape trial prosecutors demand maximum sentence for Gisèle Pelicot's ex-husband	AVIGNON, France (AP) — A mammoth rape trial in France moved into a new phase Monday as prosecutors began to lay out the verdicts and punishments they want for dozens of men accused of raping Gisèle Pelicot while she was drugged and rendered unconscious by her husband. After hearings stretching over nearly three months, the trial of 51 defendants in the southern city of Avignon is beginning to wrap up. Pelicot’s courage during the harrowing proceedings has helped transform her into an icon, even beyond France, for campaigners fighting against sexual violence. The public prosecutors started Monday by focusing on Dominique Pelicot, the man that 71-year-old Gisèle Pelicot was married to for nearly 50 years and who she believed was a loving, caring husband. But he has admitted that for years he mixed sedatives into her food and drink so he could rape her and also invite dozens of strangers that he recruited online to also rape her. Prosecutor Laure Chabaud asked the panel of judges for the maximum possible penalty for aggravated rape — 20 years — against the victim's now ex-husband. Dominique Pelicot, who turns 72 this week, stared down at the floor, one hand on the handle of his cane, as the prosecutor spoke. 'Twenty years between the four walls of a prison,' she said. 'It’s both a lot and not enough.' The court is expected to deliver its verdicts before Dec. 20. Gisèle Pelicot, who waived her right to anonymity, pushed for graphic images that her husband filmed of the rapes to be presented in the courtroom, showing that she was unconscious and inert, audibly snoring. 'This woman was you, Madame Gisèle Pelicot, an ordinary woman,' said prosecutor Jean-François Mayet, turning to her, as he praised her courage and her desire to make shame change sides, so it falls on rapists and not their victims. He noted that Monday also marked the international day for the elimination of violence against women and said that France faces 'a long path for our society to change its view of rape culture.' Gisèle Pelicot sat quietly, sometimes staring up the ceiling, as the prosecutors detailed how Dominique Pelicot amassed and carefully catalogued a library of 20,000 photos and videos of the abuse that stretched over nearly a decade. The evidence that he stored on hard drives, memory sticks and phones led investigators to dozens of the men he recruited, although about 20 others haven't been identified. All but one of the defendants are on trial for aggravated rape or attempted rape. In previous testimony, she said they treated her 'like a rag doll, like a garbage bag.' 'When did they ask the question of Madame Pelicot's consent? Not before. Not during,' Mayet said. Members of the public who hoped to witness the proceedings and lined up outside booed some defendants as they entered the courthouse, yelling: 'We recognize you' and 'Shame.' Banners that campaigners hung opposite the building read: '20 years for each of them' and 'a rape is a rape.' Gisèle Pelicot was greeted outside with cheers and applause. 'We feel it does her good. And it’s doing us good, too, because she’s really making a difference when it comes to feminism,' said Chantal Crémont, a supporter who traveled from western France. She added: 'It’s revolutionary in a way. When she says that shame changes sides, it’s really that. She’s standing as the victim, and she’s turning the tables. It’s very important.' Prosecutors described, one-by-one, the rapes that Dominique Pelicot's co-defendants allegedly committed on his unconscious wife and with his help and rules, including that they not make loud noises and first warm their hands so as not to wake her up. The defendants and alleged rapes are so numerous that the prosecutors were expected to take three days to summarize the evidence and detail the verdicts and sentences they want. In the first cases that the prosecutors focused on Monday, after requesting 20 years imprisonment for Dominique Pelicot, they asked for sentences of 10 years or more for co-defendants also on trial for rape or attempted rape. Dominique Pelicot has previously tearfully acknowledged in court that he’s guilty of the allegations against him. He said all of his co-defendants understood exactly what they were doing when he invited them to his home in Provence between 2011 and 2020 to have sex with his unconscious and unwitting wife, who divorced him after learning what he had done to her. He had no difficulty finding dozens of men to take part. In previous weeks of testimony, many defendants told the court that they couldn’t have imagined that Dominique Pelicot was drugging his wife, and that they were told she was a willing participant acting out a kinky fantasy. Dominique Pelicot’s lawyer, Béatrice Zavarro, said the prosecutors' request for the maximum possible penalty against him was justified 'in view of the gravity of the facts and the seriousness of the acts of which he is accused.' 'There’s no surprise in asking for 20 years, and that’s what I personally expected. But it’s still a shocking and heavy sentence for a man who’ll be 72 in a few days,' she said.	https://apnews.com/article/gisele-pelicot-france-rape-trial-avignon-mazan-b52c6894b74890573d6ac5e38394f245	2024-11-25T01:10:19-08:00	
Internet entrepreneur Kim Dotcom has suffered a serious stroke, a post on his X account says	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Kim Dotcom, the internet entrepreneur fighting deportation from New Zealand to the United States on charges relating to his file-sharing website Megaupload, has suffered a 'serious stroke,' a post on his X account said Monday. 'I have the best health professionals helping me to make a recovery. I will be back as soon as I can. Please be patient and pray for my family and I,' the post said. Dotcom’s U.S.-based lawyer, Ira Rothken, confirmed to The Associated Press that the contents of the statement were accurate. Rothken would not say whether Dotcom or someone else wrote the post and did not provide further details. Usually a prolific X user, the 50-year-old internet mogul last posted to the site on Nov. 6. His New Zealand-based lawyer, Ron Mansfield, told the New Zealand Herald on Tuesday that Dotcom suffered the stroke on Nov. 7 and is expected to remain hospitalized for some time. His prognosis is uncertain, Mansfield said. News of his ill health comes during a protracted battle by the U.S. government to extradite the Finnish-German millionaire to the United States from New Zealand to face charges of copyright infringement, money laundering and racketeering. In August, New Zealand ’s justice minister announced that Dotcom should be surrendered to the United States to face trial, a ruling intended to cap a 12-year legal battle. A date for the extradition was not set, and Paul Goldsmith, the minister, said Dotcom would be allowed 'a short period of time to consider and take advice' on the decision. Rothken at the time wrote on X that Dotcom intended to challenge the order in court through a judicial review, in which a judge is asked to evaluate whether an official’s decision was reached correctly. The saga stretches to the 2012 arrest of Dotcom in a dramatic raid on his Auckland mansion, along with other company officers. Prosecutors said the once wildly popular Megaupload raked in at least $175 million — mainly from people who used the site to illegally download songs, television shows and movies — before the FBI shut it down earlier that year. Lawyers for Dotcom and the others arrested had argued that it was the users of the site, founded in 2005, who chose to pirate material, not its founders. But prosecutors argued the men were the architects of a vast criminal enterprise, with the Department of Justice describing it as the largest criminal copyright case in U.S. history. The men fought the order for years — lambasting the investigation and arrests — but in 2021 New Zealand’s Supreme Court ruled that Dotcom and two other men could be extradited. It remained up to the country’s Justice Minister to decide if the extradition should proceed. 'I love New Zealand. I’m not leaving,' German-born Dotcom wrote on X in August. He did not respond to an AP request for comment at the time, or on Monday. Two of Dotcom’s former business partners pleaded guilty to the charges they faced and served time in a New Zealand jail, avoiding extradition to the U.S. Prosecutors abandoned an extradition bid against another, who has since died of cancer.	https://apnews.com/article/kim-dotcom-stroke-new-zealand-megaupload-extradition-e35032ae3a38b42da928154077f47dcd	2024-11-25T00:52:32-08:00	
The UAE arrests 3 Uzbek nationals for the killing of an Israeli-Moldovan rabbi	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The United Arab Emirates said Monday police arrested three Uzbek nationals for the killing of an Israeli-Moldovan rabbi, an attack that's raised concerns for the burgeoning Israeli community in the country. The statement from the country's Interior Ministry offered no motive for the slaying of Zvi Kogan, though an Israeli Foreign Ministry official later told The Associated Press that he simply had been 'killed because of who he was.' Kogan, 28, an ultra-Orthodox rabbi who went missing on Thursday, ran a kosher grocery store in the futuristic city of Dubai, where Israelis have flocked for commerce and tourism since the two countries forged diplomatic ties in the 2020 Abraham Accords. The agreement has held through more than a year of soaring regional tensions unleashed by Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack into southern Israel. But Israel’s devastating retaliatory offensive in Gaza and its invasion of Lebanon, after months of fighting with the Hezbollah militant group, have stoked anger among Emiratis, Arab nationals and others living in the UAE. The Interior Ministry statement identified the three men as Olimboy Tohirovich, 28, Makhmudjon Abdurakhim, 28, and Azizbek Kamilovich, 33. The state-run WAM news agency carried images of the three men, blindfolds covering their faces in prison uniforms and flip flops. The preliminary probe into the men is 'in preparation for referring them to the public prosecution for further investigation,' the Interior Ministry said. It wasn't immediately clear if the three men had lawyers or had sought consular assistance in the UAE, an autocratically ruled nation of seven sheikhdoms on the Arabian Peninsula. The Uzbek Consulate in Dubai did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding the arrests. Israeli media reports, citing unnamed security officials, had alleged Uzbeks were involved in Kogan's killing. Uzbeks and other transnational criminal gangs previously have been hired in Iranian plots targeting dissidents and others. Iran, which supports Hamas and Hezbollah, has also been threatening to retaliate against Israel after a wave of airstrikes Israel carried out in October in response to an Iranian ballistic missile attack. Iran’s Embassy in Abu Dhabi has denied Tehran was involved in the rabbi’s slaying. While the UAE statement did not mention Iran, Iranian intelligence services have carried out past kidnappings in the UAE. Western officials believe Iran runs intelligence operations in the UAE and keeps tabs on the hundreds of thousands of Iranians living across the country. Iran is suspected of kidnapping and later killing British Iranian national Abbas Yazdi in Dubai in 2013. Iran also kidnapped Iranian German national Jamshid Sharmahd in 2020 from Dubai, taking him back to Tehran, where he was executed in October. On Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also offered a glancing reference to Iran in remarks about Kogan's killing. 'I greatly appreciate the cooperation of the UAE in investigating the murder,' he said. 'We will strengthen the ties between us in the face of attempts by the axis of evil to harm the relationship of peace between us.' The Rimon Market, a kosher grocery store that Kogan managed on Dubai’s busy Al Wasl Road, was shut Sunday. As the wars have roiled the region, the store has been the target of online protests by supporters of the Palestinians. Mezuzahs on the front and back doors of the market appeared to have been ripped off. Kogan's body was flown back to Israel on Monday ahead of a planned funeral the following day. The Israeli Foreign Ministry official, who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing investigation and diplomatic matters, said authorities believe Kogan's death came from his identity as an ultra-Orthodox Jew, not anything else. 'He was attacked because of who he was,' the official said. Since the Oct. 7 attacks, Israelis and Jews in the UAE have been on edge. Worship, which typically requires 10 Jewish men to happen, still takes place but not at sites previously used by the community, the official said. The official acknowledged that tensions likely boil beneath the surface in the UAE, but praised the Emirati government for their investigation into Kogan's killing. Israeli security services have been involved in the probe, the official said. That likely includes the Mossad, Israel's foreign intelligence service. The UAE, while strenuously criticizing the conduct of the Israeli military in the Gaza Strip, has maintained its diplomatic relations with Israel. Israeli diplomats also have returned to Bahrain, the official said. 'They might not agree with what we do in the war ... but the dialogue allows them to send in all the humanitarian aid,' the official said of the Emirati government. The official added: 'It's been challenging to the relationship, but in a way, that keeps it strong.'	https://apnews.com/article/uae-israel-rabbi-killed-arrests-e4e2d0f54fd81d8f7693605639a594bd	2024-11-25T00:44:46-08:00	
A far-right populist shocks Romania by heading into the presidential runoff	BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — Romania is reeling after a little-known, far-right populist secured the first round in the presidential election, beating the incumbent prime minister. Calin Georgescu, who ran independently, will face reformist Elena Lasconi in a Dec. 8. runoff after most local surveys predicted he would win less than 10% of the vote. Georgescu, 62, was ahead after nearly all ballots were counted with around 22.95%. According to local media, Georgescu in the past has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin as 'a man who loves his country' and called Ukraine 'an invented state.' He has also sparked controversy for describing Romanian fascist and nationalist leaders from the 1930s and 1940s as national heroes. Lasconi, of the progressive Save Romania Union party, or USR, followed with 19.17%. She beat by a slim margin incumbent Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu of the Social Democratic Party, or PSD, who stood at 19.15%. Lasconi on Monday warned that Romania is now in 'a historical confrontation between preserving Romania’s young democracy … and those who want to return Romania to the Russian sphere of influence.' She added: 'Let us be very clear, Calin Georgescu is an open admirer of Vladimir Putin. He is open against NATO and the European Union … He is for Romania’s isolation, which he calls neutrality ... And without NATO we are at the mercy of Russia.' Georgescu on Monday denied charges of being an extremist as 'false, totally fake' and said he is 'completely dedicated' to the Romanian people. 'We remain directly linked to European values, but we must find our (own) values,' he said. 'I’m not an extremist, I’m not a fascist, I’m a Romanian who loves his country.' Many observers have attributed Georgescu’s success to his TikTok account, which has 3.7 million likes and 274,000 followers. He gained huge traction and popularity in recent weeks. It is the first time in Romania’s 35-year post-communist history that the country’s most powerful party, the PSD, doesn't have a candidate in the second round of a presidential race, underscoring voters’ anti-establishment sentiment. Ciolacu's shocking defeat prompted him to submit his resignation as party leader on Monday. After polls closed on Sunday, the Central Election Bureau said 9.4 million people — about 52.5% of eligible voters — had cast ballots. Georgescu won 43.3% of the vote in Romania's large diaspora, while Lasconi got 26.8%. Romania's president serves a five-year term in the European Union and NATO member country and has significant decision-making powers in areas such as national security, foreign policy and judicial appointments. According to his website, Georgescu holds a doctorate in pedology, a branch of soil science, and held positions in Romania’s environment ministry in the 1990s. Between 1999 and 2012, he was a representative for Romania on the national committee of the United Nations Environment Program. His campaign positions included supporting farmers, reducing import dependence and ramping up local energy and food production. Georgescu's rising popularity will be tested when he faces Lasconi, who may attract more moderate voters who initially choose other candidates. Lasconi, a former journalist, told The Associated Press ahead of the vote that she saw corruption as one of Romania's biggest problems and expressed support for increased defense spending and continued aid to Ukraine. If she wins the final vote, she will be the first female president in Romania's history. Romania will also hold parliamentary elections on Dec. 1 that will determine the country’s next government and prime minister.	https://apnews.com/article/romania-elections-president-far-right-europe-40e369c404cbcb0ada3527c0aaf939b8	2024-11-25T00:38:28-08:00	
Middle East latest: Israeli ambassador to US says Hezbollah ceasefire deal could come 'within days'	The Israeli ambassador to Washington says a ceasefire deal to end fighting between Israel and Lebanon-based Hezbollah militants could be reached 'within days.' Ambassador Mike Herzog told Israeli Army Radio on Monday there remain 'points to finalize' and any deal requires agreement from the government. But he said 'we are close to a deal' and 'it can happen within days.' Israeli officials said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s security Cabinet is set to convene on Tuesday to discuss a proposed ceasefire. Among the issues that remain is an Israeli demand to reserve the right to act should Hezbollah violate its obligations under the emerging deal. The deal seeks to push Hezbollah and Israeli troops out of southern Lebanon. Israel accuses Hezbollah of not adhering to a U.N. resolution that ended the 2006 war between the sides that made similar provisions, and Israel has concerns that Hezbollah could stage a Hamas-style cross-border attack from southern Lebanon if it maintains a heavy presence there. Lebanon says Israel also violated the 2006 resolution. Lebanon complains about military jets and naval ships entering Lebanese territory even when there is no active conflict. It is not clear whether Lebanon would agree to the demand. The optimism surrounding a deal comes after a top U.S. envoy held talks between the sides last week in a bid to clinch a deal. Hezbollah began attacking Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, a day after Hamas’ raid on southern Israel, setting off more than a year of fighting. That escalated into all-out war in September with massive Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon and later an Israeli ground incursion into the country’s south. Hezbollah has fired thousands of rockets into Israeli cities and towns, including some 250 on Sunday. ___ Here's the Latest: Israeli officials say security Cabinet to meet Tuesday on Lebanon ceasefire deal JERUSALEM — Israeli officials say Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s security Cabinet is set to convene on Tuesday to discuss a proposed ceasefire in the war with Hezbollah militants in Lebanon. Officials have said the sides are close to a deal that would include withdrawal of Israeli forces from southern Lebanon and a pullback of Hezbollah forces from the Israeli border. But several sticking points remain. Two officials confirmed the Cabinet meeting is set for Tuesday, but they said it is still not clear whether the decision-making body will vote to approve the deal. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were discussing internal deliberations. — Josef Federman in Jerusalem and Tia Goldenberg in Tel Aviv Arab foreign ministers call for immediate ceasefire in Gaza ROME — Several Arab foreign ministers, gathering in Rome on the sidelines of the Group of Seven meeting, are calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon and the provision of humanitarian aid to Palestinians. The ministers of Jordan, Egypt, Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates, and the secretary general of the League of Arab States, all participated in a Rome conference before joining G7 foreign minsters later in the day in nearby Fiuggi. 'Gaza is now a graveyard for children, a graveyard for human values, a graveyard for international law,' said Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi. The Mideast conflict was the top agenda item Monday for the G7, amid reported progress on a possible ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. Israel’s ambassador to the U.S. said a deal could be reached within days. 'We all hope and pray that this ceasefire will be realized because the absence of it will mean more destruction, and more and more animosity, and more dehumanization, and more hatred, and more bitterness which will doom the future of the region to more conflict and more killing and more destruction,' Safadi said. Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty reaffirmed that Cairo would host a ministerial-level conference next Monday on mobilizing international aid for Gaza. In remarks to the 'Mediterranean Dialogues' conference, he called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon, the release of hostages, provision of humanitarian aid for Palestinians and the initiation of 'a serious and genuine political process' to create a Palestinian state. Israeli rights group accuses prison authority of failing Palestinian prisoners after scabies outbreak TEL AVIV, Israel — An Israeli rights group said Monday that more than a quarter of all Palestinian prisoners currently held by Israel had contracted scabies since an outbreak was identified in May, and accused the prison authority of improper care and prevention. Physicians for Human Rights-Israel said that more than 2,800 prisoners had caught the rash-like infection, with more than 1,700 still actively infected. The outbreak was seen in five different detention facilities, the group said. It was citing figures it said came from the Israel Prison Service. The group said it filed a legal petition calling on the prison service ' to eradicate the scabies epidemic,' accusing the authorities of failing 'to implement widely recognized medical interventions necessary to contain the outbreak.' It said that it halted the legal proceedings after it received a commitment from the prison service to address the outbreak. The prison service said the court had cancelled the petition because the prisons had shown they were dealing with the outbreak in a 'systematic and thorough' way. Nadav Davidovich, an Israeli public health expert who wrote a medical analysis for the group’s court proceedings, said the outbreak was a result of overcrowding in prisons and apparent neglect from prison authorities. He said such outbreaks could be prevented if prisoners were held 'in more reasonable conditions.' If the first infections were treated as needed, such an outbreak could have been avoided, he said. Physicians for Human Rights-Israel also said that the Israel Prison Service had cited scabies as a reason for postponing lawyers' visits and court appearances for prisoners. It said those steps 'violate prisoners’ rights and serve as punitive measures rather than public health responses.' Israel’s far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who oversees the prisons, has boasted about hardening conditions to the bare minimum required by law. Lebanese politician accuses Israel of increasing bombardment to wring concessions BEIRUT — Lebanon’s deputy parliament speaker has accused Israel of ramping up its bombardment of Lebanon in order to pressure the government to make concessions in indirect ceasefire negotiations with Hezbollah. Elias Bousaab, an ally of the militant group, said Monday that the pressure has increased because 'we are close to the hour that is decisive regarding reaching a ceasefire.' 'We are optimistic, and there is hope, but nothing is guaranteed with a person like (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu),' Bousaab told reporters. Israel has carried out heavy strikes in central Beirut in recent days, while Hezbollah has increased its rocket fire into Israel. The United States is trying to broker an agreement in which Hezbollah fighters and Israeli forces would withdraw from southern Lebanon and Lebanese troops would patrol the region, along with a U.N. peacekeeping force. Israel has demanded freedom of action to strike Hezbollah if it violates the ceasefire, but Bousaab said that was not part of the emerging agreement. He also said Israel had accepted that France be part of the committee overseeing the ceasefire after Lebanese officials insisted. There was no immediate confirmation from the Israeli side. Israel has objected to France being on the committee in the wake of the International Criminal Court’s decision last week to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu, his former defense minister and a Hamas military commander. France said it supports the court. It said the question of whether it would arrest Netanyahu if he set foot on French soil was a 'complex legal issue' that would have to be worked out. Palestinian officials say Israeli forces killed 2 people, including a 13-year-old, in the occupied West Bank JERUSALEM — The Palestinian Health Ministry says Israeli forces killed two people, including a 13-year-old, in the occupied West Bank. The Israeli military said the two had thrown explosives at forces overnight near the Palestinian town of Yabad and that the forces had responded by opening fire. The Health Ministry identified the two as Mohammed Hamarsheh, 13, and Ahmad Zayd, 20. It did not disclose details about the circumstances behind their deaths. It was the latest bloodshed in the West Bank, which has faced a surge of violence throughout the 13-month war in Gaza. The Health Ministry says nearly 800 people have been killed, with more than 160 of them 18 and younger. Many have been killed in fighting with the Israeli military, but Palestinians throwing rocks and others not involved in confrontations have also been killed. There has also been an increase in Palestinian attacks against Israelis in the West Bank since the war in Gaza began. Israeli government orders public entities to stop advertising in Haaretz newspaper JERUSALEM — The Israeli government has ordered all public entities to stop advertising in the Haaretz newspaper, which is known for its critical coverage of Israel’s actions in the Palestinian territories. Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi said Sunday that the government had approved his proposal after Haaretz’ publisher called for sanctions against Israel and referred to Palestinian militants as 'freedom fighters.' 'We advocate for a free press and freedom of expression, but also the freedom of the government to decide not to fund incitement against the State of Israel,' Karhi wrote on the social platform X. Noa Landau, the deputy editor of Haaretz, accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of 'working to silence independent and critical media,' comparing him to autocratic leaders in other countries. Haaretz regularly publishes investigative journalism and opinion columns critical of Israel’s ongoing half-century occupation of lands the Palestinians want for a future state. It has also been critical of Israel’s war conduct in Gaza at a time when most local media support the war and largely ignore the suffering of Palestinian civilians. In a speech in London last month, Haaretz publisher Amos Schocken said Israel has imposed 'a cruel apartheid regime' on the Palestinians and was battling 'Palestinian freedom fighters that Israel calls ‘terrorists.’' He later issued a statement, saying he had reconsidered his remarks. 'For the record, Hamas are not freedom fighters,' he posted on X. 'I should have said: using terrorism is illegitimate. I was wrong not to say that.' Iran's supreme leader says Netanyahu should be ‘sentenced to death’ DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Iran’s supreme leader has suggested that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu should be 'sentenced to death' for his role in the ongoing wars in the Gaza Strip against Hamas and in Lebanon. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei made the remarks Monday during an event in which he spoke to members of the Basij, the all-volunteer arm of Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard. Khamenei referenced the International Criminal Court’s decision to issue an arrest warrant for Netanyahu and Israel’s former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. 'What the Zionist regime did in Gaza and Lebanon is not a victory, it is a war crime. Now they have issued a warrant for their arrest. This is not enough!' Khamenei said, according to remarks published by the state-run IRNA news agency. 'Netanyahu and the criminal leaders of this regime must be sentenced to death.' The International Criminal Court at the Hague does not issue death sentences. Khamenei also insisted those in Iran’s self-described 'Axis of Resistance,' like the Palestinian militant group Hamas and Lebanon’s Hezbollah, would be stronger after the war. 'The idiots should not think that bombing houses and hospitals in Gaza and Lebanon is a victory,' he said. 'The enemy has not become winner in Gaza and Lebanon, and it will not be winner.'	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-hezbollah-latest-25-november-2024-625d22d49f84f2442d8d9de285a183d1	2024-11-24T23:42:05-08:00	
Russia captures UK national fighting alongside Ukraine in the Kursk region, report says	The Russian military have captured a British national fighting alongside Ukrainian troops in Russia's partially occupied Kursk region, state news agency Tass reported Monday, citing unidentified sources in the law enforcement. The man was identified by Tass and other media as James Scott Rhys Anderson. Tass quoted him as saying that he had served as a signalman in the British army for four years and then joined the International Legion of Ukraine, formed early on in Russia's nearly 3-year-old war against its neighbor. In Ukraine, Anderson reportedly served as an instructor for Ukrainian troops and was deployed to the Kursk region against his will. Tass published a video of the man saying in English that he doesn’t want to be 'here.' The report couldn’t be independently verified, but if confirmed it could be the first publicly known case of a Western national captured on Russian soil while fighting for Ukraine. The U.K. Embassy in Moscow and the Russian Defense Ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-kursk-international-legion-e7fd8790cd151ff3b73a5edcc5e00bf5	2024-11-24T22:55:23-08:00	
Landslide and flash floods hit Indonesia’s Sumatra island, leaving 16 dead and 6 missing	KARO, Indonesia (AP) — Rescuers in Indonesia recovered 16 bodies under tons of mud and rocks or that were swept away in flash floods that hit mountainside villages on Sumatra Island, officials said Monday. Six people are still missing, officials said. Mud, rocks and trees tumbled down a mountain after torrential rains over the weekend and rivers burst their banks, tearing through four hilly districts in North Sumatra province, washing away houses and destroying farms. Police, soldiers and rescue workers used excavators, farm equipment and their bare hands to sift through the rubble looking for the dead and missing in Semangat Gunung, a resort area in Karo district, said Juspri M. Nadeak, who heads the local disaster management agency. Rescuers recovered six bodies after a landslide hit two houses and a cottage late Sunday, he said. Nine injured people managed to escape, he said. Rescuers on Monday were still searching for four missing people, including two children. Rescuers on Sunday pulled two bodies from a river after flash floods swept away at least 10 houses and damaged about 150 houses and buildings in villages in South Tapanuli district, said Puput Mashuri, who heads the local disaster management agency. Dozens of people were injured by the flash floods, which also destroyed more than 130 hectares (321 acres) of agricultural land and plantations. Flash floods on Sunday left four people dead in Deli Serdang district and rescue workers on Monday were searching for two people who were swept away by flash floods and are still missing. A landslide hit several houses in Harang Julu, a mountainside village in Padang Lawas district, said Mustari, the chief of the local search and rescue agency, who like many Indonesians goes by a single name. Rescuers late Saturday pulled out the bodies of a four-member family, including two children, and rescued at least three injured people from the devastated village, he said. Television reports showed relatives wailing as they watched rescuers pull mud-caked bodies from a room at a buried house in Harang Julu village. Seasonal rain from about October to March frequently causes flooding and landslides in Indonesia, an archipelago of 17,000 islands where millions of people live in mountainous areas or near fertile flood plains. Last December, 12 people were swept away to Lake Toba or buried under tons of mud after heavy rains triggered flash flood and landslide in mountainside villages in North Sumatra province. Only one of them was found dead and 11 others remain unaccounted for. The 1,145-square-kilometer (440-square-mile) Lake Toba, formed out of an ancient super volcano, is a popular sightseeing destination on the island of Sumatra and an area the government aims to develop as a magnet for international tourists. ___ Associated Press writer Niniek Karmini in Jakarta, Indonesia, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/indonesia-north-sumatra-flash-floods-landslide-df987590034f68545597a2e917fc82e9	2024-11-24T21:29:01-08:00	
DHL cargo plane crashes into a house in Lithuania, killing at least 1	VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) — A DHL cargo plane crashed on approach to an airport in Lithuania's capital and skipped into a nearby house Monday morning, leaving at least one person dead, officials said. The cause of the accident was not immediately known. The head of the country's firefighting service said that the plane skidded for a few hundred meters (yards), and photos showed smoke rising from a damaged structure in an area of barren trees. 'Residential infrastructure around the house was on fire, and the house was slightly damaged, but we managed to evacuate people,' said Renatas Požėla, chief of the Fire and Rescue Department. Lithuanian’s public broadcaster LRT, quoting an emergency official, said two people had been taken to the hospital after the crash, and one was later pronounced dead. The General Commissioner of the Lithuanian Police, Arūnas Paulauskas, told a news conference that the causes of the accident were not yet known. Authorities were investigating and Paulauska said officers when to the hospital to speak with the crew members being treated to gather information. The General Commissioner also said investigators are considering various possible causes, such technical failure and human error, and have not ruled out the possibility of a terrorist act. 'This is one of the versions that must be studied and checked,' Paulauskas said, according to LRT. The Lithuanian airport authority identified the aircraft as a DHL cargo plane arriving from Leipzig, Germany, which is a major freight hub. It posted on the social platform X that city services including a fire truck were on site. Flight-tracking data from FlightRadar24, analyzed by The Associated Press, showed the aircraft made a turn to the north of the airport, lining up for landing, before crashing a little more than 1.5 kilometers (1 mile) short of the runway. Authorities did not immediately offer a cause for the crash, which happened just before 5:30 a.m local time. Weather at the airport was around freezing temperature, with clouds before sunrise and winds around 30 kph (18 mph). DHL Group, headquartered in Bonn, Germany, did not immediately return a call for comment. The DHL aircraft was operated by Swiftair, a Madrid-based contractor. A representative from the company said it not have any immediate comment. The Boeing 737 was 31 years old, which is considered by experts to be an older airframe, though that’s not unusual for cargo flights. ___ An earlier version of this story incorrectly identified Renatas Požėla as the General Commission of Lithuanian police.

Lebanon's Shiite Muslims pay high price in war between Israel and Hezbollah	BEIRUT (AP) — The Lebanese civilians most devastated by the Israel- Hezbollah war are Shiite Muslims, and many of them believe they are being unfairly punished because they share a religious identity with Hezbollah militants and often live in the same areas. 'This is clear,' said Wael Murtada, a young Shiite man who anxiously watched paramedics search rubble after a recent Israeli airstrike destroyed his uncle’s two-story home and killed 10 people. 'Who else is being attacked?' Israel has concentrated its attacks on villages in southern and northeastern Lebanon and neighborhoods south of Beirut. This is where many Hezbollah militants operate from, and their families live side by side with large numbers of Shiites who aren’t members of the group. Israel insists its war is with Hezbollah and not the Lebanese people – or the Shiite faith. It says it only targets members of the Iran-backed militant group to try to end their yearlong campaign of firing rockets over the border. But Israel’s stated objectives mean little to people like Murtada as growing numbers of Shiite civilians also die in a war that escalated sharply in recent months. Shiites don’t just measure the suffering of their community in deaths and injuries. Entire blocks of the coastal city of Tyre have been flattened. Large parts of the historic market in the city of Nabatiyeh, which dates to the Ottoman era, have been destroyed. And in Baalbek, an airstrike damaged the city’s famed Hotel Palmyra, which opened in the late 19th century, and a home that dates to the Ottoman era. 'Lebanese Shias are being collectively punished. Their urban areas are being destroyed, and their cultural monuments and building are being destroyed,' said Mohanad Hage Ali, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut. As Shiites flee their war-torn villages and neighborhoods, the conflict is increasingly following them to other parts of Lebanon, and this is fueling tensions. Scores of people have been killed by Israeli airstrikes on Christian, Sunni and Druze areas where displaced Shiites had taken refuge. Many residents in these areas now think twice before providing shelter to displaced people out of fear they may have links to Hezbollah. 'The Israelis are targeting all of Lebanon,' said Wassef Harakeh, a lawyer from Beirut’s southern suburbs who in 2022 ran against Hezbollah in the country’s parliamentary elections and whose office was recently demolished by an Israeli airstrike. He believes part of Israel’s goal is to exacerbate frictions within the small Mediterranean country, which has a long history of sectarian fighting even though diverse groups live together peacefully these days. Some Shiites say statements from the Israeli military over the years have only reinforced suspicions that their wider community is being targeted as a means to put pressure on Hezbollah. One commonly cited example is the so-called Dahiyeh doctrine, which was first espoused by Israeli generals during the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war. It is a reference to the southern suburbs of Beirut where Hezbollah is headquartered and where entire residential blocks, bridges and shopping compounds were destroyed in both wars. Israel says Hezbollah hides weapons and fighters in such areas, turning them into legitimate military targets. A video released by the Israeli military last month has been interpreted by Shiites as further proof that little distinction is being made between Hezbollah fighters and Shiite civilians. Speaking from a southern Lebanese village he did not name, Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari called it 'a terror base. This is a Lebanese village, a Shiite village built by Hezbollah.' As he toured a house and showed stocks of hand grenades, rifles, night-vision goggles and other military equipment, Hagari said: 'Every house is a terror base.' Another army spokesperson disputed the notion that Israel tries to blur the line between combatants and civilians. 'Our war is with the terror group Hezbollah and not with the Lebanese population, whatever its origin,' said Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani. He denied that Israel was intentionally trying to disrupt the social fabric of Lebanon, and pointed to Israel’s evacuation warnings to civilians ahead of airstrikes as a step it takes to mitigate harm. Many Lebanese, including some Shiites, blame Hezbollah for their suffering, while also decrying Israel’s bombardments. Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel last year the day after Hamas attacked Israel and started the war in Gaza; this went against the group's promises to use its weapons only to defend Lebanon. Since last October, more than 3,500 people have been killed in Lebanon, and women and children accounted for more than 900 of the dead, according to the Health Ministry. More than 1 million people have been displaced from their homes. Shiites, who make up a third of Lebanon’s 5 million people, have borne the brunt of this suffering. Israel says it has killed well over 2,000 Hezbollah members in the past year. The death and destruction in Lebanon ramped up significantly in mid-September, when Israeli airstrikes began targeting Hezbollah’s leaders, and once again in early October, when Israeli ground troops invaded. Early in the war, Israeli airstrikes killed about 500 Hezbollah members but caused very little collateral damage. But since late September, airstrikes have destroyed entire buildings and homes, and in some cases killed dozens of civilians when the intended target was one Hezbollah member or official. On one particularly bloody day, Sept. 23, Israeli airstrikes killed almost 500 people and prompted hundreds of thousands of people – again, mostly Shiites -- to flee their homes in panic. Murtada’s relatives fled from Beirut’s southern suburbs in late September after entire blocks had been wiped out by airstrikes. They moved 22 kilometers (about 14 miles) east of the city, to the predominantly Druze mountain village of Baalchmay to stay in the home of Murtada’s uncle. Then, on Nov. 12, the home where they sought refuge was destroyed without warning. The airstrike killed nine relatives — three men, three women and three children — and a domestic worker, Murtada said. The Israeli army said the home was being used by Hezbollah. Murtada, who lost a grandmother and an aunt in the strike, said nobody in the home was connected to the militant group. Hezbollah has long boasted about its ability to deter Israel, but the latest war has proven otherwise and taken a severe toll on its leadership. Some Shiites fear the weakening of Hezbollah will lead to the entire community being sidelined politically once the war is over. But others believe it could offer a political opening for more diverse Shiite voices. Cease-fire negotiations to end the Israel-Hezbollah appear to have gained momentum over the past week. Some critics of Hezbollah say the group could have accepted months ago the conditions currently under consideration. This would have spared Lebanon 'destruction, martyrs and losses worth billions (of dollars),' Lebanese legislator Waddah Sadek, who is Sunni Muslim, wrote on X. _____ Associated Press writer Tia Goldenberg contributed to this report from Tel Aviv, Israel.	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-hezbollah-amal-shiites-2d242ffd84ea48d373cf6ef94399fb5c	2024-11-24T20:30:07-08:00	
Namibia may elect its first-ever female president in elections this week	OSHAKATI, Namibia (AP) — Namibia's Vice President Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah could become the country’s first female president if she wins the presidential election Wednesday. At least 1.4 million people, or about half of the population, have registered to vote in the elections, with 15 political parties running for president and seats in the National Assembly. Results from special early polls held for Namibia 's foreign missions, seamen and security services announced by the Electoral Commission of Namibia this month indicate Nandi-Ndaitwah and her party, the South West Africa People’s Organization, or SWAPO, are in the lead. SWAPO has governed the southwest African country since its independence from South Africa's apartheid minority government in 1990. But in 2019, the party lost its two-thirds majority in the National Assembly for the first time since 1994. Its dismal electoral performance has been widely attributed to allegations of corruption and money laundering in the Namibian fishing industry. Two cabinet ministers were arrested, and businessmen connected to the ministers were also convicted and imprisoned. Political analyst Henning Melber, a professor at the University of Pretoria and the University of the Free State, believes SWAPO and Nandi-Ndaitwah must take the 2019 election results as a warning even though they appear favored to win the elections. Melber said the party needs to attract support from younger voters who do not feel a link to the party's history of liberation struggles — a challenge also shared by Africa's other former liberation movements, such as South Africa's African National Congress. 'It looks like there is no way back to regain such dominance. The process of erosion of legitimacy as a former liberation movement has advanced too much,' he said. He added that the 'born-frees' — a term for children born after their country's liberation — will not vote based on emotions like the older generations did, but will do so based on delivery and governance. Nandi-Ndaitwah, 72, has promised to create more jobs and tackle the 20% unemployment rate for young people and graduates. She has pledged to spend approximately 85 billion Namibian dollars ($4.7 billion) over the next five years to create more than 500,000 jobs, a goal that her critics call unrealistic. Issues affecting women, including reproductive rights, equal pay and healthcare, are also likely to rank high for voters. If she becomes president, Nandi-Ndaitwah would follow in the footsteps of Liberia’s Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who made history when she became the continent’s first elected female president in 2005, as well as Malawi’s Joyce Banda and Samba Pranza of the Central African Republic. Erika Thomas, a political science lecturer at the University of Namibia, said should Nandi-Ndaitwah be elected as president of Namibia, she must strive to be independent, transparent and accountable. 'She must also try to push for policies and legislation frameworks for women participation and to bring more women into the political structures,' Thomas said. SWAPO will face competition from the Independent Patriots for Change, led by former dentist Panduleni Itula, and university professor Job Amupanda's Affirmative Repositioning party. Political parties contesting the elections wrapped up their campaigns with final rallies this weekend. Elections in southern Africa this year have delivered ground-breaking changes to the region's political landscape, with the ANC in South Africa losing its 30-year parliamentary majority and Botswana's Democratic Party getting unseated after 58 years in power. In Mauritius, considered one of the most stable democracies in Africa, the opposition won recent elections by a landslide. Disputed election results in Mozambique, which saw the ruling Frelimo party declared the winner, have led to ongoing protests that have seen at least 30 people killed.	https://apnews.com/article/namibia-president-election-6191f94f7294dd7d0bb9cb0b4d55b521	2024-11-24T20:19:30-08:00	
An average of 140 women and girls were killed by a partner or relative per day in 2023, the UN says	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The deadliest place for women is at home and 140 women and girls on average were killed by an intimate partner or family member per day last year, two U.N. agencies reported Monday. Globally, an intimate partner or family member was responsible for the deaths of approximately 51,100 women and girls during 2023, an increase from an estimated 48,800 victims in 2022, UN Women and the U.N. Office of Drugs and Crime said. The report released on the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women said the increase was largely the result of more data being available from countries and not more killings. But the two agencies stressed that 'Women and girls everywhere continue to be affected by this extreme form of gender-based violence and no region is excluded.' And they said, 'the home is the most dangerous place for women and girls.' UN Women’s Deputy Executive Director Nyaradzayi Gumbonzvanda told a news conference launching the report that women have been killed by their loved ones for a long time and the trend is continuing because underlying issues haven’t been addressed — especially gender stereotyping and social norms. 'This is killing which is associated with power over women,' she said, and it continues because of the continuing impunity for violent attacks against women. Gumbonzvanda, a Zimbabwean and longtime advocate for women’s rights, said there is 'a lot of perpetrator anonymity' when it comes to the killing of women by partners or family members because 'it means the family members have to bring justice against another family member.' UN Women is campaigning for those with economic and political power and for leaders in various traditions not to use their power to perpetuate violence. 'Power should be used to facilitate options for prevention,' she said. According to the report, the highest number of intimate partner and family killings was in Africa – with an estimated 21,700 victims in 2023. Africa also had the highest number of victims relative to the size of its population — 2.9 victims per 100,000 people, it said. There were also high rates last year in the Americas with 1.6 female victims per 100,000 and in Oceania with 1.5 per 100,000, it said. Rates were significantly lower in Asia at 0.8 victims per 100,000 and Europe at 0.6 per 100,000. According to the report, the intentional killing of women in the private sphere in Europe and the Americas is largely by intimate partners. By contrast, the vast majority of male homicides take place outside homes and families, it said. 'Even though men and boys account for the vast majority of homicide victims, women and girls continue to be disproportionately affected by lethal violence in the private sphere,' the report said. 'An estimated 80% of all homicide victims in 2023 were men while 20% were women, but lethal violence within the family takes a much higher toll on women than men, with almost 60% of all women who were intentionally killed in 2023 being victims of intimate partner/family member homicide,' it said. The report said that despite efforts to prevent the killing of women and girls by countries, their killings 'remain at alarmingly high levels.' 'They are often the culmination of repeated episodes of gender-based violence, which means they are preventable through timely and effective interventions,' the two agencies said.	https://apnews.com/article/un-killing-women-girls-partners-family-global-c2f26290b8158e1d97b1b16ef76e85a8	2024-11-24T20:11:52-08:00	
Stock market today: Asian shares mostly gain after Trump picks billionaire for Treasury post	BANGKOK (AP) — Shares climbed in Asia on Monday, tracking last week’s gains on Wall Street, and analysts said investors were viewing President-elect Donald Trump’s choice of billionaire investor Scott Bessent as his nominee for Treasury secretary as a relatively market-friendly choice. Bitcoin fell slightly and oil prices also declined, while U.S. futures advanced. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index gained 1.3% to 38,780.14 while the Kospi in Seoul rose 1.3% to 2,534.34. In Australia, the S&amp;P/ASX 200 picked up 0.3% to 8,417.60. In China, shares fell further, with the Shanghai Composite index giving up 0.4% to 3,253.28 and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong falling 0.3% to 19,172.07. China’s central bank kept the interest rate on the one-year medium-term lending facility unchanged at 2%. Shares in technology companies saw big declines, with online shopping platform Meituan falling 4% while multimedia and video games company Tencent dropped 1.5%. Taiwan's Taiex added 0.2% and the Sensex in India was up 1.4%. In Bangkok, the SET was nearly unchanged. This week will bring an update on consumer sentiment from the business group The Conference Board on Tuesday and key inflation data with the release Wednesday of the personal consumption expenditures index for October. The PCE is the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation and this will be the last PCE reading prior to a meeting of the Federal Reserve next month. On Friday, stocks closed higher on Wall Street as the market posted its fifth straight gain and the Dow Jones Industrial Average notched another record high, gaining 1% to close at 44,296.51. The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.3%, to 5,969.34 while the Nasdaq composite rose 0.2% to 19,003.65. The Russell 2000 index rose 1.8%. Markets have swung widely since the U.S. elections in November, and Trump's choices to head Treasury and other key positions that influence economic and financial policies were among the factors overhanging investor sentiment. Bessent, 62, is a hedge fund manager considered to be closely aligned with Wall Street. He is the founder of hedge fund Key Square Capital Management, after having worked on-and-off for Soros Fund Management since 1991. If confirmed by the Senate, he would be the nation’s first openly gay treasury secretary. The proposed choice was interpreted 'as a sign that President-elect Trump might adopt a more measured approach to tariffs and fiscal policy. Bessent’s influence is expected to bring nuanced economic strategies to the forefront, potentially easing concerns over abrupt policy shifts,' Stephen Innex of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary. Investors are watching for signs of some moderation in Trump's stance toward tariffs and other policies that might affect business both at home and overseas. But he said attention this week would likely focus more on the inflation data and what they might mean for interest rates, as the Fed holds its next policy meeting. A majority of stocks in the S&amp;P 500 gained ground, but those gains were kept in check by slumps for several big technology companies. Nvidia fell 3.2%. Its pricey valuation makes it among the heaviest influences on whether the broader market gains or loses ground. The company has grown into a nearly $3.6 trillion behemoth because of demand for its chips used in artificial-intelligence technology. Intuit, which makes TurboTax and other accounting software, fell 5.7%. It gave investors a quarterly earnings forecast that fell short of analysts’ expectations. Facebook owner Meta Platforms fell 0.7% following a decision by the Supreme Court to allow a multibillion-dollar class action investors’ lawsuit to proceed against the company. It stems from the privacy scandal involving the Cambridge Analytica political consulting firm. In the crypto market, bitcoin hovered around $98,000, according to CoinDesk. It has more than doubled this year and first surpassed the $99,000 level on Thursday. In other dealings early Monday, U.S. benchmark crude oil lost 51 cents to $70.73 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard, also fell 51 cents, to $74.12 per barrel. The U.S. dollar rose to 154.43 Japanese yen from 154.31 yen. The euro climbed to $1.0486 from $1.0475.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-bitcoin-bessent-adani-1bb840bd817b776e92192ec576ab0a76	2024-11-24T20:11:27-08:00	
Foreign ministers meet in Italy for the last G7 of the Biden administration	ROME (AP) — Foreign ministers from the world’s leading industrialized nations are meeting Monday, with the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East entering decisive phases and a certain pressure to advance diplomatic efforts ahead of the new U.S. administration taking over. Hopes for brokering a cease-fire in Gaza and Lebanon are foremost on the agenda of the Group of Seven meeting outside Rome that is gathering ministers from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. On the first day of the two-day gathering Monday, the G7 will be joined by ministers from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, as well as the Secretary General of the Arab League. 'With partners will be discussed ways to support efforts to reach a ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon, initiatives to support the population and the promotion of a credible political horizon for stability in the region,' the Italian foreign ministry said. The so-called 'Quint' grouping of the U.S., Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt and the UAE has been working to finalize a 'day after' plan for Gaza, and there is some urgency to make progress before the Trump administration takes over in January. President-elect Donald Trump is expected to pursue a policy that strongly favors Israel over the aspirations of the Palestinians. Host Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani added another item to the G7 agenda last week after the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his former defense minister and Hamas’ military chief. Italy is a founding member of the court and hosted the 1998 Rome conference that gave birth to it. But Italy’s right-wing government has been a strong supporter of Israel after the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks, while also providing humanitarian aid for Palestinians in Gaza. The Italian government has taken a cautious line, reaffirming its support and respect for the court but expressing concern that the warrants were politically motivated. 'There can be no equivalence between the responsibilities of the state of Israel and the terrorist organization of Hamas,' Premier Giorgia Meloni said, echoing the statement from U.S. President Joe Biden. Nathalie Tocci, director of the Rome-based Institute for International Affairs think tank, said Italy would be seeking to forge a united front on the ICC warrants, at least among the six G7 countries that are signatories of the court: everyone but the U.S. But in an essay this weekend in La Stampa newspaper, Tocci warned it was a risky move, since the U.S. tends to dictate the G7 line and has blasted the ICC warrants against Netanyahu as 'outrageous.' 'If Italy and the other (five G7) signatories of the ICC are unable to maintain the line on international law, they will not only erode it anyway but will be acting against our interests,' Tocci wrote, recalling Italy’s recourse to international law in demanding protection for Italian U.N. peacekeeepers who have come under fire in southern Lebanon. The other major talking point of the G7 meeting is Ukraine, and tensions have only heightened since Russia attacked Ukraine last week with an experimental, hypersonic ballistic missile that escalated the nearly 33-month-old war. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha is expected at the G7 in Fiuggi on Tuesday, and NATO and Ukraine are to hold emergency talks the same day in Brussels. Russian President Vladimir Putin said the strike was retaliation for Kyiv’s use of U.S. and British longer-range missiles capable of striking deeper into Russian territory. The G7 has been at the forefront of providing military and economic support for Ukraine since Russia’s invasion in February 2022 and G7 members are particularly concerned about how a Trump administration will change the U.S. approach. Trump has criticized the billions of dollars that the Biden administration has poured into Ukraine and has said he could end the war in 24 hours, comments that appear to suggest he would press Ukraine to surrender territory that Russia now occupies. Italy is a strong supporter of Ukraine and has backed the U.S. decision to allow Ukraine to strike Russia with U.S.-made, longer-range missiles. But Italy has invoked the country’s constitutional repudiation of war in declining to provide Ukraine with offensive weaponry to strike inside Russia and limiting its aid to anti-air defense systems to protect Ukrainian civilians. The G7 foreign ministers’ meeting, the second of the Italian presidency after ministers gathered in Capri in April, is being held in the medieval town of Fiuggi southeast of Rome, best known for its thermal spas. On Monday, which coincides with the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, ministers will attend the inauguration of a red bench meant to symbolize Italy’s focus on fighting gender-based violence. Over the weekend, tens of thousands of people marched in Rome to protest gender-based violence, which in Italy so far this year has claimed the lives of 99 women, according to a report last week by the Eures think tank.	https://apnews.com/article/italy-g7-ukraine-gaza-israel-87c0ce76ef6f4106bd8ced4056779a21	2024-11-24T20:06:51-08:00	
Uruguay’s leftist opposition candidate Yamandú Orsi becomes country's new president	MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay (AP) — Uruguay's leftist opposition candidate, Yamandú Orsi, became the country's new president in a tight runoff Sunday, ousting the conservative governing coalition and making the South American nation the latest to rebuke the incumbent party in a year of landmark elections worldwide. Even as the vote count continued, Álvaro Delgado, the presidential candidate for the center-right ruling coalition, conceded defeat to his challenger while surrounded by sullen-looking family members and colleagues. 'The country of liberty, equality and fraternity has triumphed once again,' Orsi said to sprawling crowds of supporters that waved flags and shouted their support. 'I will be the president who calls for national dialogue again and again, who builds a more integrated society and country.' As initial exit polls began showing Orsi, 57, a working-class former history teacher and two-time mayor from Uruguay’s Broad Front coalition, holding a lead over Delgado, cheers rang out across Montevideo’s beaches. Delgado told supporters gathered at his own party’s headquarters in the capital of Montevideo that he had lost. The crowd was hushed. 'With sadness, but without guilt, we can congratulate the winner,' he told them. 'But it's one thing to lose the elections and another to be defeated. We are not defeated,' he added, generating a burst of applause. A political heir to former President José 'Pepe' Mujica, an ex-Marxist guerilla who became a global icon for transforming Uruguay into one of the most liberal and environmentally sustainable nations in the region, Orsi rode to power on promises of safe change and nostalgia for his left-wing party's redistributive social policies. He struck a conciliatory tone, vowing to unite the nation of 3.4 million people after such a tight vote. 'Let’s understand that there is another part of our country who have different feelings today,' he said, as fireworks erupted over his stage overlooking the city's waterfront. 'These people will also have to help build a better country. We need them too.' With nearly all the votes counted, electoral officials reported that Orsi won 49.8% of the vote, ahead of Delgado’s 45.9%, a clear call after weeks in which the opponents appeared tied in polls. The rest cast blank votes or abstained in defiance of Uruguay’s enforced compulsory voting. Turnout in the nation with 2.7 million eligible voters reached almost 90%. Analysts say that the candidates' lackluster campaigns failed to entice apathetic young people and generated unusual levels of voter indecision. But with the rivals in broad consensus over key issues, the level-headed election was also emblematic of Uruguay's strong and stable democracy, free of the anti-establishment fury that has vaulted populist outsiders to power elsewhere, like the United States and neighboring Argentina. Orsi's win ushers in a return of the Broad Front that governed for 15 consecutive years until the 2019 election of center-right President Luis Lacalle Pou. 'I called Yamandú Orsi to congratulate him as President-elect of our country and to put myself at his service and begin the transition as soon as I deem it appropriate,' Lacalle Pou wrote on social media platform X. The opposition's upset was the latest sign that simmering discontent over post-pandemic economic malaise favors anti-incumbent candidates. In the many elections that took place during 2024, voters frustrated with the status quo have punished ruling parties from the U.S. and Britain to South Korea and Japan. But unlike elsewhere in the world, Orsi is a moderate with no plans for dramatic change. He largely agrees with his opponent on driving down the childhood poverty rate, now at a staggering 25%, and containing an upsurge in organized crime that has shaken the nation long considered among Latin America's safest. Orsi is also likely to scupper a trade agreement with China that Lacalle Pou pursued to the chagrin of Mercosur, an alliance of South American nations promoting regional commerce. Despite Orsi's promise to lead a 'new left' in Uruguay, his platform resembles the mix of market-friendly policies and welfare programs initiated under President Mujica and other Broad Front leaders. From 2005-2020, the coalition presided over a period of robust economic growth and pioneering social reforms that won widespread international acclaim, including the legalization of abortion, same-sex marriage and sale of marijuana. Mujica, now 89 and recovering from esophageal cancer, turned up at his local polling station before balloting even began on Sunday to praise Orsi’s humility and Uruguay’s proud stability. 'This is no small feat,' he said of his nation's 'citizenry that respects formal institutions.' Orsi, who for a decade served as mayor of Canelones — a town of beaches and cattle ranches also home to a Google data center and upstart tech scene — proposes tax incentives to lure investment and revitalize the critical agricultural sector. He supports security reforms that would lower the retirement age but fall short of a radical overhaul sought by Uruguay’s unions that failed to pass in the Oct. 27 general election. In that first round of voting — in which neither front-runner secured an outright majority — voters rejected generous pay-outs and the redistribution of privately managed pension funds in a rare gesture of fiscal constraint. 'He’s my candidate, not only for my sake but also for my children’s,' said Yeny Varone, a nurse at a polling station who voted for Orsi. 'In the future they’ll have better working conditions, health and salaries.' Delgado, 55, a rural veterinarian with a long career in the National Party, served most recently as Secretary of the Presidency for Lacalle Pou and campaigned under the slogan 're-elect a good government.' With inflation easing and the economy expected to expand by over 3% this year, Delgado promised to continue his predecessor’s pro-business policies. Lacalle Pou, who constitutionally cannot run for a second consecutive term, enjoyed high approval ratings, around 50%. Sunday's outcome showed Uruguayans' growing discontent with the government's failure to reverse a decade of sluggish economic growth and contain crime over the past five years. Some also attributed Delgado's loss to his lack of charisma and weak campaign strategy. 'Delgado struggled with communication defending the government’s agenda,' said Nicolás Saldías, a Latin America and Caribbean senior analyst for the London-based Economist Intelligence Unit. 'He was focused on criticizing the Frente Amplio (Broad Front) rather than giving a positive vision of what his government would do. It was a fear-based campaign that did not satisfy enough voters.' After such a suspense-filled, close race, Orsi said his win gave him a 'a strange feeling that I think takes a while to come to terms with.' 'Starting tomorrow, I'll have to work very hard,' he told The Associated Press from the glass-walled NH Columbia hotel, thronged exuberant friends and colleagues. 'There's a lot to do.' His government will take office on March 1, 2025. ___ Associated Press writer Isabel DeBre in Villa Tunari, Bolivia, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/uruguay-yamadu-orsi-elected-president-ab071b5afb2f94bcba8877d5e47c91cf	2024-11-24T20:04:00-08:00	
Social media sites call for Australia to delay its ban on children younger than 16	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — An advocate for major social media platforms told an Australian Senate committee Monday that laws to ban children younger than 16 from the sites should be delayed until next year at least instead of being rushed through the Parliament this week. Sunita Bose, managing director of Digital Industry Group Inc., an advocate for the digital industry in Australia including X, Instagram, Facebook and TikTok, was answering questions at a single-day Senate committee hearing into world-first legislation that was introduced into the Parliament last week. Bose said the Parliament should wait until the government-commissioned evaluation of age assurance technologies is completed in June. 'Parliament is asked to pass a bill this week without knowing how it will work,' Bose said. The legislation would impose fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) on platforms for systemic failures to prevent young children from holding accounts. It seems likely to be passed by Parliament by Thursday with the support of the major parties. It would take effect a year after the bill becomes law, allowing the platforms time to work out technological solutions that would also protect users’ privacy. Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said she looked forward to reading the Senate committee's assessment of the proposed law, which 'supports parents to say ‘no’' to children wanting to use social media. 'Social media in its current form is not a safe product for them,' Rowland told Parliament. 'Access to social media does not have to be the defining feature of growing up. There is more to life than constant notifications, endless scrolling and pressure to conform to the false and unrealistic perfectionism that can be served up by influencers,' she added. Bose received heated questions from several senators and challenges to the accuracy of her answers. Opposition Sen. Ross Cadell asked how his 10-year-old stepson was able to hold Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube accounts from the age of 8, despite the platforms setting a nominal age limit of 13. Bose replied that 'this is an area where the industry needs to improve.' She said the proposed social media ban risked isolating some children and driving children to 'darker, less safe online spaces' than mainstream platforms. Bose said her concern with the proposed law was that 'this could compromise the safety of young people,' prompting a hostile response from opposition Sen. Sarah Henderson. 'That’s an outrageous statement. You’re trying to protect the big tech giants,' Henderson said. Unaligned Sen. Jacqui Lambie asked why the platforms didn’t use their algorithms to prevent harmful material being directed to children. The algorithms have been accused of keeping technology-addicted children connected to platforms and of flooding users with harmful material that promotes suicide and eating disorders. 'Your platforms have the ability to do that. The only thing that’s stopping them is themselves and their greed,' Lambie said. Bose said algorithms were already in place to protect young people online through functions including filtering out nudity. 'We need to see continued investment in algorithms and ensuring that they do a better job at addressing harmful content,' Bose said. Questioned by opposition Sen. Dave Sharma, Bose said she didn’t know how much advertising revenue the platforms she represented made from Australian children. She said she was not familiar with research by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health that found X, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube and Snapchat made $11 billion in advertising from U.S. users under 18 in 2022. Communications department official Sarah Vandenbroek told the committee the evaluation of age assurance technologies that will report in June would assess not only their accuracy but also their security and privacy settings. Department Deputy Secretary James Chisholm said officials had consulted widely before proposing the age limit. 'We think it’s a good idea and it can be done,' Chisholm told the committee.	https://apnews.com/article/australia-social-media-ban-children-6f26c3177772270307c0c26a5221e64f	2024-11-24T18:55:39-08:00	
What to know about the plastic pollution treaty talks in South Korea	A last round of negotiations on a legally binding treaty to address the global scourge of plastic pollution has opened in Busan, South Korea. Here's what to know about it: Nations are deciding what actions they'll take National delegations still have a lot to hammer out before there is a treaty. Most contentious is whether there will be a limit on the amount of plastic that companies are allowed to produce. Led by Norway and Rwanda, 66 countries plus the European Union say they want to address the total plastic on Earth by controlling plastic design, production, consumption and what happens at the end of its life. Some plastic-producing and oil and gas countries, including Saudi Arabia, vigorously oppose such limits. Global plastics production is set to reach 736 million tons by 2040, up 70% from 2020, without policy changes, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Negotiators must also decide whether the treaty will reduce or eliminate single-use plastics. They'll have to resolve whether to end the use of hazardous chemicals in plastics and whether these steps will be mandated or merely encouraged. Their common objective is to protect human health and the environment. There are some things many countries agree on. They want provisions in a treaty to promote the redesign of plastic products so they can be recycled and reused. They want to invest to better manage plastic waste. They want to increase recycling rates and help waste pickers transition to safer jobs. There is agreement that there needs to be a mechanism to help countries pay for anything required of them. Environmental groups and Indigenous leaders want a holistic approach Graham Forbes, who is leading a Greenpeace delegation in Busan, said his group could support an agreement that puts sensible guardrails in place to reduce the amount of plastic produced, eliminates toxic chemicals and protects people from the uncontrolled use of plastics. That's achievable, but will take political leadership and courage not seen yet in earlier negotiations, he added. Frankie Orona, executive director of the Texas-based Society of Native Nations, said they demand a treaty that tackles the root causes of the crisis rather than just managing plastic waste. 'We must seize this moment and leave a legacy we can be proud of, with a non-toxic sustainable future for all children and our children's children,' he said. The plastics industry wants to focus on redesign, recycling and reuse Industry leaders want an agreement that prevents plastic pollution by redesigning plastics to be reused, recycled and remade into new products. They say this will keep the materials in circulation and out of the environment. Company executives said they'll support a treaty that recognizes plastics' benefits to society, while ending pollution. 'I would hate to miss this opportunity because we get fixated on issues that divide us rather than unite us in this purpose of ultimately addressing the issue of plastic pollution,' said Steve Prusak, president and CEO of Chevron Phillips Chemical Company.

In South Korea, nations meet in final round to address global plastic crisis	Negotiators gathered in Busan, South Korea, on Monday in a final push to create a treaty to address the global crisis of plastic pollution. It's the fifth time the world's nations convene to craft a legally binding plastic pollution accord. In addition to the national delegations, representatives from the plastics industry, scientists and environmentalists have come to shape how the world tackles the surging problem. 'We must end plastic pollution before plastic pollution ends us,' Kim Wansup, South Korea's minister of environment, said during the opening session. The planet is ' choking on plastic, ' according to the United Nations. It's polluting lakes, rivers, oceans and people's bodies. 'Don’t kick the can, or the plastic bottle, down the road,' U.N. Environment Programme Executive Director Inger Andersen said in a message to negotiators. This 'is an issue about the intergenerational justice of those generations that will come after us and be living with all this garbage. We can solve this and we must get it done in Busan,' she said in an interview. The previous four global meetings have revealed sharp differences in goals and interests. This week's talks go through Saturday. Led by Norway and Rwanda, 66 countries plus the European Union say they want to address the total amount of plastic on Earth by controlling design, production, consumption and where plastic ends up. The delegation from the hard-hit island nation of Micronesia helped lead an effort to call more attention to 'unsustainable' plastic production, called the Bridge to Busan. Island nations are grappling with vast amounts of other countries’ plastic waste washing up on their shores. 'We think it’s the heart of the treaty, to go upstream and to get to the problem at its source,' said Dennis Clare, legal advisor and plastics negotiator for Micronesia. 'There’s a tagline, ‘You can’t recycle your way out of this problem.’' Some plastic-producing and oil and gas countries, including Saudi Arabia, disagree. They vigorously oppose any limits on plastic manufacturing. Most plastic is made from fossil fuels. Saudi Arabia is the world’s largest exporter of primary polypropylene, a common type of plastic, accounting for an estimated 17% of exports last year, according to the Plastics Industry Association. China, the United States and Germany led the global plastics trade by exports and imports in 2023, the association said. The plastics industry has been advocating for a treaty focused on redesigning plastic products, recycling and reuse, sometimes referred to as 'circularity.' Chris Jahn, International Council of Chemical Associations secretariat, said negotiators should focus on ending plastic waste in the environment, not plastic production, to get a deal. Many countries won’t join a treaty if it includes production caps, he said. To continue to progress and grow as a global economy, there are going to be more plastics, Jahn added. 'So we should strive then to keep those plastics in the economy and out of the environment,' Jahn said. The United States delegation at first said countries should develop their own plans to act, a position viewed as favoring industry. It changed its position this summer, saying the U.S. is open to considering global targets for reductions in plastic production. Environmental groups accused the U.S. of backtracking as negotiations approached. Center for Coalfield Justice executive director Sarah Martik said the United States is standing on the sidelines rather than leading, putting 'their thumb on the scale throughout the entirety of the negotiations.' She hopes this does not derail other countries’ ambition. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency released a national strategy to prevent plastic pollution Thursday, but Martik said she thinks too many of the measures are voluntary to make a difference. Democratic U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley, of Oregon, said it's a mistake for the United States to settle for the lowest common denominator proposals, just to get some kind of agreement. Luis Vayas Valdivieso, the committee chair from Ecuador, recently proposed text for sections where he thinks the delegations could agree. The production and use of plastics globally is set to reach 736 million tons by 2040, up 70% from 2020, without policy changes, according to the intergovernmental Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Research published in Science this month found it is still possible to nearly end plastic pollution. The policies that make the most difference are: mandating new products be made with 40% post-consumer recycled plastic; limiting new plastic production to 2020 levels; investing significantly in plastic waste management, such as landfills and waste collection services and implementing a small fee on plastic packaging. The treaty is the only way to solve plastic pollution at this scale, said Douglas McCauley, professor at UC Santa Barbara and UC Berkeley. McCauley co-led the research. Margaret Spring, chief conservation and science officer for Monterey Bay Aquarium, said plastic pollution used to be considered largely a waste problem. Now it is widely viewed as an existential crisis that must be addressed, said Spring, who represents the International Science Council at the negotiations. 'I’ve never seen people’s understanding of this issue move as fast, given how complex the topic is,' she said. 'It gives me hope that we can actually start moving the dial.' ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Russian plane catches fire after landing in Turkey but passengers and crew are safely evacuated	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — The engine of a Russian plane with 95 people on board caught fire after landing at Antalya airport in southern Turkey on Sunday, Turkey’s transportation ministry said. All passengers and crew were safely evacuated. The Sukhoi Superjet 100 type aircraft run by Azimuth Airlines had taken off from Sochi and was carrying 89 passengers and six crew members, the ministry said in a statement. The pilot made an emergency call after the aircraft landed at 9:34 p.m. local time, and airport rescue and firefighting crews quickly extinguished the fire, according to the statement. No one was hurt, the statement said. The cause of the fire was not immediately known. A video of the incident posted by the aviation news website, Airport Haber, showed flames coming out from the left side of the plane as emergency crews doused the aircraft. Passengers were seen evacuating the plane through an emergency slide, some carrying belongings. The transportation ministry said efforts were underway to remove the aircraft from the runway. Arrivals at the airport were temporarily suspended while departures were taking place from a military-run runway.	https://apnews.com/article/russian-plane-engine-fire-turkey-antalya-airport-6902c0c034a39eee746955b6ae08b4d8	2024-11-24T13:09:53-08:00	
Rainbow-clad revelers hit Copacabana beach for Rio de Janeiro’s pride parade	RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Thousands of revelers gathered alongside Copacabana beach for Rio de Janeiro’s annual pride parade on Sunday, many scantily dressed and covered in glitter. Rainbow-colored flags, towels and fans abounded among the crowd mostly made up of young people who danced and sang along to music blaring from speakers. While the atmosphere was festive, some spoke of the threat of violence LGBTQ+ people face in Brazil. 'As the sister of a trans woman, I’m scared to death,' said Helen Karajá, a 32-year-old bisexual artist. At least 230 LGBTQ+ Brazilians were victims of violent deaths in 2023, according to the umbrella watchdog group Observatory of LGBTI+ deaths and violence in Brazil. And more trans people — 100 — were murdered in Brazil last year than in any other country, according to Transgender Europe, a network of global non-profits that tracks the data. To be sure, life for gay people is safer now than it used to be, said Carlos da Cunha, a 71-year-old hairdresser. 'In the past, people had to go to ghettos to meet people, because you couldn’t just be anywhere,' said da Cunha. 'Now, we can walk down the street without being attacked, without being insulted or humiliated.' One of the themes of this year’s pride march was sustainability. 'Environmental justice will only be possible with racial and social justice, gender equality and sexual diversity' read one banner attached to a truck. Brazil has faced a series of environmental catastrophes this year, including record drought in the Amazon rainforest, floods in the southern Rio Grande do Sul state, and wildfires across the country. 'If we can’t respect the environment, how can we respect others?' said Alexia Soutinho, a 23-year-old student who identifies as pansexual and lives in the Cidade de Deus favela.	https://apnews.com/article/brazil-lgbtq-pride-parade-9ec61bf3f3727cb238040234d1227653	2024-11-24T13:04:20-08:00	
Heavy rains in Bolivia send mud crashing into the capital, leaving 1 missing and destroying homes	LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) — A landslide caused by heavy rains after a prolonged drought in La Paz, the capital of Bolivia, flooded dozens of homes early Sunday, local authorities said. It swept away a young girl, spurred evacuations and left parts of the city without electricity. Torrential rain on Saturday caused a river to spill its banks, dislodging mud from a southwestern La Paz neighborhood where low-slung, shoddily built dwellings dot the hillside. The torrent of rocks and soil surged down a narrow ravine early Sunday, wrecking some two dozen homes and flooding another 40, said Juan Carlos Calvimontes, Bolivia's deputy civil defense minister. 'I lost my workshop and the cars that I had there are buried,' said auto mechanic Luis Mencias, his voice shaking as he surveyed the sea of debris. Hours after the rain subsided, rescuers were still searching for a missing 5-year-old girl in the inundated neighborhood of Bajo Llojeta. Emergency workers trudged through the boot-sucking mud on Sunday, pulling at least six residents — suffering from hypothermia, their hair matted with sludge — from the collapsed hillside. Soldiers helped clear mud from the streets. 'My daughter was with her cousins ​​when the mud came,' said Grover Mendoza, the missing girl's father. 'The neighbors rescued my nephews but my daughter was missing.' The mayor of La Paz, Iván Arias, directly blamed the poor construction of houses perched on the hillside without permits. 'There are irresponsible people who destabilize the hillside and the rains drag it away, affecting the lower-lying neighborhoods,' he said. In a visit to the site, President Luis Arce delivered aid to flood victims and vowed to hold people responsible for the illegal construction that exacerbated the damage. 'We are shocked by what happened,' he said. 'This cannot be left like this. An investigation must be carried out.' The city of La Paz, nestled in a valley surrounded by high hills, is particularly prone to floods and landslides. Bolivia's rainy season is just starting after the nation suffered one of its most severe droughts in recent memory.	https://apnews.com/article/bolivia-landslide-flood-drought-president-la-paz-5ae0961573f4585173624bdacf076799	2024-11-24T12:38:33-08:00	
South African dissident writer and poet Breyten Breytenbach dies at 85	JOHANNESBURG (AP) — South African writer and poet Breyten Breytenbach, a staunch opponent of the former white-minority government’s apartheid policy of racial oppression, has died in Paris, his family announced on Sunday. He was 85. Breytenbach was a celebrated wordsmith, a leading voice in literature in Afrikaans — an offshoot of Dutch that was developed by white settlers — and a fierce critic of apartheid that was imposed against the country's Black majority between 1948 and 1990. He moved to Paris but on a clandestine trip to his home country in 1975 he was arrested on allegations that he assisted Nelson Mandela’s then-outlawed African National Congress group in its sabotage campaign against the white-minority government. He was convicted of treason and served seven years in prison. Upon his release he based himself in Paris, where he continued his anti-apartheid activism. Breytenbach is best known for 'Confessions of an Albino Terrorist,' his account of his imprisonment and the events leading to it. His work addressed themes of exile, identity and justice, his family said in a statement on Sunday. 'Known for his masterful poetry collections in Afrikaans, as well as autobiographical works such as ‘The True Confessions of an Albino Terrorist’ and ‘A Season in Paradise,' he fearlessly addressed themes of exile, identity and justice,' his family said in a statement. Breytenbach was a poet, novelist, painter and activist whose work touched on and influenced literature and the arts both domestically and abroad, his family added. He was born in the Western Cape province in 1939, but spent much of his life abroad. He joined Okhela, an ideological wing of South Africa’s African National Congress, in exile, but remained deeply connected to his South African roots. He is survived by his wife, Yolande, daughter Daphnée and two grandsons.	https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-author-obit-08446f42348f869d7aab4fda6855f473	2024-11-24T11:21:16-08:00	
Jannik Sinner leads Italy past the Netherlands for its second consecutive Davis Cup title	MALAGA, Spain (AP) — Italy went nearly a quarter-century without winning the Davis Cup. Then along came Jannik Sinner, and now the country is celebrating its second consecutive title. The No. 1-ranked Sinner clinched the championship in the annual team event and capped his breakthrough season by beating Tallon Griekspoor 7-6 (2), 6-2 on Sunday for a 2-0 win over the Netherlands in the final of the Davis Cup. 'Coming back as defending champions and winning again — it’s one of the best feelings I think for all of us,' Sinner said. 'We are very happy to lift this trophy and, of course, also to go into the preseason with a bunch of confidence boosts.' Matteo Berrettini put Italy ahead with a 6-4, 6-2 victory over Botic van de Zandschulp — the last man to beat Rafael Nadal — in the opening singles match on an indoor hard court at the Palacio de Deportes Jose Maria Martin Carpena in southern Spain. The Italians, backed by a loud contingent of singing fans playing drums and armed with megaphones in the crowd of 9,200, became the first team to win the Davis Cup twice in a row since the Czech Republic in 2012 and 2013. Italy’s women won the Billie Jean King Cup by defeating Slovakia on Wednesday. 'They make us even more proud,' Davis Cup captain Filippo Volandri said. After Sinner finished off his win, Berrettini and other teammates rushed onto the court to begin the party, wrapping their arms around one another and bouncing in unison. Volandri grabbed Sinner and lifted him off the ground. It was clear who was key to this success. Sinner went 4-0 in Malaga, including a victory in doubles with Berrettini against Argentina in the quarterfinals. Berrettini played a vital role, too, after replacing Lorenzo Musetti for singles. Berrettini was the runner-up at Wimbledon in 2021 but since then went through a series of injuries and illnesses that have limited his playing time. He has spoken about the mental challenges he faced. 'I didn’t miss the wins or the losses,' Berrettini said. 'I missed these moments.' He needed some time to find his groove against the 80th-ranked van de Zandschulp. But Berrettini took control by grabbing the opening set’s last three games, and Sinner left his front-row seat behind Italy’s bench to head to the locker room and prepare to close the deal. He hit 15 aces against the 40th-ranked Griekspoor and stretched his unbeaten streak in tour-level singles competition to 14 matches and 26 sets, including a title at the ATP Finals a week ago. Sinner's ascension is one of the year’s biggest stories in tennis. He went 73-6 with eight singles titles in 2024, with his first two Grand Slam trophies at the Australian Open and the U.S. Open. The latter came shortly after he was cleared of wrongdoing in a doping case connected to two positive tests for steroids in March; the World Anti-Doping Agency’s appeal of that ruling is still pending. The Netherlands reached the Davis Cup final for the first time. 'We believed,' Dutch captain Paul Haarhuis said about the Italians, 'we could beat them.' Until last year, Italy’s only Davis Cup triumph came in 1976. So Volandri said he told his players to think of their goal this way: 'We want to make history.' Griekspoor, who fell to 0-6 against Sinner, held his own until the first-set tiebreaker, which was preceded by dueling chants of 'Italia! Italia!' and 'Let’s go, Tallon! Let’s go!' Sinner was steadier, more ready for the moment, and he built a substantial lead before ending it with an ace. From 2-all in the second set, Sinner wouldn't drop another game. Soon, he was joining Berrettini, Volandri, Musetti and the rest of the squad in raising the silver hardware that once again belongs to them. ___ AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis	https://apnews.com/article/davis-cup-italy-netherlands-score-8598505b0cb4a4ac160ed9dc84c15056	2024-11-24T07:41:56-08:00	
US Air Force says drones spotted near 3 bases in England last week	LONDON (AP) — The U.S. Air Force says a number of small drones were detected last week around three bases in eastern England that are used by American forces. The drones were spotted between Wednesday and Friday near RAF Lakenheath, RAF Mildenhall and RAF Feltwell. They were actively monitored after they were seen in the vicinity of and over the three bases, U.S. Air Forces Europe said in a statement. The Air Force didn’t identify who was behind the incursions, but said base officials determined there was no impact on residents or critical infrastructure. Lakenheath is home to the 48th Fighter Wing, which the U.S. Air Force describes as the foundation of its combat capability in Europe. Mildenhall hosts the 100th Air Refueling Wing, and Feltwell is a hub for housing, schools and other services. 'To protect operational security, we do not discuss our specific force protection measures but retain the right to protect the installation,' the Air Force said. 'We continue to monitor our airspace and are working with host-nation authorities and mission partners to ensure the safety of base personnel, facilities and assets.' While it is unclear whether the drones had hostile intent, the incidents came during a week that saw the most significant escalation of hostilities in Ukraine since Russia’s full-scale invasion nearly three years ago. For the first time, Ukraine struck targets inside Russia with intermediate range missiles supplied by the U.S. and Britain after President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Keir Starmer authorized use of the weapons. In response, Russia launched a new intermediate range ballistic missile at Ukraine, and President Vladimir Putin said his country had the right to strike nations that allow their weapons to be used against Russia. Lakenheath, Mildenhall and Feltwell, located close to one another in the counties of Suffolk and Norfolk, are Royal Air Force bases used primarily by the U.S. Air Force. Britain’s Ministry of Defense said 'we take threats seriously and maintain robust measures' at military installations. 'This includes counter drone security capabilities. We won’t comment further on security procedures,' it said.	https://apnews.com/article/britain-drones-lakenheath-mildenhallus-air-force-900b88ab9c37393ea7d619c9d35e4b9a	2024-11-24T04:34:52-08:00	
Police in Jordan kill a gunman in a shootout near the Israeli Embassy	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) — Police in Jordan shot and killed a man after he opened fire near the Israeli Embassy early on Sunday, authorities said. Three police officers were wounded in the shootout in the Rabiah neighborhood of the capital, Amman. Authorities did not identify the shooter or say what his motive was. Jordan is a close Western ally that made peace with Israel in 1994. But Israel's devastating offensive in the Gaza Strip, launched after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack, has strained relations. Jordan has a large Palestinian population and has seen repeated protests outside the Israeli Embassy, with demonstrators sometimes clashing with police. Jordan’s Public Security Directorate said in a statement that police pursued the gunman after he opened fire in the area. 'He was chased and surrounded, so he started firing gunshots at the security force, which in turn applied the rules of engagement, which resulted in the killing of the perpetrator,' the statement said. A retired Jordanian soldier killed three Israelis in September when he opened fire at the border crossing between Jordan and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The gunman, Maher al-Jazi, was shot dead by Israeli security forces. ___ Find more of AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/jordan-israel-palestinians-hamas-war-shooting-5d0d2792fd32b1d43d2d4fcb1cda508c	2024-11-24T02:35:20-08:00	
Israeli strike kills Lebanese soldier and wounds 18 as Hezbollah fires rockets at Israel	BEIRUT (AP) — An Israeli strike on a Lebanese army center on Sunday killed one soldier and wounded 18 others, the Lebanese military said. The Hezbollah militant group meanwhile fired around 160 rockets and other projectiles into northern and central Israel, wounding at least five people. Israeli strikes have killed over 40 Lebanese troops since the start of the war between Israel and Hezbollah, even as Lebanon's military has largely kept to the sidelines. The Israeli military expressed regret over the strike, saying it occurred in an area of ongoing combat operations against Hezbollah. It said in a statement that its operations are directed solely against Hezbollah and not the Lebanese military, and that the strike was under review. Lebanon's caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, condemned it as an assault on U.S.-led cease-fire efforts, calling it a 'direct, bloody message rejecting all efforts and ongoing contacts' to end the war. '(Israel is) again writing in Lebanese blood a brazen rejection of the solution that is being discussed,' a statement from his office read. The strike occurred in southwestern Lebanon on the coastal road between Tyre and Naqoura, where there has been heavy fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. Hezbollah fires rockets after strikes on Beirut Hezbollah began firing rockets, missiles and drones into Israel after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack out of the Gaza Strip ignited the war there. Hezbollah has portrayed the attacks as an act of solidarity with the Palestinians and Hamas. Iran supports both armed groups. Israel has launched retaliatory airstrikes since the rocket fire began, and in September the low-level conflict erupted into all-out war, as Israel launched waves of airstrikes across large parts of Lebanon and killed Hezbollah's top leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and several of his top commanders. Hezbollah fired a total of around 160 rockets and other projectiles into Israel on Sunday, some of which were intercepted, the Israeli military said. Israel’s Magen David Adom rescue service said it was treating two people in the central city of Petah Tikva, a 23-year-old man who was lightly wounded by a blast and a 70-year-old woman suffering from smoke inhalation from a car that caught fire. The first responders said they treated three other people in northern Israel, closer to the border, including a 60-year-old man in serious condition. It was unclear whether the injuries and damage were caused by the rockets or interceptors. Israeli airstrikes early Saturday pounded central Beirut, killing at least 20 people and wounding 66, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry. Israeli attacks have killed more than 3,500 people in Lebanon, according to Lebanon’s Health Ministry. The fighting has displaced about 1.2 million people, or a quarter of Lebanon’s population. On the Israeli side, about 90 soldiers and nearly 50 civilians have been killed by bombardments in northern Israel and in battle following Israel's ground invasion in early October. Around 60,000 Israelis have been displaced from the country's north. EU envoy calls for pressure on both sides to reach a truce The Biden administration has spent months trying to broker a cease-fire, and U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein was back in the region last week. The European Union’s top diplomat called for more pressure on both Israel and Hezbollah to reach a deal, saying one was 'pending with a final agreement from the Israeli government.' Josep Borrell spoke Sunday after meeting with Mikati and Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, a Hezbollah ally who has been mediating with the group. Borrell said the EU is ready to allocate 200 million euros ($208m) to assist the Lebanese military, which would deploy additional forces to the south. The emerging agreement would pave the way for the withdrawal of Hezbollah militants and Israeli troops from southern Lebanon below the Litani River in accordance with the U.N. Security Council resolution that ended the 2006 war. Lebanese troops would patrol the area, with the presence of U.N. peacekeepers. Lebanon's army reflects the religious diversity of the country and is respected as a national institution, but it does not have the military capability to impose its will on Hezbollah or resist Israel's invasion. ___ Goldenberg reported from Tel Aviv, Israel. ___ Find more of AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-lebanon-hezbollah-iran-news-11-24-2024-c91698370339e689edb6423abb3ed392	2024-11-24T02:32:43-08:00	
Moscow offers debt forgiveness to new recruits and AP sees wreckage of a new Russian missile	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a law granting debt forgiveness to new army recruits who enlist to fight in Ukraine. The measure, whose final version appeared on a government website Saturday, underscores Russia’s needs for military personnel in the nearly 3-year-old war, even as it fired last week a new intermediate-range ballistic missile. According to Russian state news agency Interfax, the new legislation allows those signing up for a one-year contract to write off bad debts of up to 10 million rubles ($96,000). The law applies to debts for which a court order for collection was issued and enforcement proceedings had commenced before Dec. 1, 2024. It also applies to the spouses of new recruits. Russia has ramped up military recruitment by offering increasing financial incentives, in some cases several times the average salary, to those willing to fight in Ukraine. The strategy has allowed the military to boost its ranks in the conflict zone while avoiding another mobilization order. A 'partial mobilization' in September 2022 sparked an exodus of tens of thousands of Russian men, who fled the country to avoid enlistment. The intense and drawn-out war has strained Russian resources. Putin in September called for the military to increase its troops by 180,000. The U.S., South Korea and Ukraine say North Korea sent more than 10,000 troops to Russia in October, some of whom have recently begun engaging in combat on the front lines, piling more pressure on Ukraine’s also weary and overstretched army. The push for recruits coincides with a new intermediate-range ballistic missile the Kremlin fired at Ukraine on Thursday. Putin said it was in response to Kyiv’s use of American and British missiles capable of striking deeper into Russia. Ukraine’s Security Service showed The Associated Press on Sunday wreckage of the new experimental ballistic missile, which struck a factory in the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro. The fragments of the missile called Oreshnik – Russian for hazel tree, and which the Pentagon said is based on Russia’s RS-26 Rubezh intercontinental ballistic missile – have not been analyzed yet, according to security officials on site in an undisclosed location in Ukraine. The AP and other media were able to see the fragments before they were taken by investigators. Charred, mangled wires and an ashy airframe the size of a large snow tire was all that remained of the weapon, which can carry either conventional or nuclear warheads. 'It should be noted that this is the first time that the remains of such a missile have been discovered on the territory of Ukraine,' said an expert with Ukraine’s Security Service, who identified himself only by his first name Oleh because he wasn't authorized to discuss the issue with the media. Ukraine’s Main Intelligence Directorate said the missile was fired from the 4th Missile Test Range, Kapustin Yar, in Russia’s Astrakhan region and flew for 15 minutes before striking Dnipro. The missile had six warheads, each carrying six submunitions. The peak speed was 11 Mach. Meanwhile, Moscow sent 73 drones into Ukraine overnight into Sunday. According to Ukraine’s air force, 50 drones were destroyed and four lost, likely having been electronically jammed. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Sunday that Russian forces over the past week had struck Ukraine with more than 800 guided aerial bombs, about 460 attack drones and more than 20 missiles. In Russia, the Defense Ministry said that 34 Ukrainian drones were shot down overnight into Sunday in four regions of western Russia, including Kursk, Lipetsk, Belgorod and one over the Oryol region. ___ Morton reported from London. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-recruits-missile-fb6c3fdd0e63d2c757bbf95fefcc2e31	2024-11-24T02:28:00-08:00	
Australia withdraws a misinformation bill after critics compare it to censorship	CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — Australia's government has withdrawn a bill that would give a media watchdog power to monitor digital platforms and require them to keep records about misinformation and disinformation on their networks. Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said Sunday that the government was unable to drum up the support needed to pass the legislation. The opposition spokesman, David Coleman, said the bill 'betrayed our democracy' and amounted to 'censorship laws in Australia.' 'Based on public statements and engagements with senators, it is clear that there is no pathway to legislate this proposal through the Senate,' Rowland said. The bill would have granted the Australian Communications and Media Authority power over digital platforms by approving an enforceable code of conduct or standards for social media companies if self-regulation fell short. 'This bill would have had the effect of suppressing the free speech of everyday Australians, as platforms would have censored online content to avoid the threat of big fines,' Coleman said said in a statement.	https://apnews.com/article/australia-misinformation-bill-tech-1625518609bcc407c63c9934b6a2a848	2024-11-24T01:21:25-08:00	
Israel says rabbi who went missing in the UAE was killed	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel said Sunday that the body of an Israeli-Moldovan rabbi who went missing in the United Arab Emirates has been found after he was killed in what it described as a 'heinous antisemitic terror incident.' The statement from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Israel 'will act with all means to seek justice with the criminals responsible for his death.' Israeli authorities did not say how they determined the killing of Zvi Kogan was a terror attack and offered no additional details. Kogan, 28, an ultra-Orthodox rabbi who went missing on Thursday, ran a Kosher grocery store in the futuristic city of Dubai, where Israelis have flocked for commerce and tourism since the two countries forged diplomatic ties in the 2020 Abraham Accords. The agreement has held through more than a year of soaring regional tensions unleashed by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack into southern Israel. But Israel's devastating retaliatory offensive in Gaza and its invasion of Lebanon, after months of fighting with the Hezbollah militant group, have stoked anger among Emiratis, Arab nationals and others living in the the UAE. Iran, which supports Hamas and Hezbollah, has also been threatening to retaliate against Israel after a wave of airstrikes Israel carried out in October in response to an Iranian ballistic missile attack. The Emirati government did not respond to a request for comment. However, senior Emirati diplomat Anwer Gargash wrote on the social platform X in Arabic on Sunday that 'the UAE will remain a home of safety, an oasis of stability, a society of tolerance and coexistence and a beacon of development, pride and advancement.' Early Sunday, the UAE’s state-run WAM news agency acknowledged Kogan’s disappearance but pointedly did not acknowledge he held Israeli citizenship, referring to him only as being Moldovan. The Emirati Interior Ministry described Kogan as being 'missing and out of contact.' 'Specialized authorities immediately began search and investigation operations upon receiving the report,' the Interior Ministry said. Netanyahu told a regular Cabinet meeting later Sunday that he was 'deeply shocked' by Kogan's disappearance and death. He said he appreciated the cooperation of the UAE in the investigation and that ties between the two countries would continue to be strengthened. Israel's largely ceremonial president, Isaac Herzog, condemned the killing and thanked Emirati authorities for 'their swift action.' He said he trusts they 'will work tirelessly to bring the perpetrators to justice.' Israel also again warned against all nonessential travel to the Emirates after Kogan's killing. 'There is concern that there is still a threat against Israelis and Jews in the area,' a government warning issued Sunday said. Kogan was an emissary of the Chabad Lubavitch movement, a prominent and highly observant branch of ultra-Orthodox Judaism based in Brooklyn's Crown Heights neighborhood in New York City. It said he was last seen in Dubai. The UAE has a burgeoning Jewish community, with synagogues and businesses catering to kosher diners. The Rimon Market, a Kosher grocery store that Kogan managed on Dubai’s busy Al Wasl Road, was shut Sunday. As the wars have roiled the region, the store has been the target of online protests by supporters of the Palestinians. Mezuzahs on the front and back doors of the market appeared to have been ripped off when an Associated Press journalist stopped by on Sunday. Kogan’s wife, Rivky, is a U.S. citizen who lived with him in the UAE. She is the niece of Rabbi Gavriel Holtzberg, who was killed in the 2008 Mumbai attacks. The UAE is an autocratic federation of seven sheikhdoms on the Arabian Peninsula and is also home to Abu Dhabi. Local Jewish officials in the UAE declined to comment. While the Israeli statement did not mention Iran, Iranian intelligence services have carried out past kidnappings in the UAE. Western officials believe Iran runs intelligence operations in the UAE and keeps tabs on the hundreds of thousands of Iranians living across the country. Iran is suspected of kidnapping and later killing British Iranian national Abbas Yazdi in Dubai in 2013, though Tehran has denied involvement. Iran also kidnapped Iranian German national Jamshid Sharmahd in 2020 from Dubai, taking him back to Tehran, where he was executed in October. ___ Gambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates	https://apnews.com/article/israel-uae-rabbi-missing-98953265dcba8329803ae87d70462117	2024-11-23T22:17:16-08:00	
Pakistan partially stops mobile and internet services ahead of pro-Imran Khan protest	ISLAMABAD (AP) — Pakistan on Sunday suspended mobile and internet services 'in areas with security concerns' as supporters of imprisoned former premier Imran Khan geared up for a protest in the capital. The government and Interior Ministry posted the announcement on social media platform X, which is banned in Pakistan. They did not specify the areas, nor did they say how long the suspension would be in place. 'Internet and mobile services will continue to operate as usual in the rest of the country,' the posts said. Meanwhile, telecom company Nayatel sent out emails offering customers 'a reliable landline service' as a workaround in the areas suffering suspended cellphone service. Khan has been in prison for more than a year and has over 150 criminal cases against him. But he remains popular and his political party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf or PTI, says the cases are politically motivated. His supporters rely heavily on social media to demand his release and use messaging platforms like WhatsApp to share information, including details of events. Pakistan has already sealed off capital Islamabad with shipping containers and shut down major roads and highways connecting the city with PTI strongholds in the provinces of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. PTI spokesperson Sheikh Waqas Akram said Khan's wife Bushra Bibi was traveling to Islamabad in a convoy led by the chief minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Ali Amin Gandapur. 'She cannot leave the party workers on their own,' said Akram. In the eastern city of Lahore, police arrested PTI members while bystanders navigated their way through blockades. There was a more festive mood in Peshawar, with PTI members dancing, drumming and holding up pictures of Khan as cars set off for Islamabad. The government is imposing social media platform bans and targeting VPN services, according to internet advocacy group Netblocks. On Sunday, the group said live metrics showed WhatsApp backends are restricted in Pakistan, affecting media sharing on the app. The U.S. Embassy issued a security alert for Americans in the capital, encouraging them to avoid large gatherings and warning that even 'peaceful gatherings can turn violent.' Last month, authorities suspended the cellphone service in Islamabad and Rawalpindi to thwart a pro-Khan rally. The shutdown disrupted communications and affected everyday services such as banking, ride-hailing and food delivery. The latest crackdown comes on the eve of a visit by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said authorities have sealed off the city’s Red Zone, which houses key government buildings and is the destination for Khan's supporters. 'Anyone reaching it will be arrested,' Naqvi told a press conference. He said the security measures were in place to protect residents and property, blaming the PTI for inconveniencing people and businesses. He added that protesters were planning to take the same route as the Belarusian delegation, but that the government had headed off this scenario. Naqvi denied cellphone services were suspended and said only mobile data was affected. —- Associated Press writer Riaz Khan in Peshawar, Pakistan contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-imran-khan-rally-cellphone-suspension-415227ef93b710798dedbc6c9f8ac2a5	2024-11-23T21:13:03-08:00	
Israel cracks down on Palestinian citizens who speak out against the war in Gaza	UMM AL-FAHM, Israel (AP) — Israel’s yearlong crackdown against Palestinian citizens who speak out against the war in Gaza is prompting many to self-censor out of fear of being jailed and further marginalized in society, while some still find ways to dissent — carefully. Ahmed Khalefa's life turned upside down after he was charged with inciting terrorism for chanting in solidarity with Gaza at an anti-war protest in October 2023. The lawyer and city counselor from central Israel says he spent three difficult months in jail followed by six months detained in an apartment. It's unclear when he'll get a final verdict on his guilt or innocence. Until then, he's forbidden from leaving his home from dusk to dawn. Khalefa is one of more than 400 Palestinian citizens of Israel who, since the start of the war in Gaza, have been investigated by police for 'incitement to terrorism' or 'incitement to violence,' according to Adalah, a legal rights group for minorities. More than half of those investigated were also criminally charged or detained, Adalah said. 'Israel made it clear they see us more as enemies than as citizens,' Khalefa said in an interview at a cafe in his hometown of Umm al-Fahm, Israel's second-largest Palestinian city. Israel has roughly 2 million Palestinian citizens, whose families remained within the borders of what became Israel in 1948. Among them are Muslims and Christians, and they maintain family and cultural ties to Gaza and the West Bank, which Israel captured in 1967. Israel says its Palestinian citizens enjoy equal rights, including the right to vote, and they are well-represented in many professions. However, Palestinians are widely discriminated against in areas like housing and the job market. Israeli authorities have opened more incitement cases against Palestinian citizens during the war in Gaza than in the previous five years combined, Adalah's records show. Israeli authorities have not said how many cases ended in convictions and imprisonment. The Justice Ministry said it did not have statistics on those convictions. Just being charged with incitement to terrorism or identifying with a terrorist group can land a suspect in detention until they're sentenced, under the terms of a 2016 law. In addition to being charged as criminals, Palestinians citizens of Israel — who make up around 20% of the country’s population — have lost jobs, been suspended from schools and faced police interrogations posting online or demonstrating, activists and rights watchdogs say. It’s had a chilling effect. 'Anyone who tries to speak out about the war will be imprisoned and harassed in his work and education,' said Oumaya Jabareen, whose son was jailed for eight months after an anti-war protest. 'People here are all afraid, afraid to say no to this war.' Jabareen was among hundreds of Palestinians who filled the streets of Umm al-Fahm earlier this month carrying signs and chanting political slogans. It appeared to be the largest anti-war demonstration in Israel since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack. But turnout was low, and Palestinian flags and other national symbols were conspicuously absent. In the years before the war, some protests could draw tens of thousands of Palestinians in Israel. Authorities tolerated the recent protest march, keeping it under heavily armed supervision. Helicopters flew overhead as police with rifles and tear gas jogged alongside the crowd, which dispersed without incident after two hours. Khalefa said he chose not to attend. Shortly after the Oct. 7 attack, Israel’s far-right government moved quickly to invigorate a task force that has charged Palestinian citizens of Israel with 'supporting terrorism' for posts online or protesting against the war. At around the same time, lawmakers amended a security bill to increase surveillance of online activity by Palestinians in Israel, said Nadim Nashif, director of the digital rights group 7amleh. These moves gave authorities more power to restrict freedom of expression and intensify their arrest campaigns, Nashif said. The task force is led by Itamar Ben-Gvir, a hard-line national security minister who oversees the police. His office said the task force has monitored thousands of posts allegedly expressing support for terror organizations and that police arrested 'hundreds of terror supporters,' including public opinion leaders, social media influencers, religious figures, teachers and others. 'Freedom of speech is not the freedom to incite ... which harms public safety and our security,' his office said in a statement. But activists and rights groups say the government has expanded its definition of incitement much too far, targeting legitimate opinions that are at the core of freedom of expression. Myssana Morany, a human rights attorney at Adalah, said Palestinian citizens have been charged for seemingly innocuous things like sending a meme of a captured Israeli tank in Gaza in a private WhatsApp group chat. Another person was charged for posting a collage of children’s photos, captioned in Arabic and English: 'Where were the people calling for humanity when we were killed?' The feminist activist group Kayan said over 600 women called its hotline because of blowback in the workplace for speaking out against the war or just mentioning it unfavorably. Over the summer, around two dozen anti-war protesters in the port city of Haifa were only allowed to finish three chants before police forcefully scattered the gathering into the night. Yet Jewish Israelis demanding a hostage release deal protest regularly — and the largest drew hundreds of thousands to the streets of Tel Aviv. Khalefa, the city counselor, is not convinced the crackdown on speech will end, even if the war eventually does. He said Israeli prosecutors took issue with slogans that broadly praised resistance and urged Gaza to be strong, but which didn’t mention violence or any militant groups. For that, he said, the government is trying to disbar him, and he faces up to eight years in prison. 'They wanted to show us the price of speaking out,' Khalefa said. ___ Associated Press writers Tia Goldenberg in Tel Aviv, Israel, Ibrahim Hazboun in Jerusalem, Mahmoud Illean in Umm al-Fahm, and Drew Callister in New York, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-gaza-war-palestinians-dissent-protest-849cc9250534b5bae98cea89e6f4d35e	2024-11-23T20:18:36-08:00	
Haiti wonders what's next as gang violence surges and UN peacekeeping mission flops	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — When Kenyan police arrived in Haiti as part of a U.N.-backed mission earlier this year to tackle gang violence, hopes were high. Coordinated gang attacks on prisons, police stations and the main international airport had crippled the country’s capital and forced the prime minister to resign, plunging Haiti into an unprecedented crisis. But the crisis has only deepened since the international policing contingent arrived. The main international airport closed for the second time this year after gangs opened fire on commercial flights in mid-November, striking a flight attendant. Gunmen also are attacking once-peaceful communities to try and seize control of the entire capital, taking advantage of political infighting that led to the abrupt dismissal of the prime minister earlier this month. Now, a new prime minister is tasked with turning around a nation that sees no escape from its troubles as Haitians wonder: How did the country reach this point? ‘No functioning authority' Bloody coups, brutal dictatorships and gangs created by Haiti's political and economic elite have long defined the country's history, but experts say the current crisis is the worst they’ve seen. 'I’m very bleak about the future,' said Robert Fatton, a Haitian politics expert at the University of Virginia. 'The whole situation is really collapsing.' The government is anemic, the U.N.-backed mission that supports Haiti's understaffed police department lacks funding and personnel, and gangs now control 85% of the capital. Then, on Wednesday, another blow. Doctors Without Borders announced it was suspending critical care in Port-au-Prince as it accused police of targeting its staff and patients, including threats of rape and death. It’s the first time the aid group has stopped working with new patients since it began operating in Haiti more than 30 years ago. 'Every day that we cannot resume activities is a tragedy, as we are one of the few providers of a wide range of medical services that have remained open during this extremely difficult year,' said Christophe Garnier, mission director in Haiti. Lionel Lazarre, deputy spokesman for Haiti’s National Police, did not return messages for comment. Neither did officials with Kenya’s mission when asked about the surge in gang violence. In a recent statement, the Kenyan-led mission said it was 'cognizant of the road ahead that is fraught with challenges.' But it noted that ongoing joint patrols and operations have secured certain communities and forced gangs to change the way they operate. André François Giroux, Canada’s ambassador to Haiti, told The Associated Press on Saturday that his country and others have been trying to bolster the Kenyan-led mission. 'They’ve done miracles, I think, considering all the challenges that we’ve been facing,' he said. 'What we have to keep in mind is that it’s still very much in deployment mode,' Giroux said. 'There are not even 400 on the ground right now.' A spokesman for Haiti’s new prime minister, Alix Didier Fils-Aimé, did not return messages for comment. In a statement Thursday, his administration said authorities were strengthening security along the capital's main roads and had formed a special security council. 'The prime minister renews his commitment to find lasting solutions to current problems,' it said. The statement was issued just days after gangs launched a pre-dawn attack Tuesday around an upper-class community in Haiti’s capital, forcing residents armed with machetes and guns to fight side-by-side with police to repel gunmen. At least 28 gang members were killed, but not before some reached an area near an upscale hotel long considered safe. 'It tells you that there is no functioning authority in Haiti,' Fatton said. Dwindling aid and growing isolation A main concern in the ongoing crisis is the temporary closure of the main international airport in Port-au-Prince. It means critical aid is not reaching those who need it the most in a country where nearly 6,000 people are starving and nearly half of the more than 11 million inhabitants are experiencing crisis levels of hunger or worse. Gang violence also has left more than 700,000 people homeless in recent years. 'We are deeply concerned about the isolation of Port-au-Prince from the rest of Haiti and the world,' said Laurent Uwumuremyi, Mercy Corps’ country director for Haiti. The aid group helps people including more than 15,000 living in makeshift shelters, but persistent gang violence has prevented workers from reaching a growing number of them in the capital and beyond. Basic goods also are dwindling as the suspension of flights has delayed imports of critical supplies. 'Before, there were some neighborhoods in Port-au-Prince that we considered safe that the gangs had never reached, but now they are threatening to take over the control of the entire capital,' Uwumuremyi said. At least 150 people were reported killed in the capital and 20,000 forced to flee their homes in the second week of November alone. Overall, more than 4,500 people were reported killed in Haiti so far this year, the U.N. said. Jimmy Chérizier, a former elite police officer who became a gang leader known as Barbecue, warned that a gang coalition known as Viv Ansanm will keep attacking as they demand the resignation of a transitional presidential council tasked with leading the country along with the new prime minister. The council also is supposed to organize general elections for the first time in nearly a decade so voters can choose a president, a position left empty since President Jovenel Moïse was killed at his private residence in July 2021. ‘What else are you left with?’ The U.S. and other countries pushed for a U.N. peacekeeping mission in Haiti at a U.N. Security Council meeting this week. Only about 400 officers from Kenya have arrived, along with a handful of police and soldiers from other countries — way short of the 2,500 personnel slated for the mission. 'This is not just another wave of insecurity; it is a dramatic escalation that shows no signs of abating,' Miroslav Jenča, U.N. assistant secretary general for Europe, Central Asia and the Americas, said Wednesday at the meeting. But Russia and China oppose a U.N. peacekeeping mission, leaving many to wonder what other options are left for Haiti. Giroux, the Canadian ambassador, said his country supports a peacekeeping operation 'when the time is right.' 'Everybody is looking at a peacekeeping mission as a silver bullet,' he said, adding that even if that were to happen, it wouldn’t be able to deploy for another six to 12 months. 'We need to be realistic.' Giroux said he is hopeful that some 600 Kenyans will arrive in Haiti in upcoming weeks, but added that 'none of this matters if the political elite doesn’t get its act together.' The nine-member transitional presidential council has been marred by accusations of corruption and infighting and was criticized for firing the previous prime minister. 'I’m at a loss for any short-term solution for Haiti, let alone any long-term solutions,' Fatton said. 'The gangs have seen that they shouldn’t be afraid of the Kenyan mission.' He said one option may be for the government to negotiate with the gangs. 'At the moment, it is perceived as utterly unacceptable,' he said. 'But if the situation deteriorates even more, what else are you left with?'	https://apnews.com/article/haiti-gangs-violence-un-kenya-3db75e795c6cac2d7e11d90d360ae525	2024-11-23T20:03:26-08:00	
Romanians cast ballots in presidential race that could pit nationalist against leftist in a runoff	BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — Romanians are casting ballots on Sunday in the first round of a presidential election that could pit a far-right nationalist against the incumbent leftist prime minister in the runoff. Thirteen candidates are vying for the presidency in the European Union and NATO member country, and the vote is expected to go to a second round on Dec. 8. Polls opened at 7.00 a.m. local time (0500GMT) and will close at 9.00 p.m. (1900GMT). Romanians abroad have been able to vote since Friday. By 8 p.m. local time (1800GMT), 9.2 million people — about 51% of eligible voters — had cast ballots, according to the Central Election Bureau. The final vote could see George Simion, the leader of the far-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, or AUR, face off against incumbent Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu, backed by Romania’s largest party, the Social Democratic Party or PSD. The presidential role carries a five-year term and has significant decision-making powers in areas such as national security, foreign policy, and judicial appointments. Romania will also hold parliamentary elections on Dec. 1 that will determine the country's next government and prime minister. Simion, 38, is a vocal supporter of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and has long been a controversial figure. He campaigned for reunification with Moldova, which this year renewed a five-year ban on him entering the country over security concerns, and he is banned for the same reason from entering neighboring Ukraine. 'I would like that in the next five to ten years, for Romanians to be really proud to be Romanians, to promote Romanian culture, Romanian products,' he told reporters on Wednesday in the capital, Bucharest. 'As a Romanian president, I will promote Romanian interests. In most cases, Romanian interests coincide with partner interests.' Ecaterina Nawadia, a 20-year-old architecture student, said she voted for the first time in a national election on Sunday and hopes young people turn out in high numbers. 'Since the (1989) revolution, we didn’t have a really good president,' she said. 'I hope most of the people my age went to vote … because the leading candidate is not the best option.' Cristian Andrei, a political consultant based in Bucharest, says Sunday's vote will be 'a tight race' in which the diaspora will likely play a key role in which candidates make it to the runoff. 'We are at a point where Romania can easily divert or slip toward a populist regime because (voter) dissatisfaction is pretty large among a lot of people from all social strata,' he told The Associated Press. 'And the temptation for any regime, any leader — will be to go on a populist road.' He added that Romania's large budget deficit, high inflation, and an economic slowdown could push more mainstream candidates to shift toward populist stances amid widespread dissatisfaction. Ciolacu told the AP that if he is elected, one of his biggest goals is 'to convince Romanians that it is worth staying at home or returning' to Romania, which has a massive diaspora spread throughout EU countries. 'Romania has a huge chance to become a developed economy in the next 10 years, where honest work is fairly rewarded and people have the security of a better life,' he said. 'But for this, we need balance and responsibility ... I am running for the Presidency of Romania because we need a change.' Other key candidates include Elena Lasconi of the Save Romania Union party, or USR; former NATO deputy general secretary Mircea Geoana, who is running independently; and Nicolae Ciuca, a former army general and head of the center-right National Liberal Party, which is currently in a tense coalition with the PSD. Geoana, a former foreign minister and ambassador to the United States, told the AP that he believes his international experience qualifies him above the other candidates. 'I think I bring a lot of competence and experience and connections in this complicated world,' he said. Lasconi, a former journalist and the leader of the USR, said she sees corruption as one of the biggest problems Romania faces and that she supports increased defense spending and continued aid to Ukraine. Romania has been a staunch ally of war-torn Ukraine since Russia launched a full-scale invasion in February 2022. But Simion of the AUR party said he opposes Romania — which has sent a Patriot missile system to Ukraine — contributing further military aid and that he hopes Trump can 'stop the war.' In 2020, the AUR party went from relative obscurity to gaining 9% in a parliamentary vote, allowing it to enter parliament. Opponents have long accused Simion and AUR of being extremists, charges he denies. 'We are sort of a Trumpist party in this new wave of patriotic political parties in Europe,' Simion said.	https://apnews.com/article/romania-elections-president-europe-nato-a6e3bd3f26272c4a9ab9337789f09da8	2024-11-23T20:02:40-08:00	
Uruguay's once-dull election has become a dead heat in the presidential runoff	MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay (AP) — Uruguayans will return to the polls on Sunday for a second round of voting to choose their next president, with the conservative governing party and the left-leaning coalition locked in a close runoff after failing to win an outright majority in last month's vote. The election has turned into a hard-fought race between Álvaro Delgado, the incumbent party's candidate, and Yamandú Orsi from the Broad Front, a coalition of leftist and center-left parties that governed for 15 years until the 2019 victory of center-right President Luis Lacalle Pou. It oversaw the legalization of abortion, same-sex marriage and the sale of marijuana in the small South American nation. Orsi's Broad Front took 44% of the vote while Delgado's National Party won just 27% in the first round of voting Oct. 27. But the other conservative parties that make up the government coalition — in particular, the Colorado Party — notched 20% of the vote collectively, enough to give Delgado an edge over his challenger this time around. Congress ended up evenly split in the October vote. Most polls have shown a virtual tie between Delgado and Orsi, with nearly 10% of Uruguayan voters undecided even at this late stage. Analysts say the candidates' lackluster campaigns and broad consensus on key issues have helped generate extraordinary voter indecision and apathy in an election dominated by discussions about taxes and social spending but largely free of the anti-establishment rage that has vaulted populist outsiders to power elsewhere. 'The question of whether Frente Amplio (the Broad Front) raises taxes is not an existential question, unlike what we saw in the U.S. with Trump and Kamala framing each other as threats to democracy,' said Nicolás Saldías, a Latin America and Caribbean senior analyst for the London-based Economist Intelligence Unit. 'That doesn't exist in Uruguay.' Both candidates are also appealing to voter angst over a surge in violent crime that has shaken a nation long regarded as one of the region’s most safe and stable. Delgado, 55, a rural veterinarian with a long career in the National Party, campaigned on a vow to continue the legacy of current President Lacalle Pou — in some ways making the election into a referendum on his leadership. He campaigned under the slogan 're-elect a good government.' While a string of corruption scandals briefly tainted Lacalle Pou's government last year, the president — who constitutionally cannot run for a second consecutive term — now enjoys high approval ratings and a strong economy expected to grow 3.2% this year, according to the International Monetary Fund. Delgado served most recently as Secretary of the Presidency for Lacalle Pou and promises to press on with his predecessor's pro-business, market-friendly policies. His coalition would likely continue pursuing a prospective trade deal with China that has raised hackles in Mercosur, an alliance of South American countries that promotes regional commerce. Orsi, 57, a former history teacher and two-time mayor from a working-class background, is widely seen as an heir to iconic former President José 'Pepe' Mujica, a former Marxist guerilla who boosted Uruguay's profile as one of the region's most socially liberal and environmentally sustainable nations during his 2010-2015 term. 'He was born from ordinary workers,' Mujica said in a closing campaign ad for Orsi. 'He represents, precisely, the average type of what Uruguay is.' Promising to forge a 'new left' in Uruguay, Orsi has proposed tax incentives to lure investment and industrial policy to boost Uruguay’s critical agricultural sector. He has also floated social security reforms that would buck the demographic trend in lowering the retirement age but fall short of a radical overhaul sought by Uruguay's unions. The contentious plebiscite on whether to boost pension payouts failed to pass in October, with Uruguayans rejecting generous pensions in favor of fiscal constraint. 'This is a normal election, which is rare,' said Saldías. 'It's indicative of Uruguay’s strength as a democracy.' ___ Associated Press writer Isabel DeBre in Villa Tunari, Bolivia, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/uruguay-election-vote-right-left-latin-america-mercosur-cb746654935e5de40a96c7b95e036e33	2024-11-23T19:00:39-08:00	
Japan holds Sado mines memorial despite South Korean boycott amid lingering historical tensions	SADO, Japan (AP) — Japanese officials on Sunday paid tribute to workers at the country's Sado Island Gold Mines but offered no apology over Japan’s brutal wartime use of Korean forced laborers, highlighting lingering tensions between the neighbors over the issue. South Korea a day earlier announced that it was boycotting the memorial, saying it had been impossible to settle unspecified disagreements between both governments in time for the event. The Korean absence is a major setback in the rapidly improving ties between the two countries, which since last year have set aside their historical disputes to prioritize U.S.-led security cooperation. The Sado mines were listed in July as a UNESCO World Heritage Site after Japan moved past years of disputes with South Korea and reluctantly acknowledged the mines’ dark history, promising to hold an annual memorial service for all victims, including hundreds of Koreans who were mobilized to work in the mines. The first ceremony of what Japan has promised will be an annual event held at a facility near the mines took place with more than 20 seats for South Korean attendees empty. 'As a local resident, I must say (their absence) is very disappointing after all the preparations we made,' said Sado Mayor Ryugo Watanabe. 'I wish we could have held the memorial with South Korean attendees.' Families of Korean victims of mine accidents and South Korean officials are expected to hold their own ceremony near the mine on Monday as an expression of their 'firm resolve not to make a compromise with Japan on history issues,' South Korea's Foreign Ministry said in a statement. It said South korea will continue to strive to achieve the improvement of bilateral ties in a way that serves national interests of both countries. At Sunday's ceremony, four Japanese representatives, including central and local government officials and the head of the organizing group, thanked all mine workers for their sacrifice and mourned for those who died. None offered any apology to Korean forced laborers for the harsh treatment at the mines. Akiko Ikuina, a parliamentary vice minister, representing Japan's government, praised the craftsmanship of the laborers and their contribution to the Sado mines. She noted that 'many people from the Korean Peninsula were at the mines under Japan's wartime labor policies' and that they engaged in difficult work under dangerous and severe conditions away from home and their loved ones, and some died in accidents or from illnesses. But she did not acknowledge their forced labor or Japan's colonization of the Korean Peninsula. There has been speculation that the South Korean boycott might have been because of Ikuina's past visit to Tokyo’s controversial Yasukuni Shrine — in August 2022, weeks after she was elected as a lawmaker. Japan’s neighbors view Yasukuni, which commemorates 2.5 million war dead including war criminals, as a symbol of Japan’s past militarism. Ikuina belonged to a Japanese ruling party faction of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who led the whitewashing of Japan’s wartime atrocities in the 2010s during his leadership. For instance, Japan says the terms 'sex slavery' and 'forced labor' are inaccurate and insists on the use of highly euphemistic terms such as 'comfort women' and 'civilian workers' instead. South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul said Saturday that Ikuina’s Yasukuni visit was an issue of contention between the countries’ diplomats. The 16th-century mines on the island of Sado, off Japan’s north-central coast, operated for nearly 400 years before closing in 1989 and were once the world’s largest gold producer. Historians say about 1,500 Koreans were mobilized to Sado as part of Japan’s use of hundreds of thousands of Korean laborers, including those forcibly brought from the Korean Peninsula, at Japanese mines and factories to make up for labor shortages because most working-age Japanese men had been sent to battlefronts across Asia and the Pacific. Japan’s government has maintained that all wartime compensation issues between the two countries were resolved under a 1965 normalization treaty. South Korea had long opposed the listing of the site as World Heritage on the grounds that the Korean forced laborers, despite their key role in the wartime mine production, were missing from the exhibition. Seoul's backing for Sado came as South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol prioritized improving relations with Japan. Some South Koreans had criticized Yoon’s government for supporting the event without securing a clear Japanese commitment to highlight the plight of Korean laborers. There were also complaints over South Korea agreeing to pay for the travel expenses of Korean victims’ family members to Sado. ___ Kim reported from Seoul, South Korea.

Stolen shoe mystery solved at Japanese kindergarten when security camera catches weasel in the act	TOKYO (AP) — Police thought a shoe thief was on the loose at a kindergarten in southwestern Japan, until a security camera caught the furry culprit in action. A weasel with a tiny shoe in its mouth was spotted on the video footage after police installed three cameras in the school in the prefecture of Fukuoka. 'It’s great it turned out not to be a human being,' Deputy Police Chief Hiroaki Inada told The Associated Press Sunday. Teachers and parents had feared it could be a disturbed person with a shoe fetish. Japanese customarily take their shoes off before entering homes. The vanished shoes were all slip-ons the children wore indoors, stored in cubbyholes near the door. Weasels are known to stash items and people who keep weasels as pets give them toys so they can hide them. The weasel scattered shoes around and took 15 of them before police were called. Six more were taken the following day. The weasel returned Nov. 12 to steal one more shoe. That was when it got caught on camera. The shoe-loving weasel only took the white indoor shoes made of canvas, likely because they’re light to carry. 'We were so relieved,' Gosho Kodomo-en kindergarten director Yoshihide Saito told Japanese broadcaster RKB Mainichi Broadcasting. The children got a good laugh when they saw the weasel in the video. Although the stolen shoes were never found, the remaining shoes are now safe at the kindergarten with nets installed over the cubbyholes. The weasel, which is believed to be wild, is still on the loose. ___ Yuri Kageyama is on Threads: https://www.threads.net/@yurikageyama	https://apnews.com/article/japan-weasel-shoes-kindergarten-camera-police-c87df6f1a69f73675e302b09d014b09b	2024-11-23T15:41:15-08:00	
Secondary-ticket prices cool for the 2nd running of the Las Vegas Grand Prix	LAS VEGAS (AP) — Secondary-ticket prices for Saturday's Las Vegas Grand Prix have cooled considerably compared to last year's inaugural Formula 1 race on the city's Strip. The lowest price at Gamesite was $477 as of late Saturday morning, dropping from $711 just the day before. A year ago, the website's cheapest ticket cost $1,387 the day before the race, which was won by Max Verstappen. Prices were similar at other sites. The low ticket was $501 at Vivid Seats, $509 at StubHub and $481 at SeatGeek. Race organizers have said leading up to the event that there would be a natural drop in interest in the second year. They cited the curiosity factor for 2023 in fans wanting to see drivers in the world's premier motor sports series racing with Las Vegas' neon lights shining on them. There was little drama about who would win last year. Verstappen claimed the first Las Vegas Grand Prix, adding to a dominant championship season. Verstappen will win his fourth title in a row if he finishes three points in front of Lando Norris. BetMGM Sportsbook lists Carlos Sainz Jr. as the +200 favorite, followed by Charles Leclerc at +225, pole sitter George Russell at +350, Verstappen at +500 and Norris at +900. ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing	https://apnews.com/article/formula-1-f1-las-vegas-grand-prix-tickets-288a85391c2dc7cb94c7039a86313e7c	2024-11-23T09:49:52-08:00	
Thousands protest against femicides and sexual and sexist violence in France	PARIS (AP) — Thousands of protesters demonstrated Saturday in Paris and other French cities against femicides and sexual and sexist violence. In Paris, large crowds of women and men marched waving purple placards that denounced gender-based violence and defended women's reproductive rights. Protesters expressed concerns of a possible rollback for women's rights in the wake of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's election victory. They also expressed solidarity for Gisèle Pélicot. The harrowing trial of her ex-husband and dozens of other men being prosecuted for rapes while she was drugged and unconscious has stoked anger about sexual violence in France. 'Unfortunately, anybody can be a perpetrator of violence. It can be our brothers. It can be our fathers. It can be our colleagues. It can be our bosses. I think that’s the big shock for people,' said Maelle Noir, representing the feminist collective 'Nous Toutes' — which translates as 'All of us.' 'There is no typical profile of who the rapist could be and there is also no typical profile of who the victim could be,' she said. Protest organizers demanded increased government spending to fight sexual and sexist violence and promote gender equality.	https://apnews.com/article/pelicot-sexual-violence-rape-france-paris-8b726b2c584f0f1c880cb7152fac7110	2024-11-23T09:20:56-08:00	
Moscow bans adoption of Russian children to countries that allow gender transition	Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday signed into law a bill banning adoption of Russian children by citizens of countries where gender transitioning is legal. The Kremlin leader also approved legislation that outlaws the spread of material that encourages people not to have children. The bills, which were previously approved by both houses of Russia’s parliament, follow a series of laws that have suppressed sexual minorities and bolstered longstanding conventional values. Russian lower house Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin, who was among the new bill’s authors, said in a Telegram post in July that 'it is extremely important to eliminate possible dangers in the form of gender reassignment that adopted children may face in these countries.' The adoption ban would apply to at least 15 countries, most of them in Europe, and Australia, Argentina and Canada. Adoption of Russian children by U.S. citizens was banned in 2012. Other bills approved Saturday ban what they described as propaganda for remaining child-free and impose fines of up to 5 million rubles (about $50,000). Its proponents contended that public arguments against having children are part of purported Western efforts to weaken Russia by encouraging population decline. Putin and other top officials in recent years have increasingly called for observing so-called traditional values as a counter to Western liberalism. As Russia’s population declines, Putin has made statements advocating large families and last year urged women to have as many as eight children. Russia last year banned gender-transition medical procedures and its Supreme Court declared the LGBTQ+ 'movement' to be extremist. In 2022, Putin signed a law prohibiting the distribution of LGBTQ+ information to people of all ages, expanding a ban issued in 2013 on disseminating the material to minors. Since he sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022, the Kremlin leader has repeatedly characterized the West as 'satanic' and accused it of trying to undermine Russia by exporting liberal ideologies. Independent journalists, critics, activists and opposition figures in Russia have come under increasing pressure from the government in recent years, intensifying significantly amid the conflict in Ukraine. Hundreds of nongovernmental groups and individuals have been designated as a 'foreign agent' — a label that implies additional government scrutiny and carries strong pejorative connotations.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-lgbtq-adoption-putin-b8d16be856d811458ef8d41f9017d8dd	2024-11-23T08:43:08-08:00	
Canadian ministers condemn anti-NATO protest in Montreal that turned violent	MONTREAL (AP) — Senior Canadian ministers on Saturday condemned an anti-NATO protest in Montreal that turned violent, saying 'hatred and antisemitism' have no place in the country. Police said they made at least three arrests following a demonstration that began late afternoon Friday that saw two cars set on fire and left some businesses and a convention center hosting a NATO conference with smashed windows. Montreal police said smoke bombs were deployed and metal barriers were thrown into the street during the demonstration. The protest was organized by the groups Divest for Palestine and the Convergence of Anti-Capitalist Struggles, who did not immediately respond to requests for comment Saturday. Delegates from NATO member states and partner countries are in Montreal this weekend to discuss issues including support for Ukraine, climate change and the future of the alliance. Speaking to reporters at the Halifax International Security Forum on Saturday, Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly and Defense Minister Bill Blair said the actions of the protesters were unacceptable. 'What we saw was not peaceful protest. What we saw was actually violence, hate and antisemitism, and this has no place on our streets,' Joly said. 'Of course, we believe in the freedom of speech, we believe in the freedom to demonstrate, but where we draw the line is when there’s violence.' Blair added the demonstration 'was nothing like lawful, peaceful protests.' Instead, he called the demonstrations an act of 'anarchy' by a 'mob.' 'It was engagement in violence and hatred on display in the City of Montreal,' Blair said. 'Those behaviors are unacceptable and we can condemn them, and in particular the hatred and antisemitism that was on display, in the strongest possible terms.' Police spokesperson Manuel Couture said the demonstrators were completely dispersed by Friday evening.	https://apnews.com/article/montreal-nato-protest-canada-9230b0d52b191ef12bf092ab51f68e5a	2024-11-23T08:17:14-08:00	
American photographer Nan Goldin opens exhibition in Berlin with fiery speech against Israel	BERLIN (AP) — American photographer and activist Nan Goldin has used a speech at the opening of her exhibition in Germany to condemn Israel's war in Gaza. Goldin, 71, said Friday she wanted to use her retrospective show at the Neue Nationalgalerie in Berlin 'as a platform to amplify my position of moral outrage' at what she described as 'genocide in Gaza and Lebanon.' 'My grandparents escaped pogroms in Russia. I was brought up knowing about the Nazi Holocaust. What I see in Gaza reminds me of the pogroms that my grandparents escaped,' Goldin said. Goldin, who is of Jewish origin, was born in Washington D.C. and is a leading artist and activist whose life and work was documented in the award-winning 2022 film 'All the Beauty and the Bloodshed.' She spoke of the displacement and destruction in Gaza, and told a cheering audience that criticism of Israel should not be conflated with antisemitism. Goldin also criticized Germany and alleged that Islamophobia was being ignored in the country. 'Germany is home of the largest Palestinian diaspora in Europe. Yet protests are met with police dogs and deportation and stigmatization,' she said. Goldin walked off the stage to loud chants of 'free, free Palestine,' which drowned out a subsequent speech by the director of the gallery, Klaus Biesenbach. Hermann Parzinger, the president of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation, to which the Neue Nationalgalerie belongs, sharply condemned Goldin’s talk and the protesters' disruption of Biesenbach's speech. 'This does not correspond to our understanding of freedom of expression,' he said. Biesenbach noted that he disagreed with Goldin but affirmed her right to freely express herself. In a statement released by Biesenbach after the show's opening, cited by German news agency dpa, he said the gallery distanced itself from the protesters' stance and 'clarifies that it stands for freedom of expression and respectful dialogue and interaction with each other.' Neue Nationalgalerie’s lifetime retrospective of Goldin, titled 'This Will Not End Well,' showcases a comprehensive overview of Goldin’s work, including slideshows and films backed up by music. The Health Ministry in Gaza said this week that the death toll in the Gaza Strip from the 13-month-old war between Israel and Hamas has surpassed 44,000, with more than half of the fatalities women and children. The Gaza Health Ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. Around 90% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million people have been displaced. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead.	https://apnews.com/article/nan-goldin-berlin-gaza-israel-antisemitism-3fedbcd682897c0eecb1b62e637575f4	2024-11-23T07:11:56-08:00	
Israeli-Moldovan rabbi living in UAE is missing. Israeli officials fear he may have been kidnapped	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — An Israeli-Moldovan rabbi living in the United Arab Emirates has gone missing, with Israeli authorities raising the suspicion Saturday he may have been kidnapped as tensions remain high with Iran. Israeli media citing unnamed security sources reported that Zvi Kogan, who has been missing since noon Thursday, may have been kidnapped. The Israeli prime minister's office on Saturday night acknowledged Kogan disappearance, without elaborating. His disappearance comes as Iran has been threatening to retaliate against Israel after it launched a strike in October hitting sensitive military bases in the country. Tehran twice has launched missile attacks on Israel amid the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip and the Israeli ground offensive in Lebanon. Emirati officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment Saturday. State-run media in the UAE, an autocratic federation of seven sheikhdoms on the Arabian Peninsula and home to Abu Dhabi and Dubai, did not immediately report the incident. Local Jewish officials in the UAE declined to comment. 'Since (Kogan’s) disappearance, and against the backdrop of information that this was a terrorist incident, an extensive investigation has been opened in the country,' the prime minister’s office said. 'Israeli intelligence and security agencies are working continuously out of concern for the well-being and safety of Zvi Kogan.' While the Israeli message did not mention Iran, Iranian intelligence services have carried out kidnappings in the past in the UAE. Western officials believe Iran runs intelligence operations in the UAE and keeps tabs on the hundreds of thousands of Iranians living across the country. Iran is suspected of kidnapping and later killing British-Iranian national Abbas Yazdi in Dubai in 2013, though Tehran has denied involvement. Iran also kidnapped Iranian-German Jamshid Sharmahd in 2020 from Dubai, taking him back to Tehran where he was executed in October. Iranian state media did not immediately acknowledge Kogan's disappearance. The UAE diplomatically recognized Israel in 2020. In the time since, Israelis have come to the UAE to set up businesses and vacation. Emirati airlines have been a key link for Israel to the rest of the world as other carriers have stopped flying to Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv amid the wars. The UAE also has a burgeoning Jewish society, with synagogues and businesses catering to kosher diners. However, the Mideast wars have sparked deep anger among Emiratis, Arabs and others living in the UAE. ___ Reich reported from New York.	https://apnews.com/article/uae-israel-rabbi-kidnapped-ce8e0f9b02b2d2abf9dc2afd283f64b4	2024-11-23T07:03:00-08:00	
Canada's top military commander calls out US senator for questioning a woman's role in combat	HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) — The first woman to command Canada's military called out a U.S. senator on Saturday for questioning the role of women in combat. Gen. Jennie Carignan responded to comments made by Idaho Republican Sen. Jim Risch, the ranking member of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who was asked on Friday whether President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee for defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, should retract comments that he believes men and women should not serve together in combat units. 'I think it’s delusional for anybody to not agree that women in combat creates certain unique situations that have to be dealt with. I think the jury’s still out on how to do that,' Risch said during a panel session at the Halifax International Security Forum on Friday. Carignan, Canada's chief of defense staff and the first woman to command the armed forces of any Group of 20 or Group of Seven country, took issue with those remarks during a panel session on Saturday. 'If you’ll allow me, I would first like maybe to respond to Senator Risch’s statement yesterday about women in combat because I wouldn’t want anyone to leave this forum with this idea that women are a distraction to defense and national security,' Carignan said. 'After 39 years of career as a combat arms officer and risking my life in many operations across the world, I can’t believe that in 2024, we still have to justify the contribution of women to their defense and to their service, in their country. I wouldn’t want anyone to leave this forum with this idea that this is that it is some kind of social experiment.' Carignan said women have participating in combat for hundreds of years but have never been recognized for fighting for their country. She noted the women military personnel in the room. 'All the women sitting here in uniform, stepping in, and deciding to get into harm’s way and fight for their country, need to be recognized for doing so,' she said. 'So again, this is the distraction, not the women themselves.' Carignan received a standing ovation at the forum, which attracts defense and security officials from Western democracies. Hegseth has reignited a debate that many thought had been long settled: Should women be allowed to serve their country by fighting on the front lines? The former Fox News commentator made it clear, in his own book and in interviews, that he believes men and women should not serve together in combat units. If Hegseth is confirmed by the Senate, he could try to end the Pentagon’s nearly decade-old practice of making all combat jobs open to women. Hegseth’s remarks have generated a barrage of praise and condemnation. Carignan was promoted to the rank of general during the change-of-command ceremony this past summer, after being chosen by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government to become Canada’s first female defense chief. Carignan is no stranger to firsts. She was also the first woman to command a combat unit in the Canadian military, and her career has included deployments to Iraq, Afghanistan, Bosnia and Syria. For the last three years, she has been the chief of professional conduct and culture, a job created as a result of the sexual misconduct scandal in 2021. Her appointment this year comes as Canada continues to face criticism from NATO allies for not spending 2% of its gross domestic product on defense. The Canadian government recently said that it would reach its NATO commitment by 2032. Risch said Friday Trump would laugh at Canada’s current military spending plans and said the country must do more.	https://apnews.com/article/woman-combat-canada-us-carignan-risch-23ad537fbfab4a63e41b5d4366f24d91	2024-11-23T06:45:05-08:00	
Canadian security forum honors Kremlin critic and Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Vladimir Kara-Murza	HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) — A Canadian security forum on Saturday presented an award to Vladimir Kara-Murza, a Kremlin critic and Pulitzer Prize-winning writer who was freed from prison earlier this year in a massive prisoner exchange. The Halifax International Security Forum presents the award annually in honor of U.S. Sen. John McCain, who died in 2018, to 'individuals from any country who have demonstrated uncommon leadership in the pursuit of human justice.' The forum attracts military officials, United States senators, diplomats and scholars. 'I am humbled beyond words to be receiving this prize, but I view it first and foremost as your recognition of all my fellow Russian citizens who have the courage to stand up to Putin's regime and to call out his murderous war in Ukraine in full knowledge what the price of that will be,' Kara-Murza said. McCain was a regular at the forum and his son, Jack McCain, presented Kara-Murza with the award. Kara-Murza was a pall bearer at McCain's funeral. 'It was described as his last dig at Vladimir Putin,' Jack McCain said. Kara-Murza was freed in the massive prisoner exchange earlier this year with the West — the largest since the Cold War. He had been imprisoned in Russia since April 2022 and was convicted of treason for denouncing the war in Ukraine. He rose to prominence as a journalist and did columns as a contributor for The Washington Post from his prison cell. He won the Pulitzer Prize for commentary earlier this year. In 2015 and 2017, he suffered two near-fatal poisonings and developed polyneuropathy, a condition that deadens the feeling in his limbs. He blamed the poisonings on Russian authorities. Kara-Murza rejected the charges against him as punishment for standing up to Putin. The security forum will also honor former Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen with the McCain award that was announced in 2021. She could not attend then. During Tsai’s two terms, which ended in May, she came under relentless attack from China for her refusal to concede to Beijing’s demands that Taipei recognize China’s sovereignty over it. Past winners of the John McCain Prize for Leadership in Public Service have included the people of Hong Kong for their 'fight for their rights in the face of oppression from the government of China' and the people of Lesbos, Greece, 'for their valiant actions to rescue refugees fleeing conflict in the Middle East.' A Navy pilot, John McCain was shot down over North Vietnam in 1967. He was captured, beaten and held prisoner for more than five years, refusing to be released ahead of other American servicemembers. 'Like Senator McCain, Kara-Murza was willing to stand up for his beliefs even if it came at the price of his freedom,' said Peter Van Praagh, the President of the Halifax International Security Forum.	https://apnews.com/article/canada-mccain-award-russia-security-forum-2443a4600006c7368c66da1222dcd736	2024-11-23T04:39:22-08:00	
Doctor at the heart of Turkey's newborn baby deaths case says he was a 'trusted' physician	ISTANBUL (AP) — The Turkish doctor at the center of an alleged fraud scheme that led to the deaths of 10 babies told an Istanbul court Saturday that he was a 'trusted' physician. Dr. Firat Sari is one of 47 people on trial accused of transferring newborn babies to neonatal units of private hospitals, where they were allegedly kept for prolonged and sometimes unnecessary treatments in order to receive social security payments. 'Patients were referred to me because people trusted me. We did not accept patients by bribing anyone from 112,' Sari said, referring to Turkey’s emergency medical phone line. Sari, said to be the plot’s ringleader, operated the neonatal intensive care units of several private hospitals in Istanbul. He is facing a sentence of up to 583 years in prison in a case where doctors, nurses, hospital managers and other health staff are accused of putting financial gain before newborns’ wellbeing. The case, which emerged last month, has sparked public outrage and calls for greater oversight of the health care system. Authorities have since revoked the licenses and closed 10 of the 19 hospitals that were implicated in the scandal. 'I want to tell everything so that the events can be revealed,' Sari, the owner of Medisense Health Services, told the court. 'I love my profession very much. I love being a doctor very much.' Although the defendants are charged with the negligent homicide of 10 infants since January 2023, an investigative report cited by the state-run Anadolu news agency said they caused the deaths of 'hundreds' of babies over a much longer time period. Over 350 families have petitioned prosecutors or other state institutions seeking investigations into the deaths of their children, according to state media. Prosecutors at the trial, which opened on Monday, say the defendants also falsified reports to make the babies’ condition appear more serious so as to obtain more money from the state as well as from families. The main defendants have denied any wrongdoing, insisting they made the best possible decisions and are now facing punishment for unavoidable, unwanted outcomes. Sari is charged with establishing an organization with the aim of committing a crime, defrauding public institutions, forgery of official documents and homicide by negligence. During questioning by prosecutors before the trial, Sari denied accusations that the babies were not given the proper care, that the neonatal units were understaffed or that his employees were not appropriately qualified, according to a 1,400-page indictment. 'Everything is in accordance with procedures,' he told prosecutors in a statement. The hearings at Bakirkoy courthouse, on Istanbul’s European side, have seen protests outside calling for private hospitals to be shut down and 'baby killers' to be held accountable. The case has also led to calls for the resignation of Health Minister Kemal Memisoglu, who was the Istanbul provincial health director at the time some of the deaths occurred. Ozgur Ozel, the main opposition party leader, has called for all hospitals involved to be nationalized. In a Saturday interview with the A Haber TV channel, Memisoglu characterized the defendants as 'bad apples' who had been 'weeded out.' 'Our health system is one of the best health systems in the world,' he said. 'This is a very exceptional, very organized criminal organization. It is a mistake to evaluate this in the health system as a whole.' Memisoglu also denied the claim that he shut down an investigation into the claims in 2016, when he was Istanbul’s health director, calling it 'a lie and slander.' Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said this week that those responsible for the deaths would be severely punished but warned against placing all the blame on the country’s health care system. 'We will not allow our health care community to be battered because of a few rotten apples,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/turkey-trial-health-newborn-deaths-sari-41d5bed064d377e5418d0af358c1938b	2024-11-23T03:27:08-08:00	
The week that upped the stakes of the Ukraine war	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — This past week has seen the most significant escalation in hostilities that Ukraine has witnessed since Russia's full-scale invasion and marks a new chapter in the nearly three-year war — one tinged with uncertainty and fear. It began with U.S. President Joe Biden reversing a longstanding policy by granting Kyiv permission to deploy American longer-range missiles inside Russian territory and ended with Moscow striking Ukraine with a new experimental ballistic weapon that has alarmed the international community and heightened fears of further escalation. Here is a look at the events in Ukraine in the span of a week that has fundamentally altered the stakes of the war: SUNDAY: U.S. approves strikes using longer-range American weapons Washington eased limits on what Ukraine can strike with its American-made Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMS, after months of ruling out such a move over fears of escalating the conflict and bringing about a direct confrontation between Russia and NATO. The change came after the U.S., South Korea and NATO said North Korean troops were inside Russia and being deployed to help Moscow drive Ukrainian troops from Russia’s Kursk region. But the scope of the new firing guidelines wasn’t clear. MONDAY: Russia warns of escalation if Western weapons are used inside its territories The Kremlin warned that Biden’s decision would escalate international tensions even higher. 'It is obvious that the outgoing administration in Washington intends to take steps, and they have been talking about this, to continue adding fuel to the fire and provoking further escalation of tensions around this conflict,' spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. TUESDAY: Ukraine fires American longer-range missiles into Russia for first time; Putin lowers threshold for nuclear attack Ukraine fired several ATACMS, striking an ammunition warehouse in Russia’s Bryansk region, the first time Kyiv had used the weapons inside enemy territory, according to widespread reports. Ukrainian officials have not officially confirmed the strikes which occurred on the 1,000th day since the invasion. Also Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin formally lowered the threshold for using nuclear weapons, opening the door to a potential nuclear response by Moscow to even a conventional attack by any nation supported by a nuclear power. That could include Ukrainian attacks backed by the U.S. WEDNESDAY: U.S. approves giving Ukraine anti-personnel mines In the second major shift in U.S. policy, the Biden administration announced it will give Ukraine antipersonnel mines to help slow Russia’s battlefield advances. Biden had previously put off signing off on this because of international objections to the use of such mines due to the risks they pose to civilians. Russia deploys them freely. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the shift in Washington’s policy was needed to counter changing Russian tactics. Ukraine also struck targets inside Russia using the British Storm Shadow missile, an equivalent of the ATACMS system, further vexing Moscow. The U.S. and some other Western embassies in Kyiv temporarily closed in response to the threat of a potentially major Russian aerial attack on the Ukrainian capital. THURSDAY: Russia uses new, experimental ballistic missile for the first time The Kremlin fired a new intermediate-range ballistic missile at Ukraine in response to Kyiv’s use of American and British missiles, Putin said. In a televised address to the country, the Russian president warned that U.S. air defense systems would be powerless to stop the new missile, which he said flies at 10 times the speed of sound and which he called the Oreshnik — Russian for hazelnut tree — based on Russia’s RS-26 Rubezh intercontinental ballistic missile, which can carry nuclear warheads. Putin also said it could be used to attack any Ukrainian ally whose missiles are used to attack Russia. Moscow gave Washington a 30-minute warning of the attack, which struck a weapons factory in the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro. FRIDAY: NATO calls emergency meeting as Ukraine's parliament closes NATO and Ukraine scheduled emergency talks slated for Tuesday, the alliance said. The meeting will be held at the request of Ukraine and will convene at the level of ambassadors. Ukraine’s parliament also canceled a session as security was tightened in the city. Lawmakers said there was a credible threat of an attack on government buildings. Ukraine's partners weighed in on the dangerous new phase of the conflict. Poland’s Prime Minister Donald Tusk said the conflict is 'entering a decisive phase' and 'taking on very dramatic dimensions.'	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-november-2024-crucial-week-0555d1af20edcb8dcf8aef47d868db22	2024-11-23T02:32:09-08:00	
Polish prime minister's party picks Warsaw mayor as its candidate for president	WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Warsaw Mayor Rafał Trzaskowski has been selected by Prime Minister Donald Tusk’s centrist Civic Coalition as its candidate in next year's presidential election, beating out Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski. Tusk announced the decision at a party gathering on Saturday, a day after more than 22,000 party members voted in a primary to select who should run to replace the incumbent, Andrzej Duda. Tusk said Trzaskowski won nearly 75% of the votes, and Sikorski slightly over 25%. Political observers in Poland say Tusk's pro-European Union party has already put itself in a strong position ahead of the presidential election by showing that it had two strong candidates, generating a buzz around them and allowing party members to choose in a democratic process. 'We are responsible people, we are responsible for the fate of our homeland today,' Tusk told supporters at the party event. He said it was only the start of what is expected to be a difficult campaign. The primary process distinguishes Tusk's party from its main rival, the national conservative Law and Justice party, known by its acronym PiS, whose candidate will be handpicked by leader Jarosław Kaczyński. The candidate is expected to be announced at a party convention in Krakow on Sunday. 'In PiS, one vote matters, while we value every vote, and that’s how we differ,' Trzaskowski told party members in his acceptance speech. 'I’m convinced that we’re coming out of this primary stronger, we’re all stronger, and I have a very strong mandate and a lot of energy, determination and courage to beat PiS.' Sikorski congratulated Trzaskowski and promised his support. Trzaskowski has long been considered the obvious candidate for Tusk’s party but was recently challenged by Sikorski, who argued that his experience in security and defense issues made him the better choice at a time of war in neighboring Ukraine and political change in the United States. But party members overwhelmingly stuck with Trzaskowski — and were in a good mood as they gathered over coffee and cookies after cheering the outcome. One, Małgorzata Kobus, told The Associated Press that she voted for Trzaskowski because he has been an excellent mayor, preserving green spaces and historical monuments in the capital. She also appreciates that he is highly educated and fluent in several foreign languages. Another, Hanna Szulczewska, thinks Trzaskowski is well suited to the difficult times in a region near Ukraine. She was persuaded by polls that show Trzaskowski would have a better chance of beating out candidates from other parties. 'I am really convinced that he will make a fantastic president,' she said. 'And strategically we really need a strong candidate.' Trzaskowski, 52, has been mayor since 2018 and has overseen a rapidly changing city of nearly 2 million people that has absorbed large numbers of Ukrainian refugees. He ran for president in 2020, barely losing to Duda. A first round of the presidential election is due to be held in May, and a possible runoff two weeks later if no candidate gets an outright majority in the first round. President Duda will complete his second five-year term in August 2025 and is prevented by the constitution from running again. It is a priority for Tusk to have an ally win the presidency because it will determine whether he can fulfill his agenda. He is currently unable to complete some of his campaign promises because Duda wields veto power over legislation, but also because of opposition within his own three-party coalition. The Civic Coalition is led by Tusk’s party Civic Platform and also includes smaller parties including the Greens.	https://apnews.com/article/poland-president-election-trzaskowski-9a4c180e86589a11a3cfeda2341172b3	2024-11-23T02:10:46-08:00	
Moody's credit rating upgrade for Cyprus opens the door to investment, president says	NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — Moody’s two-notch upgrade of Cyprus' credit rating to A3 from Baa2 opens the threshold to quality foreign investment that will generate new jobs, the president said Saturday. President Nikos Christodoulides said in a statement that the rating agency’s action reflects his government’s efforts at cementing Cyprus’ reputation as a credible investment destination through disciplined fiscal policy, banking sector stability and financial reform. Finance Minister Makis Keravnos said the upgrade marks the first time that Moody’s has elevated Cyprus back into the upper medium grade investment category since 2011, when a brewing financial crisis brought the country to the brink of bankruptcy that required a bailout from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund two years later. Moody’s said its rationale for the ratings upgrade and stable outlook was grounded in Cyprus’ 'prudent fiscal policy' that combined spending cuts with strong public revenue growth, resulting in fiscal surpluses over the last two years. The agency said smaller fiscal surpluses are expected to continue until 2028, while a drop in public debt 'has been one of the most substantial globally,' dropping from 113.6% of gross domestic product in 2020 to 73% in 2023. According to Moody’s, debt is forecast to continue dropping to 50% in 2027, while the economy will grow by an average of 3.2% between 2024 and 2028, thanks to continued growth in sectors including information and communication technology, finance and insurance. Companies are opting to set up their headquarters in Cyprus, particularly from Ukraine, Israel and the Middle East. Foreign investment in energy, education, construction, health care and tourism will also buoy economic growth over the medium term. Moody’s said downside risks include cancellation of large investment project, a burgeoning public sector wage bill and spending pressures in health care.	https://apnews.com/article/cyprus-moodys-credit-rating-upgrade-e691b87e1838498f949d4f1c6a6e1636	2024-11-23T01:18:19-08:00	
At least 11 killed and dozens injured in Israeli strikes in Beirut as diplomats push for cease-fire	BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) — Israeli airstrikes Saturday killed at least 11 people and injured dozens in central Beirut, officials said, as diplomats scrambled to broker a cease-fire. Lebanon's Health Ministry said the death toll could rise as emergency responders dug through the rubble looking for survivors. DNA tests are being used to identify the victims, it said, adding that 63 people were wounded. The strikes were the fourth in the Lebanese capital in less than a week. The escalation comes after U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein traveled to the region this week in an attempt to broker a cease-fire deal to end the more than 13 months of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, which has erupted into full-on war in the past two months. Israeli bombardment has killed more than 3,500 people in Lebanon and wounded more than 15,000, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. The fighting has displaced about 1.2 million, or a quarter of Lebanon’s population. On the Israeli side, about 90 soldiers and nearly 50 civilians have been killed by rockets, drones and missiles in northern Israel and in fighting in Lebanon. Dawn airstrikes reduce a building into rubble The strikes at 4 a.m. destroyed an eight-story building and left a crater in the ground. Also on Saturday, a drone strike killed one person and injured another in the southern port city of Tyre, according to the state-run National News Agency. The agency said the victims were fishermen. An Associated Press journalist, who saw the strike from a nearby hotel overlooking the beach, said he had watched the fishermen set up nets beforehand and both appeared to be young teenagers. Israel's military did not issue a warning for residents prior to the strikes in central Beirut and did not comment on the casualties. It warned residents Saturday in parts of Beirut’s southern suburbs that they were residing near Hezbollah facilities, which the army would target in the near future. The warning, posted on X, told people to evacuate at least 500 meters (yards) away. The army said that over the past day it had conducted intelligence-based strikes on Hezbollah targets in Dahiyeh, in Beirut’s southern suburbs, where Hezbollah has a strong presence. It said it hit several command centers and weapons storage facilities. At least 6 dead including children in Gaza Strikes also continued in Gaza on Saturday. At least six people, half of them children and including two women, were killed in the southern city of Khan Younis, according to AP reporters and staff at Nasser Hospital. The death toll from the 13-month-long war in the Gaza Strip between Israel and Hamas has surpassed 44,000 this week, according to local health officials. The Gaza Health Ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count, but it has said that more than half of the fatalities are women and children. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. The Israeli offensive in Gaza has caused heavy destruction across wide areas of the coastal territory, leading many to wonder when or how it will ever be rebuilt. Around 90% of the population of 2.3 million people have been displaced, often multiple times, and hundreds of thousands are living in squalid tent camps with little food, water or basic services. The United Nations humanitarian office warned of a 'stark increase' in the number of households experiencing severe hunger in central and southern Gaza. In Deir al-Balah, local bakeries shut down for five days this week and the price of a bag of bread climbed above $13, as bread and flour vanished from shelves before more supplies arrived. At least two women were fatally shot on Saturday while waiting in a line for bread in the city, relatives and witnesses told the AP. Heba Ajam, who was waiting at the bakery and saw the shooting, said that one was shot in the head and another in the neck. It was unclear who shot them and why. The lack of food and security have forced some bakeries to close in central and southern Gaza. Reactions continue to ICC warrants The strikes in Gaza come days after a decision by the International Criminal Court to issue arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister, Yoav Gallant, based on 'reasonable grounds' that they bear responsibility for a war crime and crimes against humanity in Gaza. The court also issued a warrant for top Hamas official, Mohammed Deif, who Israel claims it killed. Netanyahu condemned the warrant, saying Israel 'rejects with disgust the absurd and false actions.' Global reactions have been mixed. The U.K. reiterated its support for the court but stopped short of saying whether it would arrest Netanyahu if he visited. Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s office has indicated that Britain would comply with its legal obligations under domestic and international law, but refused to get into hypothetical issues about individuals. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Friday refused to comment, saying that the court’s rulings are 'insignificant' for Russia, which doesn’t recognizes its jurisdiction. The ICC last year issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin and a number of other top Russian officials, accusing them of war crimes in Ukraine. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the United States fundamentally rejects the court’s decision. She said the Biden administration was 'deeply concerned by the prosecutor’s rush to seek arrest warrants and the troubling process errors that led to this decision.' The U.S. is one of dozens of countries that did not sign and do not accept the court’s jurisdiction. Others include Israel, Russia and China. Nomi Bar-Yaacov, an associate fellow in the International Security Program at London’s Chatham House think tank, said that even if Netanyahu won’t be able to travel to many European countries, he’ll go to the United States. That will push him closer to President-elect Donald Trump. 'I don’t think Netanyahu will be arrested because he’s not going to take the risk of traveling to any country that will be able to issue an arrest warrant. So in that sense, it limits his freedom of movement, but that will only strengthen his ties to Donald Trump,' she said. —— Associated Press writers Fadi Tawil in Tyre, Lebanon, Ibrahim Hazboun in Jerusalem, Wafaa Shurafa in Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip, Mohammad Jahjouh in Khan Younis, Gaza Strip, and Danica Kirka in London contributed to this report. —— Find more of AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-news-11-23-2024-60f383ef1f42ff9928770a77d27ec4b8	2024-11-22T23:51:22-08:00	
Modi's party heads for victory in Maharashtra state election while opposition wins Jharkhand	NEW DELHI (AP) — Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist party headed for a victory Saturday in state elections in politically significant Maharashtra while the opposition won mineral-rich Jharkhand state. Polling in the two states are seen as a test of Modi's popularity after his party returned to power in June national elections but was forced to form a coalition government with help from regional partners. India’s Election Commission said Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies have already won 183 of 288 seats and were leading in another 48 seats in Maharashtra, India’s wealthiest state and home to the country's financial and entertainment capital, Mumbai. The opposition Congress party and its allies have won 50 of 81 seats and were leading in another four seats in eastern Jharkhand state, according to the commission. It said vote counting was nearing completion and final results were expected later on Saturday. Modi's BJP and a Hindu nationalist ally currently rule Maharashtra, where Hindus constitute nearly 80% and Muslims 11.5% of its 126 million people. An opposition alliance, including the Congress party, is in power in eastern Jharkhand state. The BJP has used slogans such as, 'If you divide, then you will die,' and 'If we are united, then we are safe,' to attract majority Hindu votes. The opposition accused it of trying to polarize voters along Hindu-Muslim religious lines. Meanwhile, Priyanka Gandhi from Congress party, the 52-year-old scion of the Nehru-Gandhi political dynasty, is set to make her debut in Parliament after winning the race against a Communist Party candidate by a huge margin of over 400,000 votes in the Wayanad seat in southern Kerala state. She contested a special election after her brother Rahul, who was elected in two constituencies in June, had to vacate one. Her mother Sonia Gandhi is already in Parliament. The BJP had hoped to attract women with a plan that provides 1,500 rupees ($18) a month to over 20 million women in the 21-65 age group whose annual family income is less than 250,000 rupees ($3,010). The Congress party promised women double that amount and free transportation in government buses. The opposition also hoped to capitalize on the simmering disaffection with high youth unemployment, inflation and low crop prices during the BJP’s rule. In September, Congress was able to secure votes in India’s insurgency-wracked Jammu and Kashmir after a 10-year gap. But Modi’s BJP regained momentum in October and won the Haryana state election even though pollsters had predicted an easy victory for Congress.	https://apnews.com/article/india-state-election-modi-party-congress-6cc84c72d4b00e0a49160123efdd48e7	2024-11-22T23:03:47-08:00	
The Philippine vice president publicly threatens to have the president assassinated	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Philippine Vice President Sara Duterte said Saturday she has contracted an assassin to kill the president, his wife and the House of Representatives speaker if she herself is killed, in a brazen public threat that she warned was not a joke. Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin referred the 'active threat' against President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to an elite presidential guards force 'for immediate proper action.' It was not immediately clear what actions would be taken against the vice president. The Presidential Security Command immediately boosted Marcos' security and said it considered the vice president's threat, which was 'made so brazenly in public,' a national security issue. The security force said it was 'coordinating with law enforcement agencies to detect, deter, and defend against any and all threats to the president and the first family.' Marcos ran with Duterte as his vice-presidential running mate in the May 2022 elections and both won with landslide victories on a campaign call of national unity. The two leaders and their camps, however, rapidly had a bitter falling-out over key differences, including in their approaches to China’s aggressive actions in the disputed South China Sea. Duterte resigned from the Marcos Cabinet in June as education secretary and head of an anti-insurgency body. Like her equally outspoken father, former President Rodrigo Duterte, the vice president became a vocal critic of Marcos, his wife Liza Araneta-Marcos and House Speaker Martin Romualdez, the president’s ally and cousin, accusing them of corruption, incompetence and politically persecuting the Duterte family and its close supporters. Her latest tirade was set off by the decision by House members allied with Romualdez and Marcos to detain her chief of staff, Zuleika Lopez, who was accused of hampering a congressional inquiry into the possible misuse of her budget as vice president and education secretary. Lopez was later transferred to a hospital after falling ill and wept when she heard of a plan to temporarily lock her up in a women’s prison. In a pre-dawn online news conference, an angry Sara Duterte accused Marcos of incompetence as a president and of being a liar, along with his wife and the House speaker in expletives-laden remarks. When asked about concerns over her security, the 46-year-old lawyer suggested there was an unspecified plot to kill her. 'Don’t worry about my security because I’ve talked with somebody. I said 'if I’m killed, you’ll kill BBM, Liza Araneta and Martin Romualdez. No joke, no joke,’' the vice president said without elaborating and using the initials that many use to call the president. 'I’ve given my order, ‘If I die, don’t stop until you’ve killed them.’ And he said, ’yes,’' the vice president said. Under the Philippine penal code, such public remarks may constitute a crime of threatening to inflict a wrong on a person or his family and is punishable by a jail term and fine. Amid the political divisions, military chief Gen. Romeo Brawner issued a statement with an assurance that the 160,000-member Armed Forces of the Philippines would remain nonpartisan 'with utmost respect for our democratic institutions and civilian authority.' 'We call for calm and resolve,' Brawner said. 'We reiterate our need to stand together against those who will try to break our bonds as Filipinos.' The vice president is the daughter of Marcos’ predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte, whose police-enforced anti-drugs crackdown when he was a city mayor and later as president left thousands of mostly petty drug suspects dead in killings that the International Criminal Court has been investigating as a possible crime against humanity. The former president denied authorizing extrajudicial killings under his crackdown but has given conflicting statements. He told a public Philippine Senate inquiry last month that he had maintained a 'death squad' of gangsters to kill other criminals when he was mayor of southern Davao city.	https://apnews.com/article/philippines-president-marcos-duterte-assassination-0946ce72c2475b58a2daf54efa32fe45	2024-11-22T22:54:21-08:00	
Deadly alcohol poisoning casts shadow over the Laotian backpacker town	VANG VIENG, Laos (AP) — A little town known as a backpacker paradise in northern Laos has come under spotlight for a mass poisoning case that has killed at least six tourists and potentially injured scores of others. News broke earlier this week that two Australian teens became critically ill after a night out drinking in the town of Vang Vieng. They died in Thai hospitals, with one confirmed case of methanol poisoning. A British woman was also confirmed dead. An American and two Danes also died, though their exact causes of death have not been released. A New Zealander has been sickened. Since then, many tourists have become worried as it’s unclear how many have been affected, said Neil Farmiloe, a New Zealander who owns a restaurant in the town. The incident has stirred up dark memories of the town once known for reckless partying involving young backpackers. But despite the tragedy, the town, especially at night, was packed by visitors in its main neighborhood bustling with bars, restaurants and food stalls. During the daytime, many kayaks floated along the river, with tourists shouting and splashing water at each other. Frida Svedberg left Sweden five weeks ago for her big Southeast Asia trip with no firm return plan. She said she had heard about the news just before she arrived in Laos and has been bombarded with messages from concerned family members and friends. She still went ahead with her original plan to spend three nights in the town. She found it as beautiful as expected. 'Obviously it’s like a famous backpacker place. You go from Thailand Luang Prabang and then to Vang Vieng and then you keep going. I’ve just heard good things about it and it’s where most people go,' the 24-year-old said. Vang Vieng used to be more dangerous Landlocked Laos, a one-party communist state, is one of Southeast Asia’s poorest nations and a popular tourist destination, particularly Vang Vieng. Soutjai Xayphankhaun, who has run his Sout Jai Guesthouse in Vang Vieng for 17 years, said the town back in 2005-2006 started to become popular among European backpackers, who were attracted by serene nature and activities like river tubing, where tourists sit on a tube and float along the Nam Song River, stopping to party at many different bars on the banks. It could get rowdy with cheap booze, illegal drugs and river sports sometimes turning deadly. People drowned or took a fatal blow after jumping into the river on a rope swing. In 2011, the town recorded 27 deaths related to river activities, forcing the government to step in with regulations. After that, Farmiloe said Vang Vieng has been receiving much more eclectic groups of tourists who enjoy a wider range of activities aside from nightlife. There are still a lot of young Western backpackers, but the town is also visited by many Chinese and South Koreans. Tour agencies scattered along the main streets advertised a range of packages offering the clear turquoise water of the Blue Lagoon, serene mountaintop views and many different caves. Those more adventurous try kayaking, zip line, paragliding or hot air balloons. Tubing is still there, but with far fewer riverbank bars to visit than in the past. Locals worry the incident could hit tourism Vang Vieng received more than 600,000 tourists in 2023, and expected to see even more this year, the state-owned Laos News Agency quoted the district governor as saying earlier this year. But with the latest tourist deaths, guesthouse owner Soutjai is a little worried. 'It’s about tourists and the confidence of tourists. The news was all around the world. There will definitely be an impact,' he said. Swedish tourist Anton Honkanen said what happened did affect his experience. 'I think it destroys the value of backpacking a little bit. Because everyone just enjoys this time. Maybe meeting some new people at the hostels, taking some drinks with all kinds of people from all around the world. And now I won’t do it today because of the poisoning,' he said. Svedberg, however, said what happened was unfortunate and shouldn’t stop people from coming. 'Things can happen anywhere, everywhere. So I think it doesn’t have to affect tourism. Just be cautious.' The Nana Backpacker Hostel, where the two Australian teens stayed, shut its gate on Saturday. It had not been allowed to take new guests since early this week and was accommodating the remaining visitors until Friday. Its manager and owner, who are Vietnamese, have been detained for questioning by the Lao police. Methanol is sometimes added to mixed drinks at disreputable bars as a cheaper alternative to ethanol, but can cause severe poisoning or death. It is also a byproduct of poorly distilled homebrew liquor, and could have found its way into bar drinks inadvertently. The Laotian government on Saturday officially acknowledged the case and promised to bring the perpetrators to justice.	https://apnews.com/article/laos-vang-vieng-methanol-poisoning-tourists-8b499ecc32faad18cf52e00f5691c744	2024-11-22T22:20:52-08:00	
Fighting between armed sectarian groups in restive northwestern Pakistan kills at least 33 people	PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) — Fighting between armed Sunni and Shiite groups in northwestern Pakistan killed at least 33 people and injured 25 others, a senior police officer from the region said Saturday. The overnight violence was the latest to rock Kurram, a district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, and comes days after a deadly gun ambush killed 42 people. Shiite Muslims make up about 15% of the 240 million people in Sunni-majority Pakistan, which has a history of sectarian animosity between the communities. Although the two groups generally live together peacefully, tensions remain, especially in Kurram. The senior police officer said armed men in Bagan and Bacha Kot torched shops, houses and government property. Intense gunfire was ongoing between the Alizai and Bagan tribes in the Lower Kurram area. 'Educational institutions in Kurram are closed due to the severe tension. Both sides are targeting each other with heavy and automatic weapons,' said the officer, who spoke anonymously because he was not authorized to speak to the media. Videos shared with The Associated Press showed a market engulfed by fire and orange flames piercing the night sky. Gunfire can also be heard. The location of Thursday’s attack was also targeted by armed men, who marched on the area. Survivors of the gun ambush said assailants emerged from a vehicle and sprayed buses and cars with bullets. Nobody has claimed responsibility for the attack and police have not identified a motive. Dozens of people from the district’s Sunni and Shiite communities have been killed since July, when a land dispute erupted in Kurram that later turned into general sectarian violence.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-sectarian-violence-kurram-aec6e365dd13de8e381740008fbd14b7	2024-11-22T22:16:35-08:00	
Japan holds first memorial for 'all workers' at Sado gold mines but blurs WWII atrocity. Why?	SADO, Japan (AP) — Japan held a memorial ceremony on Sunday near the Sado Island Gold Mines, listed this summer as a UNESCO World Heritage site after the country moved past years of historical disputes with South Korea and reluctantly acknowledged the mines' dark history. However, it has not offered an apology. At these mines, hundreds of Koreans were forced to labor under abusive and brutal conditions during World War II, historians say. Japanese officials at Sunday’s ceremony time paid tribute for the first to 'all workers' including Korean laborers who died at the mines, without acknowledging they were forced laborers — part of what critics call a persistent policy of whitewashing Japan's history of sexual and labor exploitation before and during the war. The ceremony, supposed to further mend wounds, renewed tensions between the two sides. South Korea boycotted Sunday's memorial service citing unspecified disagreements with Tokyo over the event. 'As a resident, I must say (their absence) is very disappointing after all the preparations we made,' said Sado Mayor Ryugo Watanabe. 'I wish we could have held the memorial with South Korean attendees.' The Associated Press explains the Sado mines, their history and the controversy. What are the Sado gold mines? The 16th-century mines on the island of Sado, about the size of the Pacific island of Guam, off the western coast of Niigata prefecture, operated for nearly 400 years, beginning in 1601, and were once the world’s largest gold producer. They closed in 1989. During the Edo period, from 1603 to 1868, the mines supplied gold currency to the ruling Tokugawa Shogunate. Today, the site has been developed into a tourist facility and hiking site where visitors can learn about the changes in mining technology and production methods while looking at the remains of mine shafts and ore dressing facilities. Critics say the Japanese government only highlights the glory of the mines and covers up its use of Korean victims of forced labor and their ordeals. The mines were registered as a cultural heritage site in July after Japan agreed to include an exhibit on the conditions of Korean forced laborers and to hold a memorial service annually after repeated protests from the South Korean government. A few signs have since been erected, indicating former sites of South Korean laborers’ dormitories. A city-operated museum in the area also added a section about Korean laborers, but a private museum attached to the main UNESCO site doesn't mention them at all. What's the controversy? At the UNESCO World Heritage Committee July meeting, the Japanese delegate said Tokyo had installed new exhibition material to explain the 'severe conditions of (the Korean laborers’) work and to remember their hardship.' Japan also acknowledged that Koreans were made to do more dangerous tasks in the mine shaft, which caused some to die. Those who survived also developed lung diseases and other health problems. Many of them were given meager food rations and nearly no days off and were caught by police if they escaped, historians say. But the Japanese government has refused to admit they were 'forced labor.' South Korea had earlier opposed the listing of the site for UNESCO World Heritage on the grounds that the Korean forced laborers used at the mines were missing from the exhibition. South Korea eventually supported the listing after consultations with Japan and Tokyo’s pledge to improve the historical background of the exhibit and to hold a memorial that also includes Koreans. Historians say Japan used hundreds of thousands of Korean laborers, including those forcibly brought from the Korean Peninsula, at Japanese mines and factories to make up for labor shortages because most working-age Japanese men had been sent to battlefronts across Asia and the Pacific. About 1,500 Koreans were forced to work at the Sado mines, according to Yasuto Takeuchi, an expert on Japan’s wartime history, citing wartime Japanese documents. The South Korean government has said it expects Japan to keep its pledge to be truthful to history and to show both sides of the Sado mines. 'The controversy surrounding the Sado mines exhibit underscores a deeper problem' of Japan’s failure to face up to its wartime responsibility and its growing 'denialism' of its wartime atrocities, Takeuchi said. Who did the ceremony commemorate? All workers who died at the Sado mines were honored. That includes hundreds of Korean laborers who worked there during Japan’s 1910-1945 colonization of the Korean Peninsula. At Sunday’s ceremony, four Japanese representatives, including central and local government officials and the head of the organizing group, thanked all mine workers for their sacrifice and mourned for those who died. None offered any apology to Korean forced laborers for the harsh treatment at the mines. Attendants observed a moment of silence for the victims who died at the mines due to accidents and other causes. The ceremony dredged up long-standing frustrations in South Korea. About 100 people, including officials from Japan’s local and central government, as well as South Korean Foreign Ministry officials and the relatives of Korean wartime laborers, were supposed to attend. Because of South Korea's last-minute boycott, more than 20 seats remained vacant. The Foreign Ministry said in a statement Saturday it was impossible to settle the disagreements between both governments before the planned event on Sunday, without specifying what those disagreements were. There has been speculation that the South Korean boycott might have been due to the presence of parliamentary vice minister Akiko Ikuina at Sunday's ceremony. In August 2022, Ikuina reportedly visited Tokyo’s controversial Yasukuni Shrine, weeks after she was elected as a lawmaker. Japan’s neighbors view Yasukuni, which commemorates 2.5 million war dead including war criminals, as a symbol of Japan’s past militarism. Her visit could have been seen as a sign of a lack of remorse. Some South Koreans criticized the Seoul government for throwing its support behind an event without securing a clear Japanese commitment to highlight the plight of Korean laborers. There were also complaints over South Korea agreeing to pay for the travel expenses of Korean victims’ family members who were invited to attend the ceremony. How has Japan faced up to its wartime atrocities? Critics say Japan’s government has long been reluctant to discuss wartime atrocities. That includes what historians describe as the sexual abuse and enslavement of women across Asia, many of them Koreans who were deceived into providing sex to Japanese soldiers at frontline brothels and euphemistically called 'comfort women,' and the Koreans who were mobilized and forced to work in Japan, especially in the final years of World War II. Korean compensation demands for Japanese atrocities during its brutal colonial rule have strained relations between the two Asian neighbors, most recently after a 2018 South Korean Supreme Court ruling ordered Japanese companies to pay damages over their wartime forced labor. Japan’s government has maintained that all wartime compensation issues between the two countries were resolved under the 1965 normalization treaty. Ties between Tokyo and Seoul have improved recently after Washington said their disputes over historical issues hampered crucial security cooperation as China’s threat grows in the region. South Korea’s conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol announced in March 2023 that his country would use a local corporate fund to compensate forced labor victims without demanding Japanese contributions. Japan’s then-Prime Minister Fumio Kishida later expressed sympathy for their suffering during a Seoul visit. Security, business and other ties between the sides have since rapidly resumed. Japan’s whitewashing of wartime atrocities has risen since the 2010s, particularly under the past government of revisionist leader Shinzo Abe. For instance, Japan says the terms 'sex slavery' and 'forced labor' are inaccurate and insists on the use of highly euphemistic terms such as 'comfort women' and 'civilian workers' instead. Takeuchi, the historian, said listing Japan’s modern industrial historical sites as a UNESCO World Heritage is a government push to increase tourism. The government, he said, wants 'to commercialize sites like the Sado mines by beautifying and justifying their history for Japan’s convenience.' ___ Associated Press writer Kim Tong-hyung in Seoul, South Korea contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-korea-unesco-sado-history-forced-labor-0218064869fb4a1270dad471432b9c46	2024-11-22T21:26:02-08:00	
Key UN committee adopts resolution paving the way for a first-ever treaty on crimes against humanity	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — A key U.N. General Assembly committee adopted a resolution late Friday paving the way for negotiations on a first-ever treaty on preventing and punishing crimes against humanity after Russia dropped amendments that would have derailed the effort. The resolution was approved by consensus by the assembly’s legal committee, which includes all 193-member U.N. nations, after tense last-minute negotiations between its supporters and Russia that dragged through the day. There was loud applause when the chairman of the committee gaveled the resolution’s approval. It is virtually certain to be adopted when the General Assembly puts it to a final vote on Dec. 4. 'Today’s agreement to start up negotiations on a much-needed international treaty is an historic achievement that was a long time coming,' Richard Dicker, Human Rights Watch’s senior legal adviser for advocacy, told The Associated Press. 'It sends a crucial message that impunity for the kinds of crimes inflicted on civilians in Ethiopia, Sudan, Ukraine, southern Israel, Gaza and Myanmar will not go unheeded,' he said. The resolution calls for a time-bound process with preparatory sessions in 2026 and 2027, and three-week negotiating sessions in 2028 and 2029 to finalize a treaty on crimes against humanity. Dicker said Russia’s proposed amendments left in question whether treaty negotiations would have been completed. Russia’s deputy U.N. ambassador Maria Zabolotskaya said Russia withdrew the amendments 'in a spirit of compromise.' But she said Russia 'dissociates itself from consensus.' 'This, of course, does not mean that we are not ready to work on this crucial convention,' Zabolotskaya told the committee. The International Criminal Court was established to punish major perpetrators of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide and it has 124 countries that are parties to it. The ICC says crimes against humanity are committed as part of a large-scale attack on civilians and it lists 15 forms including murder, rape, imprisonment, enforced disappearances, sexual slavery, torture and deportation. But the ICC does not have jurisdiction over nearly 70 other countries. There are global treaties that cover war crimes, genocide and torture — but there has been no specific treaty addressing crimes against humanity. And according to sponsors of the resolution, led by Mexico and Gambia and backed by 96 other countries, a new treaty will fill the gap. Kelly Adams, legal advisor at the Global Justice Center, also called the resolution 'a historic breakthrough' after many delays. Pointing to 'the proliferation of crimes against humanity around the world,' she expressed hope that a treaty will be 'strong, progressive and survivor-centric.' Amnesty International’s Secretary General Agnes Callamard expressed disappointment that the timeline had been extended until 2029, but said, 'What’s important is that this process will deliver a viable convention.' 'It is long overdue and all the more welcome at a time when too many states are intent on wrecking international law and universal standards,' she said. 'It is a clear sign that states are ready to reinforce the international justice framework and clamp down on safe havens from investigation and prosecution for perpetrators of these heinous crimes.' After the resolution’s adoption, Gambia’s Counselor Amadou Jaiteh, who had introduced it hours earlier, called its approval 'a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make a difference,' to hope for a world without crimes against humanity, 'and a world where voices of victims are heard louder than their perpetrators.'	https://apnews.com/article/un-crime-humanity-treaty-resolution-negotiations-punish-a2fbb38fb81bd96e7bc550dd04efc112	2024-11-22T21:07:45-08:00	
As fast fashion's waste pollutes Africa's environment, designers in Ghana are finding a solution	ACCRA, Ghana (AP) — In a sprawling secondhand clothing market in Ghana’s capital, early morning shoppers jostle as they search through piles of garments, eager to pluck a bargain or a designer find from the stalls selling used and low-quality apparel imported from the West. At the other end of the street, an upcycled fashion and thrifting festival unfolds with glamour and glitz. Models parade along a makeshift runway in outfits that designers created out of discarded materials from the Kantamanto market, ranging from floral blouses and denim jeans to leather bags, caps and socks. The festival is called Obroni Wawu October, using a phrase that in the local Akan language means 'dead white man’s clothes.' Organizers see the event as a small way to disrupt a destructive cycle that has made Western overconsumption into an environmental problem in Africa, where some of the worn-out clothes end up in waterways and garbage dumps. 'Instead of allowing (textile waste) to choke our gutters or beaches or landfills, I decided to use it to create something ... for us to use again,' said Richard Asante Palmer, one of the designers at the annual festival organized by the Or Foundation, a nonprofit that works at the intersection of environmental justice and fashion development. Ghana is one of Africa's leading importers of used clothing. It also ships some of what it gets from the United Kingdom, Canada, China and elsewhere to other West African nations, the United States and the U.K., according to the Ghana Used Clothing Dealers Association. Some of the imported clothes arrive in such poor shape, however, that vendors dispose of them to make room for the next shipments. On average, 40% of the millions of garments exported weekly to Ghana end up as waste, according to Neesha-Ann Longdon, the business manager for the Or Foundation’s executive director. The clothing dealers association, in a report published earlier this year on the socioeconomic and environmental impact of the nation’s secondhand clothing trade, cited a much lower estimate, saying only 5% of the items that reach Ghana in bulk are thrown out because they cannot be sold or reused. In many African countries, citizens typically buy preowned clothes — as well as used cars, phones and other necessities — because they cost less than new ones. Secondhand shopping also gives them a chance to score designer goods that most people in the region can only dream of. But neither Ghana's fast-growing population of 34 million people nor its overtaxed infrastructure is equipped to absorb the amount of cast-off attire entering the country. Mounds of textile waste litter beaches across the capital, Accra, and the lagoon which serves as the main outlet through which the city’s major drainage channels empty into the Gulf of Guinea. 'Fast fashion has taken over as the dominant mode of production, which is characterized here as higher volumes of lower-quality goods,' Longdon said. Jonathan Abbey, a fisherman in the area, said his nets often capture textile waste from the sea. Unsold used clothes 'aren’t even burned but are thrown into the Korle Lagoon, which then goes into the sea,' Abbey said. The ease of online shopping has sped up this waste cycle, according to Andrew Brooks, a King’s College London researcher and the author of 'Clothing Poverty: The Hidden World of Fast Fashion and Second-hand Clothes.' In countries like the U.K., unwanted purchases often end up as charity donations, but clothes are sometimes stolen from street donation bins and exported to places where the consumer demand is perceived to be higher, Brooks said. Authorities rarely investigate such theft because the clothes are 'seen as low-value items,' he said. Donors, meanwhile, think their castoffs are 'going to be recycled rather than reused, or given away rather than sold, or sold in the U.K. rather than exported overseas,' Brooks said. The volume of secondhand clothing sent to Africa has led to complaints of the continent being used as a dumping ground. In 2018, Rwanda raised tariffs on such imports in defiance of U.S. pressure, citing concerns the West's refuse undermined efforts to strengthen the domestic textile industry. Last year, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni said he would ban imports of clothing 'from dead people.' Trade restrictions might not go far in either reducing textile pollution or encouraging clothing production in Africa, where profits are low and incentives for designers are few, experts say. In the absence of adequate measures to stop the pollution, organizations like the Or Foundation are trying to make a difference by rallying young people and fashion creators to find a good use for scrapped materials. Ghana's beaches had hardly any discarded clothes on them before the country's waste management problems worsened in recent years, foundation co-founder Allison Bartella said. 'Fast forward to today, 2024, there are mountains of textile waste on the beaches,' she said.	https://apnews.com/article/ghana-fashion-waste-clothing-pollution-0809f25605722a53658bf21d7d9b1548	2024-11-22T19:10:38-08:00	
UN expert: Myanmar's desperate military ramps up attacks including beheadings, rapes and torture	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Myanmar’s desperate military junta is ramping up attacks on villages that have fallen to opposition groups, carrying out beheadings, gang rapes and torture, with women, children and the elderly among the victims, the U.N. independent human rights investigator for Myanmar said in a new report. Thomas Andrews, a former U.S. congressman from Maine, said in the report to the U.N. General Assembly circulated Friday that the junta has responded to military defeats and the loss of territory by using sophisticated weapons against civilians and seeking to destroy towns that it cannot control. Calling Myanmar 'an invisible crisis' because the world's attention is focused elsewhere, he said, 'Escalating atrocities against the people of Myanmar are being enabled by governments that allow, or actively support, the transfer of weapons, weapons materials, and jet fuel to junta forces.' Andrews didn’t name the governments. But he praised Singapore for cracking down on weapons transfers that has led to a 90% reduction by Singapore-registered companies, and said sanctions imposed by the United States on junta-controlled, state-owned banks have disrupted military supply chains. The U.N. special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar lamented, however, that their actions remain an exception. He called on all countries to address Myanmar’s 'devastating human rights and humanitarian crisis' by stopping the flow of weapons to the junta, stepping up humanitarian aid to millions in need, and supporting efforts to hold perpetrators accountable for human rights violations. Myanmar is racked by violence that began when the army ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021 and brutally suppressed nonviolent protests. That triggered armed resistance and combat across the country, with the military increasingly using airstrikes to counter the opposition and secure territory. The army is on the defensive against ethnic militias in much of Myanmar as well as hundreds of armed guerrilla groups collectively called the People’s Defense Forces, formed to fight to restore democracy. The military has said in the past that it only attacks legitimate targets of war and has accused the resistance forces of being terrorists. Andrews called the military junta’s plan to hold an election in late 2025 'a farcical parody' and 'thinly veiled attempt to create an impression of legitimacy and relieve international pressure.' He warned, 'Not only is this fraudulent attempt outrageous, it is dangerous, as it could lead to even greater levels of instability and violence.' He ticked off grim statistics: Over 3.1 million people are displaced by conflict and the junta’s human rights violations, and 18.6 million people need humanitarian assistance, including 13.3 million facing emergency levels of food insecurity. He said the junta's military forces have killed more than 5,800 civilians, destroyed over 100,000 homes and other civilian structures, and have kept more than 21,000 political prisoners languishing behind bars. 'Junta troops have killed civilians in ground assaults, including the mass killing of individuals already in the custody of junta forces,' Andrews said. 'Victims have been tortured, raped and beheaded, and their bodies burned.' Andrews, a human rights fellow at Yale Law School who was appointed by the Geneva-based Human Rights Council, said the situation was most 'desperate and dangerous' in Rakhine state in western Myanmar. Last November, the Arakan Army, which is seeking autonomy from Myanmar’s central government, began an offensive against the military in Rakhine and has gained control of more than half of its townships. The Arakan Army, which is the well-armed wing of the Rakhine ethnic minority movement, is also a member of the armed ethnic group alliance trying to topple the military. In the report, Andrews said: 'The Arakan Army has been implicated in grave human rights abuses, including indiscriminate attacks, killings, sexual violence and arbitrary arrests.' He also said the military has responded to the Arakan Army's steady losses in Rakhine by attacking civilians and raising tensions between the ethnic Rakhine and Rohingya communities. Buddhist-majority Myanmar has long considered the Rohingya Muslim minority to be 'Bengalis' from Bangladesh even though their families have lived in the country for generations. Nearly all have been denied citizenship since 1982. In August 2017, attacks by a Rohingya insurgent group on Myanmar security personnel triggered a brutal campaign by the military, which drove at least 740,000 Rohingya to Bangladesh. The military is accused of mass rape, killings and burning thousands of homes. Meanwhile, the military junta has conscripted thousands of Rohingya men and deployed them to the front lines to fight the Arakan Army, he said. And Rohingya militant groups have 'cynically aligned with the junta' and committed human rights abuses against the ethnic Rakhine population. 'Hundreds of thousands of people in Rakhine State are completely cut off from humanitarian assistance and threatened by exposure, starvation and disease,' Andrews warned. 'Failure to act immediately to provide emergency humanitarian aid will be a death sentence for untold numbers of innocent men, women and children.' A month ago, he said, Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, the interim leader of Bangladesh where 1 million Rohingya refugees live, called on U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to convene a conference with all key players in the Rohingya crisis. Yunus has pressed for their repatriation to Myanmar. Andrews urged Guterres to call a conference that could help 'seize the attention of a distracted world and mobilize the resources and action necessary to save the many lives that hang in the balance.'	https://apnews.com/article/un-myanmar-military-attacks-rights-violations-rohingya-f38f5e3f0a50d4ce64891fc6739fa8e5	2024-11-22T14:08:20-08:00	
US senator says Trump would laugh at Canada's military spending as Canadian security forum begins	HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) — A U.S. senator and supporter of Donald Trump said Friday the president-elect would laugh at Canada's current military spending plans and said the country must do more. Idaho Republican Sen. Jim Risch, ranking member of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, made the remarks at the start of the annual Halifax International Security Forum which attracts defense and security officials from Western democracies. According to NATO figures, Canada was estimated to be spending 1.33% of GDP on its military budget in 2023, below the 2% target that NATO countries have set for themselves. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said Canada will meet the alliance’s target by 2032. 'With all due respect. We're good with friends with Canada and they say ‘Well, we're working on this.' We say ‘What does that mean? And they say ’Well, we're kind of looking at 2032,'' Risch said during a panel discussion. 'If Trump were in this room you would get a large guffaw from him on 2032. It's got to be better than that. It truly, truly has to be better than that.' Canadian Defense Minister Bill Blair said his government knows it needs to increase defense spending, but he has to ensure Canada gets 'good value' for its investments. 'When our allies say they want us to meet the commitment, I’ve told them the answer is ‘Yes,’ and I’ve told them you’re pushing on an open door,' Blair said. 'We are going to make those investments.' Canada already plans to buy surveillance aircraft, helicopters and restock its ammunition supplies. And has plans to buy submarines in the future. Trudeau recently re-established a special Cabinet committee on Canada-U.S. relations to address his administration’s concerns about another Trump presidency. Former U.S. ambassador to Canada Kelly Craft said in the waning days of the U.S. presidential election campaign that Canada would be wise to accelerate its timeline for meeting its NATO spending commitments in the event of a Trump victory. Retired Lt.-Gen. Andrew Leslie — a former lawmaker in Trudeau's government — told a Parliament defense committee two days after the U.S. election that he detects 'no sense of urgency' from the government to meet those commitments. After Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in 2014, NATO allies agreed to halt budget cuts and move toward spending 2% of their gross domestic product on defense within a decade. Canada was barely spending 1% at the time. Last year, as it became clear that Russia’s war with Ukraine would grind on, they decided that 2% should be a spending minimum. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has said he expects around two thirds of the alliance’s 32 member countries to spend 2% of GDP on their defense budgets this year, up from just three countries a decade ago.	https://apnews.com/article/canada-trump-military-spending-d71d3e1ecd9571c224a85d041c775e8c	2024-11-22T13:27:18-08:00	
The man who ended Nadal's career helps the Netherlands take a Davis Cup lead against Germany	MALAGA, Spain (AP) — The last man to face — and beat — Rafael Nadal in professional tennis, 80th-ranked Botic van de Zandschulp, gave the Netherlands a 1-0 lead over Germany in the Davis Cup semifinals Friday by hanging on to defeat Daniel Altmaier 6-4, 6-7 (12), 6-3 on his 10th match point. 'At some point, I didn't know what to do any more on the match points,' van de Zandschulp said. 'I had the toughest match of my life on Tuesday (against Nadal), so everything that comes next is maybe a little bit easier.' He was up a set and a point from leading 5-2 in the second when Altmaier began playing more aggressively and interacting more with the German fans, yelling and throwing uppercuts or raising his arms after key points. In the tiebreaker, Altmaier managed to save five match points before converting his own fourth set point to extend the contest. But van de Zandschulp — who upset four-time Grand Slam champion Carlos Alcaraz at the U.S. Open — quickly moved out front in the final set, even if he needed five more match points in the last game before serving it out. The Dutch never have been to the team competition's final and would get there if Tallon Griekspoor managed to get past Jan-Lennard Struff of Germany in the second singles match. The other semifinal is Saturday, with No. 1-ranked Jannik Sinner and defending champion Italy taking on Australia. On Tuesday in the quarterfinals, van de Zandschulp outplayed Nadal for a 6-4, 6-4 result that marked the end of the 22-time Grand Slam champion's career because the Netherlands went on to eliminate Spain 2-1. The 38-year-old Nadal announced last month that the Davis Cup would be his final event before retiring. Presumably because people purchased tickets ahead of time with plans to watch Nadal compete in the semifinals, there were hundreds of unoccupied blue or gray seats surrounding the indoor hard court at the Palacio de Deportes Jose Maria Martina Carpena in southern Spain on Friday. Now truly a neutral site, the place was not nearly as loud and rowdy as on Tuesday, although there were shouts of 'Vamos, Rafa!' that drew laughter while van de Zandschulp played the 88th-ranked Altmaier. The Netherlands hadn't been as far as the semifinals since 2001. The Germans — whose best current player, two-time major finalist Alexander Zverev, opted not to participate — have won three Davis Cups but not since 1993, when 1991 Wimbledon champion Michael Stich led them to the title. ___ AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis	https://apnews.com/article/davis-cup-netherlands-germany-score-nadal-02cb8ce6f4ff632bf4742ec961df3731	2024-11-22T10:22:11-08:00	
Prominent figure from Canada's trucker protests against COVID-19 restrictions found guilty	OTTAWA, Ontario (AP) — One of the most prominent figures from Canada's trucker protests against COVID-19 restrictions in 2022 has been found guilty on five counts including mischief and disobeying a court order. A judge ruled Friday that Pat King was guilty on one count each of mischief, counseling others to commit mischief and counseling others to obstruct police. He was also found guilty on two counts of disobeying a court order. He could face up to 10 years in prison. Hundreds, sometimes thousands, of protesters clogged the streets of the capital, Ottawa, and besieged Parliament Hill for three weeks in early 2022, demonstrating against vaccine mandates for truckers and other precautions and condemning Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government. Members of the self-styled Freedom Convoy also blockaded U.S.-Canada border crossings in protest. The prosecution alleged King was a protest leader who was instrumental to the disruption in Ottawa. The prosecution alleged King coordinated the repeated bouts of honking, ordering the protesters to lay on the horn every 30 minutes for 10 minutes at a time, and told people to 'hold the line' when he was aware that police and the city had asked the truckers to leave. The prosecution's case relied mainly on King’s own videos, which he posted to social media throughout the protest to document the demonstration and communicate with those taking part. King’s lawyers argued that he was peacefully protesting and was not one of the demonstration's leaders. King was found not guilty on three counts of intimidation and one count of obstructing police himself. The truckers' convoy gridlocked downtown streets around Parliament Hill, with area residents complaining about the fumes from diesel engines running non-stop, and unrelenting noise from constant the honking of horns and music from parties. Trudeau's government ultimately invoked the Emergencies Act to try and bring an end to the protests. Ottawa Police brought in hundreds of officers from forces across Canada. The protests were first aimed at a COVID-19 vaccine mandate for cross-border truckers. They eventually encompassed fury over COVID-19 restrictions and dislike of Trudeau, reflecting the spread of disinformation in Canada and simmering populist and right-wing anger. The Freedom Convoy shook Canada’s reputation for civility, inspired convoys in France, New Zealand and the Netherlands and interrupted economic trade. For almost a week the busiest U.S.-Canada border crossing between Windsor, Ontario, and Detroit was blocked. It carries more than 25% of trade between the countries, who are each other's largest trading partners.	https://apnews.com/article/canada-truck-protests-freedom-convoy-ottawa-guilty-3975bb6bbd0c089e0c56cebbe9187fd2	2024-11-22T10:02:38-08:00	
Turkey removes two more pro-Kurdish mayors from office for links to banned group	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Turkey on Friday ousted two more elected pro-Kurdish mayors from office and replaced them with state-appointed administrators, citing terrorism-related charges against them. With their ouster, the number of elected mayors that have been sacked since October rose to six. An Interior Ministry statement said the mayor of the mainly Kurdish-populated provincial capital of Tunceli was removed from office due to his past conviction and an ongoing investigation for links to the banned Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK. The district mayor for Ovacik, in Tunceli province, was sacked due to his past conviction of membership in the PKK, the statement said. The two mayors belong to the pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Equality and Democracy Party, or DEM, which is the third-largest party represented in Parliament. They were elected to office in local elections in March. Among those previously ousted was the mayor of Esenyurt, a district in Istanbul, who is a member of the main opposition Republican People’s Party, CHP. The mayor, Ahmet Ozer, was arrested last month, for alleged connections to the PKK. Several other pro-Kurdish mayors have similarly been ousted from office following past elections. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s government has defended the mayors' removals saying they are part of efforts to maintain security. Opposition parties and human rights groups, however, accuse the government of undermining democracy and say the charges brought against the mayors are often politically motivated. The PKK, which has led an armed insurgency against the Turkish state since the 1980s, is designated a terrorist organization by Turkey, the United States and the European Union. The conflict has killed tens of thousands of people.	https://apnews.com/article/turkey-sacks-prokurdish-mayors-3c6c33fd7fa2d86c9dc34089e6a98c9b	2024-11-22T09:54:28-08:00	
2 convicted in human smuggling case after Indian family froze to death on US-Canada border	FERGUS FALLS, Minn. (AP) — A jury convicted two men of charges related to human smuggling for their roles in an international operation that led to the deaths of a family of Indian migrants who froze while trying to cross the Canada-U.S. border during a 2022 blizzard. Harshkumar Ramanlal Patel, 29, an Indian national who prosecutors say went by the alias 'Dirty Harry,' and Steve Shand, 50, an American from Florida, were part of a sophisticated illegal operation that has brought increasing numbers of Indians into the U.S., prosecutors said. They were each convicted on four counts related to human smuggling, including conspiracy to bring migrants into the country illegally. 'This trial exposed the unthinkable cruelty of human smuggling and of those criminal organizations that value profit and greed over humanity,' Minnesota U.S. Attorney Andy Luger said. 'To earn a few thousand dollars, these traffickers put men, women and children in extraordinary peril leading to the horrific and tragic deaths of an entire family. Because of this unimaginable greed, a father, a mother and two children froze to death in sub-zero temperatures on the Minnesota-Canadian border,' Luger added. The most serious counts carry maximum sentences of up to 20 years in prison, the U.S. Attorney’s Office told The Associated Press before the trial. But federal sentencing guidelines rely on complicated formulas. Luger said Friday that various factors will be considered in determining what sentences prosecutors will recommend. Federal prosecutors said 39-year-old Jagdish Patel; his wife, Vaishaliben, who was in her mid-30s; their 11-year-old daughter, Vihangi; and 3-year-old son, Dharmik, froze to death Jan. 19, 2022, while trying to cross the border into Minnesota in a scheme Patel and Shand organized. Patel is a common Indian surname, and the victims were not related to Harshkumar Patel. The couple were schoolteachers, local news reports said. The family was fairly well off by local standards, living in a well-kept, two-story house with a front patio and a wide veranda. Experts say illegal immigration from India is driven by everything from political repression to a dysfunctional American immigration system that can take years, if not decades, to navigate legally. Much is rooted in economics and how even low-wage jobs in the West can ignite hopes for a better life. Before the jury’s conviction on Friday, the federal trial in Fergus Falls, Minnesota, saw testimony from an alleged participant in the smuggling ring, a survivor of the treacherous journey across the northern border, border patrol agents and forensic experts. Defense attorneys were pitted against each other, with Shand’s team arguing that he was unwittingly roped into the scheme by Patel. Patel’s lawyers, The Canadian Press reported, said their client had been misidentified. They said 'Dirty Hary,' the alleged nickname for Patel found in Shand’s phone, is a different person. Bank records and witness testimony from those who encountered Shand near the border didn’t tie him to the crime, they added. Prosecutors said Patel coordinated the operation while Shand was a driver. Shand was to pick up 11 Indian migrants on the Minnesota side of the border, prosecutors said. Only seven survived the foot crossing. Canadian authorities found two parents and their young children later that morning, dead from the cold. The trial included an inside account of how the international smuggling ring allegedly works and who it targets. Rajinder Singh, 51, testified that he made over $400,000 smuggling over 500 people through the same network that included Patel and Shand. Singh said most of the people he smuggled came from Gujarat state. He said the migrants would often pay smugglers about $100,000 to get them from India to the U.S., where they would work to pay off their debts at low-wage jobs in cities around the country. Singh said the smugglers would run their finances through 'hawala,' an informal money transfer system that relies on trust. The pipeline of illegal immigration from India has long existed but has increased sharply along the U.S.-Canada border. The U.S. Border Patrol arrested more than 14,000 Indians on the Canadian border in the year ending Sept. 30, which amounted to 60% of all arrests along that border and more than 10 times the number two years ago. By 2022, the Pew Research Center estimates more than 725,000 Indians were living illegally in the U.S., behind only Mexicans and El Salvadorans. Jamie Holt, a Special Agent with Homeland Security Investigations, said the case is a stark reminder of the realities victims of human smuggling face. 'Human smuggling is a vile crime that preys on the most vulnerable, exploiting their desperation and dreams for a better life,' Holt said. 'The suffering endured by this family is unimaginable and it is our duty to ensure that such atrocities are met with the full force of the law.' One juror Kevin Paul, of Clearwater, Minnesota, told reporters afterward that it was hard for the jurors to see the pictures of the family’s bodies. He said he grew up in North Dakota and is familiar with the kind of conditions that led to their deaths. 'It’s pretty brutal,' Paul said. 'I couldn’t imagine having to do what they had to do out there in the middle of nowhere.'	https://apnews.com/article/immigration-canada-india-smuggling-deaths-trial-verdict-de2f999332e6cc8be1ea78c7fdfb6590	2024-11-22T09:11:01-08:00	
Conor McGregor must pay woman $250K in sexual assault case, civil jury rules	LONDON (AP) — A woman who claimed mixed martial arts fighter Conor McGregor 'brutally raped and battered' her in a Dublin hotel penthouse was awarded nearly 250,000 Euros ($257,000) on Friday by a civil court jury in Ireland. Nikita Hand said the Dec. 9, 2018, assault after a night of partying left her heavily bruised and suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. McGregor testified that he never forced the woman to do anything against her will and said she fabricated the allegations after the two had consensual sex. His lawyer had called Hand a gold digger. The fighter, once the face of the Ultimate Fighting Championship but now past his prime, shook his head as the jury of eight women and four men returned the verdict after deliberating for about six hours in the High Court in Dublin. He was mobbed by cameras as he left court but did not comment. He later said on the social platform X that he would appeal the verdict and the 'modest award.' Hand's voice cracked and her hands trembled as she read a statement outside the courthouse, saying she would never forget what happened to her but would now be able to move on with her life. She thanked her family, partner, friends, jurors, the judge and all the supporters that had reached out to her online, but particularly her daughter. 'She has given me so much strength and courage over the last six years throughout this nightmare to keep on pushing forward for justice,' she said. 'I want to show (her) and every other girl and boy that you can stand up for yourself if something happens to you, no matter who the person is, and justice will be served.' The Associated Press generally does not name victims of sexual assaults unless they come forward publicly, as Hand has done. Under Irish law, she did not have the anonymity she would have been granted in a criminal proceeding and was named publicly throughout the trial. Her lawyer told jurors that McGregor was angry about a fight he had lost in Las Vegas two months earlier and took it out on his client. 'He’s not a man, he’s a coward,' attorney John Gordon said in his closing speech. 'A devious coward and you should treat him for what he is.' Gordon said his client never pretended to be a saint and was only looking to have fun when she sent McGregor a message through Instagram after attending a Christmas party. He said Hand knew McGregor socially and that they had grown up in the same area. She said he picked her and a friend up in a car and shared cocaine with them, which McGregor admitted in court, on the way to the Beacon Hotel. Hand said she told McGregor she didn't want to have sex with him and that she was menstruating. She said she told him 'no' as he started kissing her but he eventually pinned her to a bed and she couldn't move. McGregor put her in a chokehold and later told her, 'now you know how I felt in the octagon where I tapped out three times,' referring to a UFC match when he had to admit defeat, she said. Hand had to take several breaks in emotional testimony over three days. She said McGregor threatened to kill her during the encounter and she feared she would never see her young daughter again. Eventually, he let go of her. 'I remember saying I was sorry, as I felt that I did something wrong and I wanted to reassure him that I wouldn’t tell anyone so he wouldn’t hurt me again,' she testified. She said she then let him do what he wanted and he had sex with her. A paramedic who examined Hand the next day testified that she had never before seen someone with that intensity of bruising. A doctor told jurors Hand had multiple injuries. Hand said the trauma of the attack had left her unable to work as a hairdresser, she fell behind on her mortgage and had to move out of her house. Police investigated the woman’s complaint but prosecutors declined to bring charges, saying there was insufficient evidence and a conviction was unlikely. McGregor, in his post on X, said he was disappointed jurors didn't see all the evidence prosecutors had reviewed. He testified that the two had athletic and vigorous sex, but that it was not rough. He said 'she never said ‘no’ or stopped' and testified that everything she said was a lie. 'It is a full blown lie among many lies,' he said when asked about the chokehold allegation. 'How anyone could believe that me, as a prideful person, would highlight my shortcomings.' McGregor’s lawyer told jurors they had to set aside their animus toward the fighter. 'You may have an active dislike of him, some of you may even loathe him – there is no point pretending that the situation might be otherwise,' attorney Remy Farrell said. 'I’m not asking you to invite him to Sunday brunch.' The defense said the woman never told investigators McGregor threatened her life. They also showed surveillance video in court that they said appeared to show the woman kiss McGregor’s arm and hug him after they left the hotel room. Farrell said she looked 'happy, happy, happy.' McGregor said he was 'beyond petrified' when first questioned by police and read them a prepared statement. On the advice of his lawyer, he refused to answer more than 100 follow-up questions. The jury ruled against Hand in a case she brought against one of McGregor’s friends, James Lawrence, whom she accused of having sex with her in the hotel without consent.	https://apnews.com/article/conor-mcgregor-rape-civil-trial-lawsuit-dublin-hotel-97f27bbf98734f02a7fd392efca0a3ca	2024-11-22T07:57:42-08:00	
A Norwegian student has been arrested on charges of spying on the US for Russia	OSLO, Norway (AP) — A Norwegian student in his 20s was arrested on suspicion of spying for Russia and Iran while working as a guard at the U.S. Embassy in Oslo, authorities in Norway have said. The man, who has not been identified, was ordered to be held in custody for four weeks. He runs a security company jointly with a dual national of Norway and an unspecified eastern European country, according to Norwegian public broadcaster NRK. Oslo police said Friday they would review the company's operating license. Norway's domestic intelligence agency, PST, said Thursday night that the man was arrested in his garage at home on Wednesday on suspicion of having damaged national security with his intelligence-related activity. The arrest warrant from the district court, says, among other things, that the police found records of the man's assignment dialogue with a person who was apparently guiding his espionage activity, according to NRK. The man has admitted to collecting and sharing information with Russian and Iranian authorities, the court order says, according to NRK. It is too early to talk about the details of the man's activity, PST spokesman Thomas Blom told a news conference Thursday night. PST has confirmed the man was employed as a security guard at the U.S. Embassy in Oslo. There are no other suspects in the case at this point. The suspect's attorney, John Christian Elden, told NRK that the man admits he worked for a foreign country but does not plead guilty of espionage. 'He is charged with having obtained information that could harm the security situation of third countries,' Elden said. It was revealed Friday that the man is studying for a bachelor's degree in security and preparedness at Norway’s Arctic University, UiT. It is a second such case at UiT in recent years, according to NRK. One of the people the West swapped with Russia in a major prisoner exchange in August was a UiT guest researcher who claimed to be a Brazilian named José Assis Giammaria, arrested on espionage allegations in 2022. The police revealed him to be Russian, Mikhail Valeryevich Mikushin. Norway has a 198-kilometer (123-mile) -long border with Russia in the Arctic. Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Norway has heavily restricted entry for Russian nationals. In September, the Norwegian government said it was considering a plan to build a fence along all or part of its border with Russia.	https://apnews.com/article/us-russia-espionage-arrest-embassy-norway-arctic-9aabf55ae20cffc9082df002a9976e0a	2024-11-22T06:04:08-08:00	
Middle East latest: Israeli strikes kill a hospital director in Lebanon and wound 6 medics in Gaza	Israeli airstrikes killed a hospital director at his home in northeastern Lebanon and six others, while at least five paramedics were killed by Israeli strikes in the country's south on Friday, Lebanon's Health Ministry said. The United Nations reported heavy clashes between Israeli troops and Hezbollah fighters in southern Lebanon. Four Italian peacekeepers were lightly wounded when a rocket, likely fired by Hezbollah, hit their base, the U.N. said. A full-blown war between Israel and Hezbollah erupted in September after nearly a year of lower-intensity conflict. More than 3,640 people have been killed in Lebanon and 15,350 wounded, the majority following Israel’s escalation and ground invasion, the Health Ministry said Friday. In Gaza, Israeli strikes hit Kamal Adwan Hospital, one of the few hospitals still partially operating in the northernmost part of the territory, wounding six medical staff and damaging its generator and oxygen systems, the hospital director said Friday. More than 44,000 Palestinians have been killed in the Gaza Strip, the Health Ministry said. It does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count, but it has said that more than half of the fatalities are women and children. Israel launched the war in Gaza after Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. ___ Here’s the Latest: Israeli airstrikes kill a hospital director and 5 paramedics in Lebanon BEIRUT — An Israeli airstrike killed the director of a university hospital and six others at his home in northeastern Lebanon, state media said. The strike targeted Dr. Ali Allam’s house near Dar Al-Amal Hospital, the largest health center in Baalbek-Hermel province, which has provided vital health services amid Israel's campaign of airstrikes, the Health Ministry said. State-run media reported that the strike came without warning. The ministry described his death as a 'great loss,' and provincial governor Bachir Khodr said in a post on X that, 'Mr. Allam was one of the best citizens of Baalbek.' In two separate episodes on Friday, Israeli airstrikes in southern Lebanon killed five paramedics with Hezbollah's medical arm, the Health Ministry said, describing it as 'war crime.' The militant group provides extensive social services, including running schools and health clinics. In a report published Friday, the World Health Organization said nearly half of all attacks on health care in Lebanon since Oct. 7, 2023, have resulted in fatalities. 'This is a higher percentage than in any active conflict today across the globe,' WHO said. In Lebanon, 226 health workers and patients were killed and 199 were injured between Oct. 7, 2023 and Nov. 18, 2024, the report said. The Health Ministry said Friday that 3,645 people have been killed in nearly 14 months of war between Hezbollah and Israel, while 15,356 were wounded, the majority following Israel’s escalation in late September. The death count includes 692 women and 231 children. Israeli strike on besieged hospital in northern Gaza wounds six medics DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Israeli strikes hit Kamal Adwan Hospital, one of the few hospitals still partially operating in the northernmost part of Gaza, wounding six medical staff and damaging its generator and oxygen systems, its director said Friday. Hossam Abu Safiya said the strikes before dawn Friday hit the entrance of the emergency unit as well as in the hospital courtyard. He said two members of the nursing staff suffered critical injuries. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. Abu Safiya said the strikes caused damage to the functioning of the generator and disrupted oxygen supplies. The hospital is currently treating 85 wounded, 14 children in the pediatric ward and four newborns in the neonatal unit, he said. During the past month, Kamal Adwan Hospital has been hit several times, was put under siege and raided by Israeli troops, who are waging a heavy offensive in the nearby Jabaliya refugee camp and towns of Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya. The Israeli military says it detained Hamas fighters hiding in the hospital, a claim its staff denies. UN offers details on rocket fire that wounded four Italian peacekeepers in Lebanon UNITED NATIONS – Two rockets hit a headquarters of the U.N. peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon, injuring four Italian peacekeepers, the United Nations says. U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the rockets were likely launched by Hezbollah militants or by affiliated groups Friday, impacting a bunker and a logistics area in the southwest headquarters at Chamaa. One of the structures that was hit caught fire, and the blaze was swiftly put out by U.N. staff, he said. According to Italy’s Defense Ministry, some glass shattered due to the explosion, hitting the four soldiers. Dujarric said the four injured peacekeepers were receiving treatment at the medical facility of the mission, known as UNIFIL. 'Thankfully, none of the injuries are life-threatening,' he said. Italy’s Defense Minister Guido Crosetto called the attack on the UNIFIL base 'intolerable.' He reiterated that the Italian contingent remains in southern Lebanon 'to offer a window of opportunity for peace, and cannot become hostage to militia attacks.' Dujarric said Friday’s attack was the third on Chamaa in a week and came amid heavy shelling and ground skirmishes in the Chamaa and Naqoura areas in recent days. UNIFIL’s main headquarters is in Naqoura. Friday’s attack follows a rocket attack on a UNIFIL base east of the village of Ramyah on Tuesday that injured four peacekeepers from Ghana. Dujarric said UNIFIL strongly urges Hezbollah and its affiliates and Israel to avoid fighting near its positions, which are supposed to be protected. 'We remind all parties that any attack against peacekeepers constitutes a serious violation of international law' and the U.N. Security Council resolution that ended the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war, he said. Israeli airstrikes pound southern Beirut and Tyre BEIRUT — Israeli airstrikes hit Beirut’s southern suburbs and the southern port city of Tyre on Friday, after the Israeli army issued several evacuation warnings saying it is targeting Hezbollah sites. The strikes in Beirut came dangerously close to central Beirut and Christian neighborhoods. One strike hit a building housing a gym and medical and beauty clinics, located just meters (yards) from a Lebanese army base. 'What is there in the building to target? This attack they carried out on us in this building is a criminal and vile act,' resident Hassan Najdi told The Associated Press. 'Because if their intention is targeting Hezbollah, this building has nothing to do with Hezbollah.' Najdi said he purchased an apartment in the building last year but had not yet moved in. He allowed a displaced family to move in and urgently asked them to evacuate after receiving the Israeli warning. The blasts sent plumes of smoke into the air and shattered glass in the vicinity. No casualties have been reported, but the strikes caused damage to nearby infrastructure and a key road connecting central Beirut to its southern suburbs. 'We remain steadfast,' said Ali Daher, an employee at a mall facing the targeted building. 'Everything that is lost can be replaced, and whatever is destroyed can be rebuilt in (no time).' In Tyre city, the Israeli military conducted multiple airstrikes after a series of warnings, claiming the targets belonged to Hezbollah’s Aziz unit, accusing it of firing projectiles into Israel. The Israeli military carried out other airstrikes across Lebanon, many without warnings, as heavy fighting between Israeli troops and Hezbollah in villages along the Lebanon-Israel border intensified. Italy plans to discuss Netanyahu arrest warrants with G7 ministers ROME — Italy said Friday it plans to discuss the arrest warrants issued by the International Criminal Court over the Israel-Hamas war when it hosts Group of Seven foreign ministers next week. Premier Giorgia Meloni insisted that one point remained clear for Italy: 'There can be no equivalence between the responsibilities of the state of Israel and the terrorist organization of Hamas.' Italy is a founding member of the court and hosted the 1998 Rome conference that gave birth to it. But Meloni’s right-wing government has been a strong supporter of Israel after the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks, while also providing humanitarian aid for Palestinians in Gaza. In a statement Friday, Meloni said Italy would study the reasonings behind the decision to issue arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his former defense minister and Hamas’ military chief. Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said Italy respects the ICC and supports it. 'But at the same time we are also convinced that the court must have a judicial role, and should not take up a political role.' Tajani will host G7 foreign ministers Monday and Tuesday outside Rome for the final meeting of the Italian G7 presidency. 'As far as decisions are concerned, we will take them together with our allies,' Tajani said. During the G7 meetings, 'we will talk about this with my allies there, and we will see what to do next.' Another member of the governing coalition, the outspoken Transport Minister Matteo Salvini was more defiant in supporting Israel. 'If Netanyahu comes to Italy he will be welcomed,' Salvini was quoted by Italian media as saying. ___ This item has been updated to correct that Salvini spoke of a potential Netanyahu visit to Italy, not Israel. 4 Italian soldiers injured after UN peacekeeping base in Lebanon was hit ROME — Four Italian soldiers were slightly injured after two exploding rockets hit the United Nations' peacekeeping mission base on Friday in Chamaa in southern Lebanon, Italy's defense ministry said. Initial information suggested that two rockets hit a bunker and a room of the mission base, damaging the surrounding infrastructure, the ministry said. Shattered glass hit the four soldiers. The incident was the latest in which UN peacekeeping posts have been hit since Israel began its ground invasion of Lebanon on Oct. 1, leaving a number of peacekeepers wounded. Defence Minister Guido Crosetto called Friday's attack 'intolerable.' He said he will try to speak to the new Israeli Defense Minister to ask him 'to avoid using the UNIFIL bases as a shield.' Crosetto said the conditions of the four Italian soldiers 'did not cause concern.' He reiterated that the Italian contingent remains in southern Lebanon 'to offer a window of opportunity for peace and cannot become hostage to militia attacks.' Italy’s Premier Giorgia Meloni on Friday said she learned about the new attack with 'deep indignation and concern.' Meloni reiterated that 'such attacks are unacceptable,' renewing her appeal for the parties on the ground 'to guarantee, at all times, the safety of UNIFIL soldiers and to collaborate to quickly identify those responsible.' Almost half of attacks on heath care in Lebanon have been deadly, WHO says GENEVA — The World Health Organization says nearly half of the attacks on health care in Lebanon have been deadly since the Middle East conflict erupted in October last year, the highest such rate anywhere in the world. The U.N. health agency says 65 out of 137, or 47%, of recorded 'attacks on health care' in Lebanon over that time period have proven fatal to at least one person, and often many more. WHO’s running global tally counts attacks, whether deliberate or not, that affect places like hospitals, clinics, medical transport, and warehouses for medical supplies, as well as medics, doctors, nurses and the patients they treat. Nearly half of attacks on health care in Lebanon since last October and the majority of deaths occurred since an intensified Israeli military campaign began against Hezbollah militants in the country two months ago. The health agency said 226 health workers and patients have been killed and 199 injured in Lebanon between Oct. 7, 2023 and this Monday. Israeli defense minister says he will end detention without charge of Jewish settlers JERUSALEM — Israel’s new defense minister said Friday that he would stop issuing warrants to arrest West Bank settlers or hold them without charge or trial — a largely symbolic move that rights groups said risks emboldening settler violence in the Israeli-occupied territory. Israel Katz called the arrest warrants 'severe' and said issuing them was 'inappropriate' as Palestinian militant attacks on settlers in the territory grow more frequent. He said settlers could be 'brought to justice' in other ways. The move protects Israeli settlers from being held in 'administrative detention,' a shadowy form of incarceration where people are held without charge or trial. Settlers are rarely arrested in the West Bank, where settler violence against Palestinians has spiraled since the outbreak of the war Oct. 7. Katz’s decision was celebrated by far-right coalition allies of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. National Security Minister and settler firebrand Itamar Ben-Gvir applauded Katz and called the move a 'correction of many years of mistreatment' and 'justice for those who love the land.' Since Oct. 7, 2023, violence toward Palestinians by Israeli settlers has soared to new heights, displacing at least 19 entire Palestinian communities, according to Israeli rights group Peace Now. In that time, attacks by Palestinian militants on settlers and within Israel have also grown more common. An increasing number of Palestinians have been placed in administrative detention. Israel holds 3,443 administrative detainees in prison, according to data from the Israeli Prison Service, reported by rights group Hamoked. That figure stood around 1,200 just before the start of the war. The vast majority of them are Palestinian, with only a handful at any given time Israeli Jews, said Jessica Montell, the director of Hamoked. 'All of these detentions without charge or trial are illegitimate, but to declare that this measure will only be used against Palestinians...is to explicitly entrench another form of ethnic discrimination,' said Montell. German official suggests Germany would be reluctant to arrest Netanyahu on ICC warrant BERLIN — A German official has suggested that his country would be reluctant to arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on a warrant issued by the International Criminal Court. The ICC’s warrants for Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant put Germany, a staunch ally of Israel, in an awkward position. The government said in a statement Friday that it is one of the ICC’s biggest supporters, but 'at the same time, it is a consequence of German history that unique relations and a great responsibility connect us with Israel.' The government said it takes note of the arrest warrants and that 'we will examine conscientiously the domestic steps.' It said that any further steps would only be an issue if a visit by Netanyahu or Gallant were 'foreseeable.' Government spokesperson Steffen Hebestreit was pressed repeatedly at a regular news conference on whether it would be conceivable to arrest an Israeli prime minister. He replied: 'It’s hard for me to imagine that we would carry out arrests in Germany on this basis.' Kremlin calls ICC warrant decision ‘insignificant’ for Russia Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Friday refused to comment on the International Criminal Court’s arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others, saying that the court's rulings are 'insignificant' for Russia, which doesn’t recognizes the court’s jurisdiction. The ICC last year issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin and a number of other top Russian officials, accusing them of war crimes in Ukraine. The Kremlin has brushed off the warrants, saying that in Moscow’s eyes they’re 'null and void.' Asked if the ICC warrants for Netanyahu and others can help resolve the tensions in the Middle East, Peskov said: 'Well, in general, the actions of the ICC are unlikely to help anything. That’s the first thing. And secondly, we don’t see any point in commenting on this in any way, because for us these rulings are insignificant.' Crowds in Gaza are desperate for bread amid food shortages and huge price hikes DEIR AL-BALAH, The Gaza Strip — Large crowds of displaced people crammed themselves in front of a bakery in the Gaza Strip for the second day in a row, desperate to get their share of bread after bakeries closed for five days due to a flour shortage and the lack of aid. 'I am a 61-year-old man. This is the third day that I have come to Zadna Bakery and I still cannot get bread … I have children to feed,' said Majdi Yaghi, a displaced man from Gaza City. The price of a small bag of pita bread increased to $16 by Friday, a stark increase from about 80 cents last month. A bag of pasta now costs $4 and a small bag of sugar costs nearly $14. That has left many Palestinian families surviving on one meal a day and reliant on charitable kitchens to survive. In Khan Younis, women and children lined up at the al-Dalu charitable kitchen for bulgur, the only food available at the makeshift charity. One of the workers there, Anas al-Dalu, told the AP that they cook ten pots every day of either rice, beans, or bulgur. But that hardly fills the need for the thousands of people displaced in the area. 'The charity here is in a difficult situation. It is a drop in the ocean, and there is no aid or charities. There is nothing,' said Nour Kanani, a displaced man from Khan Younis. 'It is a crisis in every sense of the word. There is no flour, no charities, and no food.' UN monitoring heavy clashes in south Lebanon locations BEIRUT — Israeli troops fought fierce battles with Hezbollah fighters on Friday in different areas in south Lebanon, including a coastal town that is home to the headquarters of U.N. peacekeepers. A spokesman for the U.N. peacekeeping force known as UNIFIL told The Associated Press that they are monitoring 'heavy clashes' in the coastal town of Naqoura and the village of Chamaa to the northeast. UNIFIL’s headquarters are located in Naqoura in Lebanon’s southern edge close to the border with Israel. 'We are aware of heavy shelling in the vicinity of our bases,' UNIFIL spokesman Andrea Tenenti said. Asked if the peacekeepers and staff at the headquarters are safe, Tenenti said: 'Yes for the moment.' Several UNIFIL posts have been hit since Israel began its ground invasion of Lebanon on Oct. 1, leaving a number of peacekeepers wounded.	https://apnews.com/article/mideast-lebanon-hezbollah-israel-gaza-war-3ae91e1af419bfbb9f4cd661ee88f96b	2024-11-22T03:22:15-08:00	
Pakistani city mourns 42 Shiite Muslims who were ambushed and killed in a gun attack	PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) — Protesters in Pakistan's restive northwest chanted anti-government slogans Friday as funeral prayers were held for 42 Shiite Muslims who were ambushed and killed by gunmen a day earlier in one of the region's deadliest such assaults in recent years. The victims were traveling in a convoy of several vehicles from the northwestern city of Parachinar to Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, when the attack took place Thursday. Those killed included six women and 20 others were injured. Survivors said the assailants emerged from a vehicle and sprayed the buses and cars with bullets. Nobody has claimed responsibility for the attack and police have not identified a motive. Thursday’s attack took place in Kurram, an area where Shiite Muslims dominate. Sectarian clashes between the group and Pakistan’s majority Sunni Muslims have killed dozens of people in recent months. Tribal elder Jalal Bangash said the bodies began arriving in the city Thursday evening. The Shiite community group Anjuman Hussainia Parachinar announced three days of mourning. Coffins were draped in white cloth that bore red calligraphy. It read 'Labbaik ya Hussein,' a Shiite expression in remembrance of the 7th-century martyrdom of the Prophet Muhammad’s grandson, Hussein, that gave birth to their faith. Locals carried the coffins aloft through Parachinar as people thronged the streets. Markets, shops, roads and schools were closed. Locals and relatives of the victims staged a sit-in, demanding action against the perpetrators. Ali Ghulam lost his nephew in the attack. 'He was a very innocent and noble man, only 40, and left behind small kids,' said Ghulam. 'He was working to feed his children, he never fought with anyone. Now we are worried about his family and what we will do for them.' Protests kicked off in parts of the city, with people chanting anti-government slogans. Some people set alight check posts and the gate at the entrance of the city. Elders have called for calm. Shiite Muslims make up about 15% of the 240 million population of Sunni-majority Pakistan, which has a history of sectarian animosity between the communities. Although the two groups generally live together peacefully, tensions have existed for decades in some areas, especially in parts of Kurram. Dozens of people from both sides have been killed since July when a land dispute erupted in Kurram that later turned into general sectarian violence.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-violence-kurram-shiite-muslims-2540207f07ce011159ed8da5188541ed	2024-11-22T02:12:53-08:00	
More aid workers have been killed in 2024 than in any other year, UN says	GENEVA (AP) — More aid workers, health care staffers, delivery personnel and other humanitarians have been killed in 2024 than in any other single year, the United Nations reported Friday. Bloodshed in the Middle East has been the single-biggest cause of the 281 deaths among humanitarians globally this year, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. 'Before the year is even over, 2024 has become the deadliest on record for humanitarian personnel worldwide,' OCHA spokesman Jens Laerke said. He told reporters in Geneva the figure surpassed the previous record of 280 deaths for the whole of last year. Humanitarians 'are working courageously and selflessly in places like Gaza, Sudan, Lebanon, Ukraine and so on. They show the best humanity has to offer, and they are getting killed in return — in record numbers,' he said. 'These numbers will send shockwaves around the humanitarian community, especially on the front lines of the response,' he added. The U.N. said the figures come from the Aid Worker Security Database, a U.S.-funded project run by a Britain-based group called Humanitarian Outcomes. A total of 268 of the humanitarians killed — including from non-U.N. organizations like the Red Cross and Red Crescent — were national staff, while 13 were international staff. Some 230 aid workers have been killed in occupied Palestinian areas, the database showed Friday. It did not break out whether that was Gaza or the West Bank. Laerke said the threats to aid workers 'extend beyond Gaza, with high levels of violence, kidnappings injuries, harassment and arbitrary detention' reported in Afghanistan, Congo, South Sudan, Sudan, Ukraine, Yemen and elsewhere. OCHA said a total of 333 humanitarians have been killed since the latest conflict between Israel and the militant Hamas group erupted when the militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. The death toll in the Gaza Strip from the 13-month-old war has surpassed 44,000, local health officials said Thursday. The Gaza Health Ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count, but it has said that more than half of the fatalities are women and children. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence.	https://apnews.com/article/ocha-humanitarians-killed-mideast-e99439359808d1290cf80cb8236bdef0	2024-11-22T01:56:29-08:00	
Ukraine's parliament cancels session after Russia fired a new missile	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine's parliament canceled a session on Friday as security was tightened after Russia deployed a new ballistic missile that threatens to escalate the nearly three-year war. NATO and Ukraine will hold emergency talks next Tuesday, the alliance said, following a request from Ukraine. The meeting will be held at the level of ambassadors and will most likely address the new missile threat. Russian troops also struck Sumy with Shahed drones overnight, killing two people and injuring 12 more, the regional administration said Friday morning. The attack targeted a residential district of the city. Ukraine’s Suspilne media, quoting Sumy regional head Volodymyr Artiukh, said the Russians used Shaheds stuffed with shrapnel elements for the first time in the region. 'These weapons are used to destroy people, not to destroy objects,' said Artiukh, according to Suspilne. Separately, Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavský arrived on a visit to Kyiv. He posted a photo from Kyiv’s railway station on his X account Friday morning. 'I am interested in how the Ukrainians are coping with the bombings, how Czech projects are working on the ground and how to better target international aid in the coming months. I will discuss all of this here,' Lipavský wrote. Three Ukrainian lawmakers confirmed that the parliamentary session previously scheduled was canceled due to the ongoing threat of Russian missile attacks targeting government buildings in the city center. Not only is the parliament closed, 'there was also recommendation to limit the work of all commercial offices and NGOs that remain in that perimeter, and local residents were warned of the increased threat,' said lawmaker Mykyta Poturaiev, who added this is not the first time such a threat has been received. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office continued to work in compliance with standard security measures, a spokesperson said. Russia on Thursday fired a new intermediate-range ballistic missile in response to Kyiv's use of U.S. and British longer-range missiles capable of striking deeper into Russian territory, Russian President Vladimir Putin said in an address on Thursday. It struck a missile factory in Dnipro in central Ukraine. Putin warned that U.S. air defense systems would be powerless to stop the new missile, which he said flies at 10 times the speed of sound and which he called Oreshnik — Russian for hazelnut tree. Ukraine’s Main Intelligence Directorate also released details. It said the missile was fired from the 4th Missile Test Range 'Kapustin Yar' in Russia’s Astrakhan region, and flew 15 minutes before striking Dnipro. The missile had six warheads each carrying six submunitions. The peak speed the missile reached was 11 Machs. Test launches of a similar missile were conducted at the range in October 2023 and June 2024, the directorate said. The Pentagon confirmed that Russia's missile was a new, experimental type of intermediate-range missile based on its RS-26 Rubezh intercontinental ballistic missile. —— Associated Press journalists Lorne Cook in Brussels and Samya Kullab in Kyiv, Ukraine, contributed. —— Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-missile-parliament-d374dc8ca0fa626e674d29df01ce95cd	2024-11-22T01:30:56-08:00	
Japan passes $250B economic package meant to lift wages and spur growth	TOKYO (AP) — Japan approved a 39 trillion yen ($250 billion) economic stimulus package Friday centered around initiatives it said were aimed at boosting individual incomes. The broad plan passed by the Cabinet is the centerpiece of Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba’s recently installed administration. It provides support for digital innovation in the world’s fourth largest economy, subsidies to defray for rising energy costs and help for low-income households. The plan is designed to instill a sense of 'well being' in the Japanese people, the government said, using the English phrase. Although Japan has managed weak growth in recent quarters, the long-term outlook for the economy and for the country's standing in the world is uncertain. The plan includes measures to address the country's falling birthrate, which is one of the lowest among developed nations, help for working women and for the elderly. The plan also calls for raising the annual tax-free salary threshold from the current 1.03 million yen ($6,640). The new ceiling is not yet decided. But a level of 1.78 million yen ($11,500) has been proposed. 'During the past 30 years, our nation has overcome various challenges, including deflation and confusion that followed the burst of the ‘bubble economy,’ the global financial crisis, various natural disasters and the difficulties stemming from the coronavirus pandemic,' documents provided by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said. The government says signs of growth are evident, but Japan must avoid a negative spiraling of lower prices similar to an earlier protracted bout of deflation and attain sustainable wage increases to support growth. The package promised help for small and medium-size businesses, for regional economies, farms and creative content like animation. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party and its coalition partner lost their majority in the lower house of Parliament last month in an election. They face the challenge of maneuvering for support among various opposition parties. Some analysts already are projecting that Ishiba’s premiership will be relatively short-lived. ___ Yuri Kageyama is on Threads: https://www.threads.net/@yurikageyama	https://apnews.com/article/japan-economy-ishiba-politics-95b09d0f8ec0287224c00d56ad453446	2024-11-22T01:22:10-08:00	
China is expanding visa-free entry to more countries in bid to boost economy	BEIJING (AP) — China announced Friday that it would expand visa-free entry to nine more countries as it seeks to boost tourism and business travel to help revive a sluggish economy. Starting Nov. 30, travelers from Bulgaria, Romania, Malta, Croatia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Estonia, Latvia and Japan will be able to enter China for up to 30 days without a visa, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said. That will bring to 38 the number of countries that have been granted visa-free access since last year. Only three countries had visa-free access previously, and theirs had been eliminated during the COVID-19 pandemic. The addition of Japan appears to reflect a recent willingness on China's part to improve ties, which have soured in part over more strident talk from Tokyo on the Taiwan issue. The two countries reached a deal in September in their dispute over the release into the sea of treated but still radioactive water from the destroyed Fukushima nuclear power plant. Japan was one of the three countries with visa-free entry before the pandemic, and the government had repeatedly requested an early resumption, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters in Tokyo. 'We hope the visa exemption measure announced by the Chinese side will contribute to further smooth our exchanges between Japan and China,' he said. The permitted length of stay for visa-free entry is being increased from the previous 15 days, Lin said, and people participating in exchanges will be eligible for the first time. China has been pushing people-to-people exchange between students, academics and others to try to improve its sometimes strained relations with other countries. China strictly restricted entry during the pandemic and ended its restrictions much later than most other countries. It restored the previous visa-free access for citizens of Brunei and Singapore in July 2023, and then expanded visa-free entry to six more countries — France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Malaysia — on Dec. 1 of last year. The program has since been expanded in tranches. Some countries have announced visa-free entry for Chinese citizens, notably Thailand, which wants to bring back Chinese tourists. For the three months from July through September this year, China recorded 8.2 million entries by foreigners, of which 4.9 million were visa-free, the official Xinhua News Agency said, quoting a Foreign Ministry consular official.	https://apnews.com/article/china-visa-free-entry-travel-7d8bdeb7d1d2eda702d519abb4162681	2024-11-22T01:12:30-08:00	
In Bali, young girls dance in a traditional Hindu festival threatened by changing times	BALI, Indonesia (AP) — Ketut Nita Wahyuni lifts her folded hands prayerfully to her forehead as a priest leads the temple gathering. The 11-year-old is preparing to perform the Rejang Dewa, a sacred Balinese dance. The rituals are part of the two-week-long Ngusaba Goreng, a thanksgiving festival for a rich harvest. 'Ngusaba' means gathering of the gods and goddesses. There are various forms of rejang performed during different occasions and rituals in Bali. Wahyuni and her friends have an important role during the festival. Rejang Dewa and Rejang Pucuk, performed on two separate days, are reserved only for girls who have not yet attained puberty. 'Being a rejang started when she lost her tooth until pre-puberty. We believe they are still pure to present dance to God during this time,' her father Nyoman Subrata says. As traditional chief of Geriana Kauh village, Subrata says he is proud to see his daughter participating in this ritual. Subrata is committed to the responsibilities of maintaining religious traditions that have passed down through generations. Balinese Hinduism brings together Hindu philosophy and local animist traditions with some Buddhist influence. It is a way of life, building a connection between the people, their heritage, and the divine. A day later, Wahyuni’s mother Kadek Krisni has picked fresh flowers from their garden and prepared an elaborate headdress while her daughter was in school. Today is Rejang Pucuk day, one of the most sacred forms of Rejang. It was routine as usual in the morning. The latter half of the day will be spent in the temple. This is life in Bali. Krisni says she participated in the same rituals as a child and is 'happy there there is someone in the family continuing the ritual.' There is apparent pride even in someone as young as Wahyuni in offering her service to the temple. Her friends are also part of the group and there is excitement as they share their experiences. 'I also learn how to apply makeup,' she says with a smile. But despite the strong roots, there is also a fear for these traditions' place in the future. Subrata expresses concern that the younger generation is opting to leave the village for the city or overseas in search of work. He stresses the importance of being pragmatic and finding ways to maintain the Balinese traditional heritage without it being an impediment to the economic growth of the people. 'It is natural when they grow up and make their own choices, but I hope they don’t forget the place where they were born and their cultural traditions,' he says.	https://apnews.com/article/indonesia-bali-hindu-festival-acf11b1e468ce337cb55ae6758f62f33	2024-11-21T23:51:55-08:00	
Indigenous leaders travel to UK from Peru to draw attention to oil damage and banking	LONDON (AP) — Indigenous leaders from the Wampis Nation in Peru are urging lawmakers at the House of Commons in London to ban international banks' support for Amazon oil activities they say harm their ancestral rainforests. HSBC bank, based in the United Kingdom, JPMorgan Chase in the United States and Santander in Spain helped finance the state-owned oil company Petroperu as it sought to upgrade a coastal refinery. The plant processes crude oil from a 680-mile (1,094-kilometer) pipeline that runs through rainforest. In the last decade there have been dozens of leaks along the pipeline. 'We’ve been conserving our forest for over 7,000 years,' Pamuk Teófilo Kukush Pati, a Wampis leader, told The Associated Press after meetings on Thursday. The group planned to continue their visit Friday. Now their fishing waters have been badly polluted, he said, and 'there is no guarantee of life ... we are in a very grave situation.' 'Most alarming is the fact we find out that various banks fund Petroperu,' said Tsanim Evaristo Wajai Asamat, another Wampis leader. 'And these things are happening all across the Amazon.' The banks acted as 'bookrunners' on a $1 billion bond offering for the refinery work in 2021, first reported by the U.K. nonprofit Bureau of Investigative Journalism. When banks act as bookrunners, they advertise the bonds to their customers and use their reputation to give investors confidence. Financial data provider Dealogic estimates each bank made $583,000 in fees. A spokeswoman for Santander bank said via email that the company followed all relevant environmental regulations and does a careful analysis before backing companies that operate in the Amazon. A JPMorgan spokeswoman said Indigenous rights are a fundamental consideration across their business. A spokeswoman for HSBC said in a statement that it places restrictions on backing projects in the Amazon. In the last decade, there were 89 leaks from the pipeline, Petroperu said in an email. It said only two were caused by equipment failure — criminals or natural forces caused the rest. Petroperu has spent more than $180 million cleaning up the last decade’s oil spills, it said. More than 15,000 Wampis live on some 5,000 square miles (13,000 square kilometers) of forest and wetland in northern Peru. Their territory is home to hundreds of species of fish and rare birds. The people made headlines in 2015 when they declared an autonomous government, in part to protect their environment. The government of Peru does not recognize it. According to Petroperu's bond prospectus for the refinery project, which provides transparency to investors, bond buyers faced financial risks 'relating to the effects of oil leaks on local and indigenous communities.' There could be protests, fines, compensation and negative publicity, it warned, and Indigenous communities had 'taken hostile measures against our facilities and installations on various occasions.' The prospectus also said there were criminal investigations being conducted by Peruvian prosecutors over oil spills that included former Petroperu executives. Petroperu has since denied that people at its executive level are being investigated, saying that two lower-level employees were among those of interest to prosecutors. The company said via email that it's cooperating with the investigation. The year after the bond deal, in 2022, Peruvian regulators penalized Petroperu with 66 fines, including for new oil spills along the pipeline. The three banks did business with Petroperu again last year, providing advice as the oil company sought to change the terms of its debt. The Wampis are also unhappy about illegal logging and mining on their territory. They were among several delegations also pressing Thursday for a proposed law that would make it a crime for British businesses to harm the environment and threaten human rights. Delegations from Colombia, Liberia and Mexico met with a baroness, then with senior officials at both the U.K. Foreign Office and Environment Department. Jesús Javier Thomas González, from northern Mexico, spoke of a ten-year battle with a mining company listed on the London Stock Exchange that he said illegally occupied and devastated their land. The company has 'economic and political influence in Mexico that is huge,' he said. It's a good corporate citizen in the UK, he said, 'but in Mexico they behave in a different way.' A U.K. government spokesman said British firms should always act to avoid environmental harms, and its approach to tackling those that don't is under constant review. __ Grattan reported from Bogota, Colombia. __ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

US bribery and fraud charges are a big test yet for India's Adani, one of Asia's richest men	NEW DELHI (AP) — Indian billionaire Gautam Adani, one of Asia’s richest men, may be facing his biggest challenge yet with an indictment by U.S. prosecutors for alleged fraud and bribery. But it’s unclear just how the case will affect his businesses and own future — as well as the Indian economy and government. On Friday, shares in some of the Adani Group's companies began ticking back up after they plunged a day earlier following the announcement of the charges in New York. The stock prices of six of his 10 listed companies rose slightly, between 1% to nearly 4%. Adani, a major power player in India perceived as close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, was charged Wednesday with securities fraud and conspiracy to commit securities and wire fraud at a court in Brooklyn, New York. The test for the tycoon and his multibillion dollar empire spawning everything from energy and ports to media and agriculture, comes just after the 62-year-old founder and his sprawling business empire had bounced back after losing more than $60 billion in market value in early 2023 following allegations of stock price manipulation and fraud by the short-selling firm Hindenburg Research. It also raises questions about corporate governance and crony capitalism in India's economy, which Modi has vowed to make the world's third largest, intensifying scrutiny on the outsized influence of large, family-run conglomerates. Asia's richest man is another Indian billionaire, Mukesh Ambani of Reliance Industries. Prosecutors allege that Adani duped investors in a massive solar project in India by concealing that it was being facilitated by bribes. Seven other executives connected to Adani’s sprawling business empire also face charges. The indictment outlines an alleged scheme to pay about $265 million in bribes to government officials in India. The Adani group denied the allegations against directors of Adani Green Energy, its renewable energy arm, as 'baseless' and said they will be seeking legal recourse. Shares in Adani's green energy venture, which is at the center of the case, dropped 8% on Friday. None of the people charged in the case have been arrested. 'For Adani, this hits hard, no matter how you slice it. His public relations machine was in overdrive for nearly two years rehabilitating his image following the Hindenburg allegations. This indictment came like a bolt from the blue and instantly reversed all recent progress in salvaging his reputation and business empire,' said Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center. Adani's imprint across the Indian economy runs deep. He is the country's largest operator of coal mines and infrastructure developer, operating several ports and airports, and employs tens of thousands of people. Despite his fossil fuel roots, Adani has ambitions to become the world's largest player in renewable energy by 2030. Analysts say a key factor in his meteoric rise over the years has been his knack for aligning his group’s priorities with those of the Modi government, investing in key industries like renewable energy, defense and agriculture. Before Modi, Adani was friendly with other parties in power. The latest controversy is likely to put Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party-led government, seen as close to Adani, in an awkward spot. Amit Malviya, the BJP's IT head, said in a post on X that the U.S. charges are 'allegations and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty,' which critics interpreted as a show of support for the Adani group. The main opposition party has seized on the controversy, demanding Adani's arrest and accusing Modi, who has at times campaigned using an Adani jet, of protecting him. Opposition lawmakers are likely to escalate pressure on Modi when the winter session of parliament begins next week. The controversy has already affected Adani’s interests overseas. Kenya’s president canceled multimillion dollar deals with the Adani group for airport modernization and energy projects. Adani is likely to also face scrutiny in Bangladesh, where a court on Tuesday ordered an inquiry into an energy project. His troubles might complicate India's ties with other countries, such as Sri Lanka, where New Delhi is competing with rival Beijing for strategically important markets. There's no doubt this is 'bad timing for New Delhi,' said Kugelman, as it comes at a moment 'when it’s trying to capitalize on the business world’s desire to move production out of China and find alternate investment destinations.' As for India-U.S. ties, some analysts believe President-elect Donald Trump may intervene. 'India would like nothing more than for Trump to halt the investigation once he takes office. That's unlikely. Trump, however, could take a positive view of Adani, a fellow businessman who has praised Trump effusively,' said Kugelman. The case highlights business risks in India, though experts believe the impact on investors will be limited mainly to the Adani group. 'There are no fears of a financial contagion -- at this point, the effect is centered on the group rather than the market. It could slow down the group’s expansion and growth as it will become more difficult for Adani to raise funds,' said Ambareesh Baliga, an independent market analyst. Still, for many in India, the news isn’t that startling. Investors already know 'just how ingrained this (bribes and corruption) is in the fabric of the Indian economy -- you can’t miss it,' Baliga said. 'Initially, investors may stay away for a while - but at the end of the day, they will come back (to Adani). This isn’t some small or medium-sized group they can ignore.'	https://apnews.com/article/india-adani-hindenburg-fraud-bribery-21c3ffa3c4c17639b18d1719dd98b1a3	2024-11-21T23:44:40-08:00	
Hungary's Orbán vows to disregard international arrest warrant for Netanyahu	BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán on Friday denounced the International Criminal Court’s issuing of an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying he would defy it by inviting him to Hungary. In comments to state radio, Orbán accused the ICC, the world’s top war crimes court based in The Hague, of 'interfering in an ongoing conflict for political purposes,' saying the decision to issue the warrant for Netanyahu over his conduct of the war in Gaza undermined international law and escalated tensions. Member countries of the ICC, such as Hungary, are required to detain suspects facing a warrant if they set foot on their soil, but the court has no way to enforce that. The ICC issued the arrest warrant on Thursday for Netanyahu as well as for his former defense minister and Hamas’ military chief, accusing them of crimes against humanity in connection with the 13-month war in Gaza. The warrants said there was reason to believe Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant used 'starvation as a method of warfare' by restricting humanitarian aid and intentionally targeted civilians in Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza — charges Israeli officials deny. In his comments Friday, Orbán, a close Netanyahu ally, called the arrest warrant 'outrageously impudent' and 'cynical.' He said he would invite Netanyahu to Hungary later Friday and vowed to disregard the warrant if the invitation is accepted. 'We will defy this decision, and it will have no consequences for him,' Orbán said. Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó earlier criticized the ICC’s warrant as 'absurd.' Israel and its top ally, the United States, are not members of the court. But other Israeli allies, including some of its close European friends, are put in an awkward position by the warrants. Several, including France, welcomed the court’s decision and signaled they might arrest Netanyahu if he visited. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said President Joe Biden’s administration was 'deeply concerned by the prosecutor’s rush to seek arrest warrants and the troubling process errors that led to this decision.' Netanyahu on Friday praised Hungary for its stance on the warrant, saying in a statement: 'Against the shameful weakness of those who stood by the outrageous decision against the right of the State of Israel to defend itself, Hungary — like our friends in the United States — is displaying moral clarity and standing by justice and truth.' The action by the ICC came as the death toll from Israel’s campaign in Gaza passed 44,000, according to local health authorities, who say more than half of those killed were women and children. Their count does not differentiate between civilians and combatants.	https://apnews.com/article/hungary-orban-arrest-warrant-netanyahu-2b25696df9b6d8a6624a8c4243ce3368	2024-11-21T22:52:29-08:00	
South Korea says Russia supplied air defense missiles to North Korea in return for its troops	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Russia has supplied air defense missile systems to North Korea in exchange for sending its troops to support Russia's war efforts against Ukraine, a top South Korean official said Friday. The U.S., South Korea and Ukraine say North Korea sent more than 10,000 troops to Russia in October, some of whom have recently begun engaging in combat on the front lines. North Korea's troop deployment threatens to escalate the war, and what Russia could give to the North in return has been a source of rampant international speculation. The most alarming development for South Korea and the U.S. would be Russia transferring sophisticated weapons technology that can enhance North Korea's nuclear-capable missiles targeting its rivals. Many experts say, though, that it is unlikely Russia would do this in the initial stage of the North’s troop deployment. Shin Wonsik, national security adviser for South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, told an SBS TV program Friday that South Korea has found Russia provided missiles and other equipment to help it reinforce its air defense network for Pyongyang, the capital. Shin didn’t say what specific missiles Russia gave to North Korea. Lee Illwoo, an expert with the Korea Defense Network in South Korea, said that Russia has likely sent S-400 long-range surface-to-air missiles, launchers and ground-based radar systems. He said that North Korea is capable of building shorter-range surface-to-air missiles on its own. The S-400 missile, with a range of 400 kilometers (250 miles), is considered one of Russia’s most advanced anti-aircraft weapons. But Lee questioned how significantly it can boost Pyongyang’s air defense, saying Russian air defense systems have failed to effectively deal with Ukrainian drone assaults. Many observers say North Korea has likely felt the urgent need to boost its air defense capabilities after it last month accused South Korea of flying drones to scatter propaganda leaflets over Pyongyang. North Korea threatened to take military action if leaflets were again dropped. South Korea’s military has refused to confirm whether or not it was behind the alleged drone flights. Kim Dae Young, a military expert at the Korea Research Institute for National Strategy, said it’s possible that the air defense systems North Korea acquired from Russia could include counter-drone equipment. Kim said that Pyongyang's outdated air defense system would need years of improvement and potentially huge external help to cope with the superior air forces of South Korea and the United States. Shin said Russia has also appeared to have given economic assistance to North Korea and various military technologies, including those needed for the North's efforts to build a reliable space-based surveillance system. Shin didn’t say whether Russia has already transferred sensitive nuclear and missile technologies to North Korea. During a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un last year, Russian President Vladimir Putin already said that Moscow was willing to help the North build satellites. North Korea put its first spy satellite into orbit in November last year, but foreign experts question whether that satellite can produce militarily meaningful imagery. The North's attempt to launch a second spy satellite failed in May. North Korea and Russia have been sharply boosting their military and other cooperation in the face of separate confrontations with the U.S. and its allies. Last month, South Korea's spy agency said that North Korea had sent more than 13,000 containers of artillery, missiles and other conventional arms to Russia since August 2023 to replenish its dwindling weapons stockpiles. The National Intelligence Service said Wednesday that North Korea had recently sent additional artillery systems to Russia. Earlier this week, North Korea and Russia reached a new agreement for expanding economic cooperation following high-level talks in Pyongyang this week, according to the countries’ state-run media.	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-troops-ukraine-russia-missile-1efc0e29d5d6225fb85891ef6c822e4c	2024-11-21T22:06:03-08:00	
The Bahamas will refinance part of its debt to protect its famous turquoise waters	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — The Bahamas announced Friday that it will refinance $300 million of its external debt to free up more than $120 million for marine conservation projects and climate change mitigation. It is the fifth such debt-for-nature swap in the world, with the Bahamian government signing the deal with The Nature Conservancy, the Inter-American Development Bank and other financial partners. 'We see this project not just supporting the biodiversity and climate objectives of the country, but ultimately the economy and livelihoods of many, many folks,' Shenique Albury-Smith, the Bahamas-based deputy director for The Nature Conservancy, told The Associated Press. The deal involves buying back the existing debt via a new loan by Standard Charter with reduced interest rates, a move expected to free up some $124 million in funding. That money will be used for marine conservation projects for the next 15 years. An endowment fund also will be created to secure financing for the projects after the 15 years are up. Overall, the Bahamas holds some $5.7 billion in external debt. The Seychelles, Belize, Gabon and Barbados previously signed similar deals, said Melissa Garvey, global director for The Nature Conservancy’s bond program. Together, the deals protect conservation areas larger than the Gulf of Mexico, she said. The agreement with the Bahamian government marks the first time a private investor, Builders Vision, provides a co-guarantee and a private insurer, AXA XL, provides credit insurance. It’s also the first time that the project includes climate change mitigation commitments, according to The Nature Conservancy. Smith said officials will likely use some of the money to protect, restore and manage the mangrove ecosystem, which stores carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, better than tropical forests. Officials also are looking to protect other ecosystems including seagrass, which also absorbs carbon dioxide, helping counter global warming. Protecting marine areas also would ensure the stability of commercially important fisheries in the Bahamas, with the spiny lobster one alone generating some $100 million a year, Albury-Smith said. In addition, climate change mitigation would help protect the low-lying archipelago that is still struggling to recover from Hurricane Dorian, which hit as a powerful Category 5 storm in 2019. The Bahamas already has a strong conservation history: more than 17% of coastal waters are protected, representing more than 6 million hectares (16 million acres) of the world’s ocean. In 1958, the Bahamas established the world’s first protected land and sea park at Exuma Cays. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/bahamas-debt-nature-conservancy-marine-protection-ed89e57b81133d5790163f798f64dc1b	2024-11-21T22:04:54-08:00	
A proposed deal on climate cash at UN summit highlights split between rich and poor nations	BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) — A new draft of a deal on cash to curb and adapt to climate change released Friday at the United Nations climate summit pledged $250 billion annually by 2035 from wealthy countries to poorer ones. The amount pleases the countries who will be paying, but not those on the receiving end. It's more than double the previous goal of $100 billion a year set 15 years ago, but less than a quarter of the number requested by developing nations struck hardest by extreme weather. But rich nations say it's realistic and about the limit of what they can do. It struck a sour note for developing countries, which see conferences like this one as their biggest hope to pressure rich nations because they aren't part of meetings of the world's biggest economies. 'Our expectations were low, but this is a slap in the face,' said Mohamed Adow, from Power Shift Africa. 'No developing country will fall for this. They have angered and offended the developing world.' Nations are still far apart on reaching a deal The proposal came from the top: the presidency of the climate talks — called COP29 — in Baku, Azerbaijan. Lead negotiator Yalchin Rafiyev, Azerbaijan's deputy foreign minister, said the presidency hopes to push countries to go higher than $250 billion, saying 'it doesn't correspond to our fair and ambitious goal. But we will continue to engage with the parties.' Brazil responded with a higher number taken from a report by an expert financial panel appointed by the United Nations secretary-general. Brazil Environment Minister Marina Silva proposed $300 billion a year until 2035 when the number would jump to $390 billion a year. Brazil is set to host next year's COP30. When asked whether lack of an ambitious agreement at COP29 would put Brazil in a bad position next year, Silva said the consequences were bigger that that. 'More than just hurting COP30, it will hurt the life of all of us and hurt the conditions that give us life on Earth,' she said. Climate Analytics CEO Bill Hare, a veteran negotiator, said the presidency's figure is likely just the first of two or three proposals. 'We’re in for a long night and maybe two nights before we actually reach agreement on this,' Hare said. Just like last year's initial proposal, which was soundly rejected, this plan is 'empty' on what climate analysts call 'mitigation' or efforts to reduce emissions from or completely quit coal, oil and natural gas, Hare said. Anger at ‘meagre’ figure for climate cash Tina Stege, Marshall Islands' climate envoy, called the drafts 'shameful.' 'It is incomprehensible that ... (we) receive only sympathy and no real action from wealthy nations,' she said. The Least Developed Countries negotiating group said they were 'deeply concerned' about the draft deal. 'It dilutes the existing commitments of the developed countries and does not reflect the ambition needed for global climate action,' their statement said. 'It is a disgrace that despite full awareness of the devastating climate crises afflicting developing nations and the staggering costs of climate action — amounting to trillions — developed nations have only proposed a meagre $250 billion per year,' said Harjeet Singh of the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty. Experts put the need at $1.3 trillion for developing countries to cover damages resulting from extreme weather, help those nations adapt to a warming planet and wean themselves from fossil fuels, with more generated by each country internally. The amount in any deal reached at COP negotiations — often considered a 'core' — will then be mobilized or leveraged for greater climate spending. But much of that means loans for countries drowning in debt. Iskander Erzini Vernoit, director of Moroccan climate think-tank Imal Initiative for Climate and Development, said 'the EU and the U.S. and other developed countries cannot claim to be committed to the Paris Agreement while putting forward such amounts.' Countries reached the Paris Agreement in 2015, pledging to keep warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times. The world is now at 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit), according to the U.N. Activists were angered, too. Several dozen marched in silence outside the halls where delegates meet, raising and crossing their arms in front of themselves to indicate rejection of the draft text. Nikki Reisch, director of the climate and energy program at the Center for International Environmental Law, said the offering was unacceptable not just because the money is low, but because 'it's really designed to escape and evade the legal obligation that developed countries have' to pay for the climate change they have largely caused. Rich countries call for realism Switzerland environment minister Albert Rösti said it was important that the climate finance number is realistic. 'I think a deal with a high number that will never be realistic, that will never be paid … will be much worse than no deal,' he said. A lack of a bigger number from European nations and the U.S. means that the 'deal is clearly moving toward the direction of China playing a more prominent role in helping other Global South countries,' said Li Shou of the Asia Society Policy Institute. 'We think this is at least a text we can work with. Now we have a map on the way forward instead of nowhere where we don’t know where we are going,' said German climate envoy Jennifer Morgan. Analysts said the proposed deal is the start of what could likely be more money. 'This can be a good down payment that will allow for further climate action in developing countries,' said Melanie Robinson, global climate program director at the World Resources Institute. 'But there is scope for this to go above $250 billion.' Rob Moore, associate director at E3G, said that whatever figure is agreed 'will need to be the start and not the end' of climate cash promises. 'If developed countries can go further they need to say so fast to make sure we get a deal at COP29,' he said. ___ Associated Press journalists Ahmed Hatem, Olivia Zhang and Aleksandar Furtula contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Many in Gaza are eating just once a day, as hunger spreads amid aid issues	DEIR AL-BALAH, The Gaza Strip (AP) — Yasmin Eid coughs and covers her face, cooking a small pot of lentils over a fire fed with twigs and scrap paper in the tent she shares with her husband and four young daughters in the Gaza Strip. It was their only meal Wednesday — it was all they could afford. 'My girls suck on their thumbs because of how hungry they are, and I pat their backs until they sleep,' she said. After being displaced five times, the Eids reside in central Gaza, where aid groups have relatively more access than in the north, which has been largely isolated and heavily destroyed since Israel began waging a renewed offensive against the militant group Hamas in early October. But nearly everyone in Gaza is going hungry these days. In the north experts say a full-blown famine may be underway. On Thursday, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister, accusing them of using 'starvation as a method of warfare' — charges Israel adamantly denies. In Deir al-Balah, the Eids are among hundreds of thousands sheltering in squalid tent camps. The local bakeries shut down for five days this week. The price of a bag of bread climbed above $13 by Wednesday, as bread and flour vanished from shelves before more supplies arrived. The United Nations humanitarian office warned of a 'stark increase' in the number of households experiencing severe hunger in central and southern Gaza. It appeared to be linked to the robbery at gunpoint of nearly 100 aid trucks last weekend in southern Gaza, close to Israeli military positions. Israel blamed Hamas but appears to have taken no action to stop the looting, while Hamas said it was the work of local bandits. Aid groups say the looting is one of many obstacles to getting food and other vital aid to the territory's 2.3 million Palestinians. They also have to contend with Israeli movement restrictions, ongoing fighting, and heavy damage wreaked by the Israeli bombardment of roads and critical infrastructure. For the Eids, hunger is the daily routine For months, Yasmin and her family have gone to bed hungry. 'Everything has increased in price, and we cannot buy anything,' she said. 'We always go to sleep without having dinner.' She misses coffee, but a single packet of Nescafe goes for around $1.30. A kilogram (2 pounds) of onions goes for $10, a medium bottle of cooking oil for $15 — if available. Meat and chicken all but vanished from the markets months ago, but there are still some local vegetables. Such sums are astronomical in an impoverished territory where few people earn regular incomes. Crowds of hundreds wait hours to get food from charities, which are also struggling. Hani Almadhoun, co-founder of the Gaza Soup Kitchen, said his teams can offer only small bowls of rice or pasta once a day. He said they 'can go to the market on one day and buy something for $5, and then go back in the afternoon to find it doubled or tripled in price.' Its kitchen in the central town of Zuweida operated on a daily budget of around $500 for much of the war. When the amount of aid entering Gaza plummeted in October, its costs climbed to around $1,300 a day. It can feed about half of the 1,000 families who line up each day. The sharp decline in aid, and a U.S. ultimatum Israel says it places no limits on the amount of aid entering Gaza and has announced a number of measures it says are aimed at increasing the flow in recent weeks, including the opening of a new crossing. It blames U.N. agencies for not retrieving it, pointing to hundreds of truckloads languishing on the Gaza side of the border. But the military's own figures show that the amount of aid entering Gaza plunged to around 1,800 trucks in October, down from over 4,200 the previous month. At the current rate of entry, around 2,400 trucks would come into Gaza in November. Around 500 trucks entered each day before the war. The U.N. says less than half the truckloads are actually distributed because of ongoing fighting, Israeli denial of movement requests, and the breakdown of law and order. Hamas-run police have vanished from many areas after being targeted by Israeli airstrikes. The war started Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led fighters stormed into Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are dead, and Hamas militants have repeatedly regrouped after Israeli operations, carrying out hit-and-run attacks from tunnels and bombed-out buildings. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 44,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities, who do not say how many of the dead were fighters. The United States warned Israel in October that it might be forced to curtail some of its crucial military support if Israel did not rapidly ramp up the amount of aid entering Gaza. But after the 30-day ultimatum expired, the Biden administration declined to take any action, saying there had been some progress. Israel meanwhile passed legislation severing ties with UNRWA. Israel accuses the agency of allowing itself to be infiltrated by Hamas — allegations denied by the U.N. Israeli news outlets have reported that officials are considering plans for the military to take over aid distribution or contract it out to private security companies. Asked about such plans Wednesday, government spokesman David Mercer said 'Israel is looking at many creative solutions to ensure a better future for Gaza.' Yoav Gallant, the former defense minister who was seen as a voice of moderation in the far-right government before being fired this month, warned on X that handing over aid distribution to a private firm was a 'euphemism for the beginning of military rule.' As that debate plays out in Jerusalem, less than 100 kilometers (60 miles) away from central Gaza, most Palestinians in the territory are focused on staying alive in a war with no end in sight.

Brazilian police indict Bolsonaro for alleged attempted coup, threatening his political career	SAO PAULO (AP) — Police indicted Brazil’s former president Jair Bolsonaro and 36 others for allegedly attempting a coup to keep the right-wing leader in office after his defeat in the 2022 election. Already barred from running again in 2026 for a different case, he could now land in jail and see his influence further diminished. Brazil's federal police said the sealed findings in Thursday's indictment were being delivered to Brazil’s Supreme Court, which will refer them to Prosecutor-General Paulo Gonet, who will decide whether to formally charge Bolsonaro and put him on trial, or toss the investigation. Gonet is already under pressure from his legal peers to move forward with the various investigations related to the ex-president, local media have reported. And politicians say if Bolsonaro does stand trial at the Supreme Court there will be a race among his allies and rivals to seize his influence with voters. 'Bolsonaro is no longer the sole leader of the right-wing. He is coming out of mayoral elections in which most of his candidates lost. All these probes don't help him at all,' said Carlos Melo, a political science professor at the Insper university in Sao Paulo. Melo added that 'the governor of Sao Paulo, Tarcisio de Freitas, the radical candidate for Sao Paulo mayorship Pablo Marcal, the governor of Goias state, Ronaldo Caiado ... There are politicians lining up to court Bolsonaro voters.' Bolsonaro told the website Metropoles that he was waiting for his lawyer to review the indictment, reportedly about 700 pages long. But he said he would fight the case and dismissed the investigation as being the result of 'creativity.' The former president has denied all claims he tried to stay in office after his narrow electoral defeat in 2022 to leftist President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Bolsonaro has faced a series of legal threats since then. Police said in a brief statement that the Supreme Court had agreed to reveal the names of all 37 people who were indicted 'to avoid the dissemination of incorrect news.' Dozens of former and current Bolsonaro aides also were indicted, including Gen. Walter Braga Netto, who was his running mate in the 2022 campaign; former Army commander Gen. Paulo Sérgio Nogueira de Oliveira; Valdemar Costa Neto, the chairman of Bolsonaro’s Liberal Party; and his veteran former adviser, Gen. Augusto Heleno. Other investigations led to indictments for Bolsonaro's alleged roles in smuggling diamond jewelry into Brazil without properly declaring them and in directing a subordinate to falsify his and others’ COVID-19 vaccination statuses. Bolsonaro has denied any involvement in either. Another probe found that he had abused his authority to cast doubt on the country's voting system, and judges barred him from running again until 2030. Still, he has insisted that he will run in 2026, and many in his orbit were heartened by the recent U.S. election win of Donald Trump, despite his own swirling legal threats. Creomar de Souza, a political analyst of Dharma Political Risk and Strategy, said the indictment is 'obviously bad' for Bolsonaro, but added the right-wing leader could still continue his bid to run again sooner than he is currently allowed to. He is barred from running in the 2026 elections. 'The idea of due legal course is a struggling one in the political arena these days. This could give those targeted a chance to portray themselves as being persecuted,' de Souza told the AP. 'We can't rule out that the tension from indictments like this might well favor Bolsonaro to some extent.' An indictment over the alleged coup attempt means the investigation has gathered evidence of 'a crime and its author,' said Eloísa Machado de Almeida, a law professor at Getulio Vargas Foundation, a university in Sao Paulo. She said she believed there was enough legal grounds for the prosecutor-general to file charges. Bolsonaro's allies in Congress have been negotiating a bill to pardon individuals who stormed the Brazilian capital and rioted on Jan. 8, 2023, in a failed attempt to keep the former president in power. Analysts have speculated that lawmakers want to extend the legislation to cover the former president himself. However, efforts to push a broad amnesty bill may be 'politically challenging' given recent attacks on the judiciary and details emerging in investigations, Machado said. On Tuesday, Federal Police arrested four military and a Federal Police officer, accused of plotting to assassinate Lula and Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes as a means to overthrow the government following the 2022 elections. And last week, a man carried out a bomb attack in the capital Brasilia. He attempted to enter the Supreme Court and threw explosives outside, killing himself.	https://apnews.com/article/brazil-bolsonaro-indictment-coup-election-83440d5a5dda43dc23bbcd58a2e52fde	2024-11-21T20:08:11-08:00	
Stock market today: World stocks track Wall St's gains with Nvidia report and bitcoin surge	HONG KONG (AP) — Global stocks rose on Friday following gains on Wall Street after market superstar Nvidia and other companies said they’re making even fatter profits than expected. Britain’s FTSE 100 rose 0.7% to 8,204.61. Germany’s DAX added 0.5% to 19,248.30, and the CAC 40 in Paris edged up 0.2% to 7,229.24. The futures for the S&amp;P 500 edged down 0.1% and those for the Dow Jones Industrial Average were virtually unchanged. Geopolitical tensions pushed oil prices higher. On Thursday, President Vladimir Putin further escalated the war, announcing that Russia had fired a new intermediate-range ballistic missile at Ukraine in response to Kyiv’s use this week of American and British missiles capable of reaching deeper into Russia. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 added 0.7% to 38,283.85 after the nation's inflation rate slowed to 2.3% in October from 2.5% in the prior month, reaching its lowest level since January. The data will be a key topic at the Bank of Japan’s policy meeting in December, where some investors expect an increase in the short-term policy rate to 0.5% from 0.25%. Australia’s S&amp;P/ASX 200 rose 0.9% to 8,393.80. South Korea’s Kospi was up 0.8% at 2,501.24. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dipped 1.9% to 19,229.97, and the Shanghai Composite index dropped 3.1% to 3,267.19, primarily driven by a drop in semiconductor stocks, which have been cooling from a surge following President-elect Donald Trump's victory in the Nov. 5 election. The index tracking the semiconductor sector fell 4%, and shares of Empyrean Technology Co., China’s leading electronic design automation developer, sank 8.2% on Friday. Hong Kong-listed shares of Semiconductor Manufacturing International Co., the largest semiconductor foundry company in mainland China, lost 6.7%. In the crypto market, as of late Friday, Asia time, bitcoin was trading at $98,589.02. Bitcoin eclipsed $99,000 for the first time Thursday before pulling back toward $98,000, according to CoinDesk. It’s more than doubled so far this year, and its climb has accelerated since Election Day. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to make the country 'the crypto capital of the planet' and create a 'strategic reserve' of bitcoin. On Thursday, the S&amp;P 500 pulled 0.5% higher to 5,948.71 after flipping between gains and losses several times during the day. Banks, smaller companies and other areas of the stock market that tend to do best when the economy is strong helped lead the way. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 1.1% to 43,870.35, and the Nasdaq composite edged up by less than 0.1% to 18,972.42. Nvidia rose just 0.5% after beating analysts’ estimates for profit and revenue yet again, but it was still the strongest force pulling the S&amp;P 500 upward. It also gave a forecast for revenue in the current quarter that topped most analysts’ expectations due to voracious demand for its chips used in artificial-intelligence technology. Nearly 90% of the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 advanced on Thursday, and the gains were even bigger among smaller companies. The Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks jumped a market-leading 1.7%. Bitcoin got a boost after Gary Gensler, the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said Thursday he would step down in January. Gensler has pushed for more protections for crypto investors. Bitcoin and related investment have a notorious history of big price swings in both directions. MicroStrategy, a company that’s been raising cash expressly to buy bitcoin, saw an early Thursday gain of 14.6% for its stock quickly disappear. It finished the day with a loss of 16.2%. In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude gained 26 cents to $70.36 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, added 29 cents to $74.52 a barrel. In currency trading, the U.S. dollar fell to 154.38 Japanese yen from 154.52 yen. The euro cost $1.0401, down from $1.0479.	https://apnews.com/article/stock-markets-bitcoin-china-oil-fe4ae2ce4338e779120c707dc9ade2e8	2024-11-21T19:28:18-08:00

North Korean leader says past diplomacy only confirmed US hostility	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said his past negotiations with the United States only confirmed Washington’s 'unchangeable' hostility toward his country and described his nuclear buildup as the only way to counter external threats, state media said Friday. Kim spoke Thursday at a defense exhibition where North Korea displayed some of its most powerful weapons, including intercontinental ballistic missiles designed to target the U.S. mainland as well as artillery systems and drones, according to text and photos published by the North’s Korean Central News Agency. While meeting with army officers last week, he had pledged a 'limitless' expansion of his military nuclear program. Kim has yet to comment directly on Donald Trump's reelection as U.S. president. During his first term, Trump held three highly orchestrated summits with the North Korean leader in 2018 and 2019, before the diplomacy collapsed over disagreements on exchanging a relaxation of U.S.-led economic sanctions with North Korean steps to wind down its nuclear program. During the speech at the exhibition, Kim touched on the failed summits without naming Trump. 'We have already gone as far as possible with the United States with negotiations, and what we ended up confirming was not a superpower’s will for coexistence, but a thorough position based on force and an unchangeable invasive and hostile policy' toward North Korea, Kim said. Kim accused the United States of raising military pressure on North Korea by strengthening military cooperation with regional allies and increasing the deployment of 'strategic strike means,' apparently a reference to major U.S. assets such as long-range bombers, submarines and aircraft carriers. He called for accelerated efforts to advance the capabilities of his nuclear-armed military, saying the country’s only guarantee of security is to build up the 'strongest defense power that can overwhelm the enemy.' Kim's expanding nuclear weapons and missile programs include various weapons targeting South Korea and Japan and longer-range missiles that have demonstrated the range to reach the U.S. mainland. Analysts say Kim’s nuclear push is aimed at eventually pressuring Washington into accepting North Korea as a nuclear power and to negotiate economic and security concessions from a position of strength. In recent months, the focus of Kim’s foreign policy has been Russia as he tries to strengthen his international footing, embracing the idea of a 'new Cold War' and aligning with President Vladimir Putin’s broader conflicts with the West. Washington and its allies have accused North Korea of providing Russia with thousands of troops and large amounts of military equipment, including artillery systems and missiles, to help sustain its fighting in Ukraine. Kim in return could possibly receive badly needed economic aid and Russian technology transfers that would possibly enhance the threat posed by his nuclear-armed military, according to outside officials and experts. North Korea also held a major arms exhibition in July last year and invited a Russian delegation led by then-Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, who was given a personal tour by Kim that included a briefing on the North's expanding military capabilities, in what outside critics likened to a sales pitch. That event came weeks before Kim traveled to the Russia for a summit with Putin, which sped up military cooperation between the countries. North Korean state media photos of this year's exhibition showed various artillery systems, including what appeared to be 240mm multiple rocket launch systems that South Korea's spy agency believes were part of the North Korean weaponry recently sent to Russia. When asked whether North Korea was showcasing the systems it intends to export to Russia, Koo Byoungsam, a spokesperson for South Korea’s Unification Ministry, said he wouldn't make 'premature judgments' but said the government was 'monitoring related trends.' 'We stress once again that arms transfers between Russia and North Korea are a clear violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions and an illegal act that undermines the norms of the international community,' he said. Even with Trump returning to the White House, a quick resumption of diplomacy with North Korea could be unlikely, according to some experts. North Korea's deepening alliance with Russia and the weakening enforcement of sanctions against it are presenting further challenges in the push to resolve the nuclear standoff with Kim, who also has a greater perception of his bargaining power following the rapid expansion of his arsenal in recent years.	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-kim-jong-un-trump-7fd79863780bc95871f5fdb5410df214	2024-11-21T16:02:16-08:00	
UN nuclear agency’s board condemns Iran for the 2nd time this year for failing to fully cooperate	VIENNA (AP) — The U.N. nuclear watchdog’s board on Thursday condemned Iran for failing to cooperate fully with the agency, the second time it has done so in just five months. The International Atomic Energy Agency also called on Tehran to provide answers in a long-running investigation into uranium particles found at two locations that Tehran has failed to declare as nuclear sites. Nineteen members of the IAEA board voted for the resolution, while Russia, China and Burkina Faso opposed it, and 12 abstained and one did not vote, according to diplomats who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the outcome of the closed-doors vote. The resolution was put forward by France, Germany and Britain, supported by the United States. It comes at a critical time, ahead of Donald Trump’s return to the White House. Trump’s first term in office was marked by a particularly tense period with Iran, when the U.S. president pursued a policy of 'maximum pressure' against Tehran. In 2018, Trump unilaterally withdrew America from Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers, and imposed even harsher sanctions that have since hobbled Iran's economy further. The resolution comes on the heels of a confidential report earlier this week in which the IAEA said Iran has defied international demands to rein in its nuclear program and has increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels. That report, seen by the AP on Tuesday, said that as of Oct. 26, Iran has accumulated 182.3 kilograms (401.9 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60%, an increase of 17.6 kilograms (38.8 pounds) since the last IAEA report in August. Uranium enriched at 60% purity is just a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. The resolution approved on Thursday requires the IAEA to now produce a 'comprehensive and updated assessment' of Iran’s nuclear activities, which could eventually trigger a referral to the U.N. Security Council to consider more sanctions on Tehran. In a joint statement issued after the approval of the resolution, the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran and the Iranian foreign ministry condemned the passing of the resolution, saying that Iran’s nuclear chief Mohammad Eslami has issued orders to launch new and advanced centrifuges, powerful machines that spin rapidly to enrich uranium. In the past, the IAEA has named two locations near Tehran — Varamin and Turquzabad — where there have been traces of processed uranium, according to IAEA inspectors. Thursday’s resolution honed in on those locations, asking Tehran to provide 'technically credible explanations' for the presence of the uranium particles at the sites.' The IAEA has urged Iran to also provide answers about the origin and current location of that nuclear material in order for it 'to be in a position to provide assurance that Iran’s nuclear program is exclusively peaceful.' Western officials suspect that the uranium traces discovered by the IAEA could provide evidence that Iran had a secret nuclear weapons program until at least 2003. Tehran insists its program is peaceful. One of the sites became known publicly in 2018 after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu revealed it at the United Nations and called it a clandestine nuclear warehouse hidden at a rug-cleaning plant. Iran denied that, though IAEA inspectors later found the man-made uranium particles there. While the number of sites about which the IAEA has questions has been reduced from four to two since 2019, lingering questions have been a persistent source of tensions. On the subject of Varamin, the IAEA said that inspectors believe Iran used the site from 1999 until 2003 as a pilot project to process uranium ore and convert it into a gas form, which then can be enriched through spinning in a centrifuge. The IAEA said buildings at the site had been demolished in 2004. Turquzabad, the second location, is where the IAEA believes Iran brought some of the material from Varamin amid the demolition, though it said that alone cannot 'explain the presence of the multiple types of isotopically altered particles' found there. Thursday’s resolution before the 35-member board at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna, called on Tehran to explain the presence of the uranium particles at Varamin and Turquzabad, inform the U.N. nuclear watchdog about the current whereabouts of that nuclear material, and grant access to IAEA inspectors to all Iranian nuclear locations. A draft of the resolution was seen by the AP. Tehran continues to maintain that its nuclear program is solely for peaceful purposes and has told the IAEA that it has declared all of the nuclear material, activities and locations required under a so-called Safeguard Agreement it has with the IAEA. Iranian officials have vowed to retaliate immediately if a resolution is passed. In the past, Tehran has responded to IAEA resolutions by stepping up its nuclear activities. The resolution also requires IAEA director general Rafael Grossi to provide an updated assessment of Iran’s nuclear program — including the possible presence of undeclared nuclear material at the two locations — by spring 2025 at the latest. The assessment could be a basis for possible further steps by European nations, diplomats said, leading to potential escalation in tensions between Iran and the West. It could also provide a basis for European countries to trigger sanctions against Iran ahead of October 2025, when the original 2015 Iran nuclear deal expires, the diplomats said.	https://apnews.com/article/un-nuclear-watchdog-iaea-iran-4706276a489b1a4cce2ca6260d0b3182	2024-11-21T12:00:13-08:00	
Canada's Trudeau to cut sales tax and send checks to millions of Canadians as election looms	HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) — Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau 's government announced plans Thursday to temporarily lift the federal sales tax off a number of items and send checks to millions of Canadians who are dealing with rising costs and as a federal election looms. The measures come as a cost of living crisis has left voters unhappy with Trudeau and ahead of an election that could come anytime between this fall and next October. 'Our government can’t set prices at the checkout, but we can put more money in people’s pockets,' Trudeau said at a press conference in Toronto. Under the plan, Canadians who worked in 2023 and earned up to 150,000 Canadian dollars (US$ 107,440) will receive a check for 250 Canadian dollars. Trudeau noted that even those earning at the high end of that amount have been struggling to get by. An estimated 18.7 million Canadians will receive the one-time check. The federal goods and services tax break would begin Dec. 14 and end Feb. 15. The government said the tax break will apply to a number of items including children’s clothing and shoes, toys, diapers, restaurant meals, beer and wine. It also applies to Christmas trees, a variety of snack foods and beverages and video game consoles. Opposition Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre called the announcement a 'two month temporary tax trick' that won’t make up for carbon taxes that are set to go up. Trudeau has said he will lead his Liberal Party into the next election. No Canadian prime minister in more than a century has won four straight terms. Trudeau channeled the star power of his father in 2015 when he reasserted the country’s liberal identity in 2015 after almost 10 years of Conservative rule. But the son of late Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau is now in trouble. Canadians have been frustrated by the cost of living coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Liberals trail the opposition Conservatives 39% to 26% in the latest Nanos poll. The poll of 1,047 respondents has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points. 'Politically, it’s probably too little too late and it feels like a desperate move on the part of an unpopular government,' said Daniel Béland, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal. 'It’s also bad public policy, at least from a fiscal standpoint.'	https://apnews.com/article/trudeau-canada-tax-break-election-e0f81b12d823a98f225c8b2c6ac28347	2024-11-21T10:12:38-08:00

What you need to know about the proposed measures designed to curb Google's search monopoly	U.S. regulators are proposing aggressive measures to restore competition to the online search market after a federal judge ruled Google maintained an illegal monopoly for the last decade. The sweeping set of recommendations filed late Wednesday by the U.S. Department of Justice could radically alter Google's business, including possibly spinning off the Chrome web browser and syndicating its search data to competitors. Even if the courts adopt the blueprint, Google isn't likely to make any significant changes until 2026 at the earliest, because of the legal system's slow-moving wheels. Here's what it all means: What is the Justice Department's goal? Federal prosecutors are cracking down on Google in a case originally filed during near the end of then-President Donald Trump’s first term. Officials say the main goal of these proposals is to get Google to stop leveraging its dominant search engine to illegally squelch competition and stifle innovation. 'The playing field is not level because of Google’s conduct, and Google’s quality reflects the ill-gotten gains of an advantage illegally acquired,' the Justice Department asserted in its recommendations. 'The remedy must close this gap and deprive Google of these advantages.' Not surprisingly, Google sees things much differently. The Justice Department's 'wildly overbroad proposal goes miles beyond the Court’s decision,' Kent Walker, Google's chief legal officer, asserted in a blog post. 'It would break a range of Google products — even beyond search — that people love and find helpful in their everyday lives.' It’s still possible that the Justice Department could ease off on its attempts to break up Google, especially if President-elect Donald Trump takes the widely expected step of replacing Jonathan Kanter, who was appointed by President Joe Biden to oversee the agency’s antitrust division. Why focus on Chrome? Regulators want Google to sell off its industry-leading Chrome web browser, though the filing did not specify who would ultimately buy the business or how that process would work. Justice lawyers called Chrome a 'gateway to the internet' that provides the search giant with data it then uses for targeted advertising. Regulators believe that asking Google to divest Chrome would create a more equal playing field for search competitors. Chrome also is included in the set of apps bundled with Android on phones as part of a mobile device ecosystem that regulators say gives Google a big edge. Chrome is the world’s most popular mobile web browser, with about 67% adoption globally, according to StatCounter. Apple’s Safari browser has the next highest adoption at 18%. Although it could be years before we see any practical effects of this case on the market, it could mean users would see more search engine options when selecting a default one to use on their favored devices. Does any of this affect Android? While federal regulators aren't going as far as to demand Google spin off Android, they are leaving the door open. The government asked the judge to impose behavioral limitations that would essentially blunt Android from favoring Google’s own general search services. Regulators asserted U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta should make it clear that Google could still be required to divest its smartphone operating system if the other proposed measures prove ineffective at restoring competition to the search market. Android is the world's most popular smartphone operating system, found on 71% of mobile phones, Statcounter says. It’s free to use, so many devices by Samsung and many other tech companies — aside from Apple — have it pre-installed. What else? The Justice Department outlined a range of behavioral measures to give rival search engines a better chance at competing with Google. The core remedy is a ban on Google from cutting deals worth billions of dollars to lock in its search engine as the default option on Apple’s iPhone and other popular devices. This could potentially impact the bottom line at companies receiving such packages. Other key recommendations: 1. Prohibiting Google from using search results to favor its own services, such as YouTube or its recently-launched artificial intelligence platform, Gemini. 2. Forcing Google to license the search index data to its rivals. 3. Requiring Google to be more transparent about how it sets the prices advertisers pay to be listed near the top of some targeted search results. 4. Giving publishers, websites and content creators the right to opt out of having their data indexed for Google's search results or to train its artificial intelligence models. What comes next? Google has the chance to submit its own list of proposed fixes in December, and federal regulators will file a revised version of their proposals in early March. Court hearings on these proposed measures are scheduled to begin in April and Mehta is expected to issue a final decision before Labor Day. The remedies trial will take place after the Trump administration takes over from Biden in January and assumes oversight of the Department of Justice, which could impact the punishments it ultimately pursues. Although Trump has made comments suggesting a breakup of Google isn't in the U.S. national interest, recent nominations put forward by his transition team have favored those who have been critical of Big Tech companies. And the case was originally filed during Trump's first term, which suggests Google won’t be entirely off the hook. Google is expected to appeal the case after the remedy hearings, which means the case could drag on for years in the courts.	https://apnews.com/article/google-android-chrome-antitrust-f4b73387d152a1c14c9df65bf0149a69	2024-11-21T08:29:53-08:00	
Wisconsin kayaker who faked his own death has told investigators how he did it, sheriff says	GREEN LAKE, Wis. (AP) — A Wisconsin man who faked his own drowning this summer so he could abandon his wife and three children has been communicating daily from Eastern Europe with police, even telling them how he did it, but has not committed to returning home, a sheriff said Thursday. Ryan Borgwardt has been talking with police since Nov. 11, Green Lake County Sheriff Mark Podoll said at a news conference. The sheriff showed a video that Borgwardt sent police that day. Police don't know exactly where he is, Podoll said, but it was somewhere in Eastern Europe. Borgwardt, wearing an orange T-shirt and not smiling, looked directly into the camera in the video, which appears to have been taken on his phone. Borgwardt said he was in his apartment and briefly panned the camera to show the inside, but mostly showed just a door and bare walls. 'I’m safe and secure, no problem,' Borgwardt said. 'I hope this works.' Borgwardt gave police details about how he faked his death and fled, Podoll said. He told police that he overturned his kayak and dumped his phone in Green Lake, paddled an inflatable boat to shore, and rode an electric bike through the night to Madison, the sheriff said. That's a distance of about 70 miles (110 kilometers). From there he took a bus to Detroit, then boarded a bus to Canada and got on a plane there, the sheriff said. Police were still verifying Borgwardt’s description of what happened, Podoll said. 'The great news is we know that he is alive and well,' Podoll said. 'The bad news is we don’t know where Ryan exactly is, and he has not yet decided to return home.' Podoll suggested Borgwardt could be charged with obstructing the investigation into his disappearance, but so far no counts have been filed. The sheriff said authorities 'keep pulling at his heartstrings' to return home. 'Christmas is coming,' Podoll said. 'And what better gift could your kids get than to be there for Christmas?' But whether Podoll returns, the sheriff said, is 'on his own free will.' Borgwardt’s disappearance was first investigated as a possible drowning after he went kayaking on Green Lake, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) northwest of Milwaukee. But subsequent clues — including that he obtained a new passport three months before he disappeared — led investigators to speculate that he faked his death to meet up with a woman he had been communicating with in Uzbekistan, a former Soviet republic in Central Asia. The sheriff declined to comment when asked what he knew about the woman, but he said police contacted Borgwardt 'through a female that spoke Russian.' Prior to police speaking with Borgwardt last week, he had not been heard from in three months. On the night of Aug. 11, Borgwardt texted his wife in Watertown shortly before 11 p.m., saying he was headed to shore after kayaking. Deputies located his vehicle and trailer near the lake. They also found his overturned kayak with a life jacket attached to it in an area where the lake’s waters run more than 200 feet (60 meters) deep. An angler later discovered Borgwardt’s fishing rod. Investigators initially speculated that Borgwardt’s kayak capsized and he didn’t have a life jacket. The search for his body went on for more than 50 days, with divers on several occasions exploring the lake. In early October, the sheriff’s department learned that Canadian law enforcement authorities had run Borgwardt’s name through their databases the day after he was reported missing. Further investigation revealed that he had reported his passport lost or stolen and had obtained a new one in May. Police said the analysis of a laptop revealed a digital trail that showed Borgwardt planned to head to Europe and tried to mislead investigators. Police said the laptop’s hard drive had been replaced and the browsers had been cleared the day Borgwardt disappeared. Investigators found passport photos, inquiries about moving money to foreign banks, and communication with a woman from Uzbekistan. They also discovered that he took out a $375,000 life insurance policy in January, although the policy was for his family and not him, the sheriff said. Authorities tried every phone number and email address on the laptop in 'a blitz fashion,' Podoll said. They eventually reached a Russian-speaking woman who connected them with Borgwardt. It's unclear whether she is the woman in Uzbekistan. Podell said Borgwardt has an apartment wherever he is, but the sheriff wasn't sure how he was supporting himself.	https://apnews.com/article/kayaker-fakes-death-fd6317cdb24bfae7c92f7933bcf47066	2024-11-21T08:26:56-08:00	
AP PHOTOS: Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande cut a 'Wicked' swath around the world	In 'Wicked,' Elphaba and Glinda travel from Shiz University to the Emerald City on a glistening green train to meet the wizard. In real life, Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande have traveled much farther and wider and longer — and on airplanes — to promote their hotly anticipated film. The Oscars. The Met Gala. CinemaCon in Las Vegas. Premieres on both U.S. coasts and around the globe in London, Mexico City and Sydney. The two stars even appeared at the Paris Olympics, where they should really have won a gold medal for fashion. At the Oscars in March, Erivo channeled her green-skinned character with a Louis Vuitton gown in shiny green leather. Grande evoked spritely Glinda in a bubble-gum pink concoction. Onstage, the duo presented the awards for best song and score, and Erivo managed to get in some lines from 'The Wizard of Oz.' Replied Grande: 'How wickedly subtle of you.' At the Met Gala in May, the duo switched colors during a performance for the lucky dinner guests, with Grande in light green and Erivo in rose. On the carpet, Erivo wore black festooned with pink flowers, a nod to her co-star. And in Paris, the two posed in front of the Eiffel Tower, with Grande in a Grace Kelly-esque light pink sleeveless dress and white gloves, and Erivo in a bright green Thom Browne gown, paired with a matching wide-brimmed hat. Her long nails — also green, of course — completed the look. Erivo changed direction in Mexico City, choosing black to emphasize Elphaba’s roots — she is, after all, the Wicked Witch of the West — wearing a hooded Thom Browne number that looked like she’d just stepped out of an enchanted forest. Grande was ethereal in a Versace gown of very light pink. At their stops, the two actors talked about the movie's message of acceptance and friendship. 'I think it’s such a beautiful thing that pop music, pop culture, these films and art that we create, can … create a safe space for people who feel like they don’t belong,' Grande said in Los Angeles. They also spoke about their own relationship. 'We really listen to each other,' Erivo said. 'I think that’s the wonderful thing. You trust that this other person knows what they want to do with their voice, knows everything about the music that they bring to the world, so you can just make space for it.'	https://apnews.com/article/ariana-grande-cynthia-erivo-wicked-gallery-28464d53c85c780cf1ac1f55673c47ab	2024-11-21T08:08:20-08:00	
The biggest remaining unsanctioned Russian bank hit with U.S. sanctions, nearly three years into war	WASHINGTON (AP) — Russia's third largest bank, Gazprombank and its six foreign subsidiaries were hit with U.S. sanctions on Thursday — in a move intended to curtail Russia's ability to evade the thousands of sanctions imposed on the nation since the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the sanctions targeting Russia’s largest remaining non-sanctioned bank would further diminish Russia's military effort and 'will make it harder for the Kremlin to evade U.S. sanctions and fund and equip its military.' In addition, more than 50 internationally connected Russian banks, 40 Russian securities registrars, and 15 Russian finance officials were hit with sanctions. The move comes after President Joe Biden this weekend authorized Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied missiles to strike deeper inside Russia, easing limitations on the longer range weapons as Russia deploys thousands of North Korean troops to reinforce its war. In addition, on Wednesday the Pentagon announced that it will send Ukraine at least $275 million in new weapons, including an undisclosed number of antipersonnel land mines, as the Biden administration rushes to do as much as it can to help Kyiv fight back against Russia before President-elect Donald Trump takes office. White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the U.S. 'remains committed to putting Ukraine in the strongest possible position, and we will continue to take all available steps to do so from surging security assistance to imposing and fully enforcing sanctions and other restrictions on Russia’s war machine.' Among other things, the sanctions deny the people and firms access to any property or financial assets held in the U.S. and prevent U.S. companies and citizens from doing business with them. Canada and the United Kingdom have previously sanctioned Gazprombank. Treasury states that Gazprombank is a means for Russia to fund its military to continue its war effort against Ukraine, using the bank to pay soldiers and compensate families of Russian soldiers killed in the fighting. Gazprombank played a role in remaining Russian natural gas supplies to Europe by handling payments from foreign customers. Earlier rounds of sanctions spared Russian gas because Europe’s economy was so dependent on it but Europe is now far less reliant on Russian gas, which is down to about 18% of imports. Russia cut off of most supplies in 2022, plunging the continent into an energy crisis. European governments and utilities have now lined up alternative supplies, much of it liquefied gas brought by ship from the U.S. and Qatar. Ukraine says it will halt flows of Russian gas through a pipeline across Ukraine to Europe - about 4% of Europe’s gas imports - at the end of the year. Gazprom recently cut off shipments through that pipeline to Austria’s OMV in a commercial dispute; OMV has said it has plenty of reserves and can find alternative supply elsewhere. The EU has set a nonbinding goal of ending all Russian gas imports by 2027. ___ McHugh reported from Frankfurt, Germany.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-sanctions-treasury-5b5852a47a143be972f8afd4f8ee89cd	2024-11-21T06:36:23-08:00	
Fashion designer describes invitation to work on Notre Dame cathedral's reopening as 'a calling'	PARIS (AP) — When Jean-Charles de Castelbajac watched as Notre Dame cathedral burned in April 2019, he felt compelled to act somehow. Returning home, the French fashion designer began sketching ideas, imagining the monument’s reconstruction. So, when the Paris Archbishop’s emissary approached him to design the liturgical garments for the cathedral's reopening next month, Castelbajac — a believer with personal roots with the church — felt the moment transcended mere coincidence. 'It’s bigger than a job. It’s a bit mysterious … mysterious,' Castelbajac said, his eyes brimming with wonder as he previewed some of the 2,000 colorful pieces for 700 celebrants at his Paris home. 'It's a calling. To be called like that is synchronicity.' This duty, as he calls it, led to a collection of work crafted in collaboration with the esteemed artisans of 19M studio. The garments, often in thick off-white Scottish wool gabardine, blend his signature eye-popping pop-art aesthetic with a reverence for the cathedral’s centuries-old legacy with medieval touches. The unorthodox designs are fun, modern — and perhaps shockingly minimalist. They undoubtedly break with the richly embellished styles associated with the cathedral's near-900-year-old liturgical garb. At their center is a large gold cross, accented by debris fragments of vivid color-blocked red, blue, yellow, and green velvet. 'It’s something that is exploded that reconstructs itself,' Castelbajac said, likening the dissipated shards coming together to the cathedral’s own rebirth. The commission was not subject to an open call. Instead, Castelbajac was handpicked by the Catholic leadership, due to his history of designing for the church. In 1997, he created the rainbow-colored robes worn by Pope John Paul II for World Youth Day in Paris, garments later enshrined in Notre Dame’s treasury as a relic. That connection carried a special weight during the fire. 'As I watched the fire, I was thinking, ‘Are the relics burning? Are the relics safe?’ So my link was not just material. It’s really a strong spiritual link,' he said. For Castelbajac, 74, the memory of those two hours in 2019 spent watching the fire with his wife amid people praying on their knees still evokes both grief and determination. 'It was not Notre Dame burning. It was hope burning. It was spirituality burning. It was such an intense moment … I was thinking, what can I do?' he said. The vestments, which will be worn in liturgies permanently — forever, as Castelbajac put it — carry a sense of continuity with his past work. The designs are a variation on the pontiff’s robes, infused with Castelbajac’s signature aesthetic: bright, almost childlike hues that evoke optimism. Castelbajac’s fascination with color began as a child in a military boarding school in Normandy, an experience he recalled as stifling and gray. 'It was the absolute loneliness. It was colorless,' he said. For the young boy, color became a lifeline. 'Color was like my teddy bear, my transitional element in a world of conflict. Each morning, there was the stained glass in the church and the coats of arms in the refectory that filled my world with primary colors,' he explained. This obsession would define his career, earning him a reputation as a provocateur in the fashion world. Castelbajac’s creations have dressed pop culture royalty for decades: Madonna in her teddy bear coat, Beyoncé in sequins, Rihanna in a Donald Duck costume. Collaborating with Andy Warhol, Keith Haring, and Jean-Michel Basquiat, he fused art and fashion into a playground of exuberance. While his designs have graced runways and music icons, Castelbajac’s work for Notre Dame strikes a different, more personal chord. The playful vestments might raise eyebrows among traditional Catholics, but he has no doubt about the faith Notre Dame’s leadership placed in him. 'Maybe I have the trust of the archbishop,' he mused, reflecting on the 'carte blanche' he said he received for his designs. This combination produced a modern-looking body of work that reflects the unity, hope, and rebirth symbolized by Notre Dame itself—just like the phoenix-like rooster gleaming like fire atop the newly constructed spire. When the cathedral reopens on the weekend of Dec. 7-8, Castelbajac hopes the vestments will be viewed by the world as a testament to renewal and the 'power of color' to heal and inspire.	https://apnews.com/article/notre-dame-designer-castelbajac-fashion-ab4fcfe8638c0250fab550e21970138f	2024-11-21T04:30:57-08:00	
Jannik Sinner leads Italy back to the Davis Cup semifinals and a rematch against Australia	MALAGA, Spain (AP) — No. 1-ranked Jannik Sinner won matches in singles and doubles to lead defending champion Italy to a 2-1 comeback victory over Argentina on Thursday, earning a return trip to the Davis Cup semifinals. 'I’m here trying to do the best I can in the singles,' Sinner said. 'If they put me on the court in doubles, I’ll also try my best.' On Saturday, Italy will face Australia in a rematch of last year's final, but this time it will only be for a chance to play for the championship. Australia eliminated the U.S. 2-1 earlier Thursday to reach the final four at the team competition for the third consecutive year. The other semifinal, to be contested Friday, is the Netherlands against Germany. The Dutch got past Rafael Nadal and Spain in the quarterfinals earlier in the week, sending the 22-time Grand Slam champion into retirement. Italy fell behind 1-0 in the quarterfinals when Argentina’s Francisco Cerúndolo defeated Lorenzo Musetti 6-4, 6-1 on an indoor hard court at the Palacio de Deportes Jose Maria Martina Carpena in southern Spain. But then in stepped Sinner, whose season already includes two Grand Slam trophies — at the Australian Open and U.S. Open — plus the title at the ATP Finals last weekend in Turin, Italy. First he overwhelmed Sebastián Báez 6-2, 6-1. Then Sinner teamed with 2021 Wimbledon runner-up Matteo Berrettini in the deciding doubles match to win 6-4, 7-5 against Andres Molteni and Maximo Gonzalez. 'He carried me today,' Sinner said about Berrettini. After arriving late to Malaga from Turin, Sinner did not get a chance to practice on the Davis Cup competition court before taking on Báez and stretching his streak to 22 sets won in a row. 'In three minutes, he was perfectly comfortable on court,' Italy captain Filippo Volandri said. 'He’s a special one.' Volandri swapped out his original doubles team, Simone Bolelli and Andrea Vavassori, for Sinner and Berrettini, and the change paid dividends. Australia, the Davis Cup runner-up the last two years, advanced when Matt Ebden and Jordan Thompson beat the surprise, last-minute American pairing of Ben Shelton and Tommy Paul 6-4, 6-4 in that quarterfinal's deciding doubles match. The Shelton-Paul substitution for Paris Olympics silver medalists Austin Krajicek and Rajeev Ram was announced about 15 minutes before the doubles match began. Ebden and John Peers beat Krajicek and Ram in the Summer Games final in August. The Australians broke once in each set of the doubles. In the second, they stole one of Shelton’s service games on the fourth break opportunity when Ebden’s overhead smash made it 5-4. Thompson then served out the victory, closing it with a service winner before chest-bumping Ebden. The 21st-ranked Shelton made his Davis Cup debut earlier Thursday in singles against 77th-ranked Thanasi Kokkinakis, who emerged from a tight-as-can-be tiebreaker by saving four match points and eventually converting his seventh to win 6-1, 4-6, 7-6 (14). No. 4 Taylor Fritz, the U.S. Open runner-up, then pulled the Americans even with a far more straightforward victory over No. 9 Alex de Minaur, 6-3, 6-4. When their match finally ended, on a backhand by Shelton that landed long, Kokkinakis dropped onto his back and pounded his chest. After he rose, he threw a ball into the stands, then walked over to Australia’s sideline, spiked his racket and yelled, before hugging captain Lleyton Hewitt. 'I don’t know if I’ve been that pumped up in my life. I wanted that for my team,' said Kokkinakis, who won the 2022 Australian Open men’s doubles title with Nick Kyrgios. 'It could have gone either way, but I kept my nerve.' ___ AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis	https://apnews.com/article/davis-cup-score-us-australia-italy-argentina-12664dd8497122489d49d345a6f22792	2024-11-21T03:17:14-08:00	
Top war-crimes court issues arrest warrants for Netanyahu, ex-defense minister and a Hamas leader	THE HAGUE (AP) — The world’s top war-crimes court issued arrest warrants Thursday for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his former defense minister and Hamas’ military chief, accusing them of crimes against humanity in connection with the 13-month war in Gaza. The warrants said there was reason to believe Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant have used 'starvation as a method of warfare' by restricting humanitarian aid and have intentionally targeted civilians in Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza — charges Israeli officials deny. The action by the International Criminal Court came as the death toll from Israel’s campaign in Gaza passed 44,000 people, according to local health authorities, who say more than half of those killed were women and children. Their count does not differentiate between civilians and combatants. Experts say hunger has become widespread across Gaza and may have reached famine levels in the north of the territory, which is under siege by Israeli troops. Netanyahu condemned the warrant against him, saying Israel 'rejects with disgust the absurd and false actions' by the court. In a statement released by his office, he said: 'There is nothing more just than the war that Israel has been waging in Gaza.' Gallant, in a statement, said the decision 'sets a dangerous precedent against the right to self-defense and moral warfare and encourages murderous terrorism.' The decision turns Netanyahu and the others into internationally wanted suspects and could further isolate them, putting them at risk of arrest when they travel abroad. Its practical implications could be limited since Israel and its major ally, the United States, are not members of the court. Still, the warrant marked the first time that a sitting leader of a major Western ally has been accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity by a global court of justice. It put Israel's allies, including some of its closest European friends, in an awkward position. Several leaders, including France, welcomed the court's decision and signaled they might arrest Netanyahu if he visited. The move 'represents the most dramatic step yet in the court’s involvement in the conflict between Israel and Hamas,' said Anthony Dworkin, senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. Israeli leaders, politicians and officials across the spectrum denounced the warrants and the ICC. The new defense minister, Israel Katz, who replaced Gallant earlier this month, said Thursday’s decision is 'a moral disgrace, entirely tainted by antisemitism, and drags the international judicial system to an unprecedented low.' Human rights groups applauded the move. The warrants against both sides 'break through the perception that certain individuals are beyond the reach of the law,' the associate international justice director at Human Rights Watch, Balkees Jarrah, said in a statement. The decision came six months after ICC Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan requested the warrants. The court issued a warrant for Mohammed Deif, head of Hamas’ armed wing, over the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks that triggered Israel’s offensive in Gaza. It said it found reasonable grounds to believe Deif was involved in murder, rape, torture and the taking of hostages amounting to war crimes and crimes against humanity. In the Hamas-led attack, militants stormed into southern Israel, killing 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and taking some 250 others hostage. Around 100 Israelis remain captive in Gaza, around a third of them believed to be dead. Khan withdrew requests for warrants for two other senior Hamas figures, Yahya Sinwar and Ismail Haniyeh, who have both since been killed. Israel says it also killed Deif in an airstrike, but Hamas has never confirmed his death. The warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant were issued by a three-judge panel in a unanimous decision. The panel said there were reasonable grounds to believe that both men bear responsibility for the war crime of starvation and the crimes against humanity of murder, persecution and other inhumane acts. The judges said the lack of food, water, electricity, fuel and specific medical supplies created conditions 'calculated to bring about the destruction of part of the civilian population in Gaza,' including the deaths of children due to malnutrition and dehydration. They also found that by preventing hospital supplies and medicine from getting into Gaza, doctors were forced to operate, including performing amputations, without anesthesia or with unsafe means of sedation that led to 'great suffering.' The judges also rejected an Israeli petition challenging the court’s jurisdiction on the grounds that Israel is not a member state in the tribunal. Despite the warrants, none of the suspects is likely to face judges in The Hague anytime soon. Member countries are required to detain suspects facing a warrant if they set foot on their soil, but the court has no way to enforce that. For example, Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is wanted on an ICC warrant for alleged war crimes in Ukraine, recently visited Mongolia, a member state in the court but also a Russian ally. He was not arrested. Still, the threat of arrest now complicates any travel abroad by Netanyahu and Gallant — including to close allies of Israel. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the warrants are binding on all 27 members countries of the European Union. France signaled it could arrest Netanyahu if he came to its territory. Foreign Ministry spokesman Christophe Lemoine called it a 'complex legal issue' but said France supports the court’s actions. 'Combating impunity is our priority,' he said. 'Our response will align with these principles.' Hamas in a statement welcomed the warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant but made no mention of the one against Deif. Israel’s opposition leaders fiercely criticized the ICC’s move. Benny Gantz, a retired general and political rival to Netanyahu, said it showed 'moral blindness' and was a 'shameful stain of historic proportion that will never be forgotten.' Yair Lapid, another opposition leader, called it a 'prize for terror.' Israel’s campaign has caused heavy destruction across Gaza, decimated parts of the territory and driven almost the entire population of 2.3 million people from their homes, leaving most dependent on aid to survive. Two days after Hamas’ attack on southern Israel, Gallant announced a total seal on Gaza, vowing not to let in food, fuel or other supplies. Under U.S. pressure, Israel began allowing a trickle of humanitarian aid to enter a few weeks later. Israel now says it puts no limit on the amount of supplies into Gaza. Still, the flow of food and other goods is at nearly the lowest levels of the war, and the U.N. and other groups have said Israeli military restrictions are largely to blame, along with widespread lawlessness that has led to theft of aid shipments. The case at the ICC is separate from another legal battle Israel is waging at the top U.N. court, the International Court of Justice, in which South Africa accuses Israel of genocide, an allegation Israeli leaders staunchly deny. Lawyers for Israel argued in court that the war in Gaza was a legitimate defense of its people and that it was Hamas militants who were guilty of genocide. ___ Associated Press journalists Raf Casert in Brussels, Mike Corder in The Hague and Josef Federman in Jerusalem contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/icc-israel-hamas-warrants-netanyahu-palestinian-arrest-73c854d072e0a1a41b19b2cb2cdd07fa	2024-11-21T03:02:05-08:00	
Middle East latest: Netanyahu denounces international court arrest warrant against him	The International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants on Thursday for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his former defense minister and Hamas officials, accusing them of war crimes and crimes against humanity. The announcement came as health officials in the Gaza Strip said the death toll from the 13-month-old war between Israel and Hamas has surpassed 44,000. Netanyahu condemned the arrest warrant against him, saying Israel 'rejects with disgust the absurd and false actions.' In a statement released by his office, he said: 'There is nothing more just than the war that Israel has been waging in Gaza.' On Thursday, the Health Ministry in Gaza said 44,056 people have been killed and 104,268 wounded since the start of the war. It has said the real toll is higher because thousands of bodies are buried under rubble or in areas that medics cannot access. The Gaza Health Ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count, but it has said that more than half of the fatalities are women and children. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. Israel launched its war against Hamas after Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. The Israeli offensive has caused heavy destruction across wide areas of the coastal territory and displaced 90% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million people. Israel has also launched airstrikes against Lebanon after the Hezbollah militant group began firing rockets, drones and missiles into Israel the day after Hamas' attack last October. A full-blown war erupted in September after nearly a year of lower-level conflict. More than 3,500 people have been killed in Lebanon, according to the country’s Health Ministry, and over 1 million people have been displaced. It is not known how many of those killed were Hezbollah fighters and how many were civilians. On the Israeli side, Hezbollah’s aerial attacks have killed more than 70 people and driven some 60,000 from their homes. ___ Here’s the Latest: Israeli military opens probe into death of a man in Hezbollah ambush JERUSALEM -- The Israeli military has launched an investigation into the death of a 70-year-old Israeli man who entered Lebanon with Israeli forces and was killed in a Hezbollah ambush. Investigators are trying to determine, among other things, who allowed Zeev Erlich into the combat zone with the forces and why he was permitted to enter. According to Israeli media reports, Erlich was not on active duty when he was shot, but was wearing a military uniform and had a weapon. The army said he was a reservist with the rank of major and identified him as a 'fallen soldier' when it announced his death. Erlich was a well-known West Bank settler and researcher of Jewish history. Media reports said Erlich was permitted to enter Lebanon to explore a local archaeological site. The army said a 20-year-old soldier was killed in the same incident, while an officer was badly wounded. The army announced Thursday that the chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, has appointed a team of experts 'to examine and strengthen operational discipline and military culture' following the incident. It said its commander for northern Israel, Maj. Gen. Ori Gordin, would launch a separate 'command inquiry,' while Israeli military police conduct a separate probe. Such investigations can lead to criminal charges. At least 29 killed by Israeli strikes across Lebanon, state media reports BEIRUT — At least 29 people were killed Thursday in Israeli strikes on different towns and villages across Lebanon, according to Lebanon’s Health Ministry and state-run media. In eastern Lebanon, Israeli airstrikes killed 26 people in six different towns in Baalbek province, the health ministry and the National News Agency said. In Tyre province, southern Lebanon, three people were killed in an Israeli strike, the health ministry said. The health ministry Wednesday said that over 3,550 people have been killed in the 13-month war between Hezbollah and Israel, the majority following Israel’s escalation in late September. EU foreign policy chief says ICC arrest warrants are binding on all bloc members The European Union's foreign policy chief has underlined that the arrest warrants issued by the International Criminal Court against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Hamas officials are a legal and not political matter, and that they are binding on all 27 EU member countries and other signatories to the ICC to implement. 'The tragedy in Gaza has to stop,' Josep Borrell told reporters during a visit to Jordan. 'It is not a political decision. It is the decision of an international court of justice, and the decision of the court has to be respected, and implemented.' 'This decision is a binding decision on all state parties of the court, which include all members of the European Union,' he added. Turkey's ruling party welcomes warrant against Netanyahu ANKARA — Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s ruling partyhas welcomed the decision by the International Criminal Court to issue arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamn Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, calling it a judgement made for the sake of 'humanity.' Omer Celik, spokesman for the Erdogan’s party, said on the social media platform X that Netanyahu and Gallant would 'eventually be held accountable for genocide.' Celik also criticised Israeli officials who described the ICC decision as antisemitic. Turkey is among the most vocal critics of Israel’s military actions in Gaza and has submitted a formal request to join a genocide case that South Africa has filed against Israel at the U.N.’s International Court of Justice. Dutch minister says his country would arrest Netanyahu if he visits Dutch foreign minister Caspar Veldkamp, whose country hosts the International Criminal Court, has confirmed The Netherlands would arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if he arrived on Dutch soil. 'The line from the government is clear. We are obliged to cooperate with the ICC ... we abide 100% by the Rome Statute,' he said in response to a question in parliament Thursday. Other European officials were more cautious. In France, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry said he supported the International Criminal Court's prosecutor but declined to comment when asked more specifically if France would arrest Netanyahu if he were to step on French soil. 'Today, combating impunity is our priority. We ratified the ICC Statute in 2000 and have consistently supported the court’s actions. Our response will align with these principles,' Christophe Lemoine told reporters at a press conference. Lemoine added that the warrants were 'a complex legal issue ... It’s a situation that requires a lot of legal precautions.' In Italy, the foreign and justice ministries didn’t immediately respond to emails seeking comment about whether Italy, an ICC member which hosted the Rome conference that gave birth to the court, would honor the arrest warrant. Premier Giorgia Meloni hosted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in March 2023 and has strongly supported Israel since Oct. 7, while providing humanitarian aid for Palestinians in Gaza. Israeli president says arrest warrants signal 'dark day for justice' JERUSALEM — Israel’s mostly ceremonial president, Isaac Herzog, has called the International Criminal Court's arrest warrants against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 'a dark day for justice. A dark day for humanity.' In a post on X, he said the international court 'has chosen the side of terror and evil over democracy and freedom, and turned the very system of justice into a human shield for Hamas’ crimes against humanity.' Israel Katz, Israel’s new defense minister, said the decision was 'a moral disgrace, entirely tainted by antisemitism, and drags the international judicial system to an unprecedented low.' He said it 'serves Iran, the head of the snake, and its proxies.' Benny Gantz, a retired general and political rival to Netanyahu, also condemned the decision, saying it showed 'moral blindness' and was a 'shameful stain of historic proportion that will never be forgotten.' Hamas welcomes warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant Hamas has welcomed the decision by the International Criminal Court to issue warrants against Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister Yoav Gallant, calling it an 'important and historic precedent' after what it said was decades of injustice at the hands of a 'fascist occupation.' The statement did not refer to the warrants issued for the militant group’s own leaders. Hamas called on all nations to 'cooperate with the court in bringing the Zionist war criminals, Netanyahu and Gallant, to justice, and to work immediately to stop the crimes of genocide against innocent civilians in the Gaza Strip.' Bakeries reopen in central Gaza after flour shortages DEIR AL-BALAH, The Gaza Strip — Bakeries have reopened in the central Gaza Strip after being closed for several days because of flour shortages. The shortages appear to have been linked to the looting of nearly 100 truckloads of aid by armed men in southern Gaza last weekend. Associated Press footage showed a crowd of hundreds pushing and shouting outside a bakery in the central city of Deir al-Balah on Thursday. The day before the reopening, the price of a bag of 15 loaves of pita bread had climbed above $13. 'In my house, there is not a morsel of bread, and the children are hungry,' said Sultan Abu Sultan, who was displaced from northern Gaza during the war. The amount of aid entering Gaza plunged in October as Israel launched a major offensive in the isolated north, where experts say famine may be underway. Hunger is widespread across the territory, even in central Gaza where aid groups have more access. Humanitarian organizations say Israeli restrictions, ongoing fighting and the breakdown of law and order make it difficult to deliver assistance. Israel’s offensive, launched after Hamas’ October 2023 attack, has displaced around 90% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million people. Hundreds of thousands are crammed into tent camps with little in the way of public services and are reliant on international food aid. Cyprus says EU must no longer stand by as an observer to the MidEast NICOSIA — The president of Cyprus says the European Union must play a bigger role in the Middle East as it can no longer stand by as an observer. President Nikos Christodoulides said the 27-member bloc needs to establish closer ties with countries that bolster regional stability like Egypt, Jordan and the Gulf states. 'The conflict in the Middle East is taking place on the EU’s doorstep, in an area of vital interest to the bloc’s interests, where any escalation or regional spillover will have significant consequences on its security and stability,' Christodoulides told an Economist conference in the Cypriot capital. Christodoulides said EU member Cyprus for years has tried to get this message across to Brussels. The island nation earlier this year was the staging ground for a maritime corridor delivering some 20,000 tons of humanitarian aid to Gaza. The EU is wracked by members’ divisions over how peace should come about in the Middle East International Criminal Court issues arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Hamas officials THE HAGUE — The International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants on Thursday for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his former defense minister and Hamas officials, accusing them of war crimes and crimes against humanity over the war in Gaza and the October 2023 attacks that triggered Israel’s offensive in the Palestinian territory. The decision turns Netanyahu and the others into internationally wanted suspects and is likely to further isolate them and complicate efforts to negotiate a cease-fire to end the 13-month conflict. But its practical implications could be limited since Israel and its major ally, the United States, are not members of the court and several of the Hamas officials have been subsequently killed in the conflict. Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders have previously condemned ICC Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan’s request for the warrants as disgraceful and antisemitic. U.S. President Joe Biden also blasted the prosecutor and expressed support for Israel’s right to defend itself against Hamas. Hamas also slammed the request. Death toll in Gaza surpasses 44,000, local officials say The death toll in the Gaza Strip from the 13-month-old war between Israel and Hamas has surpassed 44,000, local health officials said Thursday. The Gaza Health Ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count, but it has said that more than half of the fatalities are women and children. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. The Health Ministry said 44,056 people have been killed and 104,268 wounded since the start of the war. It has said the real toll is higher because thousands of bodies are buried under rubble or in areas that medics cannot access. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. Around 90% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million people have been displaced, often multiple times, and hundreds of thousands are living in squalid tent camps with little food, water or basic services. Israel says it tries to avoid harming civilians and blames their deaths on Hamas because the militants operate in residential areas, where they have built tunnels, rocket launchers and other military infrastructure. Rocket from Lebanon kills 1, wounds 2 others in northern Israel JERUSALEM — A rocket fired from Lebanon killed a man and wounded two others in northern Israel on Thursday, according to the Magen David Adom rescue service. The service said paramedics found the body of the man in his 30s near a playground in the town of Nahariya, near the border with Lebanon, after a rocket attack on Thursday. Israel meanwhile struck targets in southern Lebanon and several buildings south of Beirut, the Lebanese capital, after warning people to evacuate.	https://apnews.com/article/mideast-wars-israel-gaza-lebanon-5dbfc18c7311a6b3eb16c89981bd3dfb	2024-11-21T03:00:32-08:00	
Death toll in Gaza from Israel-Hamas war passes 44,000, Palestinian officials say	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — The death toll in the Gaza Strip from the 13-month-old war between Israel and Hamas has surpassed 44,000, local health officials said Thursday.

Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. The Israeli offensive has caused heavy destruction across wide areas of the coastal territory, leading many to wonder when or how it will ever be rebuilt. Around 90% of the population of 2.3 million people have been displaced, often multiple times, and hundreds of thousands are living in squalid tent camps with little food, water or basic services. Israel says it tries to avoid harming civilians and blames their deaths on Hamas because the militants operate in residential areas, where they have built tunnels, rocket launchers and other military infrastructure. Palestinian officials and rights groups accuse Israeli forces of war crimes and crimes against humanity, and the United Nations’ top court is considering allegations of genocide brought by South Africa. The Israeli government adamantly denies the allegations, accusing critics of being biased against it. In recent weeks, the amount of humanitarian aid entering Gaza has plummeted, prompting the United States to threaten to reduce its military support for Israel before backing down, citing limited progress. Experts have warned that isolated, war-ravaged northern Gaza could already be experiencing famine. The United States, Egypt and Qatar spent months trying to broker a cease-fire agreement in which Hamas would release the remaining hostages in exchange for an end to the war. Those talks ground to a halt over the summer, with Israel and Hamas each accusing the other of making unacceptable demands. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to end the wars in the Middle East without saying how. His previous administration gave unprecedented support to Israel and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s hard-line policies toward the Palestinians. ___ Khaled reported from Cairo. ___ Find more of AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-lebanon-hezbollah-iran-news-11-20-2024-5da3ce43df8662fe9eeab4ad804bdc0f	2024-11-21T02:39:23-08:00	
At least 38 killed as gunmen open fire on vehicles carrying Shiites in northwest Pakistan	PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) — Gunmen opened fire on vehicles carrying Shiite Muslims in Pakistan's restive northwest on Thursday, killing at least 38 people, including six women, and wounding 20 others in one of the region's deadliest such attacks in recent years, police said. The attack happened in Kurram, a district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province where sectarian clashes between majority Sunni Muslims and minority Shiites have killed dozens of people in recent months. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the latest attack. It came a week after authorities reopened a key highway in the region that had been closed for weeks following deadly clashes. Local police official Azmat Ali said several vehicles were traveling in a convoy from the city of Parachinar to Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, when gunmen opened fire. He said at least 10 passengers were in critical condition at a hospital. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said at least 38 people were killed in the 'terrorist attack.' Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the attack, and Sharif said those behind the killing of innocent civilians will not go unpunished. A witness, 35-year-old Mir Hussain, said he saw four gunmen emerge from a vehicle and open fire on buses and cars. 'I think other people were also firing at the convoy of vehicles from nearby open farm field,' he said. 'The firing continued for about 40 minutes.' He said he hid until the attackers fled. 'I heard cries of women, and people were shouting for the help,' he said. Ibne Ali Bangash, a relative of one of the victims, described the convoy attack as the saddest day in Kurram's history. 'More than 40 people from our community have been martyred,' he said. 'It’s a shameful matter for the government.' Baqir Haideri, a local Shiite leader, denounced the assault and said the death toll was likely to rise. He accused local authorities of not providing adequate security for the convoy of more than 100 vehicles despite fears of possible attacks by militants who had recently threatened to target Shiites in Kurram. Shop owners in Parachinar announced a strike on Friday to protest the attack. Shiite Muslims make up about 15% of the 240 million population of Sunni-majority Pakistan, which has a history of sectarian animosity between the communities. Although they live together largely peacefully, tensions have existed for decades in some areas, especially in parts of Kurram, where Shiites are the majority. Nearly 50 people from both sides were killed over a land dispute in July when clashes between Sunni and Shiites erupted in Kurram. Initially, the clashes between between Sunni Muslims and Shiites began over a dispute on land in July, but then the lingering dispute turned into a sectarian violence, resulting into killing of dozens of people from both sides. Pakistan is tackling violence in the northwest and southwest, where militants and separatists often target police, troops and civilians. Most of the violence in these areas has been blamed on the Pakistani Taliban, a separate militant group but closely allied with Afghanistan's Taliban rulers, and the separatists in southwestern Balochestan province who are mainly members of the outlawed Baloch Liberation Army. ___ Associated Press writers Asim Tanveer, Rasool Dawar and Ishtiaq Mahsud in Multan, Peshawar, and Dera Ismail Khan in Pakistan contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-gunmen-opened-fire-convoy-vehicles-northwest-42c8fb3cf1f720de49efebd306d76fa1	2024-11-21T01:26:35-08:00	
UK watchdog slams family of fundraiser Capt. Tom Moore for making personal gains from charity	LONDON (AP) — Britain’s charity regulator on Thursday sanctioned the daughter and son-in-law of Capt. Tom Moore, saying they personally benefited from a charity set up in the name of the World War II veteran who raised millions of pounds by walking laps of his garden during the coronavirus pandemic. Moore, who died in 2021 at 100 years old, raised almost 39 million pounds ($49 million) through his daily walks, inspiring people across the U.K. who followed his exploits in daily TV updates during the early weeks of the pandemic. All of that money was donated to Britain’s National Health Service. The problems began after Moore’s family established the Captain Tom Foundation to continue his fundraising efforts. The Charity Commission for England and Wales slammed his daughter and son-in-law in a damning report that found they made almost 1.5 million pounds ($1.9 million) from activities linked to the charity, including a book deal and an 18,000-pound fee to attend an awards ceremony. The foundation has urged the family to rectify matters by returning the funds due to the charity. The regulator has barred Moore's daughter, Hannah Ingram-Moore, from serving as a trustee for any charity for 10 years and her husband, Colin, for a period of eight years. The Ingram-Moores said the report treated them unfairly and that the charity watchdog had a 'predetermined agenda.' 'True accountability demands transparency, not selective storytelling,’’ the family said in a statement. 'We remain dedicated to upholding Captain Sir Tom’s legacy and want the public to know, that there has never been any misappropriation of funds or unauthorized payments from the charity’s bank account, by any member of our family.'	https://apnews.com/article/capt-tom-covid-19-pandemic-charity-138e7825dacafa23c00df2361ac01e6c	2024-11-21T00:36:46-08:00	
Ukraine says Russia has launched an ICBM in an attack for the first time in the war	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine says Russia launched an intercontinental ballistic missile overnight targeting Dnipro city in the central-east of the country, which, if confirmed, would be the first time Moscow has used such a missile in the war. In a statement Thursday on the Telegram messaging app, Ukraine's air force did not specify the exact type of missile, but said it was launched from Russia’s Astrakhan region, which borders the Caspian Sea. It said an intercontinental ballistic missile was fired at Dnipro city along with eight other missiles, and that the Ukrainian military shot down six of them. Two people were wounded as a result of the attack, and an industrial facility and a rehabilitation center for people with disabilities were damaged, according to local officials. While the range of an ICBM would seem excessive for use against Ukraine, such missiles are designed to carry nuclear warheads, and the use of one would serve as a chilling reminder of Russia’s nuclear capability and a powerful message of potential escalation. The development comes as the war has taken on a growing international dimension with the arrival of North Korean troops to help Russia on the battlefield — a development that U.S. officials said prompted U.S. President Joe Biden’s policy shift on allowing Ukraine to fire longer-range U.S. missiles into Russia. The Kremlin responded with threats to escalate further. The attack comes two days after Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a revised nuclear doctrine that formally lowers the threshold for the country's use of nuclear weapons. Ukraine on Tuesday fired several American-supplied longer-range missiles and reportedly fired U.K.-made Storm Shadows on Wednesday into Russia. Putin has previously warned the U.S. and other NATO allies that allowing Ukraine to use Western-supplied longer-range weapons to hit Russian territory would mean that Russia and NATO are at war. The new doctrine allows for a potential nuclear response by Moscow even to a conventional attack on Russia by any nation that is supported by a nuclear power. While the doctrine envisions a possible nuclear response by Russia to a conventional strike, it is formulated broadly to avoid a firm commitment to use nuclear weapons and keep Putin’s options open.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-icbm-attackddnipro-38b0faf6eed2cef98bdbc9be18f58244	2024-11-21T00:12:40-08:00	
One Tech Tip: How to get started with Bluesky	LONDON (AP) — Looking for a new social media platform because X, Threads and Mastodon just aren't cutting it? You could try Bluesky. People seeking to avoid chaos, noise and political bluster in the aftermath of the U.S. elections are noticing a different mood on the Bluesky social platform, where the vibe is seemingly welcoming and there are noticeably fewer trolls. The site announced it had rapidly added more than a million new users in the week after Election Day, and has emerged as one of the fastest growing rivals to Elon Musk’s X and similar platforms. If you're tempted to check out the new space, here's a guide on how Bluesky works: Getting started Maybe you're not ready to commit to adding yet another social media account. No problem — you can still look around on Bluesky without signing up because all posts and profiles are public. You might get a sense of deja vu because the platform's look and feel are very similar to X. That should be no surprise because Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey was an early Bluesky champion. (Dorsey's no longer involved with Bluesky, which is owned and run by its executive team as a public benefit corporation.) If you take the plunge and get an account, you'll need a username. You'll notice Bluesky handles are a little bit different because they end by default in the site's domain, .bsky.social. You can personalize your handle to make it more memorable, by using your own website's domain or buying a custom one through Bluesky. But it might not be something most newbie users need or want to do right away. How do I find interesting people? Bluesky boasts that it gives users 'algorithmic choice' to tailor the content they're shown instead of leaving it up to the whims of a centralized system. 'Our online experience doesn’t have to depend on billionaires unilaterally making decisions over what we see,' it says. What it means is that you can follow custom feeds set up by other users, or design your own. If you tap #Feeds in the menu on the left, you'll see some default offerings like Cat Pics and Gardening. My Bangers is a list of your most popular posts by likes and Catch Up shows the site's most popular posts from the past 24 hours. You can find more by doing a search and tapping the Feeds button. There's also the usual 'Discover' feed of suggested posts and a chronological feed of accounts that you follow. To help new users settle in, Bluesky has starter packs of recommended feeds and accounts to follow, which anyone can create and share. They don’t show up in Bluesky's search results but can be found in directories online. Or someone might share one with you. After I signed up, a colleague pointed me to one for major news outlets. There are tens of thousands of starter packs, ranging from broadly appealing topics like Taylor Swift to niche interests like cargo bikes or U.K. comedians. You can follow the whole pack or scroll down the list to choose individual accounts. What about people you followed on X? There's a browser extension tool called Sky Follower Bridge that will help you find X users who've migrated to Bluesky. But check before clicking the follow button to make sure it's not a different user using the same display name or handle. How to post Ready to join the conversation? You can write posts or reply to others but keep it short because there's a limit of 300 characters — 20 more than on X. You can also upload photos and videos, though videos can't be longer than 60 seconds. GIFs and emojis are, of course, available too. You can still @ people by typing in their username, like posts by tapping a heart icon or use hashtags to highlight a theme. Bluesky has added a menu to hashtags, so when you click on one you'll get different options for seeing, or muting, posts on that topic. What about trolls? Bluesky's decentralization ethos extends to the content control options it offers. For starters, users can choose in their settings menu whether to see replies, reposts or quote posts in their feed. Specific words or tags can be muted temporarily, or forever, while accounts can be muted or blocked individually, or in bulk by adding them a moderation list. You can even fine tune the level of adult content that shows up in your feed. Bluesky has a team of content moderators to police the site for material that's illegal or breaks the rules. But it's also taking a different approach by open sourcing its content moderation system in an attempt to resolve problems with traditional moderation services which it says 'lack transparency and user control.' So, individuals or groups can set up their own content filters, or labelers, that go beyond what Bluesky offers. These labelers can be used to categorize content or users, which can then be blocked or hidden. But they could also be used for informational or creative purposes, like curating or verifying content. There are labelers to identify images generated by artificial intelligence or to fact check news posts. You can find lists of labelers online. After I subscribed to a U.S. politics labeler, some posts in my feeds were flagged '!Donald Trump' or '!Democrat politician' and hidden unless I click Show. ___ Follow Kelvin Chan on Bluesky ___ Is there a tech challenge you need help figuring out?

Former UK Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott dies at age 86	LONDON (AP) — British politician John Prescott, a former merchant seaman who rose to the post of deputy prime minister, has died at age 86. Prescott’s family announced his death on Thursday. They said the politician, who had been suffering from Alzheimer’s disease, died peacefully in a care home on Wednesday with his loved ones around him. The family said Prescott had 'spent his life trying to improve the lives of others, fighting for social justice and protecting the environment.' For a decade, Prescott brought grit, humor and working-class authenticity to the government of the young, polished Tony Blair, who became prime minister in 1997. 'He was one of the most talented people I ever encountered in politics, one of the most committed and loyal, and definitely the most unusual,' Blair said. An amateur boxer in his youth, Prescott was a pugnacious politician who memorably punched a man who threw an egg at him during the 2001 general election. The uproar briefly looked like it might harm the party, and Prescott’s career. But Blair’s response -– 'John is John' -– cemented his folksy status. Prescott entered politics through the trade union movement — a once-common route that became less frequent after Blair rebranded the left-leaning party 'New Labour' and shifted its politics toward the center, He was a proud working-class figure in a country that still has few from that background at the top of politics. He unapologetically liked the finer things in life and was nicknamed 'Two Jags' by the press because he had two Jaguar luxury cars. The egg-thrower punching incident earned him another nickname: 'Two Jabs' Prescott served as Blair’s deputy between 1997 and 2007. One of his proudest achievements was working with then-U.S. Vice President Al Gore on the landmark Kyoto Protocol climate change agreement in 1997. Gore said he had 'never worked with anyone in politics — on my side of the pond or his — quite like John Prescott.' 'He fought like hell to negotiate the Kyoto Protocol and was an unwavering champion of climate action for decades to come. I’m forever grateful to John for that commitment to solving the climate crisis and will miss him as a dear friend,' Gore said in a statement. Prescott represented his home city of Hull in northern England for four decades. After Labour lost power in 2010 he was made a member of Parliament’s unelected upper chamber, the House of Lords. Former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown said Prescott was a true working-class hero. 'He wanted the good things in life for everyone and not just himself,' Brown said. 'And he showed that Britain can be a country where if you work hard you can fill your potential.' He is survived by his wife Pauline and sons Johnathan and David.	https://apnews.com/article/uk-labour-john-prescott-dies-f21a518359c106fbd86df1cc2d8a3084	2024-11-20T23:54:29-08:00	
Shares in India's Adani Group plunge 20% after US bribery, fraud indictments	NEW DELHI (AP) — Asia’s controversial richest man, Indian tycoon Gautam Adani, is again in the spotlight. His companies’ stocks plunged up to 20% on Thursday after he was indicted by U.S. prosecutors on charges he duped investors in a massive solar energy project in India by concealing that it was being facilitated by an alleged bribery scheme. In an indictment unsealed by federal prosecutors in New York on Wednesday, Adani, 62, was charged with securities fraud and conspiracy to commit securities and wire fraud. One result of the U.S. legal action is that the Adani group decided not to proceed with a proposed U.S. dollar-denominated bond offering. Adani Renewables announced the decision in letters to the Bombay Stock Exchange and the National Stock Exchange of India. Who is Gautam Adani? Adani is the son of a middle-class family in Ahmedabad in western India’s Gujarat state. Adani quit college to become a diamond trader in Mumbai, India’s financial capital. In the 1980s, he started importing plastics before establishing Adani Enterprises, which traded in everything from shoes to buckets and remains his flagship company. India opened up its economy in the 1990s and a new middle class emerged as tens of millions of people escaped poverty and the economy boomed, prompting Adani to bet on infrastructure and coal. Adani’s first big project, the Mundra port in Gujarat, opened in 1998 and is now India’s largest. Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd. is India’s biggest private port operator. Within a decade, Adani became India’s largest developer and operator of coal mines. According to Adani Power’s website, it has expanded to Australia and Indonesia and is on track to be 'one of the largest mining groups in the world.' Adani companies, India's second-largest conglomerate, operate airports in major cities, build roads, generate electricity, manufacture defense equipment, develop agricultural drones, sell cooking oil and run a media outlet. Despite his fossil fuel roots, the billionaire Adani Green aims to become the world’s largest renewable energy player by 2030. Why is Adani controversial? Adani is considered close to the Hindu nationalist government, and the political opposition has long accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of having close ties with the tycoon. They both hail from the western state of Gujarat. The businessman's critics say much of his success stems from his close ties to the government and Modi. For example, they have accused the government of adjusting bidding rules to make it easier for Adani to win contracts to operate airports. The company denies this, saying contracts were won relatively transparently. India’s main opposition immediately demanded a parliamentary committee probe into Adani Group dealings, which Jairam Ramesh, a leader of the Congress Party, said are causing 'growing monopolization in key sectors of the Indian economy, fueling inflation, and posing huge foreign policy challenges as well.' Ramesh said his party has been ``bringing out the various dimensions of these scams and the intimate nexus between the PM (Prime Minister Modi) and his favorite businessman. These questions have remained unanswered.' Last year, the Adani companies lost $68 billion in market value after short-selling firm Hindenburg Research accused Adani of 'pulling the largest con in corporate history,' triggering a massive sell-off of the group's stocks. U.S.-based Hindenburg accused Adani companies of stock price manipulation and fraud just as the group began a share offering meant to raise $2.5 billion. The Adani group dismissed Hindenburg’s allegations, saying none were 'based on independent or journalistic fact finding.' Adani’s response included documents and data tables and it said the group had made all necessary regulatory disclosures and has abided by local laws. How Adani became Asia's richest man Adani’s net worth shot up about 2,000% in recent years as share prices for his listed companies soared. Before Modi took office, Adani was friendly with the rival Congress Party, which governed Gujarat state when many of his early projects began. Adani has been 'close to every politician in power,' R N Bhaskar, a journalist who wrote a biography on Adani, told The Associated Press. Adani’s supporters say he has cleverly aligned the group’s priorities with those of the government by investing in key industries like renewable energy, defense, and agriculture. His projects overseas, in strategically important countries like neighboring Sri Lanka, help New Delhi compete with rival Beijing in the region.	https://apnews.com/article/adani-india-bribery-tycoon-modi-cd1ee53edee0df1bf00de01b044366b4	2024-11-20T23:08:50-08:00	
Southeast Asian defense chiefs discuss regional security with US, China and other partner nations	VIENTIANE, Laos (AP) — Southeast Asian defense chiefs met Thursday with China, the United States and other partner nations in Laos for security talks, which come as Beijing’s increasingly assertive stance in its claim to most of the South China Sea is leading to more confrontations. The closed-door talks put U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and Chinese Defense Minister Dong Jun in the same room a day after Dong refused a request to meet with Austin one-on-one on the sidelines of the ASEAN Defense Ministers Meetings. The U.S. and China have been working to improve frayed military-to-military communications and Austin said he regretted Dong's decision, calling it 'a setback for the whole region.' The ASEAN meetings come as member nations are looking warily toward the change in American administrations at a time of increasing maritime disputes with China. The U.S. has firmly pushed a 'free and open Indo-Pacific' policy under outgoing President Joe Biden and it is not yet clear how the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump will address the South China Sea situation. In addition to the United States and China, other nations attending the ASEAN meeting from outside Southeast Asia include Japan, South Korea, India, Russia, Australia and New Zealand. The meetings with the ASEAN dialogue partners were also expected address tensions in the Korean Peninsula, the Russia-Ukraine war, and wars in the Middle East. Before heading to Laos, Austin concluded meetings in Australia with officials there and with Japan’s defense minister. They pledged to support ASEAN and expressed their 'serious concern about destabilizing actions in the East and South China Seas, including dangerous conduct by the People’s Republic of China against Philippines and other coastal state vessels.' Along with the Philippines, ASEAN members Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei have competing claims with China in the South China Sea, which Beijing claims almost entirely as its own territory. Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos are the other ASEAN members. As China has grown more assertive in pushing its territorial claims in recent years, it and ASEAN have been negotiating a code of conduct to govern behavior in the sea, but progress has been slow. Officials have agreed to try to complete the code by 2026, but talks have been hampered by thorny issues, including disagreements over whether the pact should be binding. Chinese and Philippine vessels have clashed repeatedly this year, and Vietnam in October charged that Chinese forces assaulted its fishermen in disputed areas in the South China Sea. China has also sent patrol vessels to areas that Indonesia and Malaysia claim as their exclusive economic zones. Another thorny regional issue is the civil war and humanitarian crisis in ASEAN member Myanmar. The group’s credibility has been severely tested by the war in Myanmar, where the army ousted an elected government in 2021, and fighting has continued with pro-democracy guerillas and ethnic rebels. More than a year into an offensive initiated by three militias and joined by other resistance groups, observers estimate the military controls less than half the country. Myanmar military rulers have been barred from ASEAN meetings since late 2021, but this year the country has been represented by high-level bureaucrats, including at the summit in October. At the defense meetings, the country is represented by Zaw Naing Win, director of the Defense Ministry’s International Affairs Department. Meetings on Wednesday also discussed military cooperation, transnational haze, disinformation, border security and transnational crimes such as drugs, cyberscams and human trafficking, Thai Defense Ministry spokesperson Thanathip Sawangsang said.	https://apnews.com/article/laos-asean-defense-admm-south-china-sea-0fff658a80f81d2745c1234f5912a6c2	2024-11-20T20:28:29-08:00	
At UN climate talks, a draft of the deal gives little clarity on climate cash for developing nations	BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) — A new draft text released early Thursday which will form the basis of any deal reached at United Nations climate talks on money for developing countries to transition to clean energy and adapt to climate change left out a crucial sticking point: how much wealthy nations will pay. Negotiators at the talks — known as COP29 — in Baku, Azerbaijan, are trying to close the gap between the $1.3 trillion the developing world says is needed in climate finance and the few hundred billion that negotiators say richer nations have been prepared to give. But the EU's climate envoy Wopke Hoekstra told a meeting of negotiators set up by the COP29 Presidency on Thursday that 'the text we now have in front of us, in our view, is imbalanced, unworkable, and not acceptable.' Independent experts say that at least $1 trillion is needed in finance to help transition away from planet-warming fossil fuels and toward clean energy like solar and wind, better adapt to the effects of climate change and pay for losses and damages caused by extreme weather. No figure for climate cash leaves many disappointed Mohamed Adow, director of the think tank Power Shift Africa, also disappointment at the lack of a figure. 'We came here to talk about money. The way you measure money is with numbers. We need a cheque but all we have right now is a blank piece of paper,' he said. Iskander Erzini Vernoit, director of Moroccan climate think-tank Imal Initiative for Climate and Development, said he was 'at a loss for words at how disappointed we are at this stage to have come this far without serious numbers on the table and serious engagement from the developed countries.' He said that some developed nations 'are slowly waking up' to the fact that keeping warming to below 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times will require over a trillion dollars in finance. 'But many are still asleep at the wheel,' he said. Mariana Paoli, of Christian Aid, also laid the blame at the feet of developed nations. 'Rich countries had one job to do: lay out how much finance they are going to provide, but there’s no actual numbers in the latest text,' she said. 'It’s like developed countries are saying the dog ate their homework. A draft deal of two extremes Li Shuo, Asia Society Policy Institute Director, said the draft text on money 'presents two extreme ends of the aisle without much in between.' The talks' presidency — that puts the drafts together based on the negotiations — 'has not delivered as we had expected,' said German climate envoy Jennifer Morgan. 'We are confronted with a text on finance that is laid out to divide us, exactly at a time when the presidency should be working to unite us,' she said. 'Instead of bridging divides we see extreme positions.' In a statement, the COP29 Presidency stressed that the drafts 'are not final.' 'The COP29 Presidency’s door is always open, and we welcome any bridging proposals that the parties wish to present,' the Presidency said in a statement. It added that possible numbers for a finance goal will be released in the next iteration of the draft. There's some progress, but a lot of work left to do There are three big parts of the issue where negotiators need to find agreement: How big the numbers are, how much is grants or loans, and who contributes. Official observers of the talks from the International Institute of Sustainable Development who are allowed to sit in on the closed meetings reported that negotiators have now agreed on not expanding the list of countries that will contribute to global climate funds — at least at these talks. Linda Kalcher, of the think tank Strategic Partnerships, said on the question of grants or loans, the draft text suggests 'the need for grants and better access to finance.' She added that the lack of numbers in the draft text could be a 'bluff.' The COP29 presidency, which prepares the texts 'should know more ... than what they put on the table,' she said. Other areas that are being negotiated include commitments to slash planet-warming fossil fuels and how to adapt to climate change. But they’ve also seen little movement despite new draft deals on those issues also being published overnight, observers say. Harry Camilleri, a researcher at E3G, said the draft text on slashing fossil fuels 'is light on substance.' To move forward, countries will need to pledge ambitious updates to their national climate goals, he said. But David Tong, a campaign manager at climate advocacy group Oil Change International said 'ambition has gone missing' from that draft deal. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Why people are protesting over a deadly roof collapse in Serbia	BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — The deadly collapse of a concrete roof at a rail station in Serbia has raised tensions across the Balkan county, fueling widespread anger toward the government and protests after the failure claimed 15 lives in the northern city of Novi Sad. The station, a major hub, was recently renovated as part of a Serbian-Chinese partnership. Critics allege that corruption, poor oversight and inadequate construction work contributed to the Nov. 1 tragedy. Officials have offered conflicting information about whether the roof was part of the renovation, and its maintenance is under scrutiny. The collapse became a flashpoint for broader dissatisfaction with Serbia's authoritarian rule, reflecting growing public demands for transparency while the country undertakes large infrastructure projects, mostly with Chinese state companies. What do we know about the collapse? Very little. The rail station was built in 1964 and renovated twice in recent years as part of a wider deal between China, Serbia and Hungary to establish a fast rail connection between Belgrade and Budapest. Initially, authorities said the outer roof was not renovated during the work on the station, but they gave no explanation for why. Later, experts denied that, and images emerged that suggested at least some roof work was done after all. One of the protesters' demands has been to make public all documentation in connection with the reconstruction project. Has there been an investigation? Authorities opened a probe immediately after the collapse, promising it would be thorough and would not spare anyone regardless of position. On Thursday, 11 people were detained. The suspects, who have not been identified, face charges 'of committing criminal acts against public security, causing public danger and irregular conducting of construction work,' the Higher Prosecutor’s Office in Novi Sad said in a statement. Serbian media reported that Goran Vesic, who resigned as construction minister after the collapse, was among those detained. Prosecutors said earlier that several dozen people have been questioned. The only information about the investigation so far has come from Serbian media, which published unconfirmed reports about the companies involved in the reconstruction. Why are people protesting? In the first days after the tragedy, Serbians protested mostly in silence, holding vigils for the victims. But as time passed, grief gave way to anger, leading to a wave of demonstrations at various locations and by different groups. Most recently, protesters blocked a courthouse in Novi Sad, demanding that judicial authorities 'do their jobs.' Riot police pushed them away from the entrance, which led to scuffles and a two-day standoff this week. Chants such as 'corruption kills' also marked the protests that demanded the dissolution of the entire government over the tragedy. Protesters left symbolic handprints in red paint on government buildings, accusing authorities of having 'blood on their hands.' How did authorities react to the protests? Analysts say the government has sought to cushion the damage to its image by prolonging the investigation and apparently hoping that public anger will ease as time goes by. Serbia’s authoritarian president, Aleksandar Vucic, has repeatedly urged calm and called on people to trust institutions. He has said the investigation is complicated and takes time. But Vucic also said that 'responsibility cannot be avoided.' At the same time, police detained several activists who took part in recent protests and warned that they would not tolerate any disruptions of public order, which is widely seen as an attempt to discourage people from protesting. Why are Serbia and China teaming up on construction projects? By building roads, railways and other infrastructure, Serbia seeks to enhance its transportation links with neighboring states, while China seeks to strengthen its economic footprint in Europe. Serbia and China negotiate agreements mostly on a governmental level without the participation of outside bidders. Chinese state banks frequently provide loans to fund those projects. The loans may come with strings attached, such as the mandatory involvement of Chinese companies and their workers. Although such partnerships have brought billions of dollars in investments into the developing Balkan economy, questions surrounding quality, safety and financial sustainability often remain, as highlighted by the roof collapse. The Chinese companies that took part in the reconstruction said the concrete canopy that collapsed was not part of their work. ___ Associated Press writer Jovana Gec contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/serbia-roof-collapse-china-protests-3cfa282938b1ddec12c4795b9ecb3e95	2024-11-20T20:09:44-08:00	
At UN climate talks, 'sewage' beer from Singapore highlights water scarcity and innovations	BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) — In the sprawling pavilion section of the United Nations climate talks, where countries, nonprofits and tech companies use big, flashy signs to get the attention of the thousands of people walking through, small aqua and purple beverage cans sit conspicuously on a counter at the Singapore display. Those who approach learn that the cans are beer — a brand call NEWBrew — and free for anybody who asks. But there is something not everybody who cracks one open finds out right away, if at all: the beer is made with treated wastewater. 'I didn’t know. I was really surprised,' said Ignace Urchil Lokouako Mbouamboua, an international relations student from Congo, who recently sipped one while taking a break from the conference. 'I can even suggest that they make more and more of this kind of beer,' added Mbouamboua with a smile, sharing it was his third day in a row he stopped for a can. NEWBrew is made in Singapore with NEWater, the name of treated wastewater that's part of a national campaign to conserve every drop in one of the world’s most water-starved places. The drink, which some attendees jokingly call 'sewage beer,' is one of many examples of climate- and environment-related innovations on display during this year's climate talks, COP29, taking place in Azerbaijan. Highlighting the use of treated wastewater underscores one of the world's most pressing problems as climate change accelerates: providing drinking water to a growing population. For years, Singapore has been a leader in water management and innovations. The city-state island of 6 million people in Southeast Asia, one of the most densely populated countries, has no natural water sources. In addition to water imports from Malaysia, the other pillars of its national strategy are catchment, desalination and recycling. Authorities have said they need to ramp up all water sources, as demand is expected to double by 2065. While drinking treated wastewater is a novelty for many at the climate conference, for Singaporeans it's nothing new. National campaigns — from water conservation pleas to showing the wastewater recycling process — go back decades. In 2002, then-Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong was famously photographed drinking a bottle of NEWater after a tennis match, done to normalize its use. Ong Tze-Ch’in, chief executive of the Public Utilities Board, Singapore's national water agency, said NEWBrew was developed by a local brewery in 2018. The idea was to showcase treated wastewater at the country's biennial International Water Week. The beer was next produced in 2022, 2023, then again this year. 'It's part of the acceptance of the use of recycled water, which in general is a difficult topic,' said Ong. 'We did many things to drive it.' And is he happy with how it turned out? 'I chose this flavor,' said Ong, adding that he was part of the group that worked with the brewery for this year's version, a 'modern pilsner.' 'You know, beer is always very subjective,' he added with a laugh. After attending a panel on water management at the Singapore pavilion, Peter Rummel, director of infrastructure policy advancement at Bentley Systems, which creates infrastructure engineering software, stepped up to the counter and got a beer. Rummel told onlookers he was in a good position to judge beer, as he hailed from Munich, Germany, home to the Oktoberfest beer festival. 'It’s fresh, light, cool. It has a nice flavor,' said Rummel, while looking at the can. Wee-Tuck Tan, managing director of the local brewery, The Brewerkz Group, said they have made about 5,000 liters, or roughly 15,000 cans, for each edition of NewBrew. He said they use the same process as with other beers, and the cost is also similar, about 7 Singaporean dollars (around $5 U.S.) per can when bought in a supermarket. Wee-Tuck said he believes the beer has shifted how some in Singapore view NEWater. 'They think it tastes funny,' he said. 'When put into a beer, it changes the mindset. Most people can't tell the difference.' As problems with water scarcity grow, there is increasing embrace of the use of treated wastewater, said Saroj Kumar Jha, the World Bank Group's global water department director, who participated in the water management panel in the Singapore pavilion. Traveling to over 50 countries in the last two years, he said leaders have frequently told him it's important not to use the term 'wastewater,' and instead call it 'used water.' After the panel concluded, Jha and the other panelists opened NEWBrews and toasted. 'It's really good,' said Jha. 'It's the fourth time I've had it.' 'This year,' he added with a laugh. 'Not today.' ___ This story corrects the date of the photograph of then Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong drinking NEWater to 2002. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Sierra Leone loves rice and wants to free itself from imports. But how to do it?	FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) — Rice borders on the sacred in Sierra Leone. Unless a meal includes rice, people say, you haven’t eaten at all. But as prices soar, consumers in the West African nation are giving up other food to buy it. That's a major reason why 83% of the population is food insecure, according to the U.N.’s World Food Program. In the capital, Freetown, 28-year-old nail technician Anima Mangola dug into rice with stewed cassava leaves. 'I’d eat rice five times a day if I had me the money,' she said — even as its price has more than doubled this year. Not everyone can keep up, and 'people are suffering,' she said. Experts blame soaring prices on a heavy reliance on imports, which supply 35% of Sierra Leone's rice and eat up $200 million annually in foreign currency. Even though West Africa has a long tradition of growing rice and often excellent places to do it, experts said the import dependency is due to a lack of investment in agriculture, booming population growth and cheap rice imports from Asia. Sierra Leone's agriculture minister, Henry Kpaka Musa, accused the International Monetary Fund of pressuring Sierra Leone in the 1980s to stop investing in agriculture and open its markets to imports as a condition for receiving loans. 'We used to export rice,' Kpaka said in an interview. Now he and President Julius Bio plan to do it again. The government has raised over $620 million from global development banks this year to work towards food self-sufficiency, notably in rice, although Kpaka estimated the plan will cost $1.8 billion in all. Experts from the Ivory Coast-based research center Africa Rice have commended the plan as 'ambitious and forward-looking.' But NGOs and academics warn it will favor international agribusiness and large-scale farms, to the detriment of the nation’s 5 million smallholder farms. They point to similar, failed attempts at food self-sufficiency in places such as Burkina Faso and Ghana. Self-sufficiency challenges and potential West Africa has an ancient rice tradition dating back an estimated back 3,500 years. Historian Judith Carney said its farmers were taken as slaves to work plantations in the U.S. South, giving birth to a booming rice economy. Sierra Leone has the region's best climate and land for growing rice, with abundant annual rainfall in coastal regions. But Kpaka, the minister, highlighted obstacles to rice self-sufficiency: poor roads to connect rice-growing areas with markets, unreliable electricity for processing, climate change and poor access to finance. With the financial backing from development banks, he has approved plans to improve roads to the country's three main 'rice bowls,' create large areas of irrigated land and provide fertilizers, seeds and pesticides to smallholder farms. 'The plan starts with the infrastructure to attract the private sector to come,' he said. He has promoted the plan to unspecified international investors, offering them thousands of hectares of irrigated land. But some believe smallholders, who make up 70% of the country’s population of 8 million, will be an afterthought. The view from the field Aboubacar Kowa, a farming leader in Bo district, gathered others to discuss their rice challenges, which also included access to land and a lack of storage, training and processing capacity. They were united in their lack of optimism about government help. They’ve heard these ambitious plans before. 'We don’t get support from the government,' said one smallholder and village chief, Eric Amara Manyeh. The most common concern was the lack of labor to create irrigated fields. Eliminating vegetation and digging channels is laborious, and an exodus of young people to urban areas means farmers have to employ laborers — a cost out of reach for many. Although unemployment is high in towns, Manyeh said young people prefer easier jobs such as driving motorbike taxis. Some farmers have formed collectives to share labor, but poor tools slow progress. In one government-backed project in Bo, digging 60 hectares (148 acres) of channels took three months by 82 people. A cautionary tale Sierra Leone's goal to get chemical fertilizer, seeds and pesticides into the hands of smallholders is meant to replicate the Green Revolution in Asia, which increased rice production by over 100% in two decades. But Klara Fischer, a rural development professor at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences specializing in sub-Saharan Africa, warned that the approach exposes farmers to agribusiness giants such as Bayer Crop Science and Syngenta. An initiative called A Green Revolution for Africa. backed by the Gates Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation and others, has spent over $1 billion since 2006 to increase access to fertilizers and seeds for smallholders, but its own evaluation in 2022 said it hasn’t increased food security. The initiative is supporting Sierra Leone's efforts. One recent assessment by the German development ministry in Ghana and Burkina Faso found no evidence that providing fertilizer and seeds increased yield or profit for smallholders, and found that 41% of rice farmers struggled to pay off their debts. 'These fertilizer and seed packages are entangled with private interests,' Fischer said. She also highlighted differences between Asia in the 1970s and the current situation in Africa. One is the cheap and available family labor in Asia compared to the rural exodus in Sierra Leone. Kpaka, a former employee in the Gates Foundation's agricultural department, acknowledged concerns but was convinced his plan has the missing ingredient to unlock growth: the critical infrastructure to help farmers process and sell their rice, incentivizing them to grow more. 'If we don’t make the road, (farmers) will forever remain subsistence,' he said. A different way Others believe that Sierra Leone should spend its funding on measures that empower smallholder farms rather than big business. Joseph Randall, director of an environmental NGO in Sierra Leone, Green Scenery, said the government should support sustainable practices such as organic compost instead of becoming dependent on imported chemical fertilizer, usually from Europe or North America, which contributes heavily to global warming. Randall opposes the distribution of modern seeds, even though they are higher yielding. The hybrid varieties of rice can't be saved and replanted each year because they are bred by agribusinesses and have patents. Meanwhile, in Manyeh’s village, thunder echoed through the chief’s rice fields. He pointed to a swamp that might be cultivated as part of the self-sufficiency goal. 'The willingness is there, the potential is there,' he said. But he knows it takes more than potential to feed a nation. ___ The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

New Zealand police begin arrests for gang symbol ban as new law takes effect	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — A ban on New Zealanders wearing or displaying symbols of gang affiliation in public took effect on Thursday, with police officers making their first arrest for a breach of the law three minutes later. The man was driving with gang insignia displayed on the dashboard of his car and was among more than a dozen people arrested or summoned to appear in court for exhibiting such symbols since the law took force, New Zealand’s police said Friday. The prohibition on displaying gang insignia anywhere outside private homes, including on clothing or in vehicles, is among a suite of new measures intended to bolster police powers to disrupt the groups. Wearing or displaying the insignia of 35 listed gangs will now prompt a fine of up to 5,000 New Zealand dollars ($2,940) or up to six months in jail. New Zealand’s center-right government, which pledged ahead of last October’s election to tackle gang crime, says the measures will reduce the membership of groups responsible for violence and drug offenses. But detractors say the law breaches civil liberties and could drive gang activities underground. 'Gangs aren’t community groups. They’re not a Rotary club,' Prime Minister Christopher Luxon wrote on social media Thursday. 'They thrive on destroying the lives of other New Zealanders, whether that’s by peddling drugs or through brutal acts of violence that leave communities in fear.' Under the new law, officers can also disperse public gatherings of three or more members, bar some gang affiliates from associating with each other, and enter homes of those who keep breaking the law to search for banned items. Gang membership will now be considered by the courts when sentencing offenders. Police Minister Mark Mitchell told reporters Thursday that two people were arrested hours after the law took effect for wearing gang 'patches,' which are large insignia often worn by gang members on the backs of leather jackets or vests. The government says the patches are intimidating because members are required to earn them through violent acts. The measures shift New Zealand's response to gangs closer to that of neighboring Australia, which also uses a law to suppress the public visibility of gangs, and away from jurisdictions like the U.S. and Britain, which use criminal law to respond to specific activities carried out by organized crime groups, according to a report published by Treasury officials in February. Facial tattoos that display gang insignia are exempt from the ban, as is the wearing of gang colors. The government was criticized by some for not including white supremacist groups in its list of 35 organizations targeted by the new law. That means displaying swastikas and making Nazi salutes remains legal in New Zealand -– unlike in Australia, which banned both in a law that took effect in January. There are nearly 9,400 people on a New Zealand police list of known gang members. New Zealand’s population is 5 million. Successive governments have vowed to tackle criminal gangs, which often are linked to poverty and other deprivation. The previous center-left government was decried by Luxon’s administration for working with gangs on social initiatives, including COVID-19 vaccination efforts, while the current government has been denounced for advancing policies that are likely to ensnare some of New Zealand’s most marginalized groups, including Indigenous Māori. Official reports say three-quarters of those on the national gang list are Māori, who make up less than 20% of New Zealanders, and that 80% to 90% of those in two of the most notorious gangs are former wards of the state. Luxon made a formal apology this month for the widespread abuse of children and vulnerable adults in state care over the past seven decades.	https://apnews.com/article/gang-insignia-ban-zealand-criminal-03cdf4f97656171658da0798aa4adfe2	2024-11-20T19:40:05-08:00	
American and Australian tourists die, raising toll to 4 in Laos alcohol poisoning incident	VIENTIANE, Laos (AP) — An Australian teenager has died after drinking tainted alcohol in Vang Vieng, Laos, in what Australia's prime minister on Thursday called every parent's nightmare, and the U.S. State Department confirmed an American also died in the same party town, bringing the death toll to four. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told Parliament that 19-year-old Bianca Jones had died after being evacuated from Laos for treatment in a Thai hospital. Her friend, also 19, remains hospitalized in Thailand. 'This is every parent’s very worst fear and a nightmare that no one should have to endure,' Albanese said. 'We also take this moment to say that we’re thinking of Bianca’s friend Holly Bowles who is fighting for her life.' Shaun Bowles told reporters outside Bangkok Hospital the day before that his daughter was in critical condition and on life support. 'We just like to thank everyone from back home for all of the support and love that we’re receiving,' he said. 'But we’d also like the people to appreciate right now, we just need privacy so we can spend as much time as we can with Holly.' In a statement to the Melbourne Herald Sun newspaper, Jones' family asked for privacy in their grief. 'She was surrounded by love, and we are comforted by the knowledge that her incredible spirit touched so many lives during her time with us,' the family wrote. 'We want to express our deepest gratitude for the overwhelming support, love, and prayers we’ve received from across Australia.' The State Department confirmed to The Associated Press in an emailed statement that an American tourist had also died but said it had no further comment out of respect to the family. It said local authorities were investigating and that the U.S. was providing consular assistance. 'We offer our sincerest condolences to the family on their loss,' the State Department said. Telephone numbers listed for Laos' Health Ministry did not work and police refused to comment. Landlocked Laos is one of Southeast Asia's poorest nations and a popular tourist destination. Vang Vieng is particularly popular among backpackers seeking partying and adventure sports. Details on the alcohol poisoning began trickling out about a week after the two Australian women fell ill on Nov. 13 following a night out drinking with a group in the remote town. They are believed to have consumed drinks tainted with methanol, which is sometimes used as the alcohol in mixed drinks at disreputable bars and can cause severe poisoning or death. Thai authorities confirmed that Jones had died by 'brain swelling due to high levels of methanol found in her system.' 'Drink spiking and methanol poisoning are far too common in many parts of the world,' Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said after receiving news of Jones' death. 'At this time I would say to parents, to young people, please have a conversation about risks, please inform yourselves, please let’s work together to ensure this tragedy doesn’t happen again.' New Zealand's Foreign Ministry said Thursday that one of its citizens was also unwell in Laos and could be a victim of methanol poisoning. Denmark's Foreign Ministry, when asked about the poisoning incident, said Wednesday that two of its citizens had died in Laos but would not provide further details. 'We have updated our travel advisory for Laos to note that there have been several cases of suspected methanol poisoning after consuming alcoholic drinks,' New Zealand's Foreign Ministry said. 'Travelers are advised to be cautious about consuming alcoholic beverages, particularly cocktails and drinks made with spirits that may have been adulterated with harmful substances.' Australia also updated its travel advice, cautioning that several foreign nationals had been victims of suspected methanol poisoning in Laos this month. The U.S. did not immediately issue an updated travel advisory. On Tuesday, Duong Duc Toan, manager of the Nana Backpacker Hostel where the two Australian women stayed in Vang Vieng, told the AP that staff were told by other guests that the two women were unwell after they failed to check out as planned on Nov. 13, and they arranged transport to a hospital for them. The women were then transported to Thailand for emergency medical treatment and their parents flew in to be with them. 'All Australians offer them our deepest sympathy in this time of heartbreak,' Albanese said. 'Bianca’s trip should have been a joyous time and a source of fond memories in years to come,' he said. 'It is beyond sad that this was not to be.' ___ Rising reported from Bangkok.

Stock market today: Wall Street climbs as Nvidia swings, bitcoin rises and Alphabet sinks	NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are rising Thursday after more companies said they’re making fatter profits than expected. Market superstar Nvidia also topped forecasts, but Wall Street’s ambivalence about whether the heavyweight's report was impressive enough is keeping indexes in check. The S&amp;P 500 was 0.6% higher, as of 1:02 p.m. Eastern time, following many flips between modest gains and losses through the morning. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 543 points, or 1.3%, and the Nasdaq composite rose 0.1%. The moves were part of a busy day for financial markets, as bitcoin briefly broke above $98,000 and crude oil prices continued to rise. Nvidia was a big reason for the stock market's meandering after yet again beating analysts’ estimates for profit and revenue. It also gave a forecast for revenue in the current quarter that topped most analysts’ expectations thanks to voracious demand for its chips used in artificial-intelligence technology. Its stock initially sank in afterhours trading late on Wednesday following the release of the results. Some investors said that might have been because the market was looking for Nvidia's revenue forecast to surpass expectations by even more. But its stock then recovered in premarket trading Thursday, and Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said it was another 'flawless' profit report provided by Nvidia and CEO Jensen Huang, whom Ives calls 'the Godfather of AI.' How Nvidia’s stock performs has tremendous impact because it’s quickly grown into Wall Street’s most valuable company at nearly $3.6 trillion. That means a 1% move for it packs more weight on the S&amp;P 500 than the same move for any other stock. Nvidia's stock on Thursday quickly went from an early jump of 4.8% to a loss of 3.6% before settling at a drop of 1.3%. It was one of the heaviest weights on the S&amp;P 500. The frenzy around AI is sweeping up other stocks, and Snowflake jumped 34.2% after reporting stronger results for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The company, whose platform helps customers get a better view of all their silos of data and use AI, also reported stronger revenue growth than expected. BJ’S Wholesale Club rose 9.6% after likewise delivering a bigger profit than expected. That may help calm worries about how resilient U.S. shoppers can remain, given high prices across the economy and still-high interest rates. A day earlier, Target tumbled after reporting sluggish sales in the latest quarter and giving a dour forecast for the holiday shopping season. It followed Walmart, which gave a much more encouraging outlook. Roughly 90% of the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 were also rising, and the gains were even bigger among smaller companies. The Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks climbed a market-leading 1.8%. But Google’s parent company, Alphabet, was helping to drag on indexes. It fell 5.7% after U.S. regulators asked a judge to break up the tech giant by forcing it to sell its industry-leading Chrome web browser. In a 23-page document filed late Wednesday, the U.S. Department of Justice called for sweeping punishments that would include restrictions preventing Android from favoring its own search engine. Regulators stopped short of demanding Google sell Android but left the door open to it if the company’s oversight committee continues to see evidence of misconduct. Drops for other Big Tech stocks also weighed on the market, including slides of 1.7% for Amazon and 0.7% for Meta Platforms. In stock markets abroad, shares of India’s Adani Enterprises plunged 22.6% Thursday after the U.S. charged founder Gautam Adani, 62, in a federal indictment with securities fraud and conspiracy to commit securities and wire fraud. The businessman and one of the world’s richest people is accused of duping investors by concealing that his company’s huge solar energy project on the subcontinent was being facilitated by an alleged bribery scheme. Indexes elsewhere in Asia and Europe were mixed. In the crypto market, bitcoin is trading around $97,800 after eclipsing $98,000 for the first time. It’s more than doubled so far this year, and its climb has accelerated since Election Day. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to make the country 'the crypto capital of the planet' and create a 'strategic reserve' of bitcoin. Bitcoin and related investments, of course, have a notorious history of big price swings in both directions. MicroStrategy, a company that's been raising cash expressly to buy bitcoin, saw an early gain of 14.6% for its stock on Thursday quickly disappear. It was most recently down 1.6%. In the oil market, a barrel of benchmark U.S. crude rose 1.2% to bring its gain for the week to 3.8%. Brent crude, the international standard, climbed 1.2%. Oil has been rising amid escalations in the Russia-Ukraine war. In the bond market, Treasury yields held relatively steady following some mixed reports on the U.S. economy. The yield on the 10-year Treasury remained at 4.41% from late Wednesday. One report said fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week in the latest signal that the job market remains solid. Another report, though, said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic region unexpectedly shrank. Sales of previously occupied homes, meanwhile, strengthened last month by more than expected. ___ AP Business Writers Matt Ott and Yuri Kageyama contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/stock-markets-nvidia-rates-earnings-e42f068e3259f9d6c5d1c6e79e3a2b3a	2024-11-20T19:32:45-08:00	
Russia and China oppose changing the Kenya-led force in Haiti to a UN peacekeeping mission	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Russia and China on Wednesday opposed a U.S.-led campaign to transform the Kenya-led multinational force in Haiti helping police to tackle escalating gang violence into a U.N. peacekeeping mission. The two allies called a U.N. Security Council meeting as gangs have intensified attacks, shooting at four aircraft which has shut the airport in the capital Port-au-Prince, and a ttacking its upscale neighborhood Petionville on Tuesday. The U.N. estimates the gangs control 85% of the capital and have spread into surrounding areas. The United States proposed a U.N. peacekeeping mission in early September as one way to secure regular financing for the U.N.-backed multinational force, which faces a serious funding crisis. The U.S. tried to get the 15-member U.N. Security Council to sign off on a draft resolution last week to start the transformation. But Russia and China refused to discuss the resolution and instead called for Wednesday’s council meeting where they made their opposition clear. China’s Deputy U.N. Ambassador Geng Shuang said the council extended the mandate of the multinational force only a month ago, and discussing its transformation to a peacekeeping operation now 'will only interfere' and make it harder to tackle its funding shortfall and get all the police pledged to Haiti. Peacekeepers should only be deployed when there is peace to keep, and there is no peace in Haiti, Geng stressed. 'Deploying a peacekeeping operation at this time is nothing more than putting peacekeepers into the front line of the battles with gangs.' The multinational force was supposed to have 2,500 international police but the head of the U.N.’s political mission in Haiti, Maria Isabel Salvador, told the council late last month that only around 430 are deployed — some 400 from Kenya and the rest from the Bahamas, Belize and Jamaica. She said the U.N. trust fund that finances the multinational force and relies on voluntary contributions, 'remains critically under-resourced.' By last week, the trust fund had received $85.3 million of the $96.8 million pledged. The U.S. agreed to contribute $300 million to the force, but that total is still far below the $600 million cost to deploy a 2,500-strong force for a year. Russia’s Deputy U.N. Ambassador Dmitry Polyansky, expressing 'shock and horror' at what’s happening on the streets of Port-au-Prince, accused the U.S. and other countries that initially supported the multinational force of failing to fund it. 'Conditions on the ground in Haiti are not appropriate for U.N. peacekeepers,' he said. 'Their role is to maintain peace and not to fight crime in urban areas or to save a dysfunctional state that has been plunged into domestic conflict.' Whatever the future international presence in Haiti, Polyansky said Haitians need urgent assistance immediately which means providing the multinational force with the necessary materiel, funding and technical expertise. 'Otherwise, quite simply, there will be just nobody left to host any future peacekeepers,' he said. Haiti’s leaders have asked for a U.N. peacekeeping force, and the permanent council of the Organization of American States adopted a resolution on Nov. 13 entitled 'In Support of Haiti’s Request for a United States Peacekeeping Operation.' At the council meeting, there was also strong support for the transformation. Monica Juma, national security adviser to Kenya’s president, told the council that joint operations by the multinational force and the Haitian police have secured critical infrastructure including the police academy, national palace, national hospital and port. But it's evident the multinational force urgently needs 'a surge,' she said, and Kenya looks forward to additional deployments in the shortest possible time along with contributions of equipment and logistical support. At the same time, Juma said, Kenya 'strongly supports' the Haitian government’s appeal to the Security Council to authorize planning for the transformation of the multinational force to a U.N. peacekeeping force. U.S. deputy ambassador Dorothy Shea told the council that with Haitian, regional and Kenyan support, 'it is time for the Security Council to act to take the initial steps to realize Haiti’s request to help reestablish security for the people of Haiti.' Transitioning to a U.N. peacekeeping mission, she said, would facilitate the multinational force and the countries supporting it 'to take advantage of existing U.N. financial, personnel, and logistical support structures as well as predictable and sustainable financing.' The most poignant appeal for a peacekeeping force came from Haitian Dr. Bill Pape, who left Port-au-Prince about two weeks ago where he works to combat infectious and chronic diseases. He is also a professor at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York. Pape said he came with a message to the Security Council: The Haitian police and multinational force 'are outgunned and outnumbered.' He said he recognized the controversies of previous peacekeeping missions in Haiti. The most recent, from 2004-2017, was marred by allegations of sexual assault and the introduction of cholera, which killed nearly 10,000 people. But Pape stressed that during previous foreign interventions, which date to the early 1900s, 'insecurity did not exist at this scale.' 'I trust that seeking your support to restore security in my country is not asking too much,' he told council members. 'It is a difficult task for any Haitian to request foreign troops on our soil. But there is no alternative.'	https://apnews.com/article/un-haiti-gangs-kenya-force-peacekeeping-violence-d9ebed4a6a809d080511009b39b1b1ac	2024-11-20T19:32:00-08:00	
US regulators seek to break up Google, forcing Chrome sale as part of monopoly punishment	U.S. regulators want a federal judge to break up Google to prevent the company from continuing to squash competition through its dominant search engine after a court found it had maintained an abusive monopoly over the past decade. The proposed breakup floated in a 23-page document filed late Wednesday by the U.S. Department of Justice calls for sweeping punishments that would include a sale of Google's industry-leading Chrome web browser and impose restrictions to prevent Android from favoring its own search engine. A sale of Chrome 'will permanently stop Google’s control of this critical search access point and allow rival search engines the ability to access the browser that for many users is a gateway to the internet,' Justice Department lawyers argued in their filing. Although regulators stopped short of demanding Google sell Android too, they asserted the judge should make it clear the company could still be required to divest its smartphone operating system if its oversight committee continues to see evidence of misconduct. The broad scope of the recommended penalties underscores how severely regulators operating under President Joe Biden's administration believe Google should be punished following an August ruling by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta that branded the company as a monopolist. The Justice Department decision-makers who will inherit the case after President-elect Donald Trump takes office next year might not be as strident. The Washington, D.C. court hearings on Google's punishment are scheduled to begin in April and Mehta is aiming to issue his final decision before Labor Day. If Mehta embraces the government's recommendations, Google would be forced to sell its 16-year-old Chrome browser within six months of the final ruling. But the company certainly would appeal any punishment, potentially prolonging a legal tussle that has dragged on for more than four years. Besides seeking a Chrome spinoff and a corralling of the Android software, the Justice Department wants the judge to ban Google from forging multibillion-dollar deals to lock in its dominant search engine as the default option on Apple’s iPhone and other devices. It would also ban Google from favoring its own services, such as YouTube or its recently-launched artificial intelligence platform, Gemini. Regulators also want Google to license the search index data it collects from people’s queries to its rivals, giving them a better chance at competing with the tech giant. On the commercial side of its search engine, Google would be required to provide more transparency into how it sets the prices that advertisers pay to be listed near the top of some targeted search results. Kent Walker, Google’s chief legal officer, lashed out at the Justice Department for pursuing 'a radical interventionist agenda that would harm Americans and America’s global technology.' In a blog post, Walker warned the 'overly broad proposal' would threaten personal privacy while undermining Google’s early leadership in artificial intelligence, 'perhaps the most important innovation of our time.' Wary of Google’s increasing use of artificial intelligence in its search results, regulators also advised Mehta to ensure websites will be able to shield their content from Google’s AI training techniques. The measures, if they are ordered, threaten to upend a business expected to generate more than $300 billion in revenue this year. 'The playing field is not level because of Google’s conduct, and Google’s quality reflects the ill-gotten gains of an advantage illegally acquired,' the Justice Department asserted in its recommendations. 'The remedy must close this gap and deprive Google of these advantages.' It’s still possible that the Justice Department could ease off attempts to break up Google, especially if Trump takes the widely expected step of replacing Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter, who was appointed by Biden to oversee the agency's antitrust division. Although the case targeting Google was originally filed during the final months of Trump’s first term in office, Kanter oversaw the high-profile trial that culminated in Mehta's ruling against Google. Working in tandem with Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, Kanter took a get-tough stance against Big Tech that triggered other attempted crackdowns on industry powerhouses such as Apple and discouraged many business deals from getting done during the past four years. Trump recently expressed concerns that a breakup might destroy Google but didn’t elaborate on alternative penalties he might have in mind. 'What you can do without breaking it up is make sure it’s more fair,' Trump said last month. Matt Gaetz, the former Republican congressman that Trump nominated to be the next U.S. Attorney General, has previously called for the breakup of Big Tech companies. Gaetz faces a tough confirmation hearing. This latest filing gave Kanter and his team a final chance to spell out measures that they believe are needed to restore competition in search. It comes six weeks after Justice first floated the idea of a breakup in a preliminary outline of potential penalties. But Kanter's proposal is already raising questions about whether regulators seek to impose controls that extend beyond the issues covered in last year’s trial, and — by extension — Mehta’s ruling. Banning the default search deals that Google now pays more than $26 billion annually to maintain was one of the main practices that troubled Mehta in his ruling. It's less clear whether the judge will embrace the Justice Department’s contention that Chrome needs to be spun out of Google and or Android should be completely walled off from its search engine. 'It is probably going a little beyond,' Syracuse University law professor Shubha Ghosh said of the Chrome breakup. 'The remedies should match the harm, it should match the transgression. This does seem a little beyond that pale.' Google rival DuckDuckGo, whose executives testified during last year's trial, asserted the Justice Department is simply doing what needs to be done to rein in a brazen monopolist. 'Undoing Google’s overlapping and widespread illegal conduct over more than a decade requires more than contract restrictions: it requires a range of remedies to create enduring competition,' Kamyl Bazbaz, DuckDuckGo's senior vice president of public affairs, said in a statement. Trying to break up Google harks back to a similar punishment initially imposed on Microsoft a quarter century ago following another major antitrust trial that culminated in a federal judge deciding the software maker had illegally used his Windows operating system for PCs to stifle competition. However, an appeals court overturned an order that would have broken up Microsoft, a precedent many experts believe will make Mehta reluctant to go down a similar road with the Google case.	https://apnews.com/article/google-search-monopoly-penalty-justice-department-84e07fec51c5c59751d846118cb900a7	2024-11-20T19:01:31-08:00	
Australia's parliament considers legislation banning social media for under 16s	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Australia’s communications minister introduced a world-first law into Parliament on Thursday that would ban children under 16 from social media, saying online safety was one of parents’ toughest challenges. Michelle Rowland said TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram were among the platforms that would face fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for systemic failures to prevent young children from holding accounts. 'This bill seeks to set a new normative value in society that accessing social media is not the defining feature of growing up in Australia,' Rowland told Parliament. 'There is wide acknowledgement that something must be done in the immediate term to help prevent young teens and children from being exposed to streams of content unfiltered and infinite,' she added. X owner Elon Musk warned that Australia intended to go further, posting on his platform: 'Seems like a backdoor way to control access to the Internet by all Australians.' The bill has wide political support. After it becomes law, the platforms would have one year to work out how to implement the age restriction. 'For too many young Australians, social media can be harmful,' Rowland said. 'Almost two-thirds of 14- to 17-years-old Australians have viewed extremely harmful content online including drug abuse, suicide or self-harm as well as violent material. One quarter have been exposed to content promoting unsafe eating habits.' Government research found that 95% of Australian care-givers find online safety to be one of their 'toughest parenting challenges,' she said. Social media had a social responsibility and could do better in addressing harms on their platforms, she added. 'This is about protecting young people, not punishing or isolating them, and letting parents know that we’re in their corner when it comes to supporting their children’s health and wellbeing,' Rowland said. Child welfare and internet experts have raised concerns about the ban, including isolating 14- and 15-year-olds from their already established online social networks. Rowland said there would not be age restrictions placed on messaging services, online games or platforms that substantially support the health and education of users. 'We are not saying risks don’t exist on messaging apps or online gaming. While users can still be exposed to harmful content by other users, they do not face the same algorithmic curation of content and psychological manipulation to encourage near-endless engagement,' she said. The government announced last week that a consortium led by British company Age Check Certification Scheme has been contracted to examine various technologies to estimate and verify ages. In addition to removing children under 16 from social media, Australia is also looking for ways to prevent children under 18 from accessing online pornography, a government statement said. Age Check Certification Scheme’s chief executive Tony Allen said Monday the technologies being considered included age estimation and age inference. Inference involves establishing a series of facts about individuals that point to them being at least a certain age. Rowland said the platforms would also face fines of up to AU$50 million ($33 million) if they misused personal information of users gained for age-assurance purposes. Information used for age assurances must be destroyed after serving that purpose unless the user consents to it being kept, she said. Digital Industry Group Inc., an advocate for the digital industry in Australia, said with Parliament expected to vote on the bill next week, there might not be time for 'meaningful consultation on the details of the globally unprecedented legislation.' 'Mainstream digital platforms have strict measures in place to keep young people safe, and a ban could push young people on to darker, less safe online spaces that don't have safety guardrails,' DIGI managing director Sunita Bose said in a statement. 'A blunt ban doesn't encourage companies to continually improve safety because the focus is on keeping teenagers off the service, rather than keeping them safe when they're on it.'	https://apnews.com/article/australia-social-media-children-ban-e02305486cb44aa07dcaf2964bec4e3d	2024-11-20T16:01:29-08:00	
Human smuggling trial witness says he was separated from a family hours before they froze to death	FERGUS FALLS, Minn. (AP) — An Indian national who survived a treacherous trek across the U.S.-Canada border in blizzard conditions testified Wednesday that he got separated from a family of four shortly before they froze to death. Yash Patel took the stand on the third day of the trial of Indian national Harshkumar Ramanlal Patel, 29, and Steve Shand, 50, of Florida. Prosecutors say they put financial profit over human life when they attempted to smuggle Indian migrants across the border into Minnesota over a five-week period in December 2021 and January 2022. They say Patel ran part of the smuggling scheme and recruited Shand as a driver. Both men have pleaded not guilty to four counts related to human smuggling. Federal prosecutors say a family of four — 39-year-old Jagdish Patel; his wife, Vaishaliben, who was in her mid-30s; their 11-year-old daughter, Vihangi; and 3-year-old son, Dharmik — froze to death Jan. 19, 2022. Patel is a common Indian surname and the victims were not related to Harshkumar Patel or Yash Patel. Yash Patel, 23, testified through an interpreter that he got separated from the Patel family and walked alone for five or six hours until he found a van waiting for him, The Canadian Press reported. Prosecutors say that van was driven by Steve Shand. Witnesses called by the prosecution said conditions were brutal when the victims trudged through vast, snow-filled fields and high winds the night they tried to cross from Canada into the U.S. Windchills dropped into the minus 30s Fahrenheit that January morning and the rural area near the border offers little shelter from the brutal weather. 'It was snowing and it was very windy,' Patel said on the witness stand. 'I was very scared. I wanted to have help from someone, but there was no one.' Shand’s attorneys have said their client and the migrants were duped by Harshkumar Patel and the smuggling network. Shand believed he was hired by Patel to do legal work as a taxi driver, they said, pointing out that human smuggling rings often outsource some of their work to unwitting participants. Patel’s attorneys have argued that Shand’s defense is antagonistic and prejudicial against his client. They have also said Patel came to America to escape poverty and build a better life for himself before being unjustly accused of crimes he didn’t commit. Yash Patel said his journey to enter the U.S. illegally began when he arrived in Toronto, Canada, in December 2021 and was sent to Vancouver, then back to Toronto, then to a house in Winnipeg, The Canadian Press reported. He and a group of other Indian nationals, including a couple and two children, were loaded into a van at the house and taken to the border. But the van got stuck, and the migrants were told to get out and walk in a straight line until they came across another vehicle, he added. At some point, he got separated from the group and braved the conditions alone. After hours of walking, he made it to a van that prosecutors said was driven by Shand. A U.S. Border Patrol agent later spotted the van, pulled it over, identified Shand as the driver and arrested him along with Yash Patel and another passenger. Federal prosecutors say Harshkumar Patel and Steve Shand tried to smuggle migrants across the border as part of a sprawling international smuggling ring. Rajinder Singh, a man who has already been convicted of human smuggling, was part of same smuggling ring as Patel and Shand, they have argued. Singh testified on Tuesday that he shuttled more than 500 Indian migrants across the U.S.-Canada border over four years and made over $400,000 in the scheme.	https://apnews.com/article/immigration-canada-india-smuggling-deaths-trial-minnesota-d6b7b063853dff746bd47f145f0ffeed	2024-11-20T14:54:06-08:00	
Nicaragua's Ortega proposes reform to make him and his wife 'copresidents'	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Nicaragua's President Daniel Ortega on Wednesday proposed a constitutional reform that would officially make him and his wife, current Vice President Rosario Murillo, 'copresidents' of the Central American nation. While the initiative has to pass through the country's legislature, Ortega and Murillo's Sandinista party control the congress and all government institutions, so it is likely to be approved. The proposal also looks to expand the presidential term to six years from five. Ortega put forward another bill Wednesday that would make it illegal for anyone to enforce sanctions from the United States or other foreign bodies 'within Nicaraguan territory.' The Organization of American States general secretary's office condemned the proposed constitutional reforms Wednesday. 'The ‘reform’ document is illegitimate in form and content, it merely constitutes an aberrant form of institutionalization of the matrimonial dictatorship in the Central American country and is a definitive attack on the democratic rule of law,' it said in a statement. The proposals come amid an ongoing crackdown by the Ortega government since mass social protests in 2018 that the government violently repressed. Nicaragua's government has imprisoned adversaries, religious leaders, journalists and more, then exiled them, stripping hundreds of their Nicaraguan citizenship and possessions. Since 2018, it has shuttered more than 5,000 organizations, largely religious, and forced thousands to flee the country. Dissident groups including the Nicaraguan University Alliance quickly railed against the measures, calling them an extension of that clampdown. 'They are institutionalizing nepotism and repression, destroying the rule of law. Democracy faces its greatest threat,' the organization wrote on the social media platform X on Wednesday. Manuel Orozco, director of the migration, remittances, and development program at the Inter-American Dialogue, called Ortega's proposed reforms 'nothing but a rubber stamping formalization of a decision to guarantee presidential succession' for Murillo and their family. Ortega has referred to Murillo previously in recent years as his copresident. While rejection of international sanctions would have no immediate impact, Orozco said it could put the country at 'high financial risk' and risk further penalties from the U.S. Treasury Department. Orozco said the constitutional reform to the presidency is part of a long-term plan for the administration to stay in power, and was pushed forward Wednesday as a way to avoid provoking the incoming administration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. The analyst said Trump may not prioritize crackdowns on democratic freedoms in places like Nicaragua, but also isn't likely to 'tolerate provocations.' 'The procedure, apart from circumventing the popular will, the rule of law, creates the pathway to give Ortega extra time to stay in power,' Orozco said. Ortega was reelected to a fourth consecutive five-year term in November 2021. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/nicaragua-daniel-ortega-wife-murillo-copresidents-ea9ad1e1c89c72b04ebd0ede46d0b3d5	2024-11-20T14:41:08-08:00	
Senate rejects effort from Bernie Sanders to block some weapons for Israel over Gaza deaths	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate on Wednesday rejected an attempt by Sen. Bernie Sanders Wednesday to block sales of offensive weapons to Israel for its war in Gaza over mounting civilian deaths there. The Vermont lawmaker and a small group of Democrats sought to put legislation up for a Senate vote that would block the sale of some tank and mortar rounds and smart-bomb kits to Israel. The first attempt to block the sales was rejected overwhelmingly, and two more were expected to go down to defeat. Sanders, in making the case for stopping the sales, said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government 'has not simply waged war against Hamas. It has waged an all-out war against the Palestinian people.' Known as joint resolutions of disapproval, the measures would have had to pass both houses of Congress and withstand any presidential veto to become binding. Congress has never succeeded in blocking any arms sales with the joint resolutions. But the vote served as a test of broader frustration among Democrats at the war and President Joe Biden's handling of relations with Israel. Lawmakers' move comes after a 30-day Biden administration deadline came and went earlier this month for Netanyahu to meet specific U.S. targets to improve its treatment of Palestinian civilians in Gaza trapped in the war. U.S. demands included that Israel lift a near-total ban on delivery of aid to hard-hit north Gaza for starving civilians there. Leading global aid organizations say Israel — which is heavily dependent on U.S. arms and military aid — fell far short of meeting the U.S. demand to allow in an adequate number of aid trucks, and in some other ways worsened conditions for civilians. That includes Israeli lawmakers newly banning the main U.N. agency that provides aid to Palestinians. U.N. officials said as the end of the U.S. deadline neared that the entire population of north Gaza is now at imminent risk of dying from famine, airstrikes or other threats. 'We would expect that there be some consequences when things get even worse,' Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland said in the run-up to the vote on the measures. Fellow Democratic Sens. Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Peter Welch of Vermont also joined Sanders in the appeal. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor that he will 'strongly oppose' the measures. 'Israel needs to protect itself not just today, but also tomorrow and next year and beyond,' Schumer said. 'It has been a cornerstone of American policy to give Israel the resources it needs to defend against its enemies. We should not stray from that policy today.' Sen. Ben Cardin, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, read what he said was a message from the White House urging lawmakers to defeat the measures. The move to block arms to the U.S. ally came at a delicate time in Middle East cease-fire negotiations and would 'put wind in the sails of Iran, Hezbollah and Hamas at the worst possible moment,' Cardin quoted the White House as warning. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham also argued for defeat of the bills. 'This signal will be seen by the enemies of Israel, and the enemies of peace, that if they just stick with it they will win,' he said. Centrist and progressive Democratic lawmakers and Sanders have made repeated runs during the more than 1-year-old war at convincing the White House and Congress to condition U.S. arms shipments to Israel on improved treatment of Palestinian civilians in the offensive. The Biden administration has increased its warnings and appeals to Netanyahu to do more to spare civilians in airstrikes and other attacks, and to allow more aid to reach Gaza. The Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attacks that started the war killed about 1,200. The death toll of Gazans killed since then was nearing 44,000 on Wednesday. Health officials in Gaza do not distinguish between civilians and combatants in tracking deaths. Other than pausing one planned shipment of 2,000-pound bombs, Biden — at 82, a stalwart supporter of Israel since its modern founding — has rejected calls to limit military support to Israel. Sanders, on the Senate floor, said the continuing flow of U.S. arms to Israel for the war violated U.S. law and undermined U.S. standing in the world. Other governments will say to Americans, ''Don’t give us advice, don’t criticize us, when you have supported the mass starvation of children with your tax dollars,' he said. Republicans have stood firmly behind Netanyahu and will control both chambers of Congress next year as President-elect Donald Trump takes office. The U.S.'s roughly $18 billion in military support for Israel during the war was a politically divisive issue in the U.S. presidential campaign, with Republicans vowing to keep up undiminished backing for Israel. Trump has vowed strong support for Israel and has called on Netanyahu to bring the Gaza war to a quick close. He has offered few specifics on his plans on that. ___	https://apnews.com/article/israel-gaza-weapons-war-hamas-49f84cda2d17c4422cda362d1b8ea5de	2024-11-20T14:24:56-08:00

The US is sending antipersonnel land mines to Ukraine. Here's what it means	WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. decision to provide Ukraine with antipersonnel land mines expands the use of a weapon that the international community has long condemned because of its danger to innocent civilians. And it reflects another in a long line of American policy shifts on the controversial issue in the past 30 years. U.S. officials say the mines are needed to help Ukraine stall Russian progress on the battlefield, where Moscow's forces are moving in smaller ground units on the front lines rather than in more heavily protected armored vehicles. The Defense Department has been providing Ukraine with anti-tank mines throughout the war. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the new policy will give Ukraine 'nonpersistent antipersonnel land mines' that are safer because they lose the ability to detonate over time. The change shows the Biden administration 'has clearly and belatedly become less risk averse as it eyes troubling battlefield developments in Ukraine and worries how U.S. policy toward Ukraine and Russia may change on January 20,' when President-elect Donald Trump takes office, according to Bradley Bowman, senior director of the Center on Military and Political Power at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. Trump has criticized U.S. support for Ukraine and vowed to quickly end the war. As Ukraine has gotten more effective in drone warfare, Russian troops moving in armored vehicles are at greater risk of being hit by the drones, so have been moving by foot, making them harder to target, Bowman said. Here is where the U.S. stands on antipersonnel mines and what it means: TYPES OF MINES Mines range from larger, destructive ones that can take out a tank to smaller, antipersonnel variants that are hidden just beneath the surface of the ground and explode by a person's weight. The Biden administration is sending Ukraine antipersonnel mines that have a limited capacity. The so-called nonpersistent mines are electrically fused and powered by batteries. Once the battery runs out, they won’t detonate, and they can become inert in anywhere from four hours to two weeks. The U.S. has sought commitments from the Ukrainians to limit harm to civilians, according to a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Ukraine would use the mines in its own country but wouldn't put them in civilian populated areas. Throughout the war, the U.S. has given Ukraine larger, anti-tank mines, which are also battery-powered, so will become inert over time. The Remote Anti-Armor Mine System, or RAAM, is an artillery shell that contains the anti-tank mines. When fired, it scatters the mines, which can damage armored vehicles. The mines can also be set to self-detonate in four hours or 48 hours. AN OUTLIER ON LAND MINES The U.S. is one of just a small number of major nations that have not signed on to the 1997 Ottawa Convention, which prohibited the use, production and transfer of antipersonnel mines. As of 2022, 164 countries had ratified or agreed to the treaty. But several major powers, which are also past and current manufacturers of land mines, did not sign on, including the United States, China and Russia. South Korea, India and Pakistan also did not join the treaty. A key issue is that the mines are widely used in North and South Korea, particularly along the demilitarized zone, and are part of the U.S. campaign to protect the South from invasion by Pyongyang. Humanitarian groups for years have pushed the U.S. to join the ban treaty. According to NATO, nearly 70 countries and territories are still affected by the presence of 110 million land mines, which can 'remain dormant, concealed beneath the earth, for many years before being triggered.' Earlier this year, NATO said Russia's invasion of Ukraine has turned the nation into one of the most mine-laden countries in the world. Human Rights Watch has said that 11 of Ukraine’s 27 regions are now scattered with mines. The Russian mines are more deadly, as they largely are not those that become inert over time. Biden's decision was immediately condemned by Amnesty International, which said that even those type of mines are a threat to civilians. 'This is a reckless decision and a deeply disappointing setback for a President who once agreed that land mines put more civilians at increased risk of harm,' said Ben Linden, an advocacy director for Amnesty International USA. 'It is devastating, and frankly shocking, that President Biden made such a consequential and dangerous decision just before his public service legacy is sealed for the history books.' THE EVOLVING U.S. POLICY President Bill Clinton had a goal of limiting mine use and joining the treaty, but under President George W. Bush, the administration pulled back due to wide objections from military leaders. The policy under Bush was that the U.S. would use persistent mines — ones that do not automatically become inert — until 2010, and then not use them anymore. President Barack Obama ordered up a review of the U.S. policy and eventually prohibited the military from using any land mines anywhere in the world except in defense of South Korea. In January 2020, President Donald Trump canceled the Obama-era prohibition and eliminated geographic limits on the use of land mines that would become inert over time. Then-Defense Secretary Mark Esper wrote at the time that commanders 'may authorize the use of nonpersistent land mines when necessary for mission success in major contingencies or other exceptional circumstances.' The term 'major contingency' was not explicitly defined. When President Joe Biden took office, the Trump policy was rolled back, and use of the antipersonnel mines was prohibited outside of the Korean Peninsula. The administration decision, announced in June 2022, said all mines not required for the defense of South Korea would be destroyed. At that time, there were an estimated 3 million antipersonnel mines in the U.S. stockpile, but officials would not say how many of those would be considered necessary to defend South Korea. ___ Associated Press writer Tara Copp contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-russia-war-land-mines-civilians-biden-76fb21ce12f70aa965d3d7fbccb35c9c	2024-11-20T09:43:07-08:00	
Yaks, bears and cockatoos are among the animals Russia is sending to North Korean zoo	Russia has sent a gift of more than 70 animals to North Korea for the Pyongyang Zoo, including bears, yaks, ducks and cockatoos. In another sign of the growing cooperation between the countries, the animals were flown to Pyongyang aboard a government plane, escorted by officials and experts from the Moscow Zoo, according to a government statement released Wednesday. 'Historically, animals always have played a special role in relations between states. They have been given as a sign of support, kindness and care,' Russia’s Natural Resources Minister Alexander Kozlov, who traveled with the animals, said in televised remarks. The delivery included an African lion, two bears, two domestic yaks, 25 pheasants, 40 mandarin ducks and five white cockatoos, the statement said. In June, President Vladimir Putin traveled to North Korea, where he met with its leader, Kim Jong Un. They signed a 'comprehensive strategic partnership treaty' that was the strongest link between Moscow and Pyongyang since the end of the Cold War. Both countries have been targeted by Western sanctions. Since then, U.S., South Korean and Ukrainian intelligence assessments say up to 12,000 North Korean troops have been sent to Russia to fight against Ukraine.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-north-korea-pyongyang-zoo-putin-aeec989bcfa735ad477e5d0903686fdb	2024-11-20T09:01:11-08:00	
Trump chooses former acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker as NATO ambassador	WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump says he has chosen former acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker to serve as U.S. ambassador to NATO, the bedrock Western alliance that the president-elect has repeatedly expressed skepticism about. Trump, in a statement, said Whitaker was 'a strong warrior and loyal Patriot' who 'will ensure the United States’ interests are advanced and defended' and 'strengthen relationships with our NATO Allies, and stand firm in the face of threats to Peace and Stability.' The choice of Whitaker as the nation's representative to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is an unusual one, given his background is as a lawyer and not in foreign policy. Whitaker, a former U.S. attorney in Iowa, served as acting attorney general between November 2018 and February 2019, as special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian election interference was drawing to a close. Before then, he was chief of staff to Trump’s first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, before being picked to replace his boss after Sessions was fired amid lingering outrage over his decision to withdraw from the Russia investigation. Whitaker held the position for several months, on an acting basis and without Senate confirmation, until William Barr was confirmed as attorney general in February 2019. Whitaker has been a relentless critic of the federal criminal cases against Trump, which appear set to evaporate after Trump’s election win.

From Novak Djokovic to Iga Swiatek, players reflect on Rafael Nadal's career and retirement	MALAGA, Spain (AP) — As Rafael Nadal retires from tennis, current and former players — from Serena Williams and Novak Djokovic to Iga Swiatek and Taylor Fritz and so many more — have been sharing their thoughts on what the owner of 22 Grand Slam titles meant to them and to their sport. ___ 'He was pretty much the perfect role model for younger tennis players, for kids. And it’s been an honor to just get the chance to play him and to play someone who I obviously grew up watching. I mean, it’s crazy that it’s kind of just like an end of an era here.' — Taylor Fritz, this year's U.S. Open runner-up and currently ranked No. 4. ___ 'It’s been such an honor to see him play. I’ve been to his matches and watched him live. He’s a really special athlete who motivated me to fight for every point. His attitude is something … iconic.' — Elina Svitolina, three-time Grand Slam semifinalist. ___ 'What a legend. What a great ambassador for the sport. One of the greatest athletes ever — not just in tennis.' — Thanasi Kokkinakis, 2022 Australian Open men’s doubles champion. ___ 'From what I heard, off the court, he didn’t change at all with success. And that’s something that sometimes is not easy to do. I respect that.' — Daniil Medvedev, 2021 U.S. Open champion and twice the runner-up to Nadal in Grand Slam finals. ___ 'What an amazing champ, no? Amazing person. Always willing to get better.' — Conchita Martinez, 1994 Wimbledon champion and Billie Jean King Cup tournament director. ___ 'We all know how special he was to the sport, and I think he will continue to be super special to the sport. ... You couldn’t help but admire the way that he went about everything.' — Tommy Paul, 2023 Australian Open semifinalist. ___ 'We’re going to always love you. We’re going to always miss you.' — Serena Williams, 23-time Grand Slam champion. ___ 'I feel very lucky to have experienced moments on and off the court with him. And I’ve said it many times before that I would have liked to have shared many more.' — Carlos Alcaraz, four-time Grand Slam champion. ___ 'Honestly, he was the only player I watched, so I don’t know if I’m going to watch tennis at all now.' — Iga Swiatek, five-time major champion. ___ 'He has this ferocious energy on the court, but off the court, he’s this really humble, really nice, person. ... He’s an incredible role model for anyone to look at — and not try to be him, because that is very difficult, but try to take some of the things.' — Yannick Hanfmann, a German once ranked 45th. ___ 'The way he competes, he could maybe be down 6-0, 5-0, 40-Love, and still have a chance to win. He’s one of those guys you never think is out of it, one of those almost-perfect competitors. For me to meet him for the first time was pretty crazy. I got to practice with him a few times, which was an amazing experience for me. Obviously, I never got to play him. Probably lucky that I never got to play him.' — Ben Shelton, 2023 U.S. Open semifinalist. ___ 'Obviously his record on clay, and at Roland Garros, is amazing. You cannot compare it to anything. When such a big name, such a big athlete, is about to finish his career, it’s kind of sad. We’re going to miss his banana forehands. His fighting spirit. His ‘Vamos!’ I’m happy I was able to see him play and to play against him.' — Ilya Marchenko, a player who’s been ranked in the top 50 and is the captain of Ukraine’s Billie Jean King Cup team. ___ 'Whatever he will do next, he’s going to do it really well, for sure. He’s an incredible, incredible, incredible person, and it’s going to be sad for tennis and sports, in general. His grit, his passion, how he fights for every point, how he competes.' — Francisco Cerúndolo, who has been ranked in the top 20. ___ 'Your tenacity, your fighting spirit, the energy that you brought, the power, is something that will be studied and is something that will be transferred to many, many generations that are coming up. I’ve been honored and thrilled to be called your rival. The tennis world and the sports world will miss the incredible energy that you brought.' — Novak Djokovic, 24-time Grand Slam champion and Nadal's opponent in 60 matches. ___ 'The passion and intensity that you've played with was something that all tennis players aspire to and all tennis fans will remember you for. It’s been incredible watching you.' — Andy Murray, three-time Grand Slam champion and two-time Olympic gold medalist. ___ 'He has been an example for all of us.

US vetoes UN resolution demanding a cease-fire in Gaza because there's no link to a hostage release	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The United States vetoed a U.N. resolution demanding an immediate cease-fire in the war in Gaza on Wednesday because it is not linked to an immediate release of hostages taken captive by Hamas in Israel in October 2023. The U.N. Security Council voted 14-1 in favor of the resolution sponsored by the 10 elected members on the 15-member council, but it was not adopted because of the U.S. veto. The resolution that was put to a vote 'demands an immediate, unconditional and permanent cease-fire to be respected by all parties, and further reiterates its demand for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages.' The resolution had been sponsored by the 10 elected members on the 15-member council. Unlike the five permanent members – the U.S., Russia, China, Britain and France – the elected members have no veto power. The Security Council in June had adopted its first resolution on a cease-fire plan aimed at ending the war between Israel and Hamas. The U.S.-sponsored resolution welcomed a cease-fire proposal announced by President Joe Biden that the United States said Israel had accepted. It called on the militant Palestinian group Hamas to accept the three-phase plan – but the war goes on.	https://apnews.com/article/un-gaza-resolution-veto-hamas-israel-hostages-b5281432fc2acdc1860adb3015392c0b	2024-11-20T06:26:14-08:00	
Israeli officials demand the right to strike Hezbollah under any cease-fire deal for Lebanon	JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli officials demanded Wednesday the freedom to strike Lebanon's Hezbollah as part of any cease-fire deal, raising a potential complication as a top U.S. envoy was in the region attempting to clinch an agreement. The development came as an airstrike hit the historic Syrian town of Palmyra, killing 36 people, according to Syrian state-run media, which blamed the attack on Israel. The Israeli military declined to comment. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz and Foreign Minister Gideon Saar each said Israel sought to reserve the right to respond to any violations by Hezbollah under an emerging proposal, which would push the militant group’s fighters and Israeli ground forces out of a U.N. buffer zone in southern Lebanon. There have been signs of progress on the cease-fire deal, with Hezbollah’s allies in the Lebanese government saying the militant group had responded positively to the proposal. 'In any agreement we will reach, we will have to maintain our freedom to act if there will be violations,' Saar told dozens of foreign ambassadors in Jerusalem. 'We will have to be able to act in time, before the problem will grow.' Katz, in a meeting with intelligence corps officers, said 'the condition for any political settlement in Lebanon' was the right for the Israeli military 'to act and protect the citizens of Israel from Hezbollah.' Amos Hochstein, the Biden administration’s point man on Israel and Lebanon, has been working in recent days to push the sides toward agreement. He has been meeting this week with officials in Lebanon and said Wednesday he would travel to Israel in an attempt to 'try to bring this to a close if we can.' On Tuesday, Hochstein said an agreement to end the Israel-Hezbollah war is 'within our grasp.' The emerging cease-fire deal would push Hezbollah and Israel out of southern Lebanon Hezbollah began firing into Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, in solidarity with Hamas after its attack on southern Israel that sparked the war in the Gaza Strip. Israel has been responding with strikes in Lebanon, and dramatically escalated its bombardment in late September by launching a ground invasion just inside the border. In the more than a year of exchanges, more than 3,500 people have been killed in Lebanon, most in the past month, the Health Ministry reported, and over 1 million people have been displaced. It's unknown how many of the dead were Hezbollah fighters. In Israel, more than 70 people have been killed by Hezbollah fire, and tens of thousands have fled their homes. Hochstein’s proposal is based on U.N. resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 war between Hezbollah and Israel. The resolution stipulates that only the Lebanese army and U.N. peacekeepers should operate in southern Lebanon. Still, after 2006, Hezbollah never fully ended its presence in the south. Lebanon accuses Israel of also violating the resolution by maintaining hold of a small, disputed border area and conducting frequent military flights over Lebanon. Israel says that since then, Hezbollah build up a military infrastructure throughout villages and towns in southern Lebanon. The proposal currently being discussed would include an implementation plan and a monitoring system to ensure each side follows its obligations to fully withdraw from the south. That could involve the U.S. and France, but details are still unclear. There’s been progress, but the deal isn’t done yet The Israeli ministers did not outline what Israel’s demand to maintain freedom of operation would entail. Since the 2006 war, Israel has struck Hezbollah on the few occasions when border violence did flare up, but any larger scale response could push the region back into turmoil. It is also unlikely that Lebanon would agree to a deal that permits Israeli violations of its sovereignty. And although the proposal attempts to nail down an implementation mechanism, the failure to fully implement the U.N. resolution after the 2006 war could point to the difficulties in getting the sides to uphold a sustainable cease-fire that would bring long-term quiet. Israel has continued to pound Hezbollah throughout the cease-fire attempts, and rockets have continued to rain down on northern Israel. Any perceived escalation could derail the talks. The war in Gaza would grind on even if Israel and Hezbollah cease fire Even if a cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah is reached, the war in Gaza grinds on into its 14th month. Israel is still battling Hamas there, sending the death toll soaring to nearly 44,000 dead — over half of them women and children, according to local health officials, who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants in their count. While Hezbollah throughout the war in Gaza said it wouldn’t stop firing at Israel until the fighting in the Palestinian territory ends, that condition was dropped in September after Israel intensified its offensive on the militant group, killing its top leadership and degrading its military capabilities. That leaves Gaza waiting for a cease-fire of its own, as people there continue to endure a humanitarian crisis that has displaced much of the territory’s 2.3 million people and prompted widespread hunger, especially in the north, where the U.N. says virtually no food or humanitarian aid has been delivered to for more than 40 days because of the Israeli military’s siege there. International mediation efforts have stalled repeatedly over disagreement between Israel and Hamas over whether the war should end as part of a cease-fire deal, with Israel insisting it wants to maintain troop presence in certain areas. Hamas ignited the war in Gaza when its fighters stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of them believed to be dead. Other tumultuous areas of the Middle East won't likely be affected by a Hezbollah-Israel cease-fire, including Syria. Israel frequently targets military sites and facilities associated with Iran-linked groups in Syria but rarely acknowledges the strikes. The death toll from Wednesday’s strike in Palmyra was unusually high. The Syrian news agency SANA said that along wit the 36 killed, the strike on Palmyra also wounded more than 50 people and caused 'significant material damage to the targeted buildings' and the surrounding area. Palmyra is known for the historic Roman temple complex nearby, but it was not immediately clear if the ruins were damaged. The temple complex already suffered significant damage years ago from the Islamic State group in its rampage across Syria. ___ Chehayeb reported from Beirut. ___ Find more of AP’s coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-lebanon-hezbollah-iran-11-20-2024-1b39fe8499097c2f2579fce50d083263	2024-11-20T06:09:55-08:00	
Fate of man accused of killing Georgia student Laken Riley is now in judge's hands	ATHENS, Ga. (AP) — The fate of the man accused of killing Georgia nursing student Laken Riley was in the hands of a judge after prosecutors and defense attorneys delivered their closing statements Wednesday in the case that fueled the national debate over immigration during this year’s presidential race. Jose Ibarra, 26, is charged with murder and other crimes in Riley’s February death. He waived his right to a jury trial, meaning the case will be decided by Athens-Clarke County Superior Court Judge H. Patrick Haggard. The Feb. 22 killing on the University of Georgia campus added fuel to the national debate over immigration when federal authorities said Ibarra illegally entered the U.S. in 2022 and was allowed to stay in the country while he pursued his immigration case. Riley, 22, was a student at Augusta University College of Nursing, which also has a campus in Athens, about 70 miles (115 kilometers) east of Atlanta. The trial began last Friday and the prosecution rested its case on Tuesday after calling more than a dozen law enforcement officers, Riley's roommates and a woman who lived in the same apartment as Ibarra. Defense attorneys called a police officer, a jogger and one of Ibarra's neighbors on Tuesday and rested their case Wednesday morning. Riley's parents, roommates and other friends and family members packed the courtroom each day, many of them getting emotional as they listened to witness testimony. Ibarra, dressed each day in a collared shirt and dark slacks with his feet chained, appeared attentive throughout the trial.	https://apnews.com/article/georgia-nursing-student-laken-riley-immigrant-d8d75ccc6d81e7a88eb7890829d9fc9c	2024-11-20T05:20:57-08:00	
Spain to grant residency, work permits to hundreds of thousands of migrants in the country illegally	MADRID (AP) — Spain will grant residency and work permits to about 300,000 migrants living in the country illegally each year for the next three years, the country's migration minister said Wednesday. The policy will take effect next May and aims to expand the country's aging workforce. Spain has remained largely open to receiving migrants even as other European nations seek to tighten their borders to illegal crossings and asylum seekers. Spain needs around 250,000 registered foreign workers a year to maintain its welfare state, Migration Minister Elma Saiz said in an interview on Wednesday. She contended that the legalization policy is not aimed solely at 'cultural wealth and respect for human rights, it’s also prosperity.' 'Today, we can say Spain is a better country,' Saiz told national broadcaster Radio Nacional de España. Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has often described his government's migration policies as a means to combat the country's low birthrate. The new policy, approved Tuesday by Sánchez's leftist minority coalition government, simplifies administrative procedures for short and long-term visas and provides migrants with additional labor protections. It extends a visa previously offered to job-seekers for three months to one year. In August, Sánchez visited three West African nations in an effort to address irregular migration to Spain’s Canary Islands. The archipelago off the coast of Africa is seen by many as a step toward continental Europe with young men from Mali, Senegal, Mauritania and elsewhere embarking on dangerous sea voyages there seeking better job opportunities abroad or fleeing violence and political instability at home. By mid-November, some 54,000 migrants had reached Spain this year by sea or land, according to the country's Interior Ministry. The exact number of foreigners living in Spain illegally is not clear. Many such migrants make a living in Spain's underground economy as fruit pickers, caretakers, delivery drivers, or other low-paid but essential jobs often passed over by Spaniards. Without legal protections, they can be vulnerable to exploitation and abuse. Saiz said the new policy would help prevent such abuse and 'serve to combat mafias, fraud and the violation of rights.' Spain's economy is among the fastest-growing in the European Union this year, boosted in part by a strong rebound in tourism after the pandemic. In 2023, Spain issued 1.3 million visas to foreigners, according to the government. ___ Follow AP coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/migration	https://apnews.com/article/spain-migrants-foreign-workers-europe-ce2ac68649bc1cb0603f1e810885e0cf	2024-11-20T04:43:55-08:00	
Pope approves new papal funeral rites to simplify ritual, allow for burial outside the Vatican	ROME (AP) — Pope Francis has revised the funeral rites that will be used when he dies, simplifying the rituals to emphasize his role as a mere bishop and allowing for burial outside the Vatican in keeping with his wishes. The Vatican newspaper L’Osservatore Romano on Wednesday published details of the updated liturgical book, which Francis approved April 29 and which replaces the previous edition that was last published in 2000. Francis turns 88 in December and, despite some health and mobility problems, appears in fine form. On Wednesday, he presided over a spirited general audience that featured children who spontaneously rushed the stage. While popes often tinker with the rules regulating the conclave that will elect their successor, a revision of the papal funeral rites became necessary after Emeritus Pope Benedict XVI died on Dec. 31, 2022. The Vatican had to work out a funeral for the first retired pope in 600 years, and a few months later Francis revealed he was working with the Vatican’s master of liturgical ceremonies, Monsignor Diego Ravelli, to overhaul the papal funeral rites to simplify them. In that 2023 interview with Mexican Televisa broadcaster N+, Francis also revealed that he had decided he would be buried in Santa Maria Maggiore basilica in Rome, not in the grottoes underneath St. Peter’s Basilica where most popes are buried. Ravelli told L’Osservatore Romano that the new reform simplifies the funeral rites, including eliminating the requirement that the pope be placed on an elevated bier in St. Peter’s Basilica for public viewing. Rather, he will be on view in a simple coffin, and the burial no longer requires the traditional three coffins of cyprus, lead and oak. The simplification, Ravelli told the newspaper, is meant 'to emphasize even more that the Roman Pontiff’s funeral is that of a shepherd and disciple of Christ and not of a powerful man of this world.' Since his 2013 election, Francis has eschewed the pomp often associated with the papacy to emphasize his role as the bishop of Rome and a servant of the 'church of the poor.' The Argentine Jesuit lives in the Vatican hotel, not the Apostolic Palace, and travels in small Fords or Fiats, not fancy SUVs. His desire to be buried at Santa Maria Maggiore reflects his veneration of an icon of the Virgin Mary that is located there, the Salus populi Romani (Salvation of the people of Rome). After every trip, Francis goes to the basilica to pray before the Byzantine-style painting that features an image of Mary, draped in a blue robe, holding the infant Jesus who in turn holds a jeweled golden book. 'It’s my great devotion,' Francis told N+ in revealing his future burial plans. 'The place is already prepared.' ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Middle East latest: Israel insists on right to act against Hezbollah in any deal to end fighting	Israel’s defense minister says his country insists on the right to act militarily against Hezbollah in any agreement to end the fighting in Lebanon. Lebanon’s government is likely to view any such demand as an infringement on its sovereignty, complicating efforts to end more than a year of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah that erupted into all-out war in September. Defense Minister Israel Katz said in a statement Wednesday that 'the condition for any political settlement in Lebanon is the preservation of the intelligence capability and the preservation of the (Israeli military’s) right to act and protect the citizens of Israel from Hezbollah.' Lebanese officials mediating between Israel and Hezbollah have called for a return to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 war between the sides. It calls for Hezbollah militants and Israeli forces to withdraw from a buffer zone in southern Lebanon patrolled by U.N. peacekeepers and Lebanese troops. U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein, who has spent months trying to broker a cease-fire, held a second round of talks on Wednesday with Lebanon’s parliament speaker, Nabih Berri, an ally of Hezbollah who has been mediating on their behalf. Hochstein told reporters the talks had made 'additional progress,' and that he would be heading to Israel 'to try to bring this to a close, if we can.' He declined to say what the sticking points are. Israeli strikes and combat in Lebanon have killed more than 3,500 people and wounded 15,000, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. The war has displaced nearly 1.2 million people, or a quarter of Lebanon’s population. On the Israeli side, 87 soldiers and 50 civilians, including some foreign farmworkers, have been killed by attacks involving rockets, drones and missiles. Hezbollah began firing on Israel the day after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack triggered the war in Gaza. That attack killed some 1,200 people in Israel, mostly civilians, and another 250 were abducted. Around 100 hostages remain inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed nearly 44,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities. ___ Here’s the Latest: Israel explores options for delivering aid to war-ravaged Gaza JERUSALEM — Israel’s government spokesperson has indicated that it is exploring the option of hiring a private contractor to deliver aid to war-ravaged Gaza. Israel has come under heavy international criticism for a growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The U.N. and international aid agencies say Israel is failing to ensure safe conditions allowing them to work, while Israel accuses the U.N. of logistical failures. Israel also claims Hamas has stolen much of the aid. Israeli media reported Tuesday that the government is now looking into hiring private companies to deliver aid. Asked about the government’s plans, spokesman David Mencer said: 'Israel is looking at many creative solutions to ensure a better future for Gaza.' The army and COGAT, the military body responsible for Palestinian humanitarian affairs, declined comment. Aid distribution is largely coordinated by UNRWA, the U.N. Agency for Palestinian refugees. Israel accuses the agency of cooperating with Hamas and has banned it from operating on Israeli soil. UNRWA denies the accusations. 'Certainly UNRWA has provided a failed past and we are ensuring that doesn’t continue into a failed future,' Mencer said. With the war in its 14th month, Israel has still not laid out a postwar plan for the territory. Aid groups say the already grave humanitarian situation in Gaza has deteriorated in recent weeks. Their efforts suffered another blow this week when armed gangs looted nearly 100 trucks loaded with food and other supplies. Hezbollah says it supports cease-fire negotiations but has some reservations BEIRUT — Hezbollah leader Naim Kassem said in a televised speech Wednesday that the Lebanese militant group supports the ongoing negotiation process for a cease-fire with Israel after more than 13 months of fighting but had given some 'remarks' on the proposal. He added that the outcome depends on Israel’s response. Kassem’s speech coincided with a two-day visit to Lebanon by U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein aimed at clinching a deal to halt the war that has killed more than 3,500 people in Lebanon and more than 130 Israelis. Speaking from an undisclosed location in a pre-recorded address, Kassem said, 'We agree to the current negotiation process.' Kassem also said that Hezbollah has 'some reservations' on the cease-fire proposal, which it gave to the U.S. envoy. 'The cessation of fighting depends on Israel’s response and Netanyahu’s seriousness,' he added, referring to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 'No one can guarantee' whether this will lead to an actual cease-fire, Kassem said. He said that any cease-fire between Hezbollah and Israel must include 'a complete and comprehensive end to the aggression,' preserving Lebanon’s sovereignty and ruling out any freedom of movement for Israel in Lebanese territory. Kassem said that before his predecessor, longtime Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli strike on Sept. 27, the militant group had given its 'approval of the Biden-Macron proposal' for a 21-day truce, which was under discussion at the time. Israeli airstrike on Palmyra kills 36 people and causes damage, Syrian media say DAMASCUS — An Israeli airstrike on the Syrian town of Palmyra, known for the historic Roman temple complex nearby, killed 36 people and wounded more than 50 Wednesday, Syrian state-run media said. The SANA news agency said the strikes also led to 'significant material damage to the targeted buildings and the surrounding area.' The Israeli military declined to comment on the reported strike in Syria. Israel frequently targets military sites and facilities associated with Iran-linked groups in Syria but rarely acknowledges the strikes. The death toll from Wednesday’s strike was unusually high. It was not immediately clear if the ruins were damaged. The temple complex already suffered significant damage years ago during the Islamic State group’s rampage across Syria. In 2015, the world watched in horror as the militants blew up an iconic arch and temple in Palmyra. Since IS lost its hold on the area, restoration work on the site has been held up by security issues, leftover IS landmines and lack of funding. The strike in Syria comes as negotiations are underway for a potential cease-fire between Israel and the Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon, but it is unclear if the ceasefire would include Syria. Israeli bill targets families of minors convicted of security offenses JERUSALEM — The Israeli parliament has passed a bill stripping some insurance benefits from families of minors convicted of security offenses. A rights group denounced the legislation as a form of collective punishment of Palestinians. The bill, which passed 29-8 late Monday, bans direct family members of minors convicted of security offenses from receiving a child allowance, study grants, or other welfare benefits under Israel’s National Insurance program while the minor is imprisoned. It was passed to 'cause parents to supervise their children and make sure that they do not engage in terrorist activity,' according to a press release on the website of the Knesset, Israel’s parliament. Legal group Adalah, which called on Israel’s attorney general to withdraw the law, said the true aim of the legislation was 'to impose punitive measures under the pretext of counterterrorism by denying welfare benefits.' Adalah said that because the legislation only applies to those convicted of security offenses, who are overwhelmingly Palestinian, it 'creates a distinction on the basis of nationality.' It’s the latest in a series of measures passed by the Knesset that have been denounced by rights groups as draconian. A law passed earlier this month would allow Israel to deport family members of Palestinian attackers to Gaza or other locations. In late October, the Knesset passed two laws banning UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, from operating on Israeli soil. Lebanese army says one of its soldiers was killed by an Israeli airstrike BEIRUT — A Lebanese army soldier was killed Wednesday by an Israeli airstrike that hit his vehicle on the road linking Burj al-Muluk and Qalaa in southern Lebanon, the army said in a statement. The Israeli military said it was looking into reports. A day earlier, three soldiers were killed by an airstrike that targeted an army post in the town of Sarafand, near the coastal city of Saida. Wissam Khalifa, a resident of Sarafand who lives next to the army post and was injured in the strike, said he was shocked that it was targeted. 'It’s a safe residential neighborhood. There is nothing here at all' that would present a target, he said. 'Regarding the martyred soldiers, I don’t even know if there was a gun in the center. Why did this strike happen? We have no idea.' The Lebanese army has not been an active participant in the fighting between Israeli forces and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah over the past 13 months, but more than 40 soldiers have been killed in the conflict. Altogether, more than 3,500 people have been killed in Lebanon since Oct. 8, 2023, the vast majority of them in the past two months. Wounded Al Jazeera reporter to be evacuated to Jordan for treatment AMMAN, Jordan: Israel has allowed an Al Jazeera journalist wounded in an airstrike in Gaza last month to be evacuated to Jordan for medical treatment. Jordan’s Foreign Ministry said Wednesday that Ali al-Attar had been transferred to the kingdom with his sister in coordination with the World Health Organization. There was no immediate comment from Israel. Al-Attar was wounded by shrapnel when Israeli forces struck makeshift points used by Hamas-run police outside a hospital in central Gaza early on Oct. 7. There were no police present at the time. Israel banned Al-Jazeera earlier this year, accusing it of serving as a mouthpiece of Hamas. It has also accused six Al Jazeera journalists in Gaza of being current or former fighters for Hamas and another armed group. Al Jazeera has denied the allegations and accused Israel of trying to silence critical coverage. The Qatar-based network has reported round-the-clock from Gaza since the start of the war, with its field correspondents focusing on the killing of civilians in Israeli strikes. Several Al Jazeera reporters have themselves been killed or wounded. Al Jazeera has also regularly broadcast videos released by militant groups in their entirety, including some that show Israeli hostages speaking under duress.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-hezbollah-latest-20-november-2024-621bf47de03e7992d6ba3855a200abbc	2024-11-20T04:07:01-08:00	
UN authorizes first mpox vaccine for children in an attempt to control Congo outbreak	GENEVA (AP) — The World Health Organization has authorized the first mpox vaccine for children, a decision experts hope will help make immunizations more widely available to one of the hardest-hit populations during the ongoing outbreaks of the disease in Congo and elsewhere in Africa. In a statement late Tuesday, the U.N. health agency said it had approved the mpox vaccine made by Japanese company KM Biologics for use in children over 1 year of age as a single dose. Earlier this month, the charity Save the Children said that cases among children younger than 18 had increased by more than 130% in Congo, noting there were now more than 25,000 suspect cases. The charity said that children were almost four times more likely than adults to die from the newest form of mpox first detected in eastern Congo earlier this year. Mpox, related to smallpox, mostly causes symptoms including fever, rash, lesions and fatigue. 'Children are especially vulnerable to mpox,' Save The Children's Dr. Katia Vieira de Moraes LaCasse said in a statement. 'They explore by touch and taste, don't always understand health guidance and have weaker immune systems than adults.' Scientists have previously noted that mpox appears to be disproportionately affecting children in Congo and Burundi, which account for more than 90% of all mpox cases in Africa's current outbreak. WHO had previously approved the mpox vaccine made by Bavarian Nordic for people 18 and over, but said that the shot could be used in younger populations, if doctors thought the benefits might outweigh potential risks, given the lack of data in children and other groups including pregnant women. Last week, WHO said cases of mpox in the Congolese region where the new, more infectious form was first identified appeared to be ' plateauing,' even as cases were rising elsewhere, including Burundi and Uganda. So far, about 50,000 people in Congo have been immunized against mpox with the vaccine made by Bavarian Nordic. WHO said Japan had announced it would donate about 3 million doses of the shot made by KM Biologics to Congo. It wasn't clear whether any of the doses had arrived. On Friday, WHO is convening its expert committee to determine whether the outbreaks in Congo and elsewhere in Africa is still a global emergency, a declaration that the U.N. agency first made in August. To date, Africa has reported more than 46,000 suspected mpox cases in the current outbreak, including 1,081 deaths. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

Climate change goosed hurricane wind strength by 18 mph since 2019, study says	BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) — Human-caused climate change made Atlantic hurricanes about 18 miles per hour (29 kilometers per hour) stronger in the last six years, a new scientific study found Wednesday. For most of the storms — 40 of them — the extra oomph from warmer oceans made the storms jump an entire hurricane category, according to the study published in the journal, Environmental Research: Climate. A Category 5 storm causes more than 400 times the damage of a minimal Category 1 hurricane, more than 140 times the damage of a minimal Category 3 hurricane and more than five times the damage of a minimal Category 4 storm, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration For three storms, including this month's Rafael, the climate change factor goosed wind speed so much that the winds increased by two storm categories. This isn't about more storms, but increasing power from the worst ones, authors said. 'We know that the intensity of these storms is causing a lot more catastrophic damage in general,' lead study author Daniel Gilford, a climate scientist at Climate Central, which does research on global warming. 'Damages do scale (up) with the intensity.' The effect was especially noticeable in stronger storms, including those that made it to the top of the Saffir-Simpson scale of storm intensity: Category Five, study authors said. The study looked at 2019 to 2023, but the authors then did a quick addition for the named storms this year, all of which had a bump up due to climate change. 'We had two Category Five storms here in 2024,' Gilford said. 'Our analysis shows that we would have had zero Category Five storms without human-caused climate change.' This year’s three most devastating storms — Beryl, Helene and Milton — increased by 18 mph (29 kph), 16 mph (26 kph) and 24 mph (39 mph) respectively because of climate change, the authors said. A different study by World Weather Attribution had deadly Helene’s wind speed increase by about 13 mph, which is close, said Imperial College London climate scientist Friederike Otto, who coordinates the WWA team and praised the Climate Central work. 'It absolutely makes sense from a fundamental standpoint that what’s going on is we’ve added more energy to the system,' National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration chief Rick Spinrad said at United Nations climate talks in Baku, Azerbaijan. 'The change is going to manifest in terms of what we’re already seeing. You look at Hurricane Helene which was massive, 500 miles across. We’re going to see changes in terms of the velocity of these storms. We're going to see changes in terms of Hurricane Milton spawning so many tornadoes.' Since 2019, eight storms — 2019’s Humberto, 2020’s Zeta, 2021’s Sam and Larry, 2022’s Earl, 2023’s Franklin and 2024’s Isaac and Rafael — increased by at least 25 mph (40 kph) in wind speed. Humberto and Zeta gained the most: 31 miles per hour (50 kph). In 85% of the storms studied in the last six years, the authors saw a fingerprint of climate change in storm strength, Gilford said. Warm water is the main fuel of hurricanes. The warmer the Atlantic, Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico get, the more potential energy goes into storms. Other factors — such as high level crosswinds and dry air — can act to weaken hurricanes. The waters in the hurricane area have increased by 2 to 3 degrees Fahrenheit (1.1 to 1.6 Celsius) in general and as much as 4 degrees (2.2 C) due to climate change, Gilford said. They know this because Climate Central has used scientifically accepted techniques to regularly track how much warmer oceans are because of the burning of coal, oil and natural gas. That technique basically uses computer simulations to create a fictional world with no human-caused warming and then compares it to current reality, with the difference being caused by greenhouse gases. They account for other factors, such as the lessening amount of sulfate pollution from marine shipping which had been counteracting a bit of the warming before the skies cleared up more. To go from warmer waters to stronger storms, the authors looked at a calculation called potential intensity, which is essentially the speed limit for any given storm based on the environmental conditions around it, Gilford said. MIT hurricane expert and meteorology professor Kerry Emanuel, who pioneered potential intensity measurements, wasn't part of the study but said it makes sense. It shows the increase in storm strength that he predicted would happen 37 years ago, he said. Past studies have shown that climate change has made hurricanes intensify quicker, and slower moving, which causes even more rain to be dumped. ___ This story has corrected the spelling of Daniel Gilford's last name throughout. ___ Read more of AP’s climate coverage at http://www.apnews.com/climate-and-environment ___ Follow Seth Borenstein on X at @borenbears ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Russian lawmakers endorse bill to ban adoptions by gender-transition countries	MOSCOW (AP) — Russia’s upper house of parliament on Wednesday endorsed a bill banning adoption of Russian children by citizens of countries where gender transitioning is legal. The Federation Council also approved bills that outlaw the spread of material that encourages people not to have children. The bills, which have previously been approved by the lower house, will now go to President Vladimir Putin for signing into law. They follow a series of laws that have suppressed sexual minorities and bolstered longstanding conventional values. Lower house speaker Vyacheslav Volodin, who was among the new bill's authors, noted that 'it is extremely important to eliminate possible dangers in the form of gender reassignment that adopted children may face in these countries.' The adoption ban would apply to at least 15 countries, most of them in Europe as well as in Australia, Argentina and Canada. Adoption of Russian children by U.S. citizens was banned in 2012. Other bills approved by lawmakers on Wednesday outlaw what is described as propaganda for remaining child-free and impose fines of up to 5 million rubles (about $50,000). Its proponents contended that public arguments against having children are part of purported Western efforts to weaken Russia by encouraging population decline. Putin and other top officials in recent years have increasingly called for observing so-called traditional values as a counter to Western liberalism. As Russia’s population declines, Putin has made statements advocating large families and last year urged women to have as many as eight children. Russia last year banned gender-transition medical procedures and its Supreme Court declared the LGBTQ+ 'movement' to be extremist. In 2022, Putin signed a law prohibiting the distribution of LGBTQ+ information to people of all ages, expanding a ban issued in 2013 on disseminating the material to minors. Since he sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022, the Kremlin leader has repeatedly characterized the West as 'satanic' and accused it of trying to undermine Russia by exporting liberal ideologies. Independent journalists, critics, activists and opposition figures in Russia have come under increasing pressure from the government in recent years, intensifying significantly amid the conflict in Ukraine. Hundreds of nongovernmental groups and individuals have been designated as a 'foreign agent' — a label that implies additional government scrutiny and carries strong pejorative connotations. On Wednesday, the lower house of parliament, the State Duma, gave preliminary approval to a bill that would ban those who have been designated 'foreign agents' from accessing their incomes. The measure would freeze all their Russia-generated income on special accounts and would only allow them access to the funds if their 'foreign agent' status is revoked. Volodin, the lower house speaker, has said that the proposed legislation was aimed at preventing 'the enrichment of traitors to the motherland at citizens' expense.'	https://apnews.com/article/russia-lgbtq-adoption-86694922365a09e3ac27dd9893b6a334	2024-11-20T00:26:27-08:00	
Higher energy bills push UK inflation to 6-month high in October	LONDON (AP) — Inflation in the U.K. rose sharply to a six-month high in October and back above the rate targeted by rate-setters at the Bank of England, official figures showed Wednesday, an increase that is set to cement market expectations that there will be no further cuts in borrowing rates this year. The Office for National Statistics said higher domestic energy bills pushed consumer price inflation up to 2.3% in the year to October from the three-year low of 1.7% recorded the previous month. The increase, which was above forecasts for a more modest increase, took inflation above the bank's target rate of 2%. Earlier this month, the bank increased its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.75% — the second in three months — after inflation fell to its lowest level since April 2021. However, Bank Gov. Andrew Bailey cautioned that rates wouldn't be falling too fast over the coming months, partly because last week’s budget measures from the new Labour government would likely see prices rise by more than they would otherwise have done. Rate-setters will meet once more this year, on Dec. 19, by which time they will be armed with more monthly inflation reading. Central banks worldwide dramatically increased borrowing costs from near zero during the coronavirus pandemic when prices started to shoot up, first as a result of supply chain issues and then because of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine which pushed up energy costs. As inflation rates have recently fallen from multidecade highs, the central banks have started cutting interest rates.	https://apnews.com/article/uk-inflation-economy-interest-rates-f369072fc3a25285ba28d1af9de50b0e	2024-11-19T22:39:48-08:00	
Iraq launches its first national census in nearly four decades	BAGHDAD (AP) — Iraq began its first nationwide population census in decades Wednesday, a step aimed at modernizing data collection and planning in a country long impacted by conflict and political divisions. The act of counting the population is also contentious. The census is expected to have profound implications for Iraq’s resource distribution, budget allocations and development planning. Minority groups fear that a documented decline in their numbers will bring decreased political influence and fewer economic benefits in the country’s sectarian power-sharing system. The count in territories such as Kirkuk, Diyala and Mosul -- where control is disputed between the central government in Baghdad and the semi-autonomous Kurdish regional government in the north -- has drawn intense scrutiny. Ali Arian Saleh, the executive director of the census at the Ministry of Planning, said agreements on how to conduct the count in the disputed areas were reached in meetings involving Iraq’s prime minister, president and senior officials from the Kurdish region. 'Researchers from all major ethnic groups — Kurds, Arabs, Turkmen, and Christians — will conduct the census in these areas to ensure fairness,' he said. The last nationwide census in Iraq was held in 1987. Another one held in 1997 excluded the Kurdish region. The new census 'charts a developmental map for the future and sends a message of stability,' Planning Minister Mohammed Tamim said in a televised address. The census will be the first to employ advanced technologies for gathering and analyzing data, providing a comprehensive picture of Iraq’s demographic, social, and economic landscape, offiials say. Some 120,000 census workers will survey households across the country, covering approximately 160 housing units each over two days. The Interior Ministry announced a nationwide curfew during the census period, restricting movement of citizens, vehicles and trains between cities, districts and rural areas, with exceptions for humanitarian cases. The count will be carried out using the 'de jure' method, in which people are counted in their usual area of residence, Saleh said. That means that people internally displaced by years of war will be counted in the areas where they have since settled, not in their original communities. The census will not include Iraqis residing abroad or those forcibly displaced to other countries. Saleh estimated Iraq’s population at 44.5 million and said the Kurdish region’s share of the national budget — currently 12% — is based on an estimated population of 6 million. The census will also clarify the number of public employees in the region. By order of Iraq’s federal court, the census excluded questions about ethnicity and sectarian affiliation, focusing solely on broad religious categories such as Muslim and Christian. 'This approach is intended to prevent tensions and ensure the census serves developmental rather than divisive goals,' Saleh said. The census will be monitored by international observers who will travel across Iraq’s provinces to assess the data quality, he said. Hogr Chato, director of the Irbil-based Public Aid Organization, said the census will reshape the map of political thinking and future decision making. 'Even though some leaders deny it, the data will inevitably have political and economic implications,' he said. 'It’s also fair to allocate budgets based on population numbers, as areas with larger populations or those impacted by war need more resources.' Chato said he believes the delays in conducting the census were not only due to security concerns but also political considerations. 'There was data they didn’t want to make public, such as poverty levels in each governorate,' he said. Ahead of the census, leaders in Iraq’s various communities urged people to be counted. In Baghdad’s Adhamiyah district, Abdul Wahhab al-Samarrai, preacher at Imam Abu Hanifa Mosque, urged citizens to cooperate with the census. 'This is a duty for every Muslim to ensure the rights of future generations,' he said in a Friday sermon the week before the count. ___ Martany reported from Irbil, Iraq.	https://apnews.com/article/iraq-census-kurds-kirkuk-1d315225c4ccaf21355afe2af8076a9b	2024-11-19T21:34:16-08:00	
Ukraine has seen success in building clean energy, which is harder for Russia to destroy	BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) — Maxim Timchenko, CEO of DTEK, the largest private energy company in Ukraine, pulls out a piece of paper with bar charts showing how much new electricity his company has brought online this year in the country versus how much Russian bombs have destroyed. Total electricity goes up, then down, then up, then down — capturing the company's constant rebuilding each time Russian missile attacks take out a facility, which include wind and solar farms and thermal (coal or gas-fired) generating stations. The Russian strikes are part of a campaign to target energy infrastructure to reduce power in Ukraine as winter looms. 'What other choice do we have?' said Timchenko during an interview on the sidelines of this year's U.N. climate talks, taking place in Azerbaijan. 'Sit and wait and pray that they don't hit us, or do our job and bring lights back to our people?' The nearly three-year-long Russia-Ukraine war, which has left large swaths of Ukraine destroyed, has accelerated a transition to clean energy. At Ukraine's pavilion at COP29, on display is a large smashed solar panel, destroyed in an attack this year. Russian forces continue to make small but steady gains in capturing Ukrainian territory at a time when there are questions about how much the United States, which has been providing weapons and money, will continue to support the country once President-elect Donald Trump assumes office in January. During the campaign, Trump repeatedly said he could quickly end the war if elected, although he hasn't said how. Whatever the future, the decentralized nature of some clean energies, in particular wind and solar, has allowed Ukraine to quickly restore power in ways that would be impossible with Ukraine's more traditional energy sources, such as coal-fired power plants. In centralized systems, all power is generated and sent to the grid over transmission lines from the same area. That means if the plant goes down, say in an attack, a large section of grid, or even the entire grid, comes to a halt. By contrast, wind and solar installations are usually more scattered, so less of the system goes down with one hit, and if the solar is on rooftops, the impact can be even more limited. Attacks on two DTEK solar farms last spring is a good example. They destroyed many solar panels and some of the transformers, which step up voltage for long distances or step it down for use in homes. Replacing the transformers and swapping out destroyed panels allowed the farms, which generate 400 megawatts, to be back up in seven days. Timchenko said an attack on a thermal generating station, which experienced a similar amount of damage, took three to four months to rebuild. 'That's the difference between centralized and so-called decentralized generation. It's much more resistant and difficult to destroy,' said Timchenko. Geoffrey Pyatt, assistant secretary of the U.S. State Department's Bureau of Energy Resources, said that Russian attacks on energy infrastructure have evolved. In 2022 and 2023, they focused on transformers. 'The Ukrainians were incredibly efficient in working around those attacks. So Putin changed his tactics beginning in March to go after generation capacity,' said Pyatt, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Since then, about 50% of Ukraine's total power generation has been knocked out, leaving mostly nuclear, some hydropower and large new renewable projects, like a wind farm being built by DTEK, he added. Renewable and other infrastructure projects are financed by partnerships between governments and businesses, spreading out the risk, since there is no guarantee that something built isn't destroyed by missiles. In June, turbine maker GE Vernova and manufacturer Honeywell announced plans to partner with DTEK for major wind and battery storage projects in Ukraine. Roger Martella, chief sustainability officer for GE Vernova, said that developing public-private partnerships was key to lowering risk and making investment more attractive. Ukraine's resistance was also an inspiration, Martella told a panel on Ukrainian renewables at COP29. 'We’re humbled by the fact that Ukraine has done something no one has ever done before, which is to maintain the grid in a war-torn environment,' said Martella. Pyatt, a former ambassador in Ukraine, said he has seen widespread support for Ukraine's energy systems in the G7, a group of leading industrialized nations. While making clear he couldn't speak for the incoming Trump administration, Pyatt said he believed support for Ukraine in the energy sector would 'continue in any scenario.' 'If you start to get big American companies like GE and Fluxus and Honeywell involved in energy reconstruction, and there’s going to be billions of dollars of energy reconstruction,' he said. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Southern China suspends ferry services as storm brings winds, high waters to coastal regions	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Parts of coastal southern China suspended ferry services as a major storm passed into the South China Sea, bringing high winds and heavy waves to much of the region. The storm was downgraded Wednesday from Typhoon Man-yi, which left seven dead in the Philippines and worsened the crisis caused by back-to-back storms that battered the disaster-prone nation. It is now categorized as a low-pressure area lingering south of China’s Hainan Island, according to the Hong Kong Observatory, which said its maximum sustained winds were a relatively mild 40 kilometers (25 miles) per hour. Climatologists have predicted a greater frequency of such storms, but better preparedness and early warning systems in the Asia Pacific nations most affected have helped mitigate some of the most dire consequences. Higher sea temperatures caused by a warming climate are increasing the amount of moisture in the air and extending the typhoon season from its usual annual end point of September. Europe, particularly Spain, and the southeastern United States have also experienced devastating storms in recent weeks.	https://apnews.com/article/storm-typhoon-asia-china-manyi-a57d2f4e40638a81c880b49feb9466a0	2024-11-19T20:30:58-08:00	
Health advocates in Africa worry Trump will reimpose abortion 'gag rule' governing US aid	EPWORTH, Zimbabwe (AP) — Carrying her infant daughter, 19-year-old Sithulisiwe Moyo waited two hours to get birth-control pills from a tent pitched in a poor settlement on the outskirts of Zimbabwe’s capital, Harare. The outreach clinic in Epworth provides Moyo with her best shot at achieving her dream of returning to school. 'I am too young to be a baby-making machine,' she said. 'At least this clinic helps me avoid another pregnancy.' But the free service funded by the U.S. government, the world’s largest health donor, might soon be unavailable. As he did in his first term, U.S President-elect Donald Trump is likely in January to invoke the so-called global gag rule, a policy that bars U.S. foreign aid from being used to perform abortions or provide abortion information. The policy cuts off American government funding for services that women around the world rely on to avoid pregnancy or to space out their children, as well as for heath care unrelated to abortion. Four decades of on-again, off-again restrictions The gag rule has a 40-year history of being applied by Republican presidents and rescinded by Democratic presidents. Every GOP president since the mid-1980s has invoked the rule, which is known as the Mexico City Policy for the city where it was first announced. As one of his first acts as president in 2017, Trump expanded the rule to the extent that foreign NGOs were cut off from about $600 million in U.S. family planning funds and more than $11 billion in U.S. global health aid between 2017 and 2018 alone, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress. The money — much of it intended for Africa — covered efforts such as preventing malaria and tuberculosis, providing water and sanitation, and distributing health information and contraception, which might also have repercussions for HIV prevention. Women’s health advocates are 'uneasy' following Trump’s victory, said Pester Siraha, director of Population Services Zimbabwe, an affiliate of MSI Reproductive Choices, an NGO that supports abortion rights in 36 countries. The policy stipulates that foreign NGOs that receive U.S government funding must agree to stop abortion-related activities, including discussing it as a family planning option — even when they are using non-U.S. government funds for such activities. During Trump's first term, MSI did not agree to those conditions, effectively making it ineligible for U.S government funding. Siraha said that a blueprint offered to Trump by the conservative-leaning Heritage Foundation in its plan known as Project 2025 indicates that the new administration could enact 'a more comprehensive global gag rule.' Even NGOs in countries that outlaw abortion, such as Zimbabwe, are affected. Population Services Zimbabwe, for instance, closed its outreach clinics during Trump’s first term after losing funding due to its association with MSI Reproductive Choices. Such outreach clinics are often the only health care option for rural people with limited access to hospitals due to poverty or distance. 'It leaves women with no place to turn for help, even for information,' said Whitney Chinogwenya, global marketing manager at MSI Reproductive Choices. Some NGOs in other African countries such as Uganda, Ghana, Ethiopia, Kenya and South Africa rolled back services, including clinics, contraception, training and support for government and community health workers, as well as programs for young people, sex workers and LGBTIQ+ communities. Other services shut down entirely. The risk of unplanned pregnancies, unsafe abortions and related deaths increased in many of the affected countries, according to the U.S.-based Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights. Chinogwenya, the MSI Reproductive Choices marketing manager, said her organization’s donor income dropped by $120 million during Trump’s first term. The money would have provided 8 million women globally with family planning help, preventing 6 million unintended pregnancies, 1.8 million unsafe abortions and 20,000 pregnancy-related deaths, she said. The gag-rule policy 'leads to more unintended, unwanted, unsupportable pregnancies and therefore an increase in abortion,' said Catriona Macleod, a professor of psychology at South Africa’s Rhodes University. 'This legislation does not protect life … it’s been called America’s deadly export,' said Macleod, who heads the university’s studies in sexuality and reproduction. Trump's transition team did not respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press. Damage isn’t always easy to repair President Joe Biden rescinded the gag-rule policy in 2021, resulting in Population Services Zimbabwe receiving $9 million, about 50% of its donor funding, from USAID in 2023. 'But we haven’t regained all the loss we suffered,' said Siraha, the organization’s director. 'You need a minimum of five years to have an impact. If we then have another gap of five years, it means we are reversing all the gains,' she said. Her organization estimates that 1.3 million women could lose out on the care they need in Zimbabwe, leading to an additional 461,000 unintended pregnancies and 1,400 maternal deaths if the gag rule is reinstated. Overseas aid budget cuts by other Western governments will make it harder to find alternative funding, Siraha said. Forced into difficult choices MSI Reproductive Choices is lobbying world leaders and alternative donors to fight for abortion rights. 'Trump’s reelection may embolden the anti-choice movement, but the fight for women’s reproductive rights is nonnegotiable,' Chinogwenya said. However, agencies that rely heavily or entirely on U.S funding might have little choice but 'to quiet their guidelines on access to abortion' to qualify for funding, said Denise Horn, an international relations and civil society expert at Bryant University in Rhode Island. In South Africa, where abortion is mostly legal, some NGOs, especially those without alternative funding, stopped openly discussing abortion as an option or changed their guidelines and the information they share publicly, according to an assessment by South Africa’s Rhodes University and the International Women’s Health Coalition, a New York-based NGO. 'Organizations thus have to evaluate what is most important: the non-abortion work they will still be able to do or the principle of pro-choice,' read part of the 2019 assessment report. 'Ultimately, these organizations will have to make this difficult decision.' The long lines of women at the outreach clinic in Zimbabwe’s Epworth settlement underline the dire need for family planning services in impoverished communities. Engeline Mukanya, 30, said she is already struggling to support her three children with the $100 she earns monthly from plaiting women’s hair. Nurses inserted a birth-control implant in her left arm to protect her from pregnancy for the next five years. Like many here, she cannot afford private providers who charge $20 to $60. 'It’s unfortunate that we are so far away from America yet we are being caught in the crossfire of its politics,' she said. 'All we want is the freedom to space our births.'	https://apnews.com/article/trump-victory-gag-rule-women-abortion-a462faf01e298a105be8d7f4ff46db68	2024-11-19T20:00:06-08:00	
Stock market today: Asian markets mostly lower as worries over Russia-Ukraine war loom	HONG KONG (AP) — Asian stocks were mostly lower on Tuesday, despite gains on Wall Street, as worries mounted over escalations in the Russia-Ukraine war. U.S. futures edged higher while oil prices were little changed. On Tuesday, Ukraine fired several American-supplied longer-range missiles into Russia, according to the official, marking the first such use in nearly 1,000 days of war. On the same day, Russian President Vladimir Putin formally lowered the threshold for Russia’s use of its nuclear weapons. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 slipped 0.2% to 38,352.34 after the Finance Ministry reported the country recorded a trade deficit in October, for a fourth straight month. Exports rose 3.1% from a year earlier as a weak yen and the rising price of energy kept import costs high. A trade deficit occurs when the country is importing more goods and services than it is exporting. Shares of Seven &amp; i Holdings Co., the company that owns over 80,000 7-Eleven convenience stores worldwide, soared 8.4% on Wednesday after local media reported that the founding family plans to raise over 8 trillion yen ($51.66 billion) to take the company private within this financial year. China's central bank announced it will keep its benchmark lending rates unchanged after it cut its one-year lending rate to 3.1% in October. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng edged 0.1% higher to 19,687.10, and the Shanghai Composite gained 0.1% to 3,979.15. Australia’s S&amp;P/ASX 200 dipped 0.6% to 8,326.30. South Korea’s Kospi added 0.4% to 2,482.29. On Tuesday, the S&amp;P 500 rose 0.4% to 5,916.98 after erasing an early drop of 0.7%. The Nasdaq composite also shook off an early loss to turn 1% higher to 18,987.47, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.3% to 43,268.94. Nvidia’s 4.9% climb accounted for most of the index’s gain. The chip company’s stock rallied ahead of its profit report for the latest quarter, which is coming later Wednesday, and vaulted its gain for the year to nearly 197% thanks to the craze around artificial-intelligence technology. The worries on the Ukraine-Russia conflict sent investors into U.S. Treasury bonds, which are seen as some of the world’s safest investments. The rise in their prices in turn lowered their yields, and the 10-year Treasury yield fell to 4.39% from 4.41% late Monday. Gold also rose 0.6% and recovered some of the losses it sustained following Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. presidential election, as investors herded into places traditionally considered safer during times of trouble. Walmart climbed 3% after topping forecasts for both profit and revenue. The nation’s biggest retailer said it saw broad-based strength across its categories, including sales made both online and in stores. It also said it served more upper-income households, while raising its forecasts for sales and profit for the full year. Lowe’s likewise delivered bigger profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected, but its stock nevertheless dropped 4.6%. A report in the morning said construction crews broke ground on fewer new homes last month than economists expected, and rival Home Depot slipped 0.9%. Other big companies set to report their latest quarterly results this week include Target on Wednesday and Deere &amp; Co. on Thursday. In other dealings early Wednesday, benchmark U.S. crude oil edged 15 cents higher to $69.39 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard, added 10 cents to $73.41 per barrel. The dollar rose to 155.47 Japanese yen from 154.54 yen.

Argentina's Milei pivots to pragmatism in first talks with China's Xi after shaking up the G20	LA PAZ, Boliva (AP) — Last year, then-presidential candidate Javier Milei declared Argentina would not 'make deals with communists' in China or Brazil, calling their leaders 'murderers' and 'thieves' in a bid to channel the populist energies of Donald Trump and other global far-right icons into a winning political message. But Tuesday, President Milei found himself at the Group of 20 summit in Rio de Janeiro shaking hands with Chinese President Xi Jinping and vowing to boost trade with the Asian powerhouse, a day after his economy minister signed a preliminary agreement to export Argentine natural gas to Brazil. Milei even acquiesced to a joint declaration endorsed by world leaders late Monday despite his earlier attempts to play spoiler to the G20 host, Brazil’s left-wing president Luiz Inácio 'Lula' da Silva who was once called by Milei a 'corrupt communist.' The final moments of the summit revealed Milei's more pragmatic streak, coming as a surprise after the irascible president sought to undercut various international initiatives — withdrawing Argentine negotiators from the U.N. climate summit, casting the only 'no' votes on two U.N. resolutions, one supporting Indigenous rights and another advocating for an end to violence against women, and roiling negotiations at the G20 summit. Argentina has also dramatically reshaped its foreign policy in line with its hard-right allies in Italy — with Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni headed to Buenos Aires on Tuesday to spend more time with Milei — and in Israel. On Tuesday, Andrea Tenenti, a spokesperson for the U.N. peacekeeping mission operating along Lebanon's southern border, told reporters in Geneva that Argentina had decided to withdraw its peacekeepers from the force, known as UNIFIL. He did not say why, but Israel has repeatedly requested that peacekeepers leave the area since the military's Oct. 1 invasion of southern Lebanon. Despite Israeli attacks on peacekeepers, UNIFIL has vowed to stay put and none of the other 47 troop-contributing countries has pulled out. In the past few days, Argentine resistance to the joint G20 communiqué focused on clauses related to the taxation of the super-rich and regulation of online speech, diplomats said. Argentine delegates also sought to block language about gender equality and references to the U.N. 2030 agenda on sustainable development, which Milei has decried as socialist. Critics in Rio saw the Argentine president as a saboteur. Supporters back home cheered Milei as a leader of the 'new world disorder.' Fresh off a trip to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida where he ranted against socialism and rubbed shoulders with the president-elect and tech billionaire Elon Musk, Milei initially seemed immune to such concerns in Rio. Milei's office issued a harsh statement citing his objections to the G20 declaration. But the president ultimately signed onto it under enormous international pressure. 'Argentina is not a great power and it is in a very difficult situation economically,' said Roberto Goulart Menezes, a professor of international relations at the University of Brasilia. That pressure, he added, was 'enough for Argentina to finally reduce its opposition.' During Milei's first-ever meeting with Xi on Tuesday, the leaders discussed their 'current trade and financial ties' and 'desire to continue exploring new opportunities to expand and improve,' the Argentine presidency said in a statement, along with a photo of the presidents sharing a warm handshake. It said the leaders had invited each other to visit. With Argentina highly reliant on China as a market for its soybeans and other crops, the cordial tone made clear that the crisis-stricken South American nation has no desire for relations with its second-largest trading partner and crucial source of financing to further deteriorate. A statement from China's foreign ministry said Xi expressed his appreciation for Milei's 'willingness to continue deepening bilateral cooperation.' China has maintained strategic assets in Argentina, including stakes in lithium mines and a space station in Patagonia. Earlier this year, former Foreign Minister Diana Mondino, whom Milei recently fired, led a successful visit to China to patch up relations strained by Milei's colorful insults ('Would you trade with an assassin?' he asked on the campaign trail last August, accusing China of killing dissidents). After Mondino's trip, Beijing in June resumed a currency swap deal worth billions of dollars that boosted Argentina’s depleted reserves. On Monday, as negotiations over the G20 draft grew increasingly tense, Argentine Economy Minister Luis Caputo and Brazilian Energy Minister Alexandre Silveira signed a memorandum of understanding that offered a new and important source of income to cash-strapped Argentina. The agreement to work toward shipping 30 million cubic meters of natural gas to Brazil from Argentina’s Vaca Muerta, a vast shale oil and gas field in Patagonia, over the next five years, 'might have helped' Milei sign the joint G20 statement, Silveira told reporters. But it did nothing to dispel the chill between the leaders of South America's largest economies, who have opposite views on climate change, social issues and the role of governments. A set of official photographs that splashed across the front pages of local newspapers Tuesday showed Lula and other government leaders clasping hands amicably in sharp contrast to the Brazilian leader's photo-op with Milei — both men standing stiffly apart despite protocol demanding they shake hands, looking like they’d rather be anywhere else in the world. Some fear that Trump's election has further emboldened Milei and other far-right political figures to abandon U.N. commitments and ambitious multilateral agreements on issues like climate change. 'Milei has already taken a pro-Trump stance, thinking ... that the G20 could be emptied by President Trump,' said Goulart Menezes, the international relations expert. Yet, he cautioned that 'making Argentina’s foreign policy conditional on the future president of the United States' carries risks. 'Argentina is putting itself in a position of international isolation,' he said. Indeed, at the traditional G20 family photo — taken for a second time Tuesday because U.S. President Joe Biden and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau failed to show up to the first — Milei was the only leader missing from the lineup. There would be no third attempt. ___ Associated Press reporters Debora Rey in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Eléonore Hughes and Mauricio Savarese in Rio de Janeiro contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/milei-xi-president-argentina-economy-g20-lula-trump-biden-brazil-china-bf0598ba508f9d9da24cce52eaa1a82d	2024-11-19T17:11:39-08:00	
Japan records a trade deficit in October for a 4th straight month, despite export recovery	TOKYO (AP) — Japan racked up a trade deficit in October for a fourth straight month as a weak yen and rising energy prices kept import costs high. The trade deficit, which amounts to a nation’s imports subtracted from its exports, totaled 461 billion yen ($3 billion) last month, the Finance Ministry reported Wednesday. Exports grew 3.1% in October from a year earlier, picking up pace over recent months, as shipments of equipment for semiconductor production increased. But imports, up 0.4% from a year earlier, were still bigger than exports. A major uncertainty over trade is looming because of the reelection of Donald Trump as U.S. president, in part because he favors sharp increases in tariffs. Exports are a chief engine of growth for Japan, the home of Toyota Motor Corp., although such manufacturers have moved production and investment abroad. New Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has been busy meeting the leaders of Asian nations, as well as Europe and South America, to forge economic and trade relations, as well as security ties. Ishiba, who has yet to meet Trump, was recently in Brazil for the Group of 20 summit. A weakening currency, which tends to accompany trailing growth, is another worry for Japan. The U.S. dollar has been trading at about 155 Japanese yen recently, up from 140-yen levels a year ago. Inflation and rising energy prices are pushing up import costs, while slowing global demand dampens exports. But the recent fall in overseas demand is believed to be partly due to temporary disruptions like a typhoon, while the drop in exports is related to auto production disruptions in Japan. By region, exports rose to the rest of Asia, including Singapore and Hong Kong. Exports to the U.S. slipped slightly. ___ Yuri Kageyama is on Threads: https://www.threads.net/@yurikageyama	https://apnews.com/article/japan-economy-trade-imports-exports-energy-d186be06dcf195a2a4a05abd551c8a33	2024-11-19T16:38:55-08:00	
Former Hong Kong publisher Jimmy Lai begins to testify in his national security trial	HONG KONG (AP) — Former Hong Kong publisher Jimmy Lai testified he met with then-Vice President Mike Pence and then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo during Hong Kong’s anti-government protests in 2019 but told the court at his landmark national security trial Wednesday that he did not ask the U.S. officials to take action. Lai, founder of the now-shuttered Apple Daily pro-democracy newspaper, was arrested in 2020 in the crackdown that followed the protests. He is accused of colluding with foreign forces to endanger national security and conspiring with others to issue seditious publications. If convicted, he faces up to life in prison. He testified about his meetings with U.S. officials and gave details about his alleged overseas political connections with people in the U.S., Britain and Taiwan, including ex-Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen and Hong Kong’s last British governor, Chris Patten. But the media tycoon who also describes himself as a businessman and social activist said he never tried to influence foreign policy on Hong Kong or China through the people he met overseas or ask them to take action against them. Lai’s case is widely seen as a measure of press freedom and judicial independence in the Asian financial hub. Lai testified in English that he asked Pence to voice his support for Hong Kong but not for the U.S. government to take any action, saying, 'It’s beyond me.' During the same trip to the U.S., Lai also met with Pompeo and discussed the situation in Hong Kong with him, noting it was a similar conversation to the one he had with Pence, he testified. When Lai’s lawyer, Steven Kwan, asked him whether he had requested the U.S. to do something, Lai said not to do something but 'to say something.' Beijing promised to retain the former British colony’s civil liberties for 50 years when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997. But critics say that promise has become threadbare under the rubric of maintaining national security. Authorities have used a Beijing-imposed national security law to prosecute many of Hong Kong’s leading activists, including Lai and 45 democracy advocates who were sentenced to several years in prison on Tuesday. Other pro-democracy figures were forced into self-exile or silenced. Dozens of civil society groups have disbanded under the threat of the law. Beijing and Hong Kong governments insist that the law restored stability to the city following the 2019 protests. Prosecutors have alleged that Lai asked foreign countries, especially the United States, to take actions against Beijing 'under the guise of fighting for freedom and democracy.' They pointed to Lai’s meetings with Pence, Pompeo and U.S. senators in July 2019 to discuss a now-withdrawn extradition bill that sparked the massive anti-government protests. They allege that Lai sought support from the U.S. in sanctioning mainland Chinese and Hong Kong leaders who cracked down on the movement. Dozens of people stood in the rain to secure a seat in the courtroom, including former Apple Daily reader William Wong, who said he wanted to remind Lai that Hong Kongers have not forgotten him. 'I haven’t seen him for a few months. I know he will testify himself, so I want to encourage him,' said Wong, 64. Upon entering the court, Lai waved and smiled at his family members, who sat next to the city’s Roman Catholic Cardinal Joseph Zen. During the hearing, Lai said he had introduced former U.S. officials Paul Wolfowitz and Jack Keane to Taiwan’s former President Tsai Ing-wen — whom he knew before she became the island’s leader. It was because Tsai wanted to know more about the thinking of then-President Donald Trump’s administration back then, he said. Lai said she knew he was 'supportive of Trump' and she thought he knew a lot about the U.S. because of his links with U.S. think tanks. But he never communicated with Trump, he said. He said he wanted to help Taiwan to know how to better deal with the U.S. because the island was the only democracy of Chinese people. But Lai rejected the idea of Hong Kong independence, saying it was a 'crazy' idea and he never allowed his staff or the newspaper to mention it. He said he broke into the media world because 'to participate in delivering freedom' was a very good idea for him. 'The more you know, the more you are free,' he said. He said the core values of Apple Daily were the core values of the people of Hong Kong, including the rule of law, freedom and the pursuit of democracy. In May 2020, a month before the security took effect, Lai took up the role of executive chairman of Next Digital, the parent company of Apple Daily. 'I think it’s right for me to take up the responsibility of the company if anything happens to it as an owner,' he said. The American and British governments and a group of independent United Nations human rights experts have called for Lai’s release. Trump was asked on a podcast before his reelection this month whether he would talk to Chinese President Xi Jinping to seek Lai’s release, and he replied: 'One hundred percent, I will get him out.' Hong Kong leader John Lee said mutual respect is important for the development of trade relations and there should be no interference in local affairs. Beijing also criticized some U.S. lawmakers for supporting Lai. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer also raised concerns over Lai’s detention to Xi in a meeting during the Group of 20 summit in Brazil. Hong Kong’s security minister Chris Tang maintained the prosecution was based on facts. Lai’s son, Sebastien Lai, said on Friday that his father’s treatment in prison is 'inhumane.' 'My father is now 77 and has spent nearly four years in a maximum-security prison in solitary confinement,' he said in the statement released by Britain-based law firm Doughty Street Chambers. On Sunday, the Hong Kong government condemned some members of the law firm for what it called spreading misinformation. It said the separation of Lai from other inmates 'has been made at his own request' and was approved by prison authorities. It added judges remain independent and partial when handling national security cases. On the eve of the court hearing, some U.S. lawmakers gathered with the younger Lai in a restaurant near the U.S. Capitol in Washington in a show of support for the publisher. ___ Associated Press writer Didi Tang in Washington contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/hong-kong-jimmy-lai-national-security-trial-4364ca9635ff2d6601cdbd172ff94fdb	2024-11-19T16:03:49-08:00	
Congo accuses rebel group of 'ethnic cleansing' in country's east	KINSHASA, Congo (AP) — Congo's government on Tuesday accused the Rwanda-backed M23 rebel group of 'ethnic cleansing' in the central African nation’s east. The minister of the interior, Jacquemain Shabani, denounced the 'massive arrival of foreign populations' in the territories of Rutshuru and Masisi in North Kivu province, where locals were 'expelled by violence.' 'This is what constitutes ethnic cleansing,' Shabani said. Congo’s accusation comes after M23 last week appointed administrators in the areas it claims to control. More than 100 armed groups have been vying for a foothold in mineral-rich eastern Congo near the border with Rwanda. The violence has escalated as the M23 rebel group has reemerged. The conflict has created one of the world’s largest humanitarian crises, with more than 7 million people displaced, many beyond the reach of aid. M23, or the March 23 Movement, is a rebel military group mainly made up of ethnic Tutsis who broke away from the Congolese army just over a decade ago. The group rose to prominence in 2012 when its fighters seized Goma, eastern Congo’s largest city on the border with Rwanda. Congo alleges that Rwanda has been involved in war crimes in the east, and U.S. and U.N. experts accuse it of giving military backing to M23. Rwanda denies the claim, but in February admitted that it has troops and missile systems in eastern Congo to safeguard its security, pointing to a buildup of Congolese forces near the border. U.N. experts estimate there are up to 4,000 Rwandan forces in Congo. A July truce brokered by the United States and Angola has reduced the fighting between Rwandan and Congolese forces, but fighting between M23 and other militias continues. In August, clashes between the rebels and pro-government militias killed 16 villagers in a violation of the truce to help millions displaced.	https://apnews.com/article/congo-rebel-group-m23-ethnic-cleansing-2b3bfa6357fca88804e865db7912377b	2024-11-19T12:58:48-08:00	
US-Israel panel to look into civilian harm in Gaza is set for first meeting next month	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration says a U.S.-Israel panel to look into reports of civilian harm from the war in Gaza will meet for the first time in early December, missing by more than a month a U.S. call for the channel to be set up by the end of October. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Tuesday that the upcoming meeting had been agreed to after much discussion between U.S. and Israeli officials on specific incidents and reports of civilian casualties involving American-made or -supplied weapons. 'The purpose of this channel is to inform the ongoing work that the State Department has to make assessments about the use of U.S.-provided weapons,' Miller told reporters. 'It’s to gather information about incidents that have been raised that are cause of concern or cause of questions.' He said the information gathered through that channel will inform U.S. policy decisions about any response to potential violations of international humanitarian law in the conflict that has been raging since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel, which led to its retaliatory offensives in Gaza. Experts say famine may already have set in in northern Gaza, where Israel has been waging a weekslong offensive that has killed hundreds of people and driven tens of thousands from their homes. In October, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin sent a letter to top Israeli officials warning them that the Biden administration might limit the provision of some U.S. weapons systems to Israel, a close ally, if action to improve humanitarian conditions was not taken within 30 days. That deadline expired last week with no decisions being made on military aid and officials saying that Israel had taken some positive steps but was still not meeting the criteria for improvements laid out in the letter. Aid groups say the situation in Gaza has actually deteriorated instead of improved and urged the U.S. to respond accordingly. The theft in Gaza over the weekend of nearly 100 trucks loaded with food and other much-needed humanitarian aid sent prices soaring and caused shortages in central Gaza, where most of the population of 2.3 million people have fled and where hundreds of thousands are crammed into squalid tent camps. Miller said reports of such incidents demonstrated a breakdown in law and order in Gaza and underscored the need to end the fighting and restore functioning governance to the territory. 'You are not going to fully, finally solve this problem without an end to the war and the establishment of a new governance and security authority inside Gaza, because ultimately that is the problem,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-gaza-humanitarian-aid-76220814c1772a3f021a5fe596498795	2024-11-19T12:54:14-08:00	
US will send Ukraine at least $275 million in new weapons in push to bolster Kyiv before Trump	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Pentagon will send Ukraine at least $275 million in new weapons, including an undisclosed number of antipersonnel land mines, as the Biden administration rushes to do as much as it can to help Kyiv fight back against Russia before President-elect Donald Trump takes office. The latest tranche of weapons comes as worries grow about an escalation in the conflict, with both sides pushing to gain any advantage they can exploit if Trump demands a quick end to the war — as he has vowed to do. 'We will continue to provide Ukraine the support it needs to succeed on the battlefield and prevail in its defense against Russia’s aggression,' Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement. In rapid succession this week, President Joe Biden gave Ukraine the authority to fire longer-range missiles deeper into Russia and said it would provide the antipersonnel land mines. Russian President Vladimir Putin also formally lowered the threshold for using nuclear weapons. U.S. officials contend that Russia’s change in nuclear doctrine was expected, but Moscow is warning that Ukraine's new use of the Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS, inside Russia on Tuesday could trigger a strong response. One American official said the U.S. is seeing no indications that Russia is preparing to use a nuclear weapon in Ukraine. Asked Tuesday if a Ukrainian attack with longer-range U.S. missiles could potentially trigger use of nuclear weapons, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov answered affirmatively. Another U.S. official said Ukraine fired about eight ATACMS missiles into Russia on Tuesday and just two were intercepted. The official said the U.S. is still assessing the damage but the missiles struck an ammunition supply location in Karachev, in the Bryansk region. The U.S. officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence. The weapons in the new package of aid for Ukraine include, for the first time, antipersonnel land mines that are 'not-persistent' — meaning they are electrically fused and powered by batteries. As a result, once the battery runs out, they will no longer detonate, unlike the ones used by Russia, which do not become inert and remain a threat to civilians for decades. Also in the new aid package will be an infusion of air defense, including munitions for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), as well as 155mm and 105mm artillery rounds, Javelin anti-armor munitions, drones, and other equipment and spare parts. The weapons will be provided through presidential drawdown authority, which allows the Pentagon quickly to pull supplies from its shelves to speed them to Ukraine’s front line. Trump’s upcoming move to the White House has triggered a scramble by the Biden administration to ensure all the congressionally approved funding for Ukraine gets delivered and that Kyiv is in a strong position going into the winter. The Biden administration would have to rush $7.1 billion in weapons from the Pentagon’s stockpiles to spend all of those funds before Trump is sworn in. That includes $4.3 billion from a foreign aid bill passed by Congress earlier this year and $2.8 billion still on the books in savings due to the Pentagon recalculating the value of systems sent. Asked if the department can get that done before Jan. 20, when Trump takes office, Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said officials are working to get Ukraine what it needs. 'We are committed to using that full authority that Congress has allotted to us,' Singh said. 'The only way we can do that also is to make sure that our shelves are fully backfilled and stocked. So as our shelves continue to get stocked with equipment and capabilities that are needed, we draw down from those and send those to Ukraine.' In addition to the weapons in the Pentagon drawdown, the State Department said Tuesday that it had authorized the sale to Ukraine of $100 million in unspecified defense equipment and services, including vehicle refurbishment, technical assistance, training and 'other related elements of logistics and program support.' In contrast to the drawdown, the government of Ukraine will pay for those supplies. As part of the wider effort to boost Ukraine, the administration also is on track to disperse its portion of a $50 billion loan to Ukraine, backed by frozen Russian assets, before Biden leaves the White House, according to two senior administration officials. The officials, who were not authorized to comment publicly, said the U.S. and Ukraine are now in 'advanced stages' in discussing terms of the loan and are looking to complete the process for the $20 billion portion of the mammoth loan that the U.S. is backing. The goal is to get it done before the end of the year, one official said. The remaining $30 billion will come from the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada and Japan, among others. Trump has criticized U.S. support for Ukraine and derided Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a 'salesman' while also praising Putin and touting his good relationship with him. The president-elect has claimed — without explaining how — that he will end the war in in Ukraine before his inauguration on Jan. 20, saying he will 'get it resolved very quickly.' Last week, when he addressed supporters from a golden ballroom at a his Mar-a-Lago resort, Trump returned to that pledge but again offered little information before changing the subject. 'We’re going to work very hard on Russia and Ukraine. It’s got to stop. Russia and Ukraine’s gotta stop,' he said. He has suggested that Ukraine give up at least some of its Russian-occupied territory to settle the war, saying at a rally in late September that 'if they made a bad deal, it would’ve been much better. They would’ve given up a little bit and everybody would be living and every building would be built and every tower would be aging for another 2,000 years.' ____ Associated Press writers Aamer Madhani in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Michelle L.

US recognizes Venezuela's opposition candidate as president-elect months after the disputed election	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — The U.S. government recognized Venezuelan opposition candidate Edmundo González as the 'president-elect' of the South American country on Tuesday, months after President Nicolás Maduro claimed to have won the July election. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken recognized González in a post on X in which he also demanded 'respect for the will' of Venezuelan voters. The administration of U.S. President Joe Biden has said González earned the most votes in the disputed July 28 election but has fallen short of acknowledging him as president-elect. Venezuela’s National Electoral Council, which is stacked with Maduro loyalists, declared Maduro the election winner hours after polls closed. Unlike previous presidential elections, electoral authorities did not provide detailed vote counts. But the opposition coalition collected tally sheets from 80% of the nation’s electronic voting machines and posted them online. González and opposition leader Maria Corina Machado said the voting records showed the former diplomat won the election with twice as many votes as Maduro. 'We deeply appreciate the recognition of the sovereign will of all Venezuelans,' González said in a post on X shortly after Blinken's statement Tuesday. 'This gesture honors the desire for change of our people and the civic feat that we carried out together on July 28.' González left Venezuela in September for exile in Spain after a warrant was issued for his arrest in connection with an investigation into the publishing of the vote tally sheets. Venezuela's Foreign Minister Yván Gil responded to Blinken's comment with personal attacks. 'In the last days of his government, he should dedicate himself to reflecting on his failures, getting rid of imperial and colonial complexes and going to write the memoirs of how the Bolivarian Revolution made him bite the dust of defeat, just like his predecessors,' Gil said of Blinken in a statement, which did not mention election results. Maduro and electoral authorities have rejected repeated calls from the U.S., the European Union, Colombia, Brazil and other nations to show the detailed vote records that back up the president's reelection. Swift condemnation of the lack of post-election transparency prompted Maduro to ask Venezuela’s Supreme Tribunal of Justice, whose members are aligned with the ruling party, to audit the results. The high court reaffirmed his victory. Experts from the United Nations and the U.S.-based Carter Center, which observed the election at the invitation of Maduro’s government, determined the results announced by electoral authorities lacked credibility. The U.N. experts stopped short of validating the opposition’s claim to victory but said the faction’s voting records published online appear to exhibit all of the original security features. Earlier in the week, Colombia’s President Gustavo Petro, who has friendly relations with Maduro, reversed his support for the July elections, calling the vote a 'mistake.' Petro spoke in an interview with Brazilian news outlet Globo News, which released excerpts online that Petro’s office shared Tuesday on social media. Petro told the news outlet Monday while visiting Brazil for the G20 summit that he initially was in favor of Venezuela holding the elections, but that he later decided that the vote was not 'free.' 'I think the elections were a mistake,' Petro said. His office did not immediately respond to a request for him to elaborate on the reasons for his change of heart. Petro, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and then-Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador — all leftists friendly with Maduro — attempted to make peace as the results came under dispute, but the effort went nowhere. Venezuela’s next presidential term begins Jan. 10. Maduro has already received an invitation from the ruling party-controlled National Assembly for a swearing-in ceremony. ___ Garcia Cano reported from Mexico City.

The Kremlin has revised its nuclear policy. Does that make the use of atomic weapons more likely?	The 4-year-old document has a bland, bureaucratic title — 'Basic Principles of State Policy on Nuclear Deterrence' — but its contents are chilling, especially with its newest revisions. Better known as Russia's nuclear doctrine, the revamped version that was signed Tuesday by President Vladimir Putin spells out the circumstances that allow him to use Moscow's atomic arsenal, the world's largest. This new version lowers the bar, giving him that option in response to even a conventional attack backed by a nuclear power. That possibly could include the use of U.S.-supplied ATACMS missiles by Ukraine to hit Russian territory — which Moscow says happened Tuesday when six missiles hit the Bryansk region. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov emphasized that such strikes could potentially be a trigger for a nuclear response under the revised document. What is Russia’s nuclear doctrine? Its first iteration was signed by Putin in 2020, and he approved the latest version Tuesday, according to the Kremlin. It outlines when Russia could dip into its atomic arsenal. Since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, Putin and other Kremlin voices have frequently threatened the West with its nuclear arsenal. But that hasn't deterred Kyiv's allies from giving it billions of dollars of advanced weapons, some of which have hit Russian soil. The revamped document describes nuclear weapons as 'a means of deterrence,' noting their use is an 'extreme and compelled measure.' It declares that Russia 'takes all necessary efforts to reduce the nuclear threat and prevent aggravation of interstate relations that could trigger military conflicts, including nuclear ones.' Such nuclear deterrence is aimed at safeguarding the 'sovereignty and territorial integrity of the state,' deterring a potential aggressor, or, 'in case of a military conflict, preventing an escalation of hostilities and stopping them on conditions acceptable for the Russian Federation,' the document says. 'Nuclear deterrence is aimed to ensure that any potential adversary realizes the inevitability of retribution in case of an aggression against Russia and its allies,' it says. While formulated broadly to avoid a firm commitment of nuclear use and keep the West guessing at Moscow’s response, the modernized version spells out conditions under which Putin could use a nuclear option in response to a conventional strike. Changes in the doctrine have been in the works for months, and it's no coincidence that Tuesday's announcement of a new version follows by two days Washington's decision to allow Ukraine to use such longer-range missiles to hit targets in Russia. For months, U.S. President Joe Biden has been weighing the risks of such an escalation. What triggers a Russian nuclear response? The doctrine says Moscow could use nuclear weapons 'in response to the use of nuclear and other types of weapons of mass destruction' against Russia or its allies, as well as 'in the event of aggression' against Russia and Belarus with conventional weapons that threaten 'their sovereignty and/or territorial integrity.' Any aggression against Russia by a nonnuclear power with the 'participation or support of a nuclear power' will be seen as their 'joint attack' on Russia, the document says. It adds that nuclear weapons could be used in these scenarios: — If reliable information is received about the launch of ballistic missiles targeting the territory of Russia or its allies. — If nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction strike the territory of Russia or its allies, or are used to hit Russian military units or facilities abroad. — If an enemy's impact on critically important Russian government or military facilities could undermine retaliatory nuclear-strike capability. — If aggression against Russia or Belarus involving conventional weapons raises a critical threat to their sovereignty and territorial integrity. — If reliable information is received about the takeoff or launch of strategic and tactical aircraft, cruise missiles, drones, hypersonic or other flying vehicles and their crossing the Russian border. The president can inform military and political leaders of other countries or international organizations 'about the readiness to use nuclear weapons,' or that he has already decided to use them. Is the use of nuclear weapons imminent? Even before signing the revamped doctrine, Putin warned the U.S. and its NATO allies against allowing Ukraine to strike Russia with Western-supplied longer-range missiles, saying it would put Russia and NATO at war. Asked Tuesday if such a Ukrainian attack could potentially trigger a nuclear response, Peskov answered affirmatively. He pointed to the doctrine's provision that opens the door after a conventional strike that raises critical threats for Russia's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Peskov also emphasized the doctrine's new section that describes an attack by any country supported by a nuclear power as their joint aggression against Russia. Tatiana Stanovaya of the Carnegie Russia and Eurasia Center noted that Peskov's comment marked the first time the Kremlin explicitly acknowledged 'the potential use of nuclear weapons as a response to strikes on Russian territory using long-range missiles.' 'Put simply, Peskov openly admits that the Kremlin is currently considering the possibility of a nuclear strike,' she said. While the doctrine envisions a possible nuclear response by Russia, it is formulated broadly to avoid a firm commitment to use nuclear weapons and keep Putin’s options open. The U.S. has seen no change to Russia’s nuclear posture, according to a U.S. National Security Council official who was not authorized to comment publicly and requested anonymity. As a result, the Biden administration has 'not seen any reason to adjust our own nuclear posture or doctrine in response to Russia’s statements today,' the official added. Jack Watling, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute defense and security think tank in the U.K., said the use of Western longer-range missiles 'certainly will not' trigger Moscow's nuclear response as some in the West feared. But he added that 'Russia can escalate in a range of ways to impose costs on the West, from undersea sabotage to the employment of proxies to harass trade in the Bab el-Mandeb,' a strait off the Red Sea where attacks on shipping have been attributed to Yemen's Houthi rebels. Dmitry Medvedev, deputy head of Russia's Security Council that is chaired by Putin, was even more blunt. Ukraine's use of NATO missiles for strikes on Russian territory 'could be classified as an attack by bloc countries on Russia,' he said. 'In such a scenario, Russia reserves the right to retaliate with weapons of mass destruction against Kyiv and key NATO facilities, wherever they may be located,' he said. 'This would amount to World War III.' Stanovaya said 'the current situation offers Putin a significant temptation to escalate' and marks 'an extraordinarily dangerous juncture.' 'Putin may seek to present the West with two stark choices: ‘Do you want a nuclear war? You will have it,’ or ‘Let’s end this war on Russia’s terms,’' she posted on X. That would not interfere with any possible peace initiatives but could reinforce U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's argument for direct dialogue with Putin, she said. 'Simultaneously, it would expose Biden to criticism for being the catalyst of the escalation while potentially discouraging Ukraine from further using long-range missiles,' Stanovaya added. —- Aamer Madhani in Washington and Danica Kirka in London contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-nuclear-doctrine-putin-ukraine-war-b5ee115aa2099fa247f630e16da861d8	2024-11-19T08:04:10-08:00	
Iran defies international pressure, increasing its stockpile of near weapons-grade uranium, UN says	VIENNA (AP) — Iran has defied international demands to rein in its nuclear program and has increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, according to a confidential report by the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog seen Tuesday by The Associated Press. The report by the International Atomic Energy Agency said that as of Oct. 26, Iran has 182.3 kilograms (401.9 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60%, an increase of 17.6 kilograms (38.8 pounds) since the last report in August. Uranium enriched at 60% purity is just a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. The IAEA also estimated in its quarterly report that as of Oct. 26, Iran’s overall stockpile of enriched uranium stands at 6,604.4 kilograms (14,560 pounds), an increase of 852.6 kilograms (1,879.6 pounds) since August. Under the IAEA’s definition, around 42 kilograms (92.5 pounds) of uranium enriched to 60% purity is the amount at which creating one atomic weapon is theoretically possible — if the material is enriched further, to 90%. The reports come at a critical time as Israel and Iran have traded missile attacks in recent months after more than a year of war in Gaza, which is governed by Hamas, a group supported by Iran. Adding to the complexity, Donald Trump’s reelection raises questions about whether and how the incoming administration and Iran may engage. Trump’s first term in office was marked by a particularly troubled period, when he pursued a policy of 'maximum pressure' against Tehran. He unilaterally withdrew America from Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers, leading to sanctions hobbling the economy and ordered the killing of the country’s top general. Western diplomats consider censuring Iran Iran last week offered not to expand its stockpile of uranium enriched up to 60%, during a visit to Tehran by the IAEA chief, Rafael Mariano Grossi. The IAEA said during the meetings that 'the possibility of Iran not further expanding its stockpile of uranium enriched up to 60% U-235 was discussed, including technical verification measures necessary for the Agency to confirm this, if implemented.' The report said that one day after Grossi left Iran, on Nov. 16, IAEA inspectors verified that 'Iran had begun implementation of preparatory measures aimed at stopping the increase of its stockpile of uranium enriched up to 60 % U-235' at its underground nuclear sites in Fordow and Natanz. The reports come ahead of this week’s regular IAEA Board of Governors meeting in Vienna. A senior western diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter, confirmed to the AP that the United Kingdom, France and Germany, with the support from the U.S., are going ahead with a resolution at this week’s IAEA Board of Governors meeting, censuring Iran for its lack of cooperation, leading to potential confrontation with Iran ahead of Trump’s return to the White House. 'We remain tightly coordinated with our E3 partners (France, Germany and UK) in advance of the IAEA Board of Governors meeting. And, we strongly support efforts to hold Iran accountable,' U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters Tuesday in Washington. 'The Iranian regime continues to amass a growing stockpile of highly enriched uranium for which there is no credible civilian purpose and they continue to not cooperate fully with the IAEA,' he added. A senior diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, said it is possible that the commitments made by Iran during the IAEA’s chief visit may not stand in case a resolution is passed. In the past, Iran has responded to resolutions by the IAEA Board of Governors by further enhancing its nuclear program. Iran has maintained its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only, but Grossi has previously warned that Tehran has enough uranium enriched to near-weapons-grade levels to make 'several' nuclear bombs if it chose to do so. He has acknowledged the U.N. agency cannot guarantee that none of Iran’s centrifuges may have been peeled away for clandestine enrichment. Iran’s mission at the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Little progress on improving ties The IAEA also reported that Iran has failed to take concrete steps as of now to improve cooperation, despite pleas by Grossi, who held talks last week with Mohammad Eslami of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and Iran’s reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian. However, Tuesday’s confidential report also said that during Grossi’s visit to Iran on Nov. 14, 'Iran agreed to respond to the Agency’s concerns related to Iran’s withdrawal of the designation of several experienced Agency inspectors by considering the acceptance of the designation of four additional experienced inspectors.' In September 2023, Iran barred some of the Vienna-based agency’s most experienced inspectors. The report also said there was no progress thus far in reinstalling more monitoring equipment, including cameras, removed in June 2022. Since then, the only recorded data comes from IAEA cameras installed at a centrifuge workshop in Isfahan in May 2023 — although Iran has not provided the IAEA with access to this data and inspectors have not been able to service the cameras. Last week, Eslami warned that Iran could retaliate if challenged at the upcoming IAEA board meeting. Grossi acknowledged some nations were considering taking action against Iran. In an effort to ensure Iran could not develop atomic weapons, world powers struck a deal with Tehran in 2015 under which it agreed to limit enrichment of uranium to levels necessary for nuclear power in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. U.N. inspectors were tasked with monitoring the program Under the original 2015 nuclear deal, Iran was allowed to enrich uranium only up to 3.67% purity, can maintain a stockpile of uranium of 300 kilograms and is permitted to use only very basic IR-1 centrifuges, machines that spin uranium gas at high speed for enrichment purposes. A year after the U.S. withdrawal from the deal under Trump, Iran started to gradually abandon all limits the deal put on its program and began enriching uranium to up to 60% purity.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-nuclear-iaea-grossi-enriched-uranium-weapon-0525819542521d5f89bd09008f42cb2f	2024-11-19T06:32:08-08:00	
The mausoleum holding Congo independence hero Lumumba's gold-capped tooth is vandalized	KINSHASA, Congo (AP) — Congo’s government says the mausoleum of assassinated independence leader Patrice Lumumba in the capital, Kinshasa, has been vandalized. It's not immediately clear whether Lumumba’s remains — a single gold-capped tooth — were damaged or stolen. A mausoleum curator told the national press agency that the coffin containing the tooth was broken Monday. The glass doors were smashed and four suspects were arrested, the deputy mayor of the neighborhood where the mausoleum is located told the country's main radio channel. He added that he couldn't confirm whether the tooth was stolen or not. It's not clear who was responsible for the act of vandalism, Congo's ministry of culture said in a statement Tuesday. The return of Lumumba’s tooth from former colonizer Belgium in 2022 had been celebrated around Congo, with the tooth taken around the vast country so people could pay their respects. Lumumba is widely hailed as the nationalist activist who helped to end colonial rule. He became Congo’s first prime minister and was seen as one of Africa’s most promising new leaders, but he was assassinated within a year in 1961. His body was dismembered and dissolved with acid in an apparent effort to keep any grave from becoming a pilgrimage site. For many in Congo, Lumumba is a symbol of the positive developments the country could have achieved after its independence. Instead, it became mired in decades of dictatorship that drained its vast mineral riches. Historians say Lumumba was a victim of the Cold War. He promoted leftist policies, and when he reached out to the Soviet Union for help in putting down a secessionist movement in the mineral-rich Katanga region, he fell out of favor with Belgium and the United States. A military coup toppled Lumumba, and he was arrested, jailed and later killed. His assassination, blamed on separatists, cleared the way for the rise of Mobutu Sese Seko, who ruled the country he later renamed Zaire for decades with support from Western powers until his death in 1997. Even though Lumumba’s killers were Congolese, questions have persisted over the complicity of Belgium and the United States because of his perceived Communist ties. His one remaining tooth was kept by the Belgian police commissioner who oversaw the destruction of his body. In 2016, the tooth was seized by Belgian officials from the police commissioner’s daughter. The tooth was returned to Congo after the visit of Belgium’s King Philippe, who expressed regrets for his nation’s abuses in Congo when it was a Belgian colony.	https://apnews.com/article/congo-lumumba-tooth-mausoleum-vandalized-383a9c9d7099a1f6d83e727667fd6c9e	2024-11-19T05:15:30-08:00	
Brazilian police arrest 5 officers in alleged 2022 coup plot to kill President Lula, others	SAO PAULO (AP) — Brazil ’s federal police arrested Tuesday five officers accused of plotting a coup that included plans to overthrow the government following the 2022 elections and kill then-President-elect Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, authorities said. The five also planned to kill Lula's running mate, Geraldo Alckmin, and Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes. The arrested included four special operations military personnel, one of whom is a retired brigadier general, and a federal police officer. The police said they also carried out three search warrants along with other measures, including seizing the suspects' passports and preventing them from contacting others. It was not clear when charges would be officially raised against the five suspects. 'The objective was to prevent the inauguration of the legitimately elected government and undermine the free exercise of democracy and the authority of Brazil’s judiciary,' de Moraes, who authorized the arrests, said of the plot in his order. 'These actions, peaking between November and December 2022, were part of a broader plan to carry out a coup d’état,' he added. Lula returned as Brazil’s president for a third, non-consecutive term after narrowly defeating far-right incumbent Jair Bolsonaro in October 2022. Bolsonaro, who frequently cast doubt on the election results without providing evidence and never conceded, left for the United States days before Lula’s January 2023 inauguration. In the aftermath of the elections, die-hard Bolsonaro supporters staged nationwide protests challenging the results, closing highways and camping outside military installations. That culminated in a Jan. 8, 2023 uprising, when thousands of demonstrators stormed government buildings in the capital of Brasilia a week after Lula’s inauguration, seeking to oust him from power. Retired Brig. Gen. Mário Fernandes, one of the officers arrested Tuesday, played a key role in linking these pro-Bolsonaro protest camps to Bolsonaro's Cabinet, according to details of the investigation that were included in the judge’s order and that were seen by The Associated Press. Fernandes served as interim general secretary in Bolsonaro’s Cabinet from October 2020 until the end of his term. Police said they found evidence that he outlined a plan to kill de Moraes, Lula and Alckmin and visited the protest camps outside military installations, including at the army headquarters in Brasilia. According to the police, there's evidence that Fernandes gave instructions and financial support to the protesters. Fernandes' plan, according to the document, also considered different scenarios — such as using explosives or poison at an official event — to assassinate the judge. Bolsonaro had long railed against the Supreme Court, focusing his ire on de Moraes. The former president's supporters consider de Moraes their chief enemy. The judge led a five-year probe into fake news and threats against Supreme Court justices, which has led to the ban of some far-right allies and supporters from social media and even some prison terms. De Moraes also presided over the nation’s top electoral court when it ruled Bolsonaro ineligible for office until 2030, finding that he had abused his power and cast unfounded doubts on the validity of the 2022 election result. Bolsonaro is also being investigated for a slew of potential crimes, including whether he was involved in inciting the capital uprising to oust his successor. Fernandes’ plan also described a scenario of poisoning Lula. The federal police officer arrested Tuesday, Wladimir Matos Soares, allegedly provided the other military coup plotters with information about Lula’s security. The document Tuesday contained no indication that any attempt to carry out an assassination on Lula or Alckmin was put into motion. However, investigators found messages and documents indicating that the plotters were monitoring and following de Moraes at the time. According to text messages analyzed by investigators, one of the military officers arrested was involved in an operation that officials believe was likely aimed at capturing the Supreme Court justice. On Dec. 15, 2022, military personnel had even taken positions near de Moraes in a parking lot, but the messages indicated they decided to abort the plan last minute. Sen. Flavio Bolsonaro, the former president’s son, appeared to seize on that, saying no assassination attempt actually took place and claimed that 'as repugnant as it is to think about killing someone, it’s not a crime.' However, Supreme Court Justice Gilmar Mendes told local TV network Globonews on Tuesday afternoon that the alleged actions went beyond just plotting and that they were in the process of implementation. A document that police previously seized from another arrested military officer, Lt. Col. Hélio Ferreira Lima, detailed a plan to overthrow the elected government, including orchestrating a probe into alleged election fraud and calling for new elections with a presidential decree backed by Congress. Investigators had previously found another document outlining a so-called Crisis Cabinet of 11 military personnel and headed by two high-ranking generals from Bolsonaro's administration, who would assume power after an attempted coup. Police have also found evidence that some of these documents were printed inside the presidential palace during Bolsonaro's term and that part of the plan was discussed at the residence of his running mate, former defense minister Gen. Braga Walter Braga Netto. Braga Netto's lawyers told local media they would wait to review the investigation before making any comments. In March, two top Brazilian military leaders told police that Bolsonaro had presented them a plan for him to remain in power after losing the 2022 election. However, both refused to take part in the plan and warned Bolsonaro they would arrest him if he tried it, according to judicial documents released earlier this year. Lula was informed of the arrests on Tuesday morning, according to media reports, as he was hosting the final day of the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro where the Brazilian leader was to meet President Joe Biden and others. Lula made no mention of the arrests during his opening speech on the second day Tuesday of the summit. The army later said none of the arrested suspects were involved in providing security for the G20 but declined further comment the ongoing investigation. Last Wednesday, a man set off an explosion outside the Supreme Court in Brasilia, which de Moraes described as a consequence of frequent far-right attacks and hate speech targeting the country’s institutions. Federal police are investigating the blast as terrorism, according to the force's director, Andrei Passos Rodrigues.	https://apnews.com/article/brazil-president-lula-coup-plot-85a793fcef04c7dbd96746b947129042	2024-11-19T04:50:54-08:00	
Roger Federer tells friend and rival Rafael Nadal that he made him enjoy tennis more	MALAGA, Spain (AP) — Roger Federer says Rafael Nadal made him enjoy tennis 'even more' during a rivalry that spanned 40 matches over 15 years. Writing on social media Tuesday, hours before the start of the Davis Cup Final 8, Nadal's last event before heading into retirement, Federer began his message with the word 'Vamos' and said: 'As you get ready to graduate from tennis, I’ve got a few things to share before I maybe get emotional.' 'Let’s start with the obvious: you beat me — a lot. More than I managed to beat you. You challenged me in ways no one else could,' Federer said. 'On clay, it felt like I was stepping into your backyard, and you made me work harder than I ever thought I could just to hold my ground. You made me reimagine my game — even going so far as to change the size of my racquet head, hoping for any edge.' Federer, now 43, was established at No. 1 in the rankings when Nadal, now 38, came along. Federer started his career with a 7-0 record in Grand Slam finals before his first loss at that stage arrived against Nadal in the 2006 French Open final, the first of their three consecutive title matches in Paris — each with the same result. Nadal also defeated Federer in the 2008 Wimbledon final, ending the Swiss star’s bid for a sixth championship in a row at the All England Club. In all, Nadal led their head-to-head series 26-14, including 10-4 at Grand Slam tournaments and 6-3 in Slam finals. Still, Federer told Nadal in his post, referring to him by the nickname Rafa: 'You made me enjoy the game even more.' They helped form the Big Three of men's tennis along with Novak Djokovic, who is still active at age 37 and has won a men's-record 24 major trophies. Nadal is next on the list with 22, followed by Federer with 20. 'What an incredible run you’ve had,' Federer posted. 'Including 14 French Opens — historic! You made Spain proud ... you made the whole tennis world proud.' When Federer left the sport by playing a doubles match at the Laver Cup in September 2022, his partner was Nadal. The two sat side-by-side afterward, crying. 'It meant everything to me that you were there by my side — not as my rival but as my doubles partner,' Federer wrote Tuesday. 'Sharing the court with you that night, and sharing those tears, will forever be one of the most special moments of my career.' Nadal's Spanish team was scheduled to meet the Netherlands in the Davis Cup quarterfinals Tuesday. Neither Nadal nor Spain's captain, David Ferrer, would say Monday whether Nadal will play singles or doubles, both — or neither. 'Rafa, I know you’re focused on the last stretch of your epic career. We will talk when it’s done,' Federer wrote. 'I want you to know that your old friend is always cheering for you, and will be cheering just as loud for everything you do next.' ___ AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis	https://apnews.com/article/rafael-nadal-federer-davis-cup-retirement-227afcce823e736c3385719e5a36a797	2024-11-19T04:24:33-08:00	
Russia says Ukraine fired 6 US-made ATACMS at the Bryansk region, days after Biden policy shift	Ukraine fired six U.S.-made ATACMS missiles at Russia’s Bryansk region, Russia’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday, days after U.S. President Joe Biden eased restrictions on Ukrainian use of American-made weapons in the war that has reached its 1,000-day milestone. Ukraine claimed it hit a military weapons depot in Bryansk in the middle of the night, though it didn't specify what weapons it used. The Ukrainian General Staff said that multiple explosions and detonation were heard in the targeted area. In a statement carried by Russian news agencies, the Russian Defense Ministry said the military shot down five Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS, and damaged one more. The fragments fell on the territory of an unspecified military facility, the ministry said. The falling debris sparked a fire, but didn’t inflict any damage or casualties, it said. Neither side's claims could be independently verified. The announcement came after Biden authorized Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied missiles to strike deeper inside Russia, easing limitations on the longer range weapons after Russia deployed thousands of North Korean troops in the conflict. Earlier on Tuesday, Ukrainian officials reported a third Russian strike in three days on a civilian residential area in Ukraine killed at least 12 people, including a child. The strike by a Shahed drone in the northern Sumy region late Monday hit a dormitory of an educational facility in the town of Hlukhiv and wounded 11 others, including two children, authorities said, adding that more people could be trapped under the rubble. Ukrainian civilians have repeatedly been clobbered by Russian drones and missiles during the war, while on the battlefield it is under severe Russian pressure at places on the about 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line where its army is stretched thin against a bigger adversary. On Sunday, a Russian ballistic missile with cluster munitions struck a residential area of Sumy in northern Ukraine, killing 11 people and wounding 84 others. On Monday, a Russian missile barrage sparked apartment fires in the southern port of Odesa, killing at least 10 people and wounding 43. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that the series of aerial strikes proved that Russian President Vladimir Putin wasn't interested in ending the war. 'Each new attack by Russia only confirms Putin’s true intentions. He wants the war to continue. Talks about peace are not interesting to him. We must force Russia to a just peace by force,' Zelenskyy said. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-1000-days-attack-06002c8c50bfb2fc622f446a8580bc0e	2024-11-19T02:42:44-08:00	
Germany's defense minister says damage to 2 Baltic data cables appears to be sabotage	BERLIN (AP) — Germany's defense minister said Tuesday officials have to assume damage to two data cables under the Baltic Sea, one of which ends in Germany, was caused by sabotage — though he said they have no proof at present. Damage was detected Monday to the C-Lion1 cable that runs nearly 1.200 kilometers (750 miles) from the Finnish capital, Helsinki, to the German port city of Rostock. Another cable between Lithuania and Sweden was also damaged. Speaking in Brussels, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said that Russia poses not just a military but also a hybrid threat, and that Europe needs to take a broad approach to defense. He said the damage to the two cables was 'a very clear sign that something is afoot.' 'No one believes these cables were severed by mistake, and I also don't want to believe versions that it was anchors that by chance caused damage to these cables,' he said at a regular meeting of European Union defense ministers. 'So we have to state — without knowing in concrete terms who it came from — that this is a hybrid action. And we also have to assume — without already knowing it, obviously — that this is sabotage.' The foreign ministries of Finland and Germany had already said Monday evening that the damage raised suspicion of sabotage. They said in a joint statement that the damage comes at a time that 'our European security is not only under threat from Russia‘s war of aggression against Ukraine, but also from hybrid warfare by malicious actors.' The statement said the countries were investigating the incident, and that it was crucial that such 'critical infrastructure' be safeguarded.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-finland-baltic-data-cables-sabotage-russia-12082dcc129d04e417d15d3f1b24add7	2024-11-19T01:25:03-08:00	
US envoy says a truce in Lebanon is 'within our grasp' as Gaza's food crisis worsens after looting	BEIRUT (AP) — A United States envoy said an agreement to end the Israel-Hezbollah war is 'within our grasp' after talks in Lebanon on Tuesday. There was no such optimism in the Gaza Strip, where the looting of nearly 100 aid trucks by armed men worsened an already severe food crisis. Amos Hochstein, the Biden administration's pointman on Israel and Lebanon, arrived as Hezbollah's allies in the Lebanese government said it had responded positively to the proposal, which would entail both the militants and Israeli ground forces withdrawing from a U.N. buffer zone in southern Lebanon. The buffer zone would be policed by thousands of additional U.N. peacekeepers and Lebanese troops. Israel has called for a stronger enforcement mechanism, potentially including the ability to operate against any Hezbollah threats, something Lebanon is likely to oppose. Hochstein said he held 'very constructive talks' with Lebanon’s Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, an ally of Hezbollah who is mediating on the group’s behalf. 'Specifically today, we have continued to significantly narrow the gaps,' he told reporters after the two-hour meeting. 'I’m here in Beirut to facilitate that decision-making, but it’s ultimately the decisions of the parties to reach a conclusion to this conflict. ... It is now within our grasp.' In Gaza, meanwhile, the theft of nearly 100 trucks loaded with food and other humanitarian aid over the weekend sent prices soaring and caused shortages in central Gaza, where most of the population of 2.3 million people have fled and where hundreds of thousands are crammed into squalid tent camps. An even more severe hunger crisis is underway in the north, where Israel has been waging a weekslong offensive that has killed hundreds of people and driven tens of thousands from their homes. Experts say a famine might already have set in there. Food prices soar in central Gaza after looting On Monday, a crowd of people waited outside a shuttered bakery in the central city of Deir al-Balah. A woman who had been displaced from Gaza City, identifying herself as Umm Shadi, said the price of flour had climbed to 400 shekels (over $100) a bag, if it can even be found. Nora Muhanna, another woman displaced from Gaza City, said she was leaving empty-handed after waiting five hours for a bag of bread for her children. 'From the beginning, there are no goods, and even if they are available, there is no money,' she said. The United Nations said armed men stole food and other aid from 98 trucks over the weekend, the largest single incident of its kind since the start of the war. It did not say who was behind the theft. U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the convoy of 109 trucks was instructed by the Israeli military to take an 'alternative, unfamiliar route' after the aid was brought in through the Kerem Shalom crossing, and that the trucks were stolen near the crossing itself. Israel has long accused Hamas of stealing aid, allegations denied by the militant group. Al-Aqsa TV, a media outlet operated by the militants, said Hamas-run security forces in Gaza had launched an operation against looters, killing 20 of them. Bassem Naim, a senior Hamas official based abroad, said the looters were young men from Bedouin tribes in the area, emphasizing that they do not necessarily represent the tribes. He said they operate east of Rafah near Israeli military positions. The Hamas-run government had a police force of tens of thousands that maintained a high degree of public security before the war, but they have vanished from the streets in many areas after being targeted by Israeli strikes. Hamas says it has taken measures to prevent both looting and price-gouging in local markets. Wars rage on in Biden administration's final months Hamas ignited the war in Gaza when its fighters stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 43,800 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities, who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants in their toll. The war has left much of the territory in ruins and forced around 90% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million to flee, often multiple times. Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel the day after the Hamas attack in what it said was solidarity with the Palestinians and Hamas, a fellow Iran-backed militant group. Israel launched retaliatory airstrikes, and all-out war erupted in September. The fighting has left more than 3,500 dead in Lebanon and almost 15,000 wounded, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. It also displaced nearly 1.2 million, or a quarter of Lebanon’s population. On the Israeli side, 87 soldiers and 50 civilians have been killed by rockets, drones and missiles. The Biden administration has spent several months trying to broker cease-fires on both fronts. It appears to have made some progress in Lebanon, while talks over a cease-fire and the release of hostages held in Gaza stalled over the summer. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to end the wars in the Middle East without saying how he would do it. He was a staunch supporter of Israel and its hawkish government during his first term. ___ Shurafa reported from Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip and Khaled from Cairo. ___ Find more of AP’s coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-lebanon-hezbollah-iran-11-19-2024-a76670f9373598edd964139280eba60c	2024-11-19T00:34:36-08:00	
Putin lowers the threshold for using his nuclear arsenal after Biden's arms decision for Ukraine	President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday formally lowered the threshold for Russia’s use of its nuclear weapons, a move that follows U.S. President Joe Biden’s decision to let Ukraine strike targets inside Russian territory with American-supplied longer-range missiles. The new doctrine allows for a potential nuclear response by Moscow even to a conventional attack on Russia by any nation that is supported by a nuclear power. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Ukraine fired six U.S.-made ATACMS missiles early Tuesday at a military facility in Russia's Bryansk region that borders Ukraine, adding that air defenses shot down five of them and damaged one more. While the doctrine envisions a possible nuclear response by Russia to such a conventional strike, it is formulated broadly to avoid a firm commitment to use nuclear weapons and keep Putin's options open. The approval of the document demonstrates Putin’s readiness to tap his nuclear arsenal to force the West to back down as Moscow presses a slow-moving offensive in Ukraine as the war reached its 1,000th day. Asked Tuesday if a Ukrainian attack with longer-range U.S. missiles could potentially trigger a nuclear response, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov answered affirmatively, pointing to the doctrine’s provision that holds the door open for it after a conventional strike that raises critical threats for the 'sovereignty and territorial integrity: of Russia and its ally, Belarus. Commenting on whether the updated doctrine was deliberately issued to follow Biden’s decision, Peskov said the document was published 'in a timely manner' and that Putin instructed the government to update it earlier this year so that it is 'in line with the current situation.' Putin first announced changes in the nuclear doctrine in September, when he chaired a meeting discussing the proposed revisions. He has previously warned the U.S. and other NATO allies that allowing Ukraine to use Western-supplied longer-range weapons to hit Russian territory would mean that Russia and NATO are at war. Washington has permitted Ukraine to use the longer-range weapons on targets inside Russia after declaring that thousands of North Korean troops were deployed in the Russian region of Kursk to fight an incursion by Kyiv's forces. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer denounced the revised nuclear doctrine as the 'latest example of irresponsibility' from 'the depraved Russian government,' according to spokesperson Camilla Marshall. 'Russia’s the one that continues to escalate this war, and the use of North Korean troops is just one example of that,' Marshall said. 'He could remove his troops, roll back his tanks and end the onslaught and needless bloodshed in both Ukraine and Russia. … We would urge him to do so.' The updated doctrine says an attack against Russia by a nonnuclear power with the 'participation or support of a nuclear power' will be seen as their 'joint attack on the Russian Federation.' It says any massive aerial attack on Russia could trigger a nuclear response but avoids any firm commitment and mentions the 'uncertainty of scale, time and place of possible use of nuclear deterrent' among the key principles of the nuclear deterrence. The document also notes that aggression against Russia by a member of a military bloc or coalition is viewed as 'an aggression by the entire bloc,' a clear reference to NATO. At the same time, it spells out conditions for using nuclear weapons in greater detail compared with previous versions of the doctrine, noting they could be used in case of a massive air attack involving ballistic and cruise missiles, aircraft, drones and other flying vehicles. The formulation appears to significantly broaden the triggers for possible nuclear weapons use compared with the document's previous version, which stated Russia could tap its atomic arsenal if case of an attack with ballistic missiles. President Alexander Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus with an iron hand for more than 30 years and has relied on Russian subsidies and support, has allowed Russia to use his country’s territory to send troops into Ukraine and to deploy some of its tactical nuclear weapons. Since Putin sent troops into Ukraine, he and other Russian voices have frequently threatened the West with Russia’s nuclear arsenal to discourage it from ramping up support for Kyiv. Russian hawks called for toughening the doctrine for months, arguing the previous version failed to deter the West from increasing its aid to Ukraine and created the impression that Moscow would not resort to nuclear weapons.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-nuclear-doctrine-putin-91f20e0c9b0f9e5eaa3ed97c35789898	2024-11-19T00:11:50-08:00	
Leader of Georgia's separatist region of Abkhazia resigns, ending unrest	TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — The separatist leader of Georgia's breakaway region of Abkhazia resigned on Tuesday after days of unrest, in which the opposition and its supporters seized key government buildings and at least 14 people were injured in clashes with police. Demonstrators stormed the buildings on Friday to protest new measures allowing Russians to buy property in the seaside region, and demanded the ouster of self-styled Abkhazian President Aslan Bzhania, who is backed by Moscow. Bzhania said that he was prepared to resign if the protesters cede control of the buildings, but the opposition refused to do so until he stepped down. An agreement to end the unrest was reached on Tuesday, Russian media reported, with Bzhania submitting his resignation after all, and the opposition agreeing to leave the occupied buildings. Russian state media outlet Sputnik quoted Abkhazian Vice President Badra Gunba as saying that the agreement was reached after more than nine hours of negotiations. Bzhania's resignation — which he promised to walk back if the protesters didn't cede control of government buildings — was approved by Abkhazia's parliament on Tuesday afternoon, and Gunba became the province's acting president, Spuntik reported. Most of Abkhazia broke away from Georgia in fighting that ended in 1993, and Georgia lost control of the rest of the territory in a short war with Russia in 2008. Russia recognizes Abkhazia as an independent country, but many Abkhazians are concerned that the region of about 245,000 people is a client state of Moscow. Abkhazia’s mountains and Black Sea beaches make it a popular destination for Russian tourists and the demand for holiday homes could be strong. At least 14 people were injured Friday when opposition protesters clashed with police, Russian state news agencies reported. Lawmakers had gathered at the region’s parliament building to discuss ratifying measures allowing Russian citizens to buy property in the breakaway state. However, the session was postponed as demonstrators broke down the gate to the building’s grounds with a truck and streamed inside. Some threw rocks at police, who responded with tear gas. The arrest of five opposition figures at a similar demonstration last week set off widespread protests the next day in which bridges leading to Sukhumi were blocked.	https://apnews.com/article/georgia-abkhazia-separatist-protest-russia-agreement-759a7d94df9e175d2d56ece5ab30f286	2024-11-18T23:29:58-08:00	
Middle East latest: US envoy arrives in Lebanon to meet with officials about possible cease-fire	A U.S. envoy has arrived in Beirut to meet with Lebanese officials about a possible cease-fire in the Israel-Hezbollah war. Amos Hochstein, a senior advisor to United States President Joe Biden, arrived Tuesday, a day after Hezbollah reportedly gave a positive response to a U.S. draft proposal to end the war, which has been ongoing for more than 13 months. The U.S. has been working on a proposal to end hostilities that would remove Israeli ground forces from Lebanon and push Hezbollah forces away from the Israeli border. More Lebanese troops and U.N. peacekeepers would be sent to the buffer zone in southern Lebanon as part of the deal. Hochstein’s main meeting on Tuesday will be with Lebanon’s Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, a Hezbollah ally who is mediating for the militants. Hochstein’s arrival came hours after an Israeli strike in central Beirut killed five people and wounded others. It was the third Israeli strike in the heart of Beirut in two days. Since late September, Israel has dramatically escalated its bombardment of Lebanon, vowing to severely weaken Hezbollah and end its rocket barrages into Israel. Hezbollah began firing rockets, and drawing Israeli retaliation, on Oct. 8, 2023, a day after Hamas’ attack on southern Israel ignited the war in Gaza. Both groups are supported by Iran. The fighting has left more than 3,500 dead in Lebanon and almost 15,000 wounded, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. It also has displaced nearly 1.2 million, or a quarter of Lebanon’s population. On the Israeli side, 87 soldiers and 50 civilians, including some foreign laborers who work in agriculture, have been killed by attacks involving rockets, drones and missiles. ___ Here's the Latest: Qatar says Hamas leaders have left Doha but denies closure of the group's office BEIRUT — Qatar’s foreign ministry spokesperson says Hamas leaders have left Doha but denied reports that Qatar has ordered a permanent closure of the Palestinian militant group’s political office or expulsion of its previously Doha-based leadership. Qatar, which had served as a mediator in indirect cease-fire negotiations between Israel and Hamas for a cease-fire and hostage exchange deal, has suspended its efforts after growing frustration with the lack of progress on a cease-fire deal for Gaza. The Qatari spokesman, Majed bin Mohammed al-Ansari, told reporters on Tuesday that 'if there is decision to close the office permanently you will hear this news from this platform or in an official statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.' 'The leaders of Hamas that are in the negotiating team are now not in Doha and as you know, they move between the different capitals,' he said. '...The office in Doha was created for the purpose of the mediation process — obviously when there is no mediation process, the office itself doesn’t have any function.' Al-Ansari did not say where the Hamas leaders went nor did he rule out that Doha might return to its mediating role. 'The suspension of negotiation efforts does not in any way mean that there is a Qatari position to withdraw from de-escalation efforts or that there is a change in the position of the State of Qatar on the need to end this war,' he said. Israel's military says it sent 1,000 units of blood to a northern Gaza hospital JERUSALEM — The Israeli military has facilitated the delivery of blood units to a hospital in isolated northern Gaza. Israel has imposed a tight siege on the northernmost part of the territory since launching an offensive there in early October. Aid groups say very little humanitarian assistance has been allowed in and have warned of famine. The military agency in charge of transferring aid to Gaza, COGAT, said it had sent 1,000 units of blood through a northern crossing on Monday. The U.N.’s health cluster said the blood shipment was delivered to Kamal Adwan hospital in Beit Lahiya. Tens of thousands of Palestinians have fled the northernmost reaches of the strip since the offensive began, and hospitals there have struggled to function. Israeli forces kill three militants in the West Bank JERUSALEM — Israeli forces have killed three militants in the occupied West Bank. The military says they were killed during an ongoing raid in Jenin, in the north of the occupied territory, which has been a flashpoint for Israeli-Palestinian violence in recent years, even before the war in Gaza. Hamas identified all three of those killed as its fighters. Since Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack triggered the war in Gaza, Israeli fire has killed at least 784 Palestinians in the West Bank, including 167 children, according to the Palestinian Authority’s Health Ministry. Most appear to have been militants killed during Israeli raids, but the dead also include people killed during violent protests as well as civilian bystanders. There has also been a rise in stabbing, shooting and car-ramming attacks against Israelis. Israel seized the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war, and the Palestinians want it to form the main part of their future state. Israel issues veiled warning to Iranian-backed militias in Iraq JERUSALEM — Israel has issued a veiled threat to strike Iraq in response to recent attacks by Iran-backed militant groups based there. In a letter to the United Nations Security Council posted on X, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said his country has the right to 'take all necessary measures to protect itself and its citizens against the ongoing acts of hostilities by Iranian-backed militias in Iraq.' Militants in Iraq have launched several rocket and drone attacks against both Israel and U.S. forces since Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack triggered the war in Gaza. An Oct. 3 drone attack launched from Iraq on an army base in northern Israel killed two Israeli soldiers and wounded 24, Saar said. Israel is believed to have struck militants in Iraq in 2019, but it has not acknowledged any such strikes since the start of the war in Gaza. Israel has carried out hundreds of strikes on Iran-backed militants in Syria, Lebanon and Yemen. In his letter, Saar called on the U.N. to take 'immediate action' to address the situation. US envoy says a conclusion to the Israel-Hezbollah conflict is ‘within our grasp’ BEIRUT — A U.S. envoy to the Middle East says he had 'very constructive talks' in Lebanon and that reaching an agreement to end the Israel-Hezbollah war 'is now within our grasp.' 'Specifically today, we have continued to significantly narrow the gaps. The meeting was very constructive and very helpful,' Amos Hochstein, the U.S. envoy to Lebanon and Israel, told reporters Tuesday. He spoke after a two-hour meeting with Lebanon’s Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, an ally of Hezbollah who is mediating on the group’s behalf. The emerging agreement would apparently restore a U.N. buffer zone patrolled by international peacekeepers and Lebanese troops in southern Lebanon, with Israel withdrawing its ground forces and Hezbollah militants pulling back to the north. Hochstein, who has been shuttling back and forth for several months, said he came back to the region because 'we have a real opportunity to bring this conflict to an end.' 'I’m here in Beirut to facilitate that decision-making, but it’s ultimately the decisions of the parties to reach a conclusion to this conflict,' he said. 'It is now within our grasp.' Hochstein was scheduled to meet Lebanon’s caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati and other officials. 'I am committed to do everything I can to work with the government here in Lebanon and in Israel to bring this conflict to a close,' he said. UN peacekeeping force says it's maintaining positions in Lebanon GENEVA — The U.N. peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon, under pressure from an Israeli military campaign against militant group Hezbollah in its area of operations, says Argentina has asked three of its officers in the contingent to return home, while all other contributing countries are maintaining their commitments. Spokesman Andrea Tenenti of UNIFIL said its 'operational capabilities have not changed' after the move by Argentina, and U.N. forces have not moved from their positions – despite Israeli Defense Forces asking them to move from positions near the 'blue line' along the Lebanon-Israel border about a month ago. 'The posture of our more than 10,000 peacekeepers from nearly 50 countries remain unchanged,' he told a U.N. briefing in Geneva by video conference from Beirut. The UNIFIL forces have not left the 50 positions across their area of operations, aiming to monitor and report on this situation since Israeli forces began their military campaign in Lebanon in September. He said UNIFIL has limited means to monitor the situation amid the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. While Israeli forces have at times moved deeper into Lebanon, it’s not 'permanently,' and the level of destruction in UNIFIL zones was 'huge' and 'shocking.' Separately, UNICEF spokesman James Elder told the U.N. briefing that more than 200 children have been killed in Lebanon in less than the last two months, saying 'their deaths are being met with inertia from those able to stop this violence.' 'It’s become a silent normalization of horror,' Elder said. Tuesday marks 1-year anniversary of Houthi attacks on shipping in Red Sea DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Tuesday marks the one-year anniversary of Yemen’s Houthi rebels beginning their attacks on shipping in the Red Sea corridor. On Nov. 19, 2023, the Houthis seized the car carrier Galaxy Leader in a helicopter-borne attack in the Red Sea. The ship and its 25 crew remain held until today, something the United Nations Security Council noted in a statement calling on the rebels to release the ship and its crew. The Houthis have attacked over 90 commercial vessels in the time since. They sank two vessels in the campaign, which also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have included Western military vessels as well.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-hezbollah-latest-19-november-2024-beff99f84132dab5bb1154244a825e9b	2024-11-18T23:27:07-08:00	
Foreign governments criticize Hong Kong's sentencing of 45 activists. Beijing defends it	HONG KONG (AP) — Forty-five prominent activists in Hong Kong were sentenced to jail for up to 10 years on Tuesday, sparking criticism from foreign governments and rights groups. Beijing defended the decisions. The democracy advocates were among 47 people charged under a Beijing-imposed national security law in 2021 for their involvement in an unofficial primary election to pick opposition candidates. In the city's biggest national security case to date, they were accused of agreeing to veto government-proposed budgets after potentially securing a legislative majority to force a dissolution of the legislature and the ouster of the city’s leader. The case involved pro-democracy figures. Thirty-one of them pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit subversion. Fourteen others were convicted following a long trial. Two were acquitted. Australia Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said her government is 'gravely concerned' by the sentences for Australian citizen Gordon Ng and the other activists. Wong said Australia has expressed strong objections to authorities in China and Hong Kong over the continuing broad application of national security legislation. Britain Catherine West, minister for the Indo-Pacific in Britain’s Foreign Office, said the sentencing demonstrates how Hong Kong authorities use the security law to criminalize political dissent. 'Those sentenced today were exercising their right to freedom of speech, of assembly and of political participation,' she said. China Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said no one should be allowed to use democracy as a pretext to engage in unlawful activities and escape justice. Lin said certain Western countries ignored that they maintain their own national security through judicial procedures while unreasonably criticizing Hong Kong courts for 'fairly implementing' the security law. 'This severely violates and tramples on the spirit of the rule of law,' he said at a news briefing. He said Beijing firmly opposes what he described as certain Western countries' interference in China's internal affairs and their attempts to smear Hong Kong's rule of law. European Union The European Union called the sentencing 'another unprecedented blow' against the city's fundamental freedoms, democratic participation and pluralism. The bloc said in a statement that its members are deeply concerned about the politically motivated prosecution of people engaging in peaceful political activity. It said such activities should be legitimate in any political system that respects basic democratic principles. Hong Kong Hong Kong leader John Lee said the activists' plan was to undermine, destroy or overthrow the city's political system. The government said the case was handled strictly in accordance with the law. Hong Kong Security Minister Chris Tang said the sentences reflect the severity of the offenses. Tang said national security helps safeguard the city's prosperity, so his government takes any violations of the law seriously. 'Different people may have different judgments about whether the sentencing is appropriate. But I think the important point is the rule of law,' he said in a news briefing. Taiwan Taiwan presidential office spokesperson Karen Kuo said democracy is not a crime and condemned the Chinese government for using what she called unjust procedures to suppress the political participation and freedom of speech of Hong Kong pro-democracy figures. The sentencing 'not only breaks the promises of ‘50 years unchanged’ and ‘high degree of autonomy,’ but further proves that ‘one country, two systems’ is unfeasible,' she said in a statement. When Hong Kong returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997, Beijing promised to retain its Western-style civil liberties for 50 years under the governing principle of 'one country, two systems.' United Nations Jeremy Laurence, spokesperson for the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said he is gravely concerned by the use of the security law to criminalize conduct protected by the human rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and association. 'We will continue to engage with the Chinese authorities as we have done in the past,' he said. United States The State Department said it 'strongly' condemned the sentences and called on Hong Kong authorities to 'immediately and unconditionally release the 45 individuals and similarly detained political prisoners.' 'These harsh sentences erode confidence in Hong Kong’s judicial system and harm the city’s international reputation,' said spokesperson Matthew Miller on Tuesday. The department said it plans to 'impose new visa restrictions on multiple Hong Kong officials responsible for implementing' the security law. The U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong said the defendants were aggressively prosecuted and jailed for participating in normal political activity protected under the city's mini-constitution, and called for their immediate release. In Washington, D.C., the chairs of the bipartisan Congressional-Executive Commission said the sentences violate international law and called for wide condemnation. Rep. Chris Smith, a New Jersey Republican, and Sen. Jeff Merkley, a Democrat from Oregon, asked the Biden administration to sanction judges and prosecutors responsible for 'undermining democracy and human rights in Hong Kong.' 'These politically motivated prosecutions are occurring at the same time that dozens of U.S. CEOs are being wined and dined by Hong Kong officials and urged to invest in Hong Kong,' the lawmakers said. 'Each of these U.S. financial titans should be asked whether the Hong Kong government’s mass detentions of political prisoners and regular bulldozing of the rule of law undermine the city’s attractiveness as an international commercial and financial center.' Hong Kong's last British governor Hong Kong's last British governor, Chris Patten, said in a statement the sentencing was 'not only an affront to the people of Hong Kong, but those who value rights and freedoms around the world.' He condemned the 'sham' sentences and urged the British government not to allow the results of the case to go unnoticed. He said the activists were an integral part of the city's pro-democracy movement. Amnesty International Amnesty International China director Sarah Brooks said the people convicted in the 'politically motivated' case should not spend even a day in jail. 'None of the 45 people sentenced have committed an internationally recognized crime; they have been jailed only for exercising their human rights,' she said. Human Rights Watch Maya Wang, associate China director at Human Rights Watch, said, 'Running in an election and trying to win it is now a crime that can lead to a decade in prison in Hong Kong.' Wang said the harsh sentences reflect how fast Hong Kong's civil liberties and judicial independence have nosedived in the past four years since the security law was introduced. ___ Associated Press writer Didi Tang in Washington, D.C., Jamey Keaten in Geneva and Sylvia Hui in London contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/hong-kong-activists-sentencing-reaction-8072c53b68ed770fb1926f31f40a6a97	2024-11-18T22:20:41-08:00	
Australian tourists hospitalized after apparent severe alcohol poisoning in Laos party town	VANG VIENG, Laos (AP) — Two Australian tourists are being treated in Thailand for suspected severe alcohol poisoning after consuming tainted drinks in neighboring Laos, Australian media reported Tuesday. The two 19-year-old women were on a backpacking vacation in Laos when they became ill in the tourist town of Vang Vieng, The Age newspaper in the women’s hometown of Melbourne reported. Duong Duc Toan, manager of the Nana Backpacker Hostel, said staff were told by other guests that the women were unwell after they failed to check out as planned on Nov. 13, and they arranged transport to a hospital for them. He said that two days earlier the women had joined more than 100 other guests for free shots of Lao vodka offered by the hostel as a gesture of hospitality. He said no other guest reported any issue, adding that the women had then gone for a night out, returning in the early hours of the morning. Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade confirmed that it was providing consular assistance to two Australians and their families in Thailand but could not provide further information for privacy reasons. 'Our thoughts are with them at this deeply distressing time,' the office said. They were then transported to Thailand and are being treated at hospitals in Bangkok and Udon Thani, The Age reported. Their parents have flown in to be with them. It was not clear what the two drank, but methanol is sometimes used as the alcohol in mixed drinks at disreputable bars and can cause severe poisoning or death. It was not immediately possible to verify reports that other tourists were also poisoned in the same incident. Toan, the hostel manager, said he hoped the investigation would clear its name but for now the hostel has stopped giving free shots to its guests.	https://apnews.com/article/australian-laos-thailand-alcohol-poisoning-a5a4035fff9ac6e0960c0ffa4a2ef576	2024-11-18T21:39:34-08:00	
Stock market today: Wall Street points toward more losses as big US retailers report latest results	Wall Street was poised to open with losses early Tuesday as more prominent U.S. retailers report their latest financial results. Futures for the S&amp;P 500 declined 0.3% before the bell, while futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average were down 0.5%. The declines come as tensions flare between Ukraine and Russia with the war reaching 1,000 days. Walmart jumped 3.6% in premarket after it beat Wall Street's sales and profit targets and raised its outlook for the year. Walmart is among the first major U.S. retailers to report quarterly results and provides a peek into how Americans are feeling as they head into the holiday shopping season. Home improvement chain Lowe's also beat analyst estimates and raised guidance but its shares were down 1.4% before the bell. Super Micro Computer soared 26% after the server company announced it had hired BDO to be its independent auditor and submitted a compliance plan to the Nasdaq Stock Market to remain listed. Super Micro had lost more than half its value since its previous accounting firm, Ernst &amp; Young, resigned on Oct. 30, saying it could 'no longer be able to rely' on representations from the company’s management and audit committee. Other big companies set to report this week include chipmaker Nvidia and Target on Wednesday and Deere on Thursday. Nvidia, with a total market value of nearly $3.5 trillion, will need to hit analysts’ high expectations for growth during the latest quarter to justify its big stock price, which has surged 183% this year. In Europe at midday, Germany's DAX lost 1.3%, while the CAC 40 in Paris sank 1.5%. Britain's FTSE 100 shed 0.5%.

Money to respond to climate change is key to UN talks in Baku. Nations are finding ways to raise it	BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) — Just as a simple lever can move heavy objects, rich nations are hoping another kind of leverage — the financial sort — can help them come up with the money that poorer nations need to cope with climate change. It involves a complex package of grants, loans and private investment, and it's becoming the major currency at annual United Nations climate talks known as COP29. But poorer nations worry they’ll get the short end of the lever: not much money and plenty of debt. Meanwhile, half a world away in Brazil, leaders of the 20 most powerful economies issued a statement that among other things gave support to strong financial aid for climate for poor nations and the use of leverage financial mechanisms. That was cheered by climate analysts and advocates. Money is the key issue in Baku, where negotiators are working on a new amount of cash for developing nations to transition to clean energy, adapt to climate change and deal with weather disasters. It’ll replace the current goal of $100 billion annually — a goal set in 2009. Looking for the first domino to fall Negotiators are fighting over three big parts of the issue: How big the numbers are, how much is grants or loans, and who pays. The how big question is the toughest to negotiate and will likely be resolved only after the first two are solved, COP29 lead negotiator Yalchin Rafiyev told The Associated Press in an interview Tuesday. 'There are interlinkages of the elements. That’s why having one of them agreed could unlock the other one,' Rafiyev said. It's like the first domino falling leading to another, he said. In these negotiations, rich potential donor nations have been reluctant to offer a starting figure to negotiate from. So Rafiyev said the conference presidency is putting the pressure on them, telling 'the developed countries that the figure should be fair and ambitious, corresponding to the needs and priorities of the world.' Money could be in the form of loans, grants or private investment Experts put the need closer to $1 trillion, while developing nations have said they'll need $1.3 trillion in climate finance. But negotiators are talking about different types of money as well as amounts. So far rich nations have not quite offered a number for the core of money they could provide. But the European Union is expected to finally do that and it will likely be in the $200 to $300 billion a year range, Linda Kalcher, executive director of the think tank Strategic Perspectives, said Tuesday. It might be even as much as four times the original $100 billion, said Luca Bergamaschi, co-founding director of the Italian ECCO think tank. But there's a big difference between $200 billion and $1.3 trillion. That can be bridged with 'the power of leverage,' said Avinash Persaud, climate adviser for the Inter-American Development Bank. When a country gives a multilateral development bank like his $1, it could be used with loans and private investment to get as much as $16 in spending for transitioning away from dirty energy, Persaud said. When it comes to spending to adapt to climate change, the bang for the buck, is a bit less, about $6 for every dollar, he said. But when it comes to compensating poor nations already damaged by climate change — such as Caribbean nations devastated by repeated hurricanes — leverage doesn't work because there's no investment and loans. That's where straight-out grants could help, Persaud said. Whatever the form of the finance, Ireland’s environment minister Eamon Ryan said it would be 'unforgivable' for developed countries to walk away from negotiations in without making a firm commitment toward developing ones. 'We have to make an agreement here,' he said. 'We do have to provide the finance, particularly for the developing countries, and to give confidence that they will not be excluded, that they will be center stage.' For developing nations, the talk of loans brings fear of debt If climate finance comes mostly in the form of loans, it means more debt for nations that are already drowning in it, said Michai Robertson, climate finance negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States. 'All of these things are just nice ways of saying more debt,' Robertson said. His organization argues that most of the $1.3 trillion it seeks should be in grants and very low-interest and long-term loans that are easier to pay back. Only about $400 billion should be in leveraged loans, Robertson said. Leverage from loans 'will be a critical part of the solution,' said United Nations Environment Programme Director Inger Andersen. But so must grants and so must debt relief, she added. Rohey John, Gambia's environment minister, said the absence of a financial commitment from rich nations suggests 'they are not interested in the development of the rest of the mankind.' 'Each and every day we wake up to a crisis that will wipe out a whole community or even a whole country, to a crime that we never committed,' she said. Ministers giving their national statements also came out with fighting words. 'Our children, our elderly, our women, our girls, our Indigenous people, our youth deserve better,' said St. Kitts and Nevis Climate Minister Joyelle Clarke. 'Let us be seized by a desire for better.' Cuban environment minister Armando Rodriguez Batista urged countries not to 'favor death over life.' Praise and worry about G20 statement The G20's mention of the need for strong climate finance and especially the replenishment of the International Development Association gives a boost to negotiators in Baku, ECCO's Bergamaschi said. 'G20 Leaders have sent a clear message to their negotiators at COP29: do not leave Baku without a successful new finance goal,' United Nations climate secretary Simon Stiell said. 'This is an essential signal, in a world plagued by debt crises and spiraling climate impacts, wrecking lives, slamming supply chains and fanning inflation in every economy.' Analysts and activists said they were also worried because the G20 statement did not repeat the call for a transition away from fossil fuels, a hard-fought concession at last year's climate talks. Veteran climate talks analyst Alden Meyer of the European think tank E3G said the watering down of the G20 statement on fossil fuel transition is because of pressure by Russia and Saudi Arabia. He said it is 'just the latest reflection of the Saudi wrecking ball strategy' at climate meetings. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

1,000 days of war in Ukraine, distilled in a single 24-hour span of violence and resilience	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The clock on her wall stopped almost as soon as the day began, its hands frozen by the Russian bomb that hit the dormitory serving as home for Ukrainians displaced by war. It was 1:45 a.m. in an upstairs room in the eastern city of Zaporizhzhia, Natalia Panasenko’s home for just shy of a year after the town she thinks of as her real home came under Russian occupation. The explosion blasted a door on top of her, smashed her refrigerator and television and shredded the flowers she’d just received for her 63rd birthday. 'The house was full of people and flowers. People were congratulating me ... and then there was nothing. Everything was mixed in the rubble,' she said. 'I come from a place where the war is going on every day. We only just left there, and it seemed to be quieter here. And the war caught up with us again.' Nov. 11 was a typical day of violence and resilience in Ukraine. The Associated Press fanned out across Ukraine to chronicle 24 hours of life just as the country prepared to mark a grim milestone Tuesday: 1,000 days since Russia’s full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022. The day opened with two Russian bombings — one that hit Panasenko’s apartment and another that killed six in Mykolaiv, including a woman and her three children. Before the day was even halfway done, a Russian ballistic missile shattered yet another apartment building, this time in the city of Kryvyi Rih. Swimmers braved the Black Sea waters off Odesa, steelworkers kept the economy limping along, a baby was born. Soldiers died and were buried. The lucky ones found a measure of healing for their missing limbs and broken faces. About a fifth of Ukraine’s internationally recognized territory is now controlled by Russia. Those invisible geographical lines shift constantly, and the closer a person is to them the more dangerous life is. In the no-man’s-land between Russian and Ukrainian forces, there’s hardly any life at all. It’s called the Gray Zone for good reason. Ashen homes, charred trees and blackened pits left by shells exploding over 1,000 days of war stretch as far as the eye can see. Odesa, 6:50 a.m. The waters of the Black Sea hover around 13 degrees Celsius (55 Fahrenheit) in late fall. The coastline is mined. Dmytro's city is regularly targeted by drones and missiles. But Dmytro — who insisted on being identified only by his first name because he was worried for the safety of his family — was undaunted as he plunged into the waves with a handful of friends for their regular swim. Before the war, the group numbered a couple of dozen. Many fled the country. Men were mobilized to fight. Some returned with disabilities that keep them out of the water. His 33-year-old stepson is missing in action after a battle in the Donetsk region. For Dmytro and fellow swimmers, the ritual grounds them and makes the grimness of war more bearable. He said the risks of his hobby are well worth the reward: 'If you’re afraid of wolves, don’t go into the forest.' Zaporizhzhia, noon Managing the Zaporizhstal steel mill during wartime means days filled with calculations for Serhii Saphonov. The staff of 420 is less than half its pre-war levels. Power cuts from Russian attacks on electricity infrastructure require an 'algorithm of actions' to maintain operations. Russian forces are closing in on the coke mine in Pokrovsk that supplies the plant with coal. And the city is under increasing attack by Russia’s unstoppable glide bombs. Right outside his office, a bulletin board displays the names of 92 former steelworkers who have joined the army. Below are photos of the dead. Staff hold fundraisers for supplies for colleagues on the front, including two bulletproof vests sitting in the corner near his desk. 'The old workers, they carry everything on their shoulders. They are hardened. They know their job,' Saphonov said. 'Everyone knows that we have to endure, hold out, hoping that things will get better ahead.' Chernihiv, 1 p.m. Dr. Vladyslava Friz has performed more reconstructive surgeries in the past 1,000 days than she did in the previous decade of her career. And the injuries are like nothing she had ever seen before. Her days start early and end late. In the first months of the war, she said, the hospital was admitting 60 people per hour, and eight surgeons worked nonstop. They’re still catching up, because so many of the injured need multiple surgeries. On Nov. 11, she was rebuilding the cheek and jaw of a patient injured in a mine explosion. 'Appearance is a person’s visual identity,' she said. 'There is work to be done; we are doing it. We have no other options. There are medicines, equipment and personnel, but there are no metal structures for reconstruction. There is no state funding for implants.' She said she will not abandon her patients but worries that the world will abandon Ukraine as the war approaches its fourth year. 'The global community continues to lose interest in the events in Ukraine while we lose people every day,' she said. 'The world seems to have forgotten about us.' Odesa, 6 p.m. Yulia Ponomarenko has brought two babies into the world in the past 1,000 days, including Mariana on Nov. 11. Her husband, Denys, is fighting at the front. Their hometown, Oleshky, was submerged by flooding after the explosion of the Kakhovka Dam. But by then, she’d long since fled the occupying Russian forces, who target the families of Ukrainian soldiers. Mariana, born healthy at 3.8 kilograms and 55 centimeters (8 pounds, 6 ounces and 21 inches), will grow up with an older brother and sister and a menagerie of two cats and two dogs. 'This child is very expected, very wanted. We now have another princess,' Ponomarenko said. Kyiv, 9 p.m. The actors can't perform in their home theater in Kharkiv — too many bombs, too few people willing to gather in one place. So they've moved to the Ukrainian capital, where they played to a nearly full house on Nov. 11 as guests of the Franko Theater. 'Because of the war, the Kharkiv theater cannot play on its stage. We play underground. It is literally underground art. There are only two to three places in Kharkiv where we can play, and that's it,' said Mykhailo Tereshchenko, one of the principal actors of the Taras Shevchenko Academic Ukrainian Drama Theatre, named for Ukraine's most famous writer. Yevhen Nyshchuk, director of the Franko, said the theater paused production for a few months after the war started. Now, it's packed nearly every night there is a play, and the lengthy applause when curtains close is deafening. The reason goes beyond the quality of a performance at this point, he believes, and expresses 'this inner realization that in spite of everything, we will create, we will live, we will come, we will meet, we will applaud each other.' ___ Volodymyr Yurchuk and Anton Shtuka contributed from Kyiv.	https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-russia-war-1000-days-ade5a60cf2345d694871f85df162d08a	2024-11-18T20:09:58-08:00	
G20 summit calls for more aid to Gaza and an end to the war in Ukraine	RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Leaders of the world's 20 major economies called for a global pact to combat hunger, more aid for war-torn Gaza and an end to hostilities in the Mideast and Ukraine, issuing a joint declaration Monday that was heavy on generalities but short of details on how to accomplish those goals. The joint statement was endorsed by group members but fell short of complete unanimity. It also called for a future global tax on billionaires and for reforms allowing the eventual expansion of the United Nation Security Council beyond its five current permanent members. At the start of the three-day meeting which formally ends Wednesday, experts doubted Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva could convince the assembled leaders to hammer out any agreement at all in a gathering rife with uncertainty over the incoming administration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, and heightened global tensions over wars in the Mideast and Ukraine. Argentina challenged some of the language in initial drafts and was the one country that did not endorse the complete document. 'Although generic, it is a positive surprise for Brazil,' said Thomas Traumann, an independent political consultant and former Brazilian minister. 'There was a moment when there was a risk of no declaration at all. Despite the caveats, it is a good result for Lula.' Condemnation of wars, calls for peace, but without casting blame Taking place just over a year after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, the declaration referred to the 'catastrophic humanitarian situation in the Gaza and the escalation in Lebanon,' stressing the urgent need to expand humanitarian assistance and better protect civilians. 'Affirming the Palestinian right to self-determination, we reiterate our unwavering commitment to the vision of the two-State solution where Israel and a Palestinian State live side by side in peace,' it said. It did not mention Israel’s suffering or of the 100 or so hostages still held by Hamas. Israel isn’t a G20 member. The war has so far killed more than 43,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to local health officials, and more than 3,500 people in Lebanon following Israel’s offensive against Hezbollah, according to Lebanon’s Health Ministry. The omitted acknowledgment of Israel's distress appeared to run contrary to U.S. President Joe Biden’s consistent backing of Israel's right to defend itself. It's something Biden always notes in public, even when speaking about the deprivation of Palestinians. During a meeting with G20 leaders before the declaration was hammered home, Biden expressed his view that Hamas is solely to blame for the war and called on fellow leaders to 'increase the pressure on Hamas' to accept a cease-fire deal. Biden's decision to ease restrictions on Ukraine’s use of longer-range U.S. missiles to allow that country to strike more deeply inside Russia also played into the meetings, 'The United States strongly supports Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Everyone around this table in my view should, as well,' Biden said during the summit. Russian President Vladimir Putin did not attend the meeting , and instead sent his foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov. Putin has avoided such summits after the International Criminal Court issued a warrant that obliges member states to arrest him. The G20 declaration highlighted the human suffering in Ukraine while calling for peace, without naming Russia. 'The declaration avoids pointing the finger at the culprits,' said Paulo Velasco, an international relations professor at the State University of Rio de Janeiro. 'That is, it doesn’t make any critical mention of Israel or Russia, but it highlights the dramatic humanitarian situations in both cases.' The entire declaration lacks specificity, Velasco added. 'It is very much in line with what Brazil hoped for ... but if we really analyze it carefully, it is very much a declaration of intent. It is a declaration of good will on various issues, but we have very few concrete, tangible measures.' Fraught push to tax global billionaires The declaration did call for a possible tax on global billionaires, which Lula supports. Such a tax would affect about 3,000 people around the world, including about 100 in Latin América. The clause was included despite opposition from Argentina. So was another promoting gender equality, said Brazilian and other officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly. Argentina signed the G20 declaration, bit also had issues with references to the U.N.’s 2030 sustainable development agenda. Its right-wing president, Javier Milei, has referred to the agenda as 'a supranational program of a socialist nature.' It also objected to calls for regulating hate speech on social media, which Milei says infringes on national sovereignty, and to the idea that governments should do more to fight hunger. Milei has often adopted a Trump-like role as a spoiler in multilateral talks hosted by his outspoken critic, Lula. Concrete steps for fighting global hunger Much of the declaration focuses on eradicating hunger — a priority for Lula. Brazil’s government stressed that Lula’s launch of the global alliance against hunger and poverty on Monday was as important as the final G20 declaration. As of Monday, 82 nations had signed onto the plan, Brazil’s government said. It is also backed by organizations including the Rockefeller Foundation and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. A demonstration Sunday on Rio’s Copacabana beach featured 733 empty plates spread across the sand to represent the 733 million people who went hungry in 2023, according to United Nations data. Viviana Santiago, a director at the anti-poverty nonprofit Oxfam, praised Brazil for using its G20 presidency 'to respond to people’s demands worldwide to tackle extreme inequality, hunger and climate breakdown, and particularly for rallying action on taxing the super-rich.' 'Brazil has lit a path toward a more just and resilient world, challenging others to meet them at this critical juncture,' she said in a statement. Long-awaited reform of the United Nations Leaders pledged to work for 'transformative reform' of the U.N. Security Council so that it aligns 'with the realities and demands of the 21st century, makes it more representative, inclusive, efficient, effective, democratic and accountable.' Lula has been calling for reform of Security Council since his first two terms in power, from 2003 to 2010, without gaining much traction. Charged with maintaining international peace and security, its original 1945 structure has not changed. Five dominant powers at the end of World War II have veto power — the U.S., Russia, China, Britain and France — while 10 countries from different regions serve rotating two-year terms. Virtually all countries agree that nearly eight decades after the United Nations was established, the Security Council should be expanded to reflect the 21st century world and include more voices. The central quandary and biggest disagreement remains how to do that. The G20 declaration doesn’t answer that question. 'We call for an enlarged Security Council composition that improves the representation of the underrepresented and unrepresented regions and groups, such as Africa, Asia-Pacific and Latin America and the Caribbean,' the declaration said. The United States announced shortly before a U.N. summit in September that it supports two new permanent seats for African countries, without veto power, and a first-ever non-permanent seat for a small island developing nation. But the Group of Four – Brazil, Germany, India and Japan – support each other’s bids for permanent seats. And the larger Uniting for Consensus group of a dozen countries including Pakistan, Italy, Turkey and Mexico wants additional non-permanent seats with longer terms. ___ Associated Press writers Aamer Madhani in Rio de Janeiro, Edith M.

Toronto author Anne Michaels wins Giller Prize for novel 'Held'	TORONTO (AP) — Poet-novelist Anne Michaels has won the Giller Prize for her novel 'Held,' a multi-generational examination of war and trauma. The 100,000 Canadian dollar ($71,000) Giller prize honors the best in Canadian fiction. Past winners have included Margaret Atwood, Mordecai Richler and Alice Munro. Michaels appealed for 'unity' among 'all the arts' during her speech Monday night at the Toronto ceremony, held under the shadow of anti-war protests by other members of the literary community. Outside the Park Hyatt hotel, protesters renewed demands for the Giller Foundation to cut ties with several corporate sponsors, including Scotiabank over its stake in Israeli arms manufacturer Elbit Systems. Inside, the gala went off without any disruptions after last year’s ceremony was beset by pro-Palestinian demonstrators. 'Held' moves backwards and forwards through time as it follows a photographer-turned-First World War solider, his descendants, their spouses and their spouses’ parents. The Giller jury cited 'Held' as an impactful and hypnotic exploration of mortality, resilience and desires. The Giller was created in 1994 by late businessman Jack Rabinovitch in memory of his late wife, literary journalist Doris Giller.	https://apnews.com/article/giller-prize-canadian-book-award-954017970112ab815cbe6c0a1d6603d2	2024-11-18T18:46:18-08:00	
42,000 crowd New Zealand's Parliament grounds in support of Māori rights	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — As tens of thousands of marchers crowded the streets in New Zealand’s capital Wellington on Tuesday, the throng of people, flags aloft, had the air of a festival or a parade rather than a protest. They arrived to oppose a law that would reshape the county’s founding treaty between Indigenous Māori and the British Crown. But for many, it was about something more: a celebration of a resurging Indigenous language and identity that colonization had once almost destroyed. 'Just fighting for the rights that our tūpuna, our ancestors, fought for,' Shanell Bob said as she waited for the march to begin. 'We’re fighting for our tamariki, for our mokopuna, so they can have what we haven’t been able to have,' she added, using the Māori words for children and grandchildren. What was likely the country’s largest-ever protest in support of Māori rights — a subject that has preoccupied modern New Zealand for much of its young history — followed a long tradition of peaceful marches the length of the country that have marked turning points in the history of modern New Zealand. 'We’re going for a walk!' One organizer proclaimed from the stage as crowds gathered at the opposite end of the city from the nation’s Parliament. Some had traveled the length of the country over the past nine days. For many, the turnout reflected growing solidarity on Indigenous rights from non-Māori. At bus stops during the usual morning commute, people of all ages and races waited with Māori sovereignty flags. Some local schools said they would not register students as absent. The city’s mayor joined the protest. The bill that marchers were opposing is unpopular and unlikely to become law. But opposition to it has exploded, which marchers said indicated rising knowledge of the Treaty of Waitangi’s promises to Māori among New Zealanders — and a small but vocal backlash from those who are angered by attempts by courts and lawmakers to keep them. Māori marching for their rights as outlined in the treaty is not new. But the crowds were larger than at treaty marches before and mood was changed, Indigenous people said. 'It’s different to when I was a child,' Bob said. 'We’re stronger now, our tamariki are stronger now, they know who they are, they’re proud of who they are.' As the marchers moved through the streets of Wellington with ringing Māori haka — rhythmic chants — and waiata, or songs, thousands more holding signs lined the pavement in support. Some placards bore jokes or insults about the lawmakers responsible for the bill, which would change the meaning of the principles of the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi and prevent them from applying only to Māori — whose chiefs signed the document when New Zealand was colonized. But others read 'proud to be Māori' or acknowledged the bearer’s heritage as a non-Māori person endorsing the protest. Some denounced the widespread expropriation of Māori land during colonization, one of the main grievances arising from the treaty. 'The treaty is a document that lets us be here in Aotearoa so holding it up and respecting it is really important,' said Ben Ogilvie, who is of Pākehā or New Zealand European descent, using the Māori name for the country. 'I hate what this government is doing to tear it down.' Police said 42,000 people tried to crowd into Parliament’s grounds, with some spilling into the surrounding streets. People crammed themselves onto the children's slide on the lawn for a vantage point; others perched in trees. The tone was almost joyful; as people waited to leave the cramped area, some struck up Māori songs that most New Zealanders learn at school. A sea of Māori sovereignty flags in red, black and white stretched down the lawn and into the streets. But marchers bore Samoan, Tongan, Indigenous Australian, U.S., Palestinian and Israeli flags, too. At Parliament, speeches from political leaders drew attention to the reason for the protest — a proposed law that would change the meaning of words in the country’s founding treaty, cement them in law and extend them to everyone. Its author, libertarian lawmaker David Seymour — who is Māori — says the process of redress for decades of Crown breaches of its treaty with Māori has created special treatment for Indigenous people, which he opposes. The bill’s detractors say it would spell constitutional upheaval, dilute Indigenous rights, and has provoked divisive rhetoric about Māori — who are still disadvantaged on almost every social and economic metric, despite attempts by the courts and lawmakers in recent decades to rectify inequities caused in large part by breaches of the treaty. It is not expected to ever become law, but Seymour made a political deal that saw it shepherded through a first vote last Thursday. In a statement Tuesday, he said the public could now make submissions on the bill — which he hopes will reverse in popularity and experience a swell of support. Seymour briefly walked out onto Parliament’s forecourt to observe the protest, although he was not among the lawmakers invited to speak. Some in the crowd booed him. The protest was 'a long time coming,' said Papa Heta, one of the marchers, who said Māori sought acknowledgement and respect. 'We hope that we can unite with our Pākehā friends, Europeans,' he added. 'Unfortunately there are those that make decisions that put us in a difficult place.'	https://apnews.com/article/maori-protest-hikoi-treaty-waitangi-principles-54d5a5345815bed2c2a12687d4f6b625	2024-11-18T18:30:48-08:00	
Numerous children injured by a vehicle at a school gate in central China	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Numerous children were injured by a vehicle at the gate of an elementary school in central China’s Hunan province on Tuesday morning, reports said. Students were arriving for classes around 8 a.m. at Yong'an Elementary School in the city of Changde when the incident occurred. Few details were immediately available, and it wasn’t clear whether the vehicle had lost control or whether it was a deliberate attack. The official Xinhua News Agency said several adults were also injured and identified the vehicle as a small white SUV. It said the driver was subdued by parents and security guards, and some of the injured were sent to the hospital immediately, with the total casualty count still unknown. Footage posted on Chinese social media showed the injured lying on the road while terrified students ran past the gate and inside the schoolhouse. Comments on Chinese internet sites reflected anger and frustration with recurring incidents of violence against citizens by those venting anger at society. 'No matter what the reason is, innocent children should not be harmed,' said one comment on the popular Weibo social media site. 'Timely resolve conflicts, prevent such incidents and severely punish the perpetrators,' said another. While China has much lower rates of violence than many countries — personal gun ownership there is illegal — knifings and the use of homemade explosives still occur. Chinese schools have been subject to numerous attacks by people armed with knives or using vehicles as weapons. A stabbing attack at a vocational school in the eastern Chinese city of Wuxi on Saturday left eight people dead and 17 others injured. That came shortly after a man drove his car into people at a sports facility in the southern city of Zhuhai, leaving 35 people dead and 43 others injured. In September, three people were killed in a knife attack in a Shanghai supermarket, and 15 others were injured. Police said at the time that the suspect had personal financial disputes and came to Shanghai to 'vent his anger.' The same month, a Japanese schoolboy died after being stabbed on his way to school in the southern city of Shenzhen. The Chinese government generally censors internet content it deems overly sensitive or political, and some images of the school incident were quickly taken down. Most Western social media sites and search engines like Google are blocked in China, limiting available content even while some people use tools like VPNs and send news through Chinese social media before the censors have time to catch it.	https://apnews.com/article/china-school-children-injured-3a2cfec62629de089dab285cf38d54b8	2024-11-18T17:27:54-08:00	
45 lawmakers and activists get 4 to 10 years in prison in Hong Kong's biggest national security case	HONG KONG (AP) — Forty-five lawmakers and activists were sentenced to four to 10 years in prison Tuesday in Hong Kong’s biggest national security case under a Beijing-imposed law that crushed a once-thriving pro-democracy movement. The were tried under the 2020 national security law for their roles in an unofficial primary election. Prosecutors said their aim was to paralyze Hong Kong’s government and force the city’s leader to resign by aiming to win a legislative majority and using it to block government budgets indiscriminately. Legal scholar Benny Tai, who was widely seen as the organizer of the unofficial primary, received the longest sentence of 10 years. The judges said the sentences had been reduced for defendants who said they were unaware the plan to secure a majority in the legislature and stall governance was unlawful. However, the court said the penalties were not reduced for Tai and Alvin Yeung, as they are lawyers who were 'absolutely adamant in pushing for the implementation of the Scheme.' In the judgment posted online, the judges wrote that Tai essentially 'advocated for a revolution' by publishing a series of articles over a period of months that traced his thinking, even though in his mitigation letter Tai said the steps were 'never intended to be used as blueprint for any political action.' Two of the 47 original defendants had been acquitted earlier this year. The rest either pleaded guilty to or were found guilty of conspiracy to commit subversion. The judges said in the verdict that the activists’ plans to effect change through the unofficial primary would have undermined the government’s authority and created a constitutional crisis. The judges rejected the reasoning from some defendants that the scheme would never have materialized, stating that 'all the participants had put in every endeavor to make it a success.' In the judgment, the judges highlighted that a great deal of time, resources and money had been put into the organization of the primary election. 'When the Primary Election took place on the 10 and 11 July, no one had remotely mentioned the fact that Primary Election was no more than an academic exercise and that the Scheme was absolutely unattainable,' the judgment read. 'In order to succeed, the organisers and participants might have hurdles to overcome, that however was expected in every subversion case where efforts were made to overthrow or paralyse a government.' Some of the defendants waved at their relatives in the courtroom after they were sentenced. Chan Po-ying, wife of defendant Leung Kwok-hung, told reporters she wasn’t shocked when she learned her husband received a jail term of six years and nine months. She said they were trying to use some of the rights granted by the city’s mini-constitution to pressure those who are in power to address the will of the people. 'This is an unjust imprisonment. They shouldn’t be kept in jail for one day,' said Chan, also the chair of the League of Social Democrats, one of the city’s remaining pro-democracy parties. Emilia Wong, the girlfriend of Ventus Lau, felt calm because Lau’s jail term was within her expectations. Wong said the sentencing was a 'middle phase' of history and she could not see the end point at this moment, but she pledged to support Lau as best as she could. Philip Bowring, the husband of Claudia Mo, was relieved that the sentences finally were handed down. Observers said the trial illustrated how authorities suppressed dissent following huge anti-government protests in 2019, alongside media crackdowns and reduced public choice in elections. The drastic changes reflect how Beijing’s promise to retain the former British colony’s civil liberties for 50 years when it returned to China in 1997 is increasingly threadbare, they said. Beijing and Hong Kong governments insisted the national security law was necessary for the city's stability. The sentencing drew criticism from foreign governments and human rights organizations globally. The U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong said the U.S. strongly condemned the sentences against the 45 pro-democracy advocates and former lawmakers. 'The defendants were aggressively prosecuted and jailed for peacefully participating in normal political activity protected under Hong Kong’s Basic Law,' the statement said. 'We call on (Beijing) and Hong Kong authorities to cease politically motivated prosecutions of Hong Kong citizens and to immediately release all political prisoners and individuals jailed for their peaceful advocacy for rights and freedoms.' Australia's Foreign Minister Penny Wong said its government was 'gravely concerned' by the sentences for Australian citizen Gordon Ng and the other activists. Wong said Australia has expressed strong objections to the Chinese and Hong Kong authorities on the continuing broad application of national security legislation. The subversion case involved pro-democracy activists across the spectrum. They include Tai, former student leader Joshua Wong and former lawmakers. Most of them have already been detained for more than three and a half years before the sentencing. The separations pained them and their families. More than 200 people stood in line in moderate rain and winds Tuesday morning for a seat in the court, including one of the acquitted defendants Lee Yue-shun. Lee said he hoped members of the public would show they care about the development of the court case. 'The public's interpretation and understanding has a far-reaching impact on our society's future development,' he said. A supporter locally known as 'Grandpa Wong,' who did not know the English spelling of his name, said he wanted to see the convicted activists again. He is about 100 years old and feared he wouldn't be able to see them when they are released from prison. Wei Siu-lik, a friend of convicted activist Clarisse Yeung, said she arrived at 4 a.m. even though her leg was injured. 'I wanted to let them know there are still many here coming here for them,' she said. Thirty-one of the activists entered a guilty plea and had better chances of getting reduced sentences. The law authorizes a range of sentences depending on the seriousness of the offense and the defendant’s role in it, going from under three years for the least serious to 10 years to life for people convicted of 'grave' offenses. The unofficial primary held in July 2020 drew 610,000 voters, and its winners would have advanced to the official election. Authorities canceled the official legislative election, however, citing public health risks during the COVID-19 pandemic.	https://apnews.com/article/hong-kong-activists-sentencing-unofficial-primary-1ed13be76fa4918d83f7d3e498f2f543	2024-11-18T16:23:49-08:00	
Greece to repay chunk of bailout debt early and touts recovery during anger over cost of living	ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Greece will make an early repayment of 5 billion euros ($5.3 billion) in bailout-era debt in 2025, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis told a banking conference in Athens on Monday, describing the move as a signal of the country's fiscal recovery. 'This ... underscores our confidence in public finances and reflects our commitment to fiscal discipline,' Mitsotakis said. Finance Ministry officials say they plan to reduce debt through primary surpluses, loan repayments and combating tax evasion. Greece has rebounded from a 10-year financial crisis that forced it to borrow tens of billions of euros from its European Union partners and the International Monetary Fund. But Mitsotakis' center-right government, elected for a second term in 2023, is struggling to address a cost of living crisis that has sapped Greeks' spending power. Despite the lack of any substantial challenge from opposition parties, the high cost of living has nibbled away at the government's approval ratings and triggered union anger. The country's two main private and public sector unions have called a general strike for Wednesday that will keep island ferries in port and disrupt other forms of transport and public services. A protest march will be held in central Athens on Wednesday morning. The GSEE main private sector union on Monday accused the government of 'refusing to take any meaningful measures that would secure workers dignified living conditions.' 'The cost of living is sky-high and our salaries rock-bottom, (while) high housing costs have left young people in a tragic position,' GSEE chairman Yiannis Panagopoulos said. According to EU forecasts, Greece's economy is expected to grow 2.1% in 2024 and maintain a broadly similar course over the following two years. Unemployment, now below 10%, is expected to keep declining, while inflation is projected at 3% this year.	https://apnews.com/article/greece-debt-strike-cost-of-living-f0bd69f12df0a1a34e93008d10789af2	2024-11-18T11:01:32-08:00	
UK hits Iran with new sanctions for supplying missiles to Russia	LONDON (AP) — The U.K. government hit Iran with new sanctions Monday for sending ballistic missiles and other weapons to Russia to support the war against Ukraine. The Foreign Office said it will freeze assets for Iran’s national airline and its state-owned shipping company that helped transfer weapons. It will also sanction the Russian cargo ship Port Olya-3 that delivered the missiles from Iran. 'Iran’s attempts to undermine global security are dangerous and unacceptable,' Foreign Secretary David Lammy said in a statement in advance of announcing the sanctions at the U.N. Security Council. 'Alongside our international partners, we were clear that any transfer of ballistic missiles from Iran to Russia would face a significant response.' The announcement comes on the eve of the 1,000th day of the war in Ukraine and the day after U.S. President Joe Biden authorized Ukraine to use missiles supplied by Washington to strike deeper inside Russia. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said at the G20 summit in Brazil that 'we need to double down' to support Ukraine as long as necessary. The asset freezes will restrict Iran Air’s ability to operate direct services to and from the United Kingdom and will prevent U.K. citizens or businesses from financial dealings with those entities, the office said. The actions follow a previous round of sanctions against Iran and Russia that it announced in September alongside Germany and France.	https://apnews.com/article/uk-iran-sanctions-supplying-russia-missiles-2a4b06b76b1157678e7b12b02c6ad2c3	2024-11-18T09:52:30-08:00	
US sanctions group that builds illegal West Bank settlements, with close ties to Israeli government	WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. on Monday imposed sanctions on organizations and firms involved in illegal settlement development in the occupied West Bank, including a well-established decades-old group that has close ties with Israeli leadership. Treasury sanctioned Amana, the largest organization involved in illegal settlement development in the West Bank, and its subsidiary Binyanei Bar Amana Ltd. Already sanctioned by Britain and Canada, Amana is one of the major funders and supporters of unauthorized settlements in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Peace Now, a settlement tracking group, says its assets are valued at around 600 million Israeli shekels, or about $160 million, and that it has a yearly budget stretching into tens of millions of shekels. Amana, which is based in the West Bank and has no known connection to the U.S. appliance maker, over the past few years has underwritten loans, signed contracts, bought equipment and funded infrastructure projects for new settlements, according to Peace Now. The settlements, small farming outposts, have become some of the primary drivers of violence and displacement of Palestinians living in the West Bank. Additionally, the State Department imposed diplomatic sanctions on Eyal Hari Yehuda Co., which provides construction logistics to sanctioned groups, as well as company owner Itamar Yehuda Levi. The co-founder of the already sanctioned nonprofit group Hashomer Yosh, Shabtai Koshlevsky, and Israeli citizen Zohar Sabah, who has perpetrated acts of violence on Palestinians, also were hit with sanctions. The penalties come as settlers in the territory celebrate the incoming Trump administration, believing it will likely take a more favorable approach to the settlements. During his first term, Trump took unprecedented steps to support Israel’s territorial claims, including recognizing Jerusalem as its capital and moving the U.S. Embassy there, and recognizing Israel’s annexation of the Golan Heights. Treasury’s Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo said the U.S. 'remains committed to holding accountable those who seek to facilitate these destabilizing activities, which threaten the stability of the West Bank, Israel, and the wider region.' Among other things, the sanctions deny the people and firms access to any property or financial assets held in the U.S. and prevent U.S. companies and citizens from doing business with them. In February, President Joe Biden issued an executive order that targets Israeli settlers in the West Bank who have been accused of attacking Palestinians and Israeli peace activists in the occupied territory. That order is used to justify the financial penalties against the companies and men. In response, Texans for Israel, a Christian nonprofit, Israeli nonprofit Regavim and others in August sued the Biden administration in Amarillo, Texas, over its sanctions against Israeli extremists in the West Bank. Eitay Mack, a human rights lawyer who has spent years campaigning for the sanctions on violent West Bank settlers, said the sanctions on Amana were 'an earthquake for the settlement project and especially the shepherds farms.' He called on the U.S. to extend the sanctions now to firebrand Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, also a far-right settler in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Cabinet. Amana’s leadership has appeared at pro-settlement events alongside Cabinet members. Peace Now says the group’s secretary-general, Zeev Hever, was greeted by Smotrich at a June conference where Smotrich laid out his plans for the West Bank. Violence against Palestinians and their displacement have only picked up since the Israel-Hamas war began on Oct. 7, 2023. Around 8,000 Palestinians have been displaced in the West Bank during that time and over 700 killed, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and Palestinian health officials. The Associated Press previously reported that the sanctions measures have had minimal impact, instead emboldening settlers as attacks and land-grabs escalate, according to Palestinians in the West Bank, local rights groups and sanctioned Israelis who spoke to AP. Additionally, Smotrich has previously vowed to intervene on sanctioned settlers’ behalf. Israel captured the West Bank along with east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want those territories for their hoped-for future state. Settlement growth and construction have been promoted by successive Israeli governments stretching back decades, but it has exploded under Netanyahu’s far-right coalition, which has settlers in key Cabinet posts. There are now well over 100 settlements and 500,000 Israeli settlers sprawling across the territory from north to south — a reality, rights groups say, dimming any hopes for an eventual two-state solution. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said 'we once again call on the Government of Israel to take action and hold accountable those responsible for or complicit in violence, forced displacement, and the dispossession of private land. The United States will continue to promote accountability for those who further destabilize conditions in the West Bank and support extremist violence in the region.' __ Frankel reported from Jerusalem.	https://apnews.com/article/treasury-sanctions-israel-hamas-gaza-war-8f652c7d2a5e53e5ca52d0c08a9a27cb	2024-11-18T09:30:34-08:00

Interior Chinatown': Its cast has faced Hollywood struggles uncannily like its characters	Jimmy O. Yang once played 'Chinese Teenager #1.' He's now No. 1 on the call sheet in 'Interior Chinatown' — despite playing downtrodden background actor Willis Wu in the new Hulu series. There’s no escaping the layers of meta around 'Interior Chinatown,' an adaptation of Charles Yu’s award-winning satirical novel that jabs at how Asian American men have been treated by Hollywood — and in life — one trope at a time. 'I feel like I have gone through every single number on the call sheet now,' Yang told The Associated Press. 'And I’ve learned from a lot of other great No. 1s, you know? To carry yourself a certain way. It’s not just about showing up when you work, but it’s also about leading by example.' The dramedy, premiering Tuesday, is told from the view of Willis, a Chinatown restaurant server stuck in a police procedural show whose perspective starts to shift as he looks into the yearslong disappearance of his older brother. The 10-episode season has a mostly Asian cast including Ronny Chieng, Chloe Bennet, Archie Kao and Tzi Ma. There is also plenty of Asian talent behind the scenes, led by Yu, who serves as creator and executive producer. The episodes are full of nods to cop dramas such as 'Law &amp; Order.' They also evoke scenes from '80s and '90s U.S. action-comedies structured around one of the co-leads being Asian and knowing martial arts — think 'Rush Hour' and 'Martial Law.' But it wasn't a youth spent watching these movies and shows that inspired Yu's book, which is structured like a screenplay. 'More what informed the book was the experiences of my parents, who are immigrants, and of their community and seeing how they and their friends had built lives here, were trying to be Americans, were succeeding at it in a lot of ways, but still were feeling like outsiders — and wanting to just tell their story,' Yu said. Taika Waititi, the director of 'Jojo Rabbit' and two 'Thor' movies and the first person of Māori descent to win an Academy Award, also produces. He's no stranger to promoting underrepresented voices on television, co-creating the Emmy-nominated 'Reservation Dogs,' the first series where every role on and off-screen was held by someone Indigenous. Growing up in New Zealand, he saw similarities in 'Interior Chinatown' with how Indigenous Māori like him were treated even in daily interactions. 'I remember working in a convenience store and I was always out the back of the convenience store. There were people who got to come in — and I’d been working there for six months — and they went straight to work on the till,' Waititi told The Associated Press. 'One of the big draws to me was to be able to be involved in something that highlights those issues.' The series' episode titles reference different archetypes that have shadowed Asian American actors for decades. These include 'delivery guy,' 'tech guy,' 'kung fu guy' and 'Chinatown expert.' There has been a reclaiming in recent years of 'kung fu guy,' particularly. Marvel’s 'Shang-Chi,' the CW’s 'Kung Fu,' and 'Warrior' on Max all have protagonists with martial arts prowess who also deal with personal baggage. All three stories happen to take place in San Francisco’s Chinatown. The show's commentary on stereotyping seems more relevant in a post-coronavirus pandemic era, Ma said. 'In every major city, you know, the Chinatowns are going through hard times particularly after the pandemic,' Ma said. 'I hope that people who come to Chinatown realize that Chinatown isn't just a place for you to eat food. It’s a community.' Chieng, who plays curmudgeonly restaurant server Fatty Choi, memorably stuck up for Chinatowns everywhere in 2016 when he used his 'Daily Show' gig to put Fox News’ Jesse Watters on blast for a racist segment about Manhattan’s Chinatown. (The Malaysian-born comedian says that takedown helped get him his part in 'Crazy Rich Asians,' alongside Yang. Unlike the characters in 'Interior Chinatown,' he says, he has since been very fortunate. In fact, he didn’t even have to read for Yu and other producers.) A third of 'Interior Chinatown's' main cast has been in projects set in a Chinatown, which Yu says affirms the story's examination of how Hollywood limits the range of roles available to Asian Americans. 'You don’t have to look too far down the IMDb listings of some of our cast who are really successful actors, but a few years ago could have easily been — you know, Jimmy likes to still tell the story of how he was ‘Chinese Teenager (#1)’ on Chloe’s show, ‘Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,’ which is 10 years ago,' Yu said. Bennet, who is half Chinese and half white, has spoken out before about struggling to be considered for roles when she used her actual surname, Wang. For so long, Bennet felt like her whiteness was what people saw at work and her '‘Asian-ness’ was always reserved for home,' the former 'Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.' star told the AP. So, just walking onto the 'Interior Chinatown' set was emotional. 'I’m viewed as white and so I’ve never really been a part of something where being Asian was so much at the forefront on and off-screen,' Bennet said. 'And so being surrounded by our incredible crew, who was also very diverse, was something I didn’t realize I’d seen and that it was the immediate power of representation. I felt so much more comfortable.' Yang, though, was too embarrassed to tell his frequent scene partner about his nameless part on her show. 'The journey that Willis was going through was the journey that I went through. I just have to zoom back 10 years,' said Yang, who also has his own production company. 'I had a phase where I was fighting for the same kind of roles. ... Even I had to fight to get Chinese Teenager #1.'	https://apnews.com/article/interior-chinatown-jimmy-o-yang-hulu-show-945dc249a00d138544acf98d210da5e6	2024-11-18T09:12:22-08:00	
Hungarian official criticizes Biden decision allowing Ukraine to use US weapons to strike Russia	BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — Hungary's foreign minister lashed out on Monday at U.S. President Joe Biden's decision to authorize Ukraine to use missiles supplied by Washington to strike deeper inside Russia, saying the move could serve to escalate the war and threaten the outbreak of a global conflict. The decision allowing Kyiv to use the Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMs, for attacks farther inside Russia comes as President Vladimir Putin positions North Korean troops along Ukraine’s northern border to try to reclaim hundreds of miles of territory seized by Ukrainian forces. The Kremlin has decried the move, warning that it would add 'fuel to the fire' and further heighten international tensions. On Monday, Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó, a fervent critic of Ukraine with close ties to Putin's government, said that Biden's decision was in contradiction to the will of voters who elected Donald Trump to the presidency earlier this month. Szijjártó also slammed European Union leaders that continue to make efforts to provide support to Kyiv. 'One has the feeling that the pro-war political elites on both sides of the ocean are launching one last desperate, scalding attack on the new realities and the will of the people,' Szijjártó said. Hungary's government under Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has been the most hostile in the EU to Ukraine's ambitions to join the 27-nation bloc, and eventually the NATO military alliance. Orbán, the Kremlin's closest EU partner, has consistently opposed aid for Ukraine and threatened to block sanctions against Moscow for its war. Szijjártó called Biden's authorization of Ukraine to use U.S. weapons 'incredibly dangerous,' and warned that it carried the risk of the war, which marks 1,000 days on Tuesday, spreading further. 'Then there is the demand of Ukrainians and the permissive opinion of some NATO member countries regarding the invitation of Ukraine to NATO,' Szijjártó said. Such membership for Ukraine 'would bring the real threat of World War III very close,' he said. President-elect Trump, who takes office in about two months, has raised uncertainty about whether his administration would continue vital military support to Ukraine. He has also vowed to quickly end the war, but hasn't detailed how. Hungary's government has long advocated for an immediate cease-fire in the conflict but avoids commenting on what such a move would mean for Ukraine's territorial integrity or the broader security implications for Europe. ___ Follow the AP’s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/hungary-criticizes-biden-ukraine-weapons-russia-f928f4c245a1cc977f21136548a8a2f8	2024-11-18T09:05:53-08:00	
Israeli airstrike hits central Beirut near key government buildings and embassies	BEIRUT (AP) — An Israeli airstrike slammed into a densely populated residential area in Lebanon’s capital near key government and diplomatic buildings late Monday, killing at least five people as the U.S. pressed ahead with cease-fire efforts. Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency said two missiles hit the area of Zoqaq al-Blat neighborhood – where local U.N. headquarters and Lebanon’s parliament and prime minister’s office are located. Since late September, Israel has dramatically escalated its bombardment of Lebanon, vowing to severely weaken the Iranian-backed Hezbollah militant group and end its barrages in Israel that the militants have said are in solidarity with Palestinians during the war in Gaza. The U.S. has been working on a cease-fire proposal that would remove Israeli ground forces from Lebanon and push Hezbollah forces far from the Israeli border. Lebanon’s Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, a Hezbollah ally who is mediating for the militants, is expected to meet with U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein in the Lebanese capital on Tuesday. The White House has not confirmed Hochstein's visit. Labor Minister Mostafa Bayram, who met with Berri on Monday, said Lebanon would convey its 'positive position' to the latest U.S. proposal. The Israeli military had no immediate comment on the strike, which also wounded 24 people, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. Many areas in central Beirut, including Zoqaq al-Blat, have become a refuge for many of the roughly 1 million people displaced by the ongoing conflict in southern Lebanon and the southern suburbs of Beirut. The strike also occurred near a Hussainiye, a Shia mosque. The target of the airstrike remained unclear, and the Israeli army did not issue a prior warning. Ambulance sirens echoed through the streets as an Associated Press photographer on the scene saw significant casualties on the street. It was the second consecutive day of Israeli strikes on central Beirut after more than a monthlong pause. On Sunday, a strike in the area of Ras el-Nabaa killed Hezbollah media spokesperson Mohammed Afif, along with six other people, including a woman. Later that day, four people were killed in a separate strike in the commercial district of Mar Elias. The Israeli military has not said what the target of that strike was. Minutes after Monday's strike, Lebanon’s caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati said in a post on X, 'All countries and decision-makers are required to end the bloody and destructive Israeli aggression on Lebanon and implement international resolutions, most notably Resolution 1701.' UN Security Council Resolution 1701, adopted in 2006, ended a monthlong war between Israel and Hezbollah and was intended to create a buffer zone in southern Lebanon. However, the resolution’s full implementation has faced challenges from both sides. The resolution is again on the table as part of an American proposal for a cease-fire deal, aiming to end 13 months of exchanges of fire between Israel and Hezbollah. Israeli ground forces, who invaded southern Lebanon on Oct. 1, would fully withdraw from Lebanon, where the Lebanese army and the U.N. peacekeeping force UNIFIL would be the exclusive armed presence south of Lebanon’s Litani River. Hezbollah would withdraws from the area. A Western diplomat familiar with the talks told The Associated Press there is a sense of 'cautious optimism.' The diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss behind-the-scenes negotiations, said a final deal, however, was 'still in the hands' of the warring players. Israel is said to be pushing for guarantees it can continue to act militarily against Hezbollah if needed, a demand the Lebanese are unlikely to accept. Israeli government spokesperson David Mencer said Israel would continue attacking Hezbollah infrastructure while the US and other countries led negotiations for the ceasefire. 'The military campaign will continue until the immediate threat from Lebanon is removed,' he said. Also on Monday, Hezbollah launched dozens of projectiles against Israel. A rocket that hit the northern Israeli city of Shfaram killed one woman and injured 10, according to Israel’s Magen David Adom rescue services. More then 3,500 people have been killed by Israeli fire, according to Lebanon’s Health Ministry. In Israel, 77 people, including 31 soldiers, have been killed by Hezbollah projectiles, while over 50 soldiers have been killed in the Israeli ground offensive. Israel has said it is targeting Hezbollah in order to ensure that thousands of Israelis can return to their homes near the border. ___ Associated Press writer Melanie Lidman contributed from Tel Aviv, Israel.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-gaza-palestinians-hezbollah-news-nov-18-2024-e97ba8991d02530306d10b1962b1c6e1	2024-11-18T08:11:23-08:00	
Starmer calls for strong UK-China relationship as he meets with Xi in Brazil	LONDON (AP) — U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that he wanted a strong and durable relationship with China Monday as he met with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 summit in Brazil. It was the first time a British leader has met with Xi in recent years as ties between the two countries deteriorated over security and human rights concerns and China’s support for Russia in the war in Ukraine. Starmer, who became prime minister in July after his Labour Party won a landslide election victory, is seeking to repair relations with Beijing. The last time a U.K. leader met with Xi was in 2018. 'We want our relations to be consistent, durable, respectful, as we have agreed (and) avoid surprises where possible,' Starmer told Xi during a meeting on the fringes of the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro. Downing Street said that Starmer wanted a 'pragmatic' approach to working with Beijing on global stability, boosting economic ties and especially climate change and the transition to clean energy. Starmer also raised more thorny issues including concerns over the detention of Hong Kong pro-democracy publisher and activist Jimmy Lai, a U.K. citizen who has been in custody since December 2020. Lai, 76, could face up to life in prison if he is convicted under a sweeping national security law that Beijing has imposed on the former British colony. Journalists were ushered out of the room at the start of Monday's bilateral meeting around the time Starmer raised Lai's case, Britain's Press Association agency reported. Starmer 'wanted to engage honestly and frankly on those areas where we have different perspectives, including on Hong Kong, human rights and Russia’s war in Ukraine,' his office said in a statement after the meeting. Xi told Starmer that the U.K. and China have potential for more cooperation despite their differences and should deepen political trust for mutual benefit, according to China's Xinhua state news agency. Monday's meeting came after U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy paid a visit to Beijing last month for talks with his counterpart, Wang Yi.	https://apnews.com/article/uk-china-starmer-xi-g20-brazil-b1314c8aabf33db8fbf8e2af58d54ac9	2024-11-18T06:29:35-08:00	
What does Biden's decision to allow Ukraine to use longer-range US weapons mean?	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The U.S. will allow Ukraine to use American-supplied longer-range weapons to conduct strikes inside Russian territory, a long-sought request by Kyiv. It was not clear if there would be limits on Ukraine's use of the Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMS, as there have been on other U.S. missile systems. Their deployment could — at least initially — be limited to Russia's Kursk region, where Ukrainian troops seized territory earlier this year. Since the first year of the war, Ukrainian leaders have lobbied Western allies to allow them to use advanced weapons to strike key targets inside Russia — a move they hope would erode Moscow’s capabilities before their troops reach the eastern front line and could make it more difficult for them to strike Ukrainian territory. It could also serve as a deterrent force in the event of future cease-fire negotiations. The U.S. has long opposed the move, with President Joe Biden determined to avoid any escalation that he felt could draw the U.S. and other NATO members into direct conflict with nuclear-armed Russia. The Kremlin warned Monday that the decision adds 'fuel to the fire.' The decision comes in the waning days of Joe Biden’s presidency, before President-elect Donald Trump, who has said he would bring about a swift end to the war that many fear could force unpalatable concessions from Kyiv, assumes office. What are ATACMS? The ballistic missiles, developed by U.S. aerospace and defense company Lockheed Martin, have nearly double the striking distance — up to 300 kilometers (190 miles) — of most of the weapons in Ukraine's possession. They can carry out pinpoint attacks on air fields, ammunition stores and strategic infrastructure. The United States supplied Ukraine with ATACMS last year and they have been used to destroy military targets in Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine — but not on Russian soil. What is Biden allowing Ukraine to do? Biden authorized Ukraine to use the ATACMS to strike deeper inside Russia, according to a U.S. official and three other people familiar with the matter. The longer-range missiles are likely to be used in response to North Korea’s decision to send troops to support Kremlin forces, according to one of the people familiar with the development. Pyongyang’s troops are apparently being deployed to help the Russian army drive Ukrainian forces out of Russia’s Kursk border region, where they launched an incursion in August. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the U.S. decision publicly. It marks the second time that Washington has permitted Ukraine to use its weapons systems inside Russian territory. In May, after Russia’s offensive into the Kharkiv region threatened to stretch Ukrainian forces thin, Biden permitted the use of HIMARS systems — with a range of 80 kilometers (50 miles) — to quell that advance. That decision helped Ukrainian soldiers stabilize the fight for a time by forcing Russian forces to pull back military assets. Why does Ukraine need longer-range weapons? Ukraine has been asking its Western allies for longer-range weapons in order to alter the balance of power in the war where Russia is better resourced, and strike with precision air bases, supply depots and communication centers hundreds of kilometers (miles) over the border. It hopes the weapons would help blunt Russia’s air power and weaken the supply lines it needs to launch daily strikes against Ukraine and to sustain its military ground offensive into Ukraine. If used in Kursk, the weapons would likely require Russian forces preparing for counterattacks to push back valuable equipment and manpower and complicate battle plans. In lieu of Western weapons, Ukraine has been regularly striking Russia with domestically produced weapons, with some capable of traveling up to 1,000 kilometers (620 miles), but still lacks sufficient quantities to do serious long-term harm. Will the decision change the course of the war? The effect depends on the rules set for the weapons' use. If strikes are allowed across all of Russia, they could significantly complicate Moscow's ability to respond to battlefield demands. If strikes are limited to the Kursk region, Russia could relocate its command centers and air units to nearby regions, blunting the effect of those logistical challenges. That would also mean many of the valuable targets Ukrainian officials have expressed desire to hit may still be beyond reach. Ukrainian leaders are being cautious about the announcement. 'Today, many in the media are talking about the fact that we have received permission to take appropriate actions. But blows are not inflicted with words. Such things are not announced. The rockets will speak for themselves,' said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of the announcement. Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Charlie Dietz has noted the ATACMS wouldn’t be the answer to the main threat Ukraine faces from Russian-fired glide bombs, which are being fired from more than 300 kilometers (180 miles) away, beyond the ATACMS' reach. Ukrainian leaders have also said that Russian forces have had time to pull back assets beyond the range of the missiles in the time it has taken the U.S. to make the decision. 'The decision came far too late. Had it been made at the beginning of the fall, it might have disrupted Russia’s counteroffensive in the Kursk region. And if it had been made even earlier, it could have derailed the offensive in the Pokrovsk direction,' said Glib Voloskyi, an analyst at the CBA Initiatives Center, a think tank. In addition, the overall supply of ATACMS is short, so U.S. officials in the past have questioned whether they could give Ukraine enough to make a difference. Some supporters of Ukraine say that even a few strikes deeper inside Russia would force its military to change deployments and expend more of its resources. And the decision may also encourage Britain and France to allow Ukraine to use Storm Shadow missiles, also known as SCALP missiles, with a range of 250 kilometers (155 miles). ___ Associated Press writers Hanna Arhirova in Kyiv, Ukraine, Aamer Madhani in Manaus, Brazil, and Colleen Long, Zeke Miller, Matthew Lee and Ellen Knickmeyer in Washington contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-russia-war-biden-what-are-atacms-missiles-8d8621321af8c673bd42a5693c2ad1f4	2024-11-18T05:29:51-08:00	
Abuse survivors urge the Vatican to globalize the zero-tolerance policy it approved in the US	ROME (AP) — Survivors of clergy sexual abuse urged the Vatican on Monday to expand its zero-tolerance policy that it approved for the U.S. Catholic Church in 2002 to the rest of the world, arguing that children everywhere should be protected from predator priests. The U.S. norms, adopted at the height of the abuse scandal there, say a priest will be permanently removed from church ministry based on even a single act of sexual abuse that is either admitted to or established under church law. That 'one strike and you’re out' policy in the U.S. has long stood out as the toughest in the church. It is held up by some as the gold standard, by others as excessive and by still others as imperfect but better than most. It was adopted by U.S. bishops as they scrambled to try to regain credibility following the revelations of abuse and cover-up in Boston documented by the Boston Globe’s 'Spotlight' series. Since then, the church abuse scandal has erupted globally, and survivors from around the world said Monday there’s no reason why the U.S. norms couldn’t and shouldn’t be applied universally. They called for changes in the church’s in-house canon law and reasoned they could be approved since the Holy See already approved the norms for the U.S. church. 'Despite Pope Francis’ repeated calls for zero tolerance on abuse, his words have yet to lead to any real action,' said Gemma Hickey, a transgender survivor of abuse and the president of the global survivor network Ending Clergy Abuse. The proposal launched at a press conference was hammered out during an unusual meeting in June in Rome between survivors and some of the Catholic hierarchy's top priestly experts on preventing abuse. It was described by participants at the time as a 'historic collaboration' between two groups that often talk past one another, given victims' deep distrust of the Catholic hierarchy. The priestly participants in that meeting included the Rev. Hans Zollner, who heads the church’s main academic think tank on safeguarding; the No. 2 at the Vatican’s child protection advisory board, Bishop Luis Manuel Ali Herrera; and the Gregorian University’s canon law dean, the Rev. Ulrich Rhode as well as diplomats from the U.S., Australian and other embassies. However, there was apparently no one from the Vatican legal office, secretariat of state or the discipline section of the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith, which processes all abuse cases worldwide and largely sets policy on applying the church’s canon law — albeit in secret since its cases are never published. As a result, it was unclear what would become of the proposed policy changes, given the U.S. norms only came about because U.S. bishops pushed the Vatican to approve them, driven by their outraged flocks and insurance companies. Nicholas Cafardi, a U.S. canon lawyer who was an original member of the U.S. National Review Board that provided input to the 2002 U.S. norms, said globalizing that policy into universal church law 'would be one of the logical next steps' for Francis to take to continue the fight against abuse. But Cafardi, author of 'Before Dallas,' about the lead-up to the 2002 Dallas bishops' meeting that approved the norms, said that some bishops today bristle at how the policy limits their authority and freedom. And in a telephone interview, he noted that even in the U.S., the norms are only still in place because the U.S. bishops keep formally asking to keep them, which he acknowledged was a 'weakness' in the system. 'It seems to me that a good protection would be ‘Let’s just make it universal law,’' said Cafardi. 'Once you have that law, you don’t have to worry about the bishops asking for it in country after country. It’s just the law.' However, the proposal faces an uphill battle since the Vatican in recent years has repeatedly insisted on 'proportionality' in its sentences for abuse, refusing to apply a one-size-fits-all approach and taking into account cultural differences in countries where abuse isn't as openly discussed as it is in the West. That has resulted in seemingly light punishments for even confirmed cases of abuse which, in the U.S., would have resulted in a priest being permanently removed from ministry. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Germany and Finland investigate a severed data cable through the Baltic Sea	HELSINKI (AP) — German and Finland expressed deep concern over the discovery Monday of a severed undersea data cable between the countries through the Baltic Sea, saying it raised suspicions of sabotage and that an investigation was underway. The foreign ministries of the two countries said in a joint statement that the damage comes at a time that 'our European security is not only under threat from Russia‘s war of aggression against Ukraine, but also from hybrid warfare by malicious actors.' The statement said the countries were investigating the incident, and that it was crucial that such 'critical infrastructure' be safeguarded. 'The fact that such an incident immediately raises suspicions of intentional damage speaks volumes about the volatility of our times,' the two countries said. The Finnish state-controlled data services provider Cinia said the severed data cable was detected Monday in the C-Lion1 cable that runs nearly 1.200 kilometers (750 miles) from the Finnish capital, Helsinki, to the German port city of Rostock. Cinia said Finland’s international data and telecommunications connections are secured by running them through several redundant lines, and the effects of a single cable failure would depend on the security level of service providers’ connections. The C-Lion1, commissioned in 2016, is Finland’s only data communications cable that runs from the Nordic country directly to central Europe, according to Finnish public broadcaster YLE. Finnish media outlets noted that the cable's route to Germany runs in the vicinity of the two NordStream gas pipelines between Russia and Germany that aren’t currently functioning.	https://apnews.com/article/finland-germany-data-communications-cable-9b231aa47501545690a26a442fe106a5	2024-11-18T04:32:15-08:00	
Today he is a high school football player. Soon he'll be a Buddhist lama in the Himalayas	ISANTI, Minn. (AP) — The young Buddhist lama sat on a throne near an altar decorated with flowers, fruits and golden statues of the Buddha, watching the celebrations of his 18th birthday in silence, with a faint smile. Jalue Dorje knew it would be the last big party before he joins a monastery in the Himalayan foothills -- thousands of miles from his home in a Minneapolis suburb, where he grew up like a typical American teen playing football and listening to rap music. But this was not an ordinary coming-of-age celebration. It was an enthronement ceremony for an aspiring spiritual leader who from an early age was recognized by the Dalai Lama and other Tibetan Buddhist leaders as a reincarnated lama. From the stage, he saw it all: The young women in white long bearded masks who danced, jumping acrobatically and twirling colorful sticks to wish him luck in a tradition reserved for dignitaries. The banging of drums. The procession of hundreds – from children to elderly -- who lined up to bow to him and present him with a 'khata' -- the white Tibetan ceremonial scarves that symbolize auspiciousness. From a throne reserved for lamas, he smelled the aroma of Tibetan dishes prepared by his mother over sleepless nights. He heard the monks with shaved heads, in maroon and gold robes like his own, chant sacred mantras. Behind them, his shaggy-haired high school football teammates sang 'Happy Birthday' before he cut the first slice of cake. One of his buddies gave him shaker bottles for hydrating during training at the gym; another, a gift card to eat at Chipotle Mexican Grill. 'I was in awe!' Dorje recalled later. 'Usually, I’d be at the monk section looking up to whomever was celebrating. But that night it was for me.' Watching Monday Night Football and memorizing ancient Buddhist prayers Since the Dalai Lama’s recognition, Dorje has spent much of his life training to become a monk, memorizing sacred scriptures, practicing calligraphy and learning the teachings of Buddha. After graduation in 2025, he’ll head to northern India to join the Mindrolling Monastery, more than 7,200 miles (11,500 kilometers) from his home in Columbia Heights. Following several years of contemplation and ascetism, he hopes to return to America to teach in the Minnesota Buddhist community. His goal is 'to become a leader of peace,' following the example of the Dalai Lama, Nelson Mandela and Gandhi 'There’s going to be a lot of sacrifice involved,' Dorje said. But he’s not new to sacrifices. He remembered all the early mornings reciting ancient prayers and memorizing Buddhist scriptures, often rewarded by his dad with Pokémon cards. 'As a child, even on the weekend, you’re like: ‘Why don’t I get to sleep more? Why can’t I get up and watch cartoons like other kids.’ But my dad always told me that it’s like planting a seed,' he said, 'and one day it’s going to sprout.' It all began with the process of identifying a lama, which is based on spiritual signs and visions. Dorje was about 4 months old when he was identified by Kyabje Trulshik Rinpoche, a venerated master of Tibetan Buddhism and leader of the Nyingma lineage. He was later confirmed by several lamas as the eighth Terchen Taksham Rinpoche — the first one was born in 1655. After the Dalai Lama recognized him at age 2, Dorje’s parents took him to meet the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism when he visited Wisconsin in 2010. The Dalai Lama cut a lock of Dorje’s hair in a ceremony and advised his parents to let their son stay in the U.S. to perfect his English before sending him to a monastery. Dorje is fluent in English and Tibetan. He grew up reading the manga graphic novel series ″Buddha,' and is an avid sports fan. He roots for the Timberwolves in basketball, Real Madrid in soccer, and the Atlanta Falcons in football. He even keeps a rookie card of wide receiver Drake Londo pasted to the back of his phone, which he carried wrapped in his robes during his party. On the football field, playing as a left guard, his teammates praised his positivity, often reminding them to have fun and keep losses in perspective. 'It’s someone to look up to,' said Griffin Hogg, 20, a former player who took Dorje under his wing. He said they learned from each other and credits Dorje with helping him find his spirituality. 'I’m more of a relaxed person after getting to know him and understanding his own journey.' While Dorje tries to never miss Monday Night Football, he’s always there to help with any event hosted by the local Tibetan community, one of the largest in the United States. 'He has one foot in the normal high school life. And he has one foot in this amazing Tibetan culture that we have in the state of Minnesota,' said Kate Thomas, one of his tutors and the teachings coordinator at Minneapolis’ Bodhicitta Sangha Heart of Enlightenment Institute. 'You can see that he’s comfortable playing a role of sitting on a throne, of participating and being honored as a respected person in his community, as a religious figure. And yet, as soon as he has the opportunity, he wants to go and hang out with his high school buddies,' she said. 'That’s testimony to his flexibility, his openness of mind.' Listening to rap and making Tibetans proud For years, he has followed the same routine. He wakes up to recite sacred texts and then attends school, followed by football practice. He returns home for tutoring about Tibetan history and Buddhism. Then he might practice calligraphy or run on a treadmill while listening to BossMan Dlow, Rod Wave and other rappers. Although he was officially enthroned in 2019 in India, an estimated 1,000 people gathered at the Tibetan American Foundation of Minnesota for his recent ceremony. 'He unites us – Jalue is always here for us,' said Zenden Ugen, 21, a family friend and neighbor who performed Tibetan dances at the event. 'I wish him the best in life because being born and not being able to choose your life must be very hard,' Ugen said. 'But he has a responsibility and him being able to take on that responsibility, I’m very inspired by him. I just hope he keeps being who he is.' Dorje's proud uncle, Tashi Lama, saw him grow up and become a Buddhist master. 'He’s somebody who’s going to be a leader, who’s going to teach compassion and peace and love and harmony among living beings,' he said about his nephew, often referred to as 'Rinpoche' -- a Tibetan word that means 'precious one.' __ Associated Press video journalist Jessie Wardarski contributed to this report. __ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Protesters in Georgia's capital set up a tent camp and demand new elections, wary of Russia	TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — Demonstrators in Georgia's capital have set up tents on a central thoroughfare and vowed Monday to stay around the clock to demand new parliamentary elections in the country. The Oct. 26 election kept the governing Georgian Dream party in power, but opponents say the vote was rigged with Russia's assistance. Many Georgians viewed the election as a referendum on the country’s effort to join the European Union. Several large protests have been held since then. President Salome Zourabichvili, who has rejected the official results, declared on Monday that she would appeal the vote results to the Constitutional Court. Zourabichvili, who holds a mostly ceremonial position, has said Georgia has fallen victim to pressure from Moscow against joining the EU. Critics have accused Georgian Dream, established by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia, of becoming increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow. The party recently pushed through laws similar to those used by the Kremlin to crack down on freedom of speech and LGBTQ+ rights. On Sunday, demonstrators closed an avenue leading into the center of Tbilisi. Nika Melia, leader of Coalition for Change, one of the opposition groups, voiced hope that the protests around the clock will mark 'the beginning of the intense, strong protest movement that will finish with the fall of Ivanishvili’s regime.' The EU suspended Georgia’s membership application process indefinitely in June after the country’s parliament passed a law requiring organizations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as 'pursuing the interest of a foreign power,' similar to a Russian law used to discredit organizations critical of the government. The Central Election Commission said Georgian Dream won about 54% of the vote in October. Its leaders have rejected opposition claims of vote fraud. European election observers said the election took place in a 'divisive' atmosphere marked by instances of bribery, double voting and physical violence.	https://apnews.com/article/georgia-protest-lgbtq-election-russia-cc8169abe7d03205e8cf2c032891b6a9	2024-11-18T02:41:33-08:00	
Senegal's governing party poised for parliamentary majority in boost for reform agenda	DAKAR, Senegal (AP) — Senegal's governing party is poised to win a parliamentary majority as main opposition leaders conceded defeat Monday in an election determining whether newly elected President Bassirou Diomaye Faye can carry out ambitious reforms he promised during his campaign. PASTEF is projected to win around 131 out of the 165 seats in the National Assembly, according to local media and citizen vote counting platforms, giving Faye’s party an absolute majority. The official results and number of seats won by each party will be announced later this week. Former President Macky Sall, leader of the main opposition Takku Wallu coalition, congratulated PASTEF in a post on X. Two other major opposition leaders had already conceded defeat hours after the polls closed on Sunday. PASTEF only held 56 seats in the National Assembly before Sunday’s legislative election, while Sall's coalition had a slim majority of 83 seats. Faye, who was elected in March on an anti-establishment platform, said the lack of a majority had prevented him from executing reforms he pledged during his presidential campaign, including fighting corruption, reviewing fishing permits for foreign companies and securing a bigger share from the country’s natural resources for the population. In September, he dissolved the opposition-led parliament, paving the way for an early legislative election. Voting in the West African nation known for its stability was calm and peaceful despite an electoral campaign that was marked by sporadic clashes between rival supporters. Faye, 44, became Africa’s youngest elected leader in March, less than two weeks after he was released from prison. The former tax inspector's rise has reflected widespread frustration among Senegal’s youth with the country’s direction — a common sentiment across Africa, which has the world’s youngest population and a number of leaders accused of clinging to power for decades. More than 60% of Senegalese are under age 25, and 90% work in informal jobs. Senegal has been hit by skyrocketing inflation in recent years, making life difficult for much of the population. The country is also a major source of irregular migration to Europe, with thousands leaving every year on rickety, artisanal fishing boats in search of economic opportunities.	https://apnews.com/article/senegal-legislative-election-president-reforms-edaa944a674a9dc5dff57e88a2b2029a	2024-11-18T02:20:46-08:00	
Uniqlo's chief says fast fashion must change with the times	TOKYO (AP) — Forty years after its founding, Japanese clothing retailer Uniqlo has more than 2,500 stores worldwide. Sales at its parent company, Fast Retailing Co., recently topped 3 trillion yen ($20 billion) annually for the first time. The name Uniqlo comes from joining the words for 'unique' and 'clothing.' The chain’s basic concept is 'LifeWear,' or everyday clothing. Uniqlo parent Fast Retailing Co. Chief Executive Tadashi Yanai, ranked by Forbes as Japan’s richest man and estimated to be worth $48 billion, spoke recently to The Associated Press at the company’s Tokyo headquarters. The interview has been edited for length and clarity. Q: What were the biggest challenges over the past 40 years? A: Actually 40 years, upon reflection, went by so fast they feel more like three years. You know what they say in Japan: Time flies like an arrow. I started a regional business, then expanded nationwide. When we became No. 2 or No. 3 in Japan’s casual wear, and being No. 1 was right within reach, we became a listed company in 1994. That was followed by our fleece boom, which doubled our revenue in one year to 400 billion yen ($2.6 billion). I’d been thinking about going global when our revenue reached 300 billion yen ($2 billion) so we opened 50 stores in Great Britain, hoping to be a winner there just like we had conquered Japan. Instead, we got totally knocked out. We opened 21 outlets in a year and a half, but had to close 16 of them, leaving just five. We didn’t succeed as we had hoped. This is not an easy job. It’s very tough. But these days, our sales are strongest in London, and also Paris. We made progress gradually. Q: What are some of the sustainability and other key issues you have faced over the years? A: We make clothes that last a long time. Not just clothes that last for one season. The cashmere sweater I’m wearing today is $99. But please don’t say 'cheap.' Please call it 'reasonable.' We sell quality products at reasonable prices. We’ve done various sustainability efforts, and we talk only about what we have really achieved. Sustainability is crucial to our operations. And we’ve done just about everything — recycling, employing the disabled, support for refugees. The prices may be cheaper at Wal-Mart, but our products offer real quality for the price. We take the greatest care and time, and involve a lot of people. Our rivals are more careless. Q: What is behind Uniqlo’s success and what resonated with global buyers? A: When we say Uniqlo is 'made for all,' one might imagine products for the masses, like what’s at a Wal-Mart or a Target. But what we mean is a high-quality product that appeals to all people, including the extremely rich, not only those with sophisticated taste and intelligence, but also people who don’t know that much about clothes, and the design is fine-tuned, the material fine quality, and sustainability concerns have been addressed. We were first a retailer, then a manufacturer-cum-retailer. Now we are a digital consumer retailer. That is why we are successful. If we had stayed the same, then we can’t hope to succeed. Being a digital consumer retail company means we utilize information at a high level to shape the way we do our work. We gain information about our customers, the workers at the store, the market, all that information. Changing daily is the only way we can hope for stable growth. The world is changing every day. Q: Are you confident you can keep it up another 40 years? A: Of course. We’ve been preparing to reach 3 trillion yen ($20 billion) revenue all these years. And we are finally starting to be known. But we still have a long way to go. We are just getting started, and we are going to keep growing. There is more potential for growth in Europe and the U.S., as well as China and India, given the 1.4 billion population in each country. Clothing is a necessity, so population size is key. ___ Yuri Kageyama is on X: https://x.com/yurikageyama	https://apnews.com/article/uniqlo-clothing-japan-affordable-a37ecb0c4539dde266573ef76b2afc3c	2024-11-18T02:01:14-08:00	
Tanzanian government says rescue efforts will continue at collapsed building where 13 died	DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) — Rescue efforts at a building that collapsed, killing at least 13 people, in Tanzania’s commercial capital entered a third day Monday with the government saying they will continue until all those trapped inside are saved. The number of people trapped was unclear, but several people have told local media that they have lost contact with relatives who they believe were inside the building. More than 80 people have been rescued from the four-story building, which housed dozens of shops and collapsed Saturday morning. Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu said on Sunday that more than 20 people were receiving medical treatment and the government would cover the costs. She ordered an audit of all buildings in Dar Es Salaam's Kariakoo area, which is popular among traders, and asked police to obtain the ownership and construction permits for the collapsed building. Some of those who died were being buried on Monday. It is currently the rainy season, when building collapses are common in the east African country. Buildings that collapse are often found to have violated construction regulations.	https://apnews.com/article/tanzania-building-collapse-rescue-8c0813965bc06cfb6b27b7ff69bb5265	2024-11-18T01:25:48-08:00	
A Russian ballistic missile with cluster munitions kills 11 people and injures 84 in Ukraine's north	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A Russian ballistic missile with cluster munitions struck a residential area of a northern Ukraine city, killing 11 people including two children and injuring 84 others, officials said Monday. The two children killed in the strike on Sumy late Sunday were a 9-year-old boy and a 14-year-old girl, the regional prosecutor’s office said. Six injured children are in critical condition, it said. The attack damaged 15 buildings, including two educational facilities, the prosecutor’s office said. A search and rescue operation continued Monday, on the eve of the war’s 1,000-day milestone. Sumy lies 40 kilometers (24 miles) from the Russian border. Also Sunday, U.S. President Joe Biden authorized for the first time the use of U.S.-supplied longer-range missiles by Ukraine to strike inside Russia, after extensive lobbying by Ukrainian officials. The weapons are likely to be used in response to North Korea’s decision to send thousands of troops to support Russia in the Kursk region where Ukraine mounted a military incursion over the summer. It is the second time the U.S. has permitted the use of Western weapons inside Russian territory within limits after permitting the use of HIMARS systems, a shorter-range weapon, to stem Russia’s advance in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region in May. The first reaction from Ukraine to the long-awaited decision from the U.S. was notably restrained. 'Today, much is being said in the media about us receiving permission for the relevant actions. But strikes are not made with words. Such things are not announced. The missiles will speak for themselves,' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address. Earlier, Zelenskyy said that Russia had launched a total of 120 missiles and 90 drones in a large-scale attack across Ukraine, including Sumy. Russia deployed various types of drones, he said, including Iranian-made Shaheds, as well as cruise, ballistic and aircraft-launched ballistic missiles. The attack, which targeted Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, came as fears are mounting about Moscow’s intentions to devastate Ukraine’s power generation capacity ahead of the winter. Ukrainian defenses shot down 144 out of a total of 210 air targets, Ukraine’s air force reported. 'The enemy’s target was our energy infrastructure throughout Ukraine. Unfortunately, there is damage to objects from hits and falling debris. In Mykolaiv, as a result of a drone attack, two people were killed and six others were injured, including two children,' Zelenskyy said. Two more people were killed in the Odesa region, where the attack damaged energy infrastructure and disrupted power and water supplies, said local Gov. Oleh Kiper. Both victims were employees of Ukraine’s state-owned power grid operator, Ukrenergo, the company said hours later. The combined drone and missile attack was the most powerful in three months, according to the head of Kyiv’s City Military Administration, Serhii Popko. One person was injured after the roof of a five-story residential building caught fire in Kyiv’s historic center, according to Popko. A thermal power plant operated by private energy company DTEK was 'seriously damaged,' the company said. Russian strikes have hammered Ukraine’s power infrastructure since Moscow’s all-out invasion of its neighbor in February 2022, prompting repeated emergency power shutdowns and nationwide rolling blackouts. Ukrainian officials have routinely urged Western allies to bolster the country’s air defenses to counter assaults and allow for repairs. Russia’s Defense Ministry on Sunday acknowledged carrying out a 'mass' missile and drone attack on 'critical energy infrastructure' in Ukraine, but claimed all targeted facilities were tied to Kyiv’s military industry. Although Ukraine’s nuclear plants were not directly impacted, several electrical substations on which they depend suffered further damage, the U.N.’s nuclear energy watchdog said in a statement Sunday. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, only two of Ukraine’s nine operational reactors continue to generate power at full capacity. The Russian military said Monday it intercepted and destroyed 59 Ukrainian drones overnight over several Russian regions. Two were downed over the Moscow region that surrounds the Russian capital, and three others over the neighboring Tula region. A total of 54 drones were destroyed over the Bryansk, Kursk and Belgorod regions on the border with Ukraine, according to a statement by the Russian Defense Ministry. Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said the drones shot down outside of Moscow were heading toward the capital. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-missile-attack-sumy-5cd4f9fe2cee1ae8aed67d63c22b0703	2024-11-18T00:39:19-08:00	
New Zealand's founding treaty is at a flashpoint. Why are thousands protesting for Māori rights?	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — A proposed law that would redefine New Zealand’s founding treaty between the British Crown and Māori chiefs has triggered political turmoil and a march by thousands of people the length of the country to Parliament to protest it. The bill is never expected to become law. But it has become a flashpoint on race relations and a critical moment in the fraught 180-year-old conversation about how New Zealand should honor its promises to Indigenous people when the country was colonized -– and what those promises are. Tens of thousands are expected to throng the capital, Wellington, for the final stretch of the weeklong protest march on Tuesday. It follows a Māori tradition of hīkoi, or walking, to bring attention to breaches of the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi. Why is a 180-year-old treaty being debated? Considered New Zealand’s founding document, the treaty was signed between representatives of the British Crown and 500 Māori chiefs during colonization. It laid out principles guiding the relationship between the Crown and Māori, in two versions -– one in English and the other in Māori. It promised Māori the rights and privileges of British citizens, but the English and Māori versions differed on what power the chiefs were ceding over their affairs, lands and autonomy. Over decades, the Crown breached both versions. By the mid-20th century, Māori language and culture had dwindled -– Indigenous people were often barred from practicing it -- tribal land was confiscated and Māori were disadvantaged in many metrics. How were treaty rights revived? Prompted by a surging Māori protest movement, for the past 50 years the courts of New Zealand, lawmakers and the Waitangi Tribunal -– a permanent body set up to adjudicate treaty matters -– have navigated the differences in the treaty’s versions and tried to redress breaches by constructing the meaning of the treaty's principles in their decisions. Those principles are intended to be flexible but are commonly described as partnership with the Crown, protection of Māori interests and participation in decision-making. While Māori remain disenfranchised in many ways, the weaving of treaty recognition through law and attempts at redress have changed the fabric of society since then. Māori language has experienced a renaissance, and everyday words are now commonplace -– even among non-Māori. Policies have been enacted to target disparities Māori commonly face. Billions of dollars in settlements have been negotiated between the Crown and tribes for breaches of the treaty, particularly the widespread expropriation of Māori land and natural resources. Why is there fresh debate? Some New Zealanders, however, are unhappy with redress. They have found a champion in lawmaker David Seymour, the leader of a minor libertarian political party which won less than 9% of the vote in last year’s election -– but scored outsized influence for its agenda as part of a governing agreement. Seymour‘s proposed law would set specific definitions of the treaty’s principles, and would apply them to all New Zealanders, not only to Māori. He says piecemeal construction of the treaty’s meaning has left a vacuum and has given Māori special treatment. His bill is widely opposed — by left- and right-wing former prime ministers, 40 of the country’s most senior lawyers, and thousands of Māori and non-Māori New Zealanders who are walking the length of the country in protest. Seymour’s bill is not expected to pass its final reading. It cleared a first vote on Thursday due to a political deal, but most of those who endorsed it are not expected to do so again. Detractors say the bill threatens constitutional upheaval and would remove rights promised in the treaty that are now enshrined in law. Critics have also lambasted Seymour -– who is Māori -– for provoking backlash against Indigenous people. Why are protesters marching? Peaceful walking protests are a Māori tradition and have occurred before at crucial times during the national conversation about treaty rights. Police in the country of 5 million people say they expect 30,000 to march across Wellington to Parliament on Tuesday. Crowds of up to 10,000 people have joined the march in cities en route to Wellington. Many are marching to oppose Seymour’s bill. But others are protesting a range of policies from the center-right government on Māori affairs -– including an order, prompted by Seymour, that public agencies should no longer target policies to specifically redress Māori inequities.	https://apnews.com/article/treaty-waitangi-zealand-protest-principles-parliament-623dbb403ca78ad35cd96d9392e12778	2024-11-18T00:22:58-08:00	
Middle East latest: 2 young children and parents killed in an Israeli strike in Gaza, officials say	An Israeli strike hit a tent sheltering displaced people in the Gaza Strip, killing two children aged 7 and 9 and their parents, Palestinian officials said Monday. A third child, 10 years old, was wounded in the strike overnight in the southern city of Khan Younis, according to the Civil Defense, first responders who operate under the Hamas-run government. An Associated Press reporter saw the bodies at the nearby Nasser Hospital. The two children were beheaded by the blast and their remains were placed in one body bag. The Israeli military blames civilian deaths on Hamas, accusing militants of hiding among civilians and fighting from residential areas. It rarely comments on individual strikes, which often kill women and children. The war began when Hamas stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed over 43,800 Palestinians, according to local health authorities. They do not distinguish between militants and civilians but say most of those killed are women and children. The fighting has left some 76 people dead in Israel, including 31 soldiers. ___ Here's the Latest: 2 young children and their parents killed in an Israeli strike in Gaza, officials say KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip — An Israeli strike hit a tent sheltering displaced people in the Gaza Strip, killing two children aged 7 and 9 and their parents, Palestinian officials said.

US and Philippines sign a pact to secure shared military intelligence and weapons technology	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The United States and the Philippines signed an agreement on Monday to secure the exchange of highly confidential military intelligence and technology in key weapons the U.S. would provide to Manila. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and his Philippine counterpart, Gilberto Teodoro, signed the legally binding General Security of Military Information Agreement in Manila at a time when the longtime treaty allies have boosted their defense and military engagements, including large-scale joint combat drills, largely in response to China’s increasingly aggressive actions in Asia. The outgoing Biden administration has taken steps to strengthen an arc of military alliances across the Indo-Pacific region to better counter China, including in any future confrontation over Taiwan or in the disputed South China Sea, which Beijing has claimed almost in its entirety. That has dovetailed with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s thrust to strengthen his country’s external defenses given an alarming escalation of territorial confrontations between Chinese and Filipinos forces in the South China Sea. The Department of National Defense in Manila said the agreement aims to ensure the security of classified military information that would be exchanged between the U.S. and the Philippines. It will 'allow the Philippines access to higher capabilities and big-ticket items from the United States,' the Philippine defense department said. Neither side provided more details or released a copy of the agreement. Two Philippine security officials, however, have told The Associated Press that such an agreement, similar to ones Washington has signed with other allied countries, would allow the U.S. to provide the Philippines with higher-level intelligence and more sophisticated weapons, including missile systems. It would also provide the Philippine military access to U.S. satellite and drone surveillance systems with an assurance that such intelligence and details about sophisticated weapons would be kept highly secure to prevent possible leaks, the two Philippine officials said on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the sensitive issue publicly. Philippine efforts to obtain sophisticated weapons from the U.S. military in the past have been hampered by a lack of such an intelligence deal, including when Filipino forces were scrambling to fight a 2017 siege by Filipino and foreign militants aligned with the Islamic State group in southern Marawi city. Philippine forces, backed by U.S. and Australian spy planes, quelled the uprising after five months. Austin and Teodoro also attended a groundbreaking ceremony for a center where the U.S. and Philippine militaries would coordinate future joint operations, including the exchange of information. Austin said the center 'will be a place where our forces can work side-by-side to respond to regional challenges.' Austin renewed the U.S. commitment to the Philippines as an ally and told Teodoro that 'we are more than allies. We are family.' The coordinating center, Teodoro said, would provide 'a unified picture of the shared areas of responsibility and common approaches to threats against both our securities.' 'I’m sure it will benefit future generations of both our peoples to come because although we may change people, the values don’t change,' Teodoro said. The Philippine defense chief reiterated the crucial need for the U.S. security presence in the region, citing Marcos’s repeated statements that such a presence 'is essential for maintaining peace and stability in this region.' ___ Associated Press journalist Aaron Favila contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/philippines-us-general-security-of-military-information-agreement-4622f461bde4599a08be8c51d5f4db09	2024-11-17T23:38:51-08:00	
Climate talks in Azerbaijan head into their second week, coinciding with G20 in Rio	BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) — United Nations talks on getting money to curb and adapt to climate change resumed Monday with tempered hope that negotiators and ministers can work through disagreements and hammer out a deal after slow progress last week. That hope comes from the arrival of the climate and environment ministers from around the world this week in Baku, Azerbaijan, for the COP29 talks. They’ll give their teams instructions on ways forward. 'We are in a difficult place,' said Melanie Robinson, economics and finance program director of global climate at the World Resources Institute. 'The discussion has not yet moved to the political level — when it does I think ministers will do what they can to make a deal.' Talks in Baku are focused on getting more climate cash for developing countries to transition away from fossil fuels, adapt to climate change and pay for damages caused by extreme weather. But countries are far apart on how much money that will require. Several experts put the sum needed at around $1 trillion. 'One trillion is going to look like a bargain five, 10 years from now,' said Rachel Cleetus from the Union of Concerned Scientists, citing a multitude of costly recent extreme weather events from flooding in Spain to hurricanes Helene and Milton in the United States. 'We’re going to wonder why we didn’t take that and run with it.' Also on Monday, the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has been mulling a proposal to cut public spending for foreign fossil fuel projects. The OECD — made up of 38 member countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Japan and Germany — are discussing a deal that could prevent up to $40 billion worth of carbon-polluting projects. At COP29, activists are protesting the U.S., South Korea, Japan, and Turkey who they say are the key holdouts preventing the agreement in Paris from being finalized. 'It’s of critical importance that President Biden comes out in support. We know it’s really important that he lands a deal that Trump cannot undo. This can be really important for Biden’s legacy,' said Lauri van der Burg, Global Public Finance Lead at Oil Change international. 'If he comes around, this will help mount pressure on other laggards including Korea, Turkey and Japan.' Meanwhile, the world’s biggest decision makers are halfway around the world as another major summit convenes. Brazil is hosting the Group of 20 summit, which runs Nov. 18-19, bringing together many of the world's largest economies. Climate change — among other major topics like rising global tensions and poverty — will be on the agenda. Harjeet Singh, global engagement director for the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative, said G20 nations 'cannot turn their backs on the reality of their historical emissions and the responsibility that comes with it.' 'They must commit to trillions in public finance,' he said. In a written statement on Friday, United Nations Climate Change's executive secretary Simon Stiell said 'the global climate crisis should be order of business Number One' at the G20 meetings. Stiell noted that progress on stopping more warming should happen both in and out of climate talks, calling the G20's role 'mission-critical.' ___ Associated Press journalist Ahmed Hatem in Baku contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Young people, whose futures are at stake in UN climate talks, push through anger to fight for hope	BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) — Young people who attend the United Nations climate talks have a lot to be angry about. They've lost loved ones and months of school. They've lost homes and family farms and connections to their families' native lands. They haven't lost hope, though. Not yet. 'It has become so tiring for me to be just a poster child,' said Marinel Ubaldo, who by age 16 had watched two back-to-back supersized typhoons destroy entire communities in her native Philippines. Missing a chunk of high school in the aftermath, because there was no school to go back to, was a wake-up call. Now 27, COP29 will be her sixth time attending the summit where leaders negotiate the future she will inherit. 'I guess I'm very pessimistic, but I’m going to be positive that this COP could actually bring more clarity,' she said. Her pessimism isn't unwarranted. Fewer leaders were in attendance this year, with a backdrop of uncertainty as political will on climate unravels in major countries like the U.S. and Germany. While many passionate youth want to protest, this will be the third straight COP in an authoritarian country with tighter controls on protests and speech. And for many of the young people hardest hit by climate extremes, it's simply difficult and expensive to get to the conference. 'We have this constant challenge of having sometimes the youth forums with spaces at the margins of the decision maker spaces,' said Felipe Paullier, assistant secretary general for youth affairs in the United Nations youth office. That's why the U.N. has been working to institutionalize the role of youth in the climate talks, he said. And climate change has a disproportionate impact on children around the world. Their growing bodies have a harder time handling extreme heat, which also causes an uptick in premature births and childhood malnutrition, said UNICEF assistant secretary-general Kitty van der Heijden. 'We are simply not doing good enough for children in this world. We are failing children,' she said. All of that means young people are feeling the burden of speaking up about climate change more than ever. And many of those who come to COP, and even some of the ones who don't, said they feel tired — weighed down by the knowledge that year after year, they show up to speak and don't have a lot to show for it. This was the third year in a row that Earth's projected warming hasn't improved. 'I think for a lot of young people from extremely climate vulnerable nations, it actually it doesn’t feel like much of a choice' to speak out about climate change, said 20-year-old Fathimath Raaia Shareef, from the Maldives. Shareef's grandmother migrated south to the small island nation's capital, so she has never had the opportunity to see what her family's home island was like. Growing up, after she found out about sea level rise, she had recurring nightmares about her island sinking. She would wake up crying. 'How am I supposed to focus on anything else when when my island, when my home country is at risk?' she asked. It's that focus that brings many young people to the table even as they question their faith in the possibility that international negotiations can achieve real change. Here at his fourth COP, 15-year-old Francisco Vera Manzanares of Colombia called the U.N. summit a necessary but 'very difficult space' to be in. He thinks slow pace of change from countries around the world creates a 'credibility crisis' in the institutions that are most needed to keep the goals that require global cooperation within reach. 'People listen to children. But, let's say, it’s different (to) listen than hear,' he said. That's why he hopes more adults will help children meaningfully advocate for themselves in a crisis where they have the most to lose — and the most to save. 'It's our rights. It's our future. It's our present,' he said. ___ Follow Melina Walling on X, formerly Twitter, @MelinaWalling. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Typhoon Man-yi leaves 7 dead in landslide in Philippines and worsens crisis from back-to-back storms	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Typhoon Man-yi left at least seven people dead in a landslide, destroyed scores of houses and displaced large numbers of villagers before blowing away from the northern Philippines, worsening the crisis wreaked by multiple back-to-back storms, officials said Monday. Man-yi was one of the strongest of the six major storms to hit the northern Philippines in less than a month and had sustained winds of up to 195 kilometers (125 miles) per hour when it slammed into the eastern island province of Catanduanes on Saturday night. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. In Manila and offered his prayers, announcing an additional $1 million in humanitarian aid for typhoon victims. He told Marcos he has authorized U.S. troops to help Filipino forces provide lifesaving aid. Torrential rains and fierce wind unleashed by Man-yi set off a landslide early Monday in the northern town of Ambaguio in Nueva Vizcaya province that buried a house and killed seven people, including children, and injured three others inside, regional police chief Brig. Gen. Antonio P. Marallag Jr. said. Army troops, police and villagers were scrambling to search for three other people who were believed to have been entombed in the avalanche of mud, boulders and uprooted trees, Marallag said. Disaster response officials said they were checking if the deaths of two villagers in a motorcycle accident and an electrocution were directly related to Man-yi’s onslaught so they could be added to the overall death toll. They said a separate search was underway for a couple and their child after their shanty was swept away in rampaging rivers in northern Nueva Ecija province. More than a million people were affected by the typhoon and two previous storms, including nearly 700,000 who fled their homes and moved to emergency shelters or relatives' homes, according to the Official of Civil Defense. Nearly 8,000 houses were damaged or destroyed and more than 100 cities and towns were hit by power outages due to toppled electric posts, it said. In the worst-hit province of Camarines, officials pleaded for additional help after fierce winds and rain damaged more houses and cut off electricity and water supplies in the entire province, along with cellphone connections in many areas, provincial information officer Camille Gianan said. Welfare officials transported food aid, drinking water and other help but more is needed over the coming months, Gianan said. Many villagers will need construction materials to rebuild their houses, she said. 'They have not recovered from the previous storms when the super typhoon hit,' Gianan told The Associated Press. 'It’s been one calamity after another.' The rare number of back-to-back storms and typhoons that lashed Luzon — the country's largest and most populous island — in just three weeks left more than 160 people dead, affected 9 million people and caused such extensive damage to communities, infrastructure and farmlands that the Philippines may have to import more rice, a staple food. In an emergency meeting as Man-yi approached, Marcos asked his Cabinet and provincial officials to brace for 'the worst-case scenario.' At least 26 domestic airports and two international airports were briefly shut and inter-island ferry and cargo services were suspended due to rough seas, stranding thousands of passengers and commuters. Most transport services have now resumed, according to the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippine and the coast guard. The U.S., Manila’s treaty ally, along with Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei provided cargo aircraft and other storm aid to help the government’s overwhelmed disaster-response agencies. Last month, the first major storm, Trami, left scores of people dead after dumping one to two months’ worth of rain in just 24 hours in several towns. The Philippines is battered by about 20 typhoons and storms each year. It’s often hit by earthquakes and has more than a dozen active volcanoes, making it one of the world’s most disaster-prone countries.	https://apnews.com/article/philippines-typhoon-manyi-04db73a5ee97fed4fbf12c342c4e7bb8	2024-11-17T20:48:47-08:00	
New Delhi closes schools, bans construction as air pollution shoots up to worst level this season	NEW DELHI (AP) — Authorities in India’s capital shut schools, halted construction and banned non-essential trucks from entering the city on Monday after air pollution shot up to its worst level this season. Residents of New Delhi woke up to thick, toxic smog enveloping the city of some 33 million as the air quality became increasingly hazardous. It rose further into the severe category, according to SAFAR, the country’s main environmental agency, which measures tiny particulate matter in the air that can enter deep into the lungs. The deadly haze covered monuments and high-rise buildings in the capital, with visibility so low that airlines warned of delays. In several areas of the city, pollution levels were more than 50 times higher than the World Health Organization’s recommended safe limit. Forecasts say the poor air quality will continue into the week. Air pollution in northern India rises every year, particularly in winter, as farmers burn crop residue in agricultural areas. The burning coincides with colder temperatures, which trap the smoke in the air. The smoke is then blown into cities, where auto emissions add to the pollution. Emissions from industries and the burning of coal to produce electricity are also linked to the pollution, which has been steadily ticking up in recent weeks. Starting Monday, authorities began enforcing stage 4 of a graded response action plan, or GRAP 4, based on the severity of the air pollution. Earlier stages of the plan were already in place, and stage 4 includes stricter curbs. Classes for all grades except 10 and 12 will be held online and no trucks will be allowed to enter the city except for those carrying essential items. Some older, diesel guzzling vehicles have been banned inside the city, and all construction activities have been halted. Authorities also urged children, the elderly and others with chronic diseases or respiratory issues to avoid going outside as much as possible. Over the weekend, farmers in neighboring Uttar Pradesh state burned their fields, releasing plumes of gray smoke that winds likely carried into New Delhi and other nearby areas. Despite the poisonous air, many in the capital continued their usual routines, including morning walks in the city’s beloved Lodhi Garden. 'Everyone has a sore throat,' said Sanjay Goel, a 51-year-old shopkeeper in New Delhi. 'They should ban crop residue burning ... it's just smoke everywhere.' The worsening air quality in the capital also sparked outrage from residents on social media. Many complained of headaches and hacking coughs, describing the city as 'apocalyptic' and a 'gas chamber.' Others urged officials to solve the public health crisis once and for all. Several studies have estimated more than a million Indians die each year from pollution-related diseases. Authorities have invoked similar measures in the past and have at times deployed water sprinklers and anti-smog guns in an attempt to control the haze. But critics say there needs to be a long-term solution that drastically reduces pollution itself, instead of actions that aim to mitigate the effects after it has already plagued the region.	https://apnews.com/article/new-delhi-air-pollution-india-ae1ec1e6292009db198f18b113047cd5	2024-11-17T20:32:16-08:00	
As China cracks down on bookstores at home, Chinese-language booksellers are flourishing overseas	WASHINGTON (AP) — Yu Miao smiles as he stands among the 10,000 books crowded on rows of bamboo shelves in his newly reopened bookstore. It’s in Washington’s vibrant Dupont Circle neighborhood, far from its last location in Shanghai, where the Chinese government forced him out of business six years ago. 'There is no pressure from the authorities here,' said Yu, the owner of JF Books, Washington’s only Chinese bookseller. 'I want to live without fear.' Independent bookstores have become a new battleground in China, swept up in the ruling Communist Party’s crackdown on dissent and free expression. The Associated Press found that at least a dozen bookstores in the world’s second-largest economy have been shuttered or targeted for closure in the last few months alone, squeezing the already tight space for press freedom. One bookstore owner was arrested over four months ago. The crackdown has had a chilling effect on China’s publishing industry. Bookstores are common in China, but many are state-owned. Independent bookstores are governed by an intricate set of rules with strict controls now being more aggressively policed, according to bookstore owners. Printing shops and street vendors are also facing more rigorous government inspections by the National Office Against Pornography and Illegal Publication. The office did not respond to interview requests from The Associated Press. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in a statement to AP, said it was not aware of a crackdown on bookstores. Yu isn't alone in taking his business out of the country. Chinese bookstores have popped up in Japan, France, Netherlands and elsewhere in the U.S. in recent years, as a result of both stricter controls in China and growing Chinese communities abroad. It’s not just the books' contents that are making Chinese authorities wary. In many communities, bookstores are cultural centers where critical thinking is encouraged, and conversations can veer into politics and other topics not welcomed by the authorities. The bookstore owner who was arrested was Yuan Di, also called Yanyou, the founder of Jiazazhi, an artistic bookstore in Shanghai and Ningbo on China’s eastern coast. He was taken away by police in June, according to Zhou Youlieguo, who closed his own bookstore in Shanghai in September. Yuan's arrest was also confirmed by two other people who declined to be named for fear of retribution. The charge against Yuan is unclear. An official in Ningbo's Bureau of Culture, Radio Television and Tourism, which oversees bookstores, declined comment, noting the case is under investigation. The Ningbo police didn’t respond to an interview request. Michael Berry, director of UCLA's Center for Chinese Studies, said a sluggish Chinese economy may be driving the government to exert greater control. 'The government might be feeling that this is a time to be more cautious and control this kind of discourse in terms of what people are consuming and reading to try to put a damper on any potential unrest and kind of nip it in the bud,' Berry said. These bookstore owners face dual pressures, Berry added. One is the political clampdown; the other is the global movement, especially among young people, toward digital media and away from print publications. Wang Yingxing sold secondhand books in Ningbo for almost two decades before being ordered to close in August. Local officials informed Wang he lacked a publication business license even though he wasn’t eligible to obtain one as a second-hand seller. Faded outlines marked the spot where a sign for Fatty Wang’s Bookstore once hung. Spray-painted black letters on the bookstore’s window read: 'Temporarily closed'. 'We’re promoting culture, I’m not doing anything wrong, right? I’m just selling some books and promoting culture,' Wang said, tying a bundle of books together with brown wrapper and white nylon string. 'Then why won’t you leave me alone?' Wang added. Half a dozen other people heaved boxes of books into the back of a van. The books, Wang said, were being sold to cafe and bar owners who wanted to burnish little libraries for their patrons. Some would be sent to a warehouse in Anhui. The rest, he said, were to be sent to a recycling station to be pulped and destroyed. Bookstores are not the only target. Central authorities have also cracked down on other places such as printing shops, internet bars, gaming rooms and street vendors. Strict inspections have taken place all over the country, according to Chinese authorities. Authorities in Shanghai inspected printing places and bookstores, looking for 'printing, copying or selling illegal publications,' according to a government document. This shows the authorities are not just barring the sale of some publications, but tracing them back to the printing process. They found some printing stores did not 'register the copy content as required' and demanded they fix the problem quickly. In Shaoyang, a city in China’s south, authorities said they will be 'cracking down on harmful publications in accordance with the law.' The Communist Party has various powers to control which books are available. Any publication without a China Standard Book Number is considered illegal, including self-published books and those imported without special licenses. Books can be banned even after they are published if restrictions are later tightened — often for unclear reasons — or if the writers say something upsetting to the Chinese authorities. Yet despite these restrictions and the crackdown on existing booksellers, more bookstores are opening. Recent figures are unavailable, but a survey by Bookdao, a media company that focuses on the book industry, shows more than twice as many bookstores opened than closed in China in 2020. Liu Suli, who has been running All Sages Books in Beijing for over three decades, says there are many idealists in the industry. 'Everyone who reads has a dream of having a bookstore,' Liu says, despite the challenges. In many cases, those dreams are being fulfilled outside China. Yu and other Chinese booksellers around the world stock their shelves with books from Hong Kong, Taiwan and mainland China, as well as books published locally. Zhang Jieping, founder of Nowhere, a bookstore in Taiwan and Thailand, said there's a growing demand for books from migrants who left China after the COVID-19 pandemic. 'They don’t just want to speak fluent English or Japanese to fit in, they want cultural autonomy,' Zhang said. 'They want more community spaces. Not necessarily a bookstore, but in any format — a gallery, or a restaurant.' Li Yijia is a 22-year-old student who arrived in Washington from Beijing in August. One Sunday morning, she wandered through JF Books where she found titles in Chinese and English. She said a Chinese bookstore feels like 'another world in a bubble' which helps her critical thinking by allowing her to read books in both languages. 'It also relieves homesickness, like a Chinese restaurant,' Li added. The closure of the bookstores leads the owners to different paths. Some ended up in jail, some went looking for jobs to feed their families. Some started a journey to leave censorship behind. Since he closed his Shanghai bookstore, Zhou, 39, has moved to Los Angeles, but hasn't decided what his next step will be. He said his fully licensed independent bookstore, which sold art books and self-published works by artists and translators, was fined thousands of dollars and he was interrogated over a dozen times during the past four years. He's seen colleagues jailed for selling 'illegal publications.' All the self-published book artists and editors he worked with asked him to take down their work after warnings by local authorities. Zhou said he could not handle further harassment He said it was as if he were 'smuggling drugs instead of selling books.' The existence of his bookstore, Zhou said, was 'a rebellion and a resistance,' which is not there anymore. ___ Associated Press writer Dake Kang in Ningbo, China, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/china-bookstores-crackdown-shanghai-ba54f48c08c2ed4352534e2183a07ad1	2024-11-17T20:09:11-08:00	
Stock market today: Asian shares are mixed after Wall Street suffers worst loss since Election Day	BANGKOK (AP) — Shares started out the week mixed in Asia after U.S. stocks fell to their worst loss since Election Day. U.S. futures were higher, with the S&amp;P 500 contract up 0.3% and that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.1% as speculation mounted over who President-elect Donald Trump might nominate to be his Treasury secretary. Japan's Nikkei 225 index dropped 1.1% to 38,220.85 as the yen initially regained some strength against the U.S. dollar after the central bank governor, Kazuo Ueda, indicated that the Bank of Japan will continue to raise interest rates as conditions permit. The dollar inched up to 154.58 Japanese yen from 154.54 yen late Friday. It had been trading above 156 yen last week. South Korea's Kospi jumped 2.2% to 2,469.07 after Samsung Electronics, the country's biggest company, announced a share buyback plan. Samsung's shares jumped 6%. Chinese markets were mixed. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong added 0.8% to 19,572.34, while the Shanghai Composite index shed early gains to close down 0.2% at 3,323.55. Elsewhere in Asia, Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 edged 0.2% higher, to 8,300.20. Taiwan's Taiex lost 0.9% and the SET in Bangkok picked up 0.8% as the government announced that Thailand's economy grew more than expected in the last quarter. On Friday, U.S. stocks tumbled Friday with the waning of the 'Trump bump' that Wall Street got from last week’s presidential election, along with a cut to interest rates by the Federal Reserve. The S&amp;P 500 dropped 1.3% to 5,870.62, for its worst day since before Election Day to close out a losing week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.7% to 43,444.99, and the Nasdaq composite sank 2.2% to 18,680.12. Vaccine manufacturers helped drag the market down after President-elect Donald Trump said he wants Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent anti-vaccine activist, to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Moderna tumbled 7.3%, and Pfizer fell 4.7% amid concerns about a possible hit to profits. Kennedy still needs confirmation from the Senate to get the job, and some analysts are skeptical about his chances. Biotech stocks broadly sank to some of the market’s worst losses, but the sharpest drop in the S&amp;P 500 came from Applied Materials. It fell 9.2% as it forecast a range of future revenue below analysts' expectations, even though it reported a stronger-than-anticipated profit for the latest quarter. Companies face pressure to deliver big growth since their stock prices have been rising so much faster than their earnings. That’s made the stock market look pricey by a range of measures. The S&amp;P 500 is still up 23% for the year and not far from its all-time high set on Monday, despite last week’s weakness. Stocks had been broadly roaring since Election Day, when Trump’s victory sent a jolt through financial markets worldwide. Investors immediately began sending up stocks of banks, smaller U.S. companies and cryptocurrencies as they laid bets on the winners coming out of Trump’s preference for higher tariffs, lower tax rates and lighter regulation. But investors are also taking into account some of the potential downsides from Trump’s return to the White House, including worries that his policies could spur bigger U.S. government deficits and faster inflation. That’s forced traders to rethink how much relief the Federal Reserve could give the economy next year through cuts to interest rates. The Fed earlier this month lowered its main interest rate for the second time this year, and past forecasts indicated Fed officials saw more cuts as likely through 2025. On Thursday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell suggested the U.S. central bank may be cautious about future decisions on interest rates. 'The economy is not sending any signals that we need to be in a hurry to lower rates,' Powell said, though he declined to discuss how Trump’s potential policies could alter things. A report Friday showed shoppers spent more at U.S. retailers last month than expected, suggesting consumer spending, the most influential force on the economy, remains solid. In other dealings early Monday, U.S. benchmark crude oil added 13 cents to $67.15 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude climbed 27 cents to $71.31 per barrel. The euro bought $1.0543, up from $1.0534 late Friday.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-trump-fed-samsung-b80ab78cee5382e0d17ea058f123ace7	2024-11-17T20:08:18-08:00	
Brazil hosts a G20 summit overshadowed by wars and Trump's return, aiming for a deal to fight hunger	RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — With Brazil preparing to host the Group of 20 summit, it appears unlikely the leading rich and developing nations will sign on to a meaningful declaration regarding geopolitics: The meeting Monday and Tuesday in Rio de Janeiro is overshadowed by two major wars and Donald Trump's recent election victory. Heightened global tensions and uncertainty about an incoming Trump administration have tempered any expectations for a strongly worded statement addressing the conflicts in the Middle East and between Russia and Ukraine. Experts instead anticipate a final document focused on social issues like the eradication of hunger — one of Brazil's priorities — even if it aims to include at least a mention of the ongoing wars. 'Brazilian diplomacy has been strongly engaged in this task, but to expect a substantively strong and consensual declaration in a year like 2024 with two serious international conflicts is to set the bar very high,' said Cristiane Lucena Carneiro, an international relations professor at the University of Sao Paulo. After Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silvathwarted far-right former President Jair Bolsonaro 's reelection bid in 2022, there was some excitement in the international community at the prospect of the leftist leader and savvy diplomat — who Barack Obama once called 'the most popular politician on Earth' — hosting the G20. Bolsonaro had little personal interest in international summits, let foreign policy be guided by ideology and clashed with several leaders, including France’s Emmanuel Macron. Lula took office and often quoted a catchphrase: 'Brazil is back.' Brazil under Lula has reverted to its decades-old principle of non-alignment to carve out a policy that best safeguards its interests in an increasingly multipolar world. That involves talking to all parties, which experts say gave Brazil a privileged position to host a summit such as the G20. But his administration's foreign policy has at times raised eyebrows. A Brazil-China peace plan for Russia and Ukraine doesn't call for Russia's withdrawal from Ukraine and has been slammed by Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy. And Lula sparked a diplomatic incident with Israel after comparing its actions in Gaza to the Holocaust. Donald Trump’s win in the U.S. presidential election earlier this month and the imminent return of an America First doctrine may also hamper the diplomatic spirit needed for broad agreement on divisive issues. 'If we have one certainty, it is regarding Donald Trump’s skepticism towards multilateralism,' Carneiro said. Two officials from Brazil and one from another G20 nation say Argentine negotiators are standing in the way of a joint declaration. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Two of them said Argentina’s negotiators have raised several objections to the draft. They most vehemently oppose a clause calling for a global tax on the super-rich — which they had previously accepted, in July — and another promoting gender equality. Ambassador Mauricio Lyrio, Brazil’s key negotiator at G20, told journalists on Nov. 8 that the leaders’ final declaration should address the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, but that diplomats were still discussing how to reach universally acceptable language. 'The main message, naturally, is that we need to achieve peace not only regarding these conflicts but all conflicts,' he said in the capital Brasilia, adding that Lula's launch of a global alliance against hunger and poverty on Monday is just as important as the final statement. 'The leaders’ declaration will be the crowning achievement. But, at the same time, as instructed by the president himself, we have a G20 focused on concrete actions, such as the launch of a Global Alliance Against Hunger, with a package of very concrete social programs and innovative mechanisms to meet the resources needed for implementing them.' Lula, a former trade unionist who hails from a humble background, made the fight against hunger a priority during his first two terms as president (2003-2010) both at home and abroad. The number of undernourished Brazilians fell by more than 80% in 10 years, according to a 2014 U.N. report. Lula's hunger alliance is the only one of Brazil’s primary aims for a G20 declaration that will be obtained, according to Thomas Traumann, a former government minister and a political consultant based in Rio. 'Brazil wanted a global deal to fight poverty, a project to finance green transition and some consensus over a global tax for the super rich. Only the first one has survived,' Traumann said. President Joe Biden will attend the summit after a stop in Lima for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum and then travel on to Manaus, a city in Brazil's Amazon rainforest. It will be the first time a sitting American president sets foot in the Amazon, and the trip’s objective is to highlight 'commitment to environmental protection and respect for local cultures,' according to a Nov. 12 statement from the U.S. Embassy in Brazil. White House officials insist that Biden’s visits to APEC and the G20 will be substantive, with talks on climate issues, global infrastructure, counternarcotic efforts and one-on-one meetings with global leaders, including Chinese President Xi Jinping. Those officials say Biden also will use the summits to press allies to keep up support for Ukraine as it tries to fend off Russia’s invasion and not lose sight of finding an end to the wars in Lebanon and Gaza. Any commitments Biden makes may be overturned by the next White House administration, according to Danielle Ayres, an international relations professor at the Federal University of Santa Catarina. 'It would mean Trump would have to be proactive and say the U.S. is not going to do something to which it signed up for internationally,' Ayres said. 'That has a cost. It generates insecurity, a bad perception on behalf of the international community towards Trump.' Trump’s election may also cause other countries to look toward China as a more reliable partner. Xi Jinping's inauguration of the Chancay megaport in Peru on Thursday was perhaps the clearest sign of Latin America’s reorientation. A notable absentee at the G20 will be Russia’s President Vladimir Putin, against whom the International Criminal Court has issued a warrant that obliges member states to arrest him, and Russia’s delegation will be led by Sergey Lavrov. Israel is not a G20 member. 'The latest G20 meetings were somewhat depleted and became just another moment for bilateral meetings of heads of government. As Putin is out, Lula managed Ukraine not to be a topic, just as much as Israel. But Trump’s election takes from Lula the chance of being the star on the stage,' Traumann said. ___ Associated Press writer Gabriela Sá Pessoa contributed from Sao Paulo.	https://apnews.com/article/brazil-g20-rio-de-janeiro-wars-trump-12f7a09b8f79229509de52c92c0a074c	2024-11-17T20:05:14-08:00	
45 pro-democracy activists face sentencing in Hong Kong. Here's who some of them are	HONG KONG (AP) — Dozens of prominent Hong Kong pro-democracy activists are scheduled to be sentenced Tuesday in the largest case under a national security law that critics say crushed political activism in the semi-autonomous Chinese city. The convictions of the 45 activists under the Beijing-imposed law are widely seen as part of a crackdown by China that destroyed hopes for a more democratic Hong Kong. They face sentences of up to life imprisonment. The activists were among 47 people charged with conspiracy to commit subversion in 2021 for their involvement in an unofficial primary election to pick opposition candidates. They were accused of agreeing to veto government-proposed budgets indiscriminately after securing a legislative majority to force a dissolution of the legislature and then the ouster of the city's leader. Three government-approved judges ruled that the plan to achieve political change through the unofficial primary in 2020 would have undermined the government’s authority and created a constitutional crisis. Thirty-one of the activists pleaded guilty and 14 others were found guilty in May following a trial. Two were acquitted. Those who entered guilty pleas have a better chance of shorter prison terms. Some of the convicted activists have sought lesser sentences by expressing remorse and apologizing. Others have remained defiant. Here are profiles of some of the leading activists. Benny Tai Riding on a wave of anti-government protests in 2019, Benny Tai, a former law professor at the University of Hong Kong, co-organized the primary election that drew 610,000 voters — over 13% of the city’s registered electorate. The primary was aimed at selecting pro-democracy candidates who would then run in the official election. The judges said Tai stated that acquiring a legislative majority was a 'constitutional weapon of mass destruction' that would allow the pro-democracy camp to veto government budgets. Under the city’s Basic Law, or mini-constitution, the city leader can dissolve the legislature if a budget cannot be passed. But the leader must step down if the budget is again blocked by the next legislature. The judges said Tai aimed to 'undermine, destroy or overthrow the existing political system and structure' of Hong Kong. Tai pleaded guilty to the charge. In seeking a shorter sentence, his lawyer said Tai always supported non-violence and believed his actions were legal. Tai was not always viewed as a threat by authorities. He was a member of a consultative committee that helped collect views on the drafting of the Basic Law before the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997. In 2001, the government awarded him a medal of honor for promoting civic education, though it was withdrawn in 2022. Tai is perhaps best known as a co-founder of the city’s 2014 Occupy Movement, during which demonstrators occupied streets and brought traffic to a standstill in some areas for nearly 80 days, demanding direct elections for the city’s leader. Joshua Wong Joshua Wong rose to fame in Hong Kong in 2012 as a high school student leading protests against the introduction of national education in the city’s schools. Two years later, he became world famous as a leader of the Occupy Movement. In 2016, Wong co-founded a political party named 'Demosisto' with fellow young activists Nathan Law and Agnes Chow. In the 2019 pro-democracy movement, Wong helped seek overseas support for the protests. His activism led Beijing to label him an advocate of Hong Kong's independence who 'begged for interference' by foreign forces. Demosisto disbanded when Beijing imposed the security law in 2020. Wong won in the primary election, but the government postponed the official election, citing public health risks during the COVID-19 pandemic. Wong has pleaded guilty and asked for a lesser sentence. His lawyer said he hoped 'he could part with his history and would be able to reform himself' after completing it. Wu Chi-wai Wu Chi-wai is the former chair of Hong Kong's biggest pro-democracy party, the Democratic Party, which some activists saw as too moderate. In 2006, the government awarded Wu a medal of honor for community service. Wu entered a guilty plea, with his lawyer saying he has been in public service for over 30 years and that he and his party did not seek indiscriminate vetoing of budgets. Three former government officials wrote letters seeking a reduced sentence for him. Wu's parents passed away during his detention and he could only briefly attend their funerals. Gordon Ng Gordon Ng, a dual citizen of Australia and Hong Kong, was initially named an organizer of the primary by prosecutors, an accusation Ng denied. He pleaded not guilty. The judges acknowledged in their verdict that Ng did not organize the plan and was not a candidate. However, they pointed to his campaign urging voters to support primary winners through social media posts and a front-page advertisement in the now-shuttered pro-democracy Apple Daily newspaper, founded by Jimmy Lai. In seeking a lesser sentence, Ng said his support for the primary was linked to his belief that it could address the differences within the pro-democracy camp, which had long been plagued by infighting. He said he never asked candidates to promise to veto budgets.	https://apnews.com/article/hong-kong-prodemocracy-activists-sentencing-f2c36e5da3e974f54595447050280eee	2024-11-17T18:51:16-08:00	
Suspected attack by Yemen's Houthi rebels targets ship in the Red Sea	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — A suspected attack by Yemen's Houthi rebels targeted a commercial ship late Sunday night traveling through the southern reaches of the Red Sea, though it caused no damage nor injuries, authorities said. The attack comes as the rebels continue their monthslong assault targeting shipping through a waterway that typically sees $1 trillion in goods pass through it a year over the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and Israel’s ground offensive in Lebanon. A ship's captain saw that 'a missile splashed in close proximity to the vessel' as it traveled near the Bab el-Mandeb Strait connecting the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden, the British military's United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center said in an alert. The attack happened some 30 miles (48 kilometers) west of Yemen port city of Mocha. 'The vessel and crew are safe and proceeding to its next port of call,' the UKMTO added. The Houthis did not immediately claim the attack. However, it can take the rebels hours or even days to acknowledge their assaults. The Houthis have targeted more than 90 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started in October 2023. They seized one vessel and sank two in the campaign, which also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have included Western military vessels as well. The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the U.K. to force an end to Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran. The Houthis have shot down multiple American MQ-9 Reaper drones as well. In the rebels' last attack on Nov. 11, two U.S. Navy warships targeted with multiple drones and missiles as they were traveling through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, but the attacks were not successful.	https://apnews.com/article/yemen-red-sea-attack-houthis-mideast-wars-8c86509962cbb3d41fa1ceb2e200c7b8	2024-11-17T16:43:04-08:00	
Poultry infected with bird flu found on commercial farm in England	Poultry on a commercial farm in England have been infected with the bird flu virus, the U.K. government said Sunday. The H5N1 virus was found in kept birds in St. Ives, a seaside town in Cornwall. All the poultry in the infected area will be humanely culled, according to the Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs. It was England's first confirmation of H5N1 in kept birds this season. The virus was also recently found in wild birds in the southwest of England and in continental Europe, the department said. The H5N1 bird flu has been spreading in the U.S. among wild birds, poultry, cows and other animals. Recently, health officials in Canada confirmed that a British Columbia teen had contracted bird flu and said the virus was related to a poultry outbreak in the province.	https://apnews.com/article/bird-flu-outbreak-farm-england-dce7600e0dba5de59b68bf379307ef9c	2024-11-17T14:17:40-08:00	
Gabon votes yes on new constitution a year after the military seized power	LIBREVILLE, Gabon (AP) — Voters in Gabon overwhelmingly approved a new constitution, authorities said Sunday, more than one year after mutinous soldiers overthrew the country’s longtime president and seized power in the oil-rich Central African nation. Over 91% of voters approved the new constitution in a referendum held on Saturday, Gabon's Interior Minister Hermann Immongault said in a statement read on state television. Turnout was an estimated 53.5%, he added. The final results will be announced by the Constitutional Court, the interior minister said. The draft constitution, which proposes sweeping changes that could prevent dynastic rule and transfer of power, needed more than 50% of the votes cast to be adopted. In 2023, soldiers toppled President Ali Bongo Ondimba and put him under house arrest, accusing him of irresponsible governance and massive embezzlement that risked leading the country into chaos. The junta released Ondimba a week later on humanitarian grounds, allowing him travel abroad for medical treatment. The soldiers proclaimed their Republican Guard chief, Gen. Brice Clotaire Oligui Nguema, as president of a transitional committee to lead the country. Oligui is a cousin of Bongo. Bongo had served two terms since coming to power in 2009 after the death of his father, who ruled the country for 41 years. His rule was marked by widespread discontent with his reign. A coup attempt in 2019 failed. The draft constitution imposes a seven-year term, renewable only once, instead of the current charter that allows for five-year terms renewable without limit. It also says family members cannot succeed a president and abolishes the position of prime minister. The former French colony is a member of OPEC but its oil wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few — and nearly 40% of Gabonese aged 15 to 24 were out of work in 2020, according to the World Bank. Its oil export revenue was $6 billion in 2022, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.	https://apnews.com/article/gabon-referendum-constitution-approved-ee9724fb660ca97efd82946a88c4545d	2024-11-17T13:57:19-08:00	
Biden authorizes Ukraine to use US-supplied longer range missiles for deeper strikes inside Russia	MANAUS, Brazil (AP) — President Joe Biden has authorized Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied missiles to strike deeper inside Russia, easing limitations on the longer range weapons as Russia deploys thousands of North Korean troops to reinforce its war, according to a U.S. official and three other people familiar with the matter. The decision allowing Kyiv to use the Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMs, for attacks farther inside Russia comes as President Vladimir Putin positions North Korean troops along Ukraine's northern border to try to reclaim hundreds of miles of territory seized by Ukrainian forces. Biden's move also follows the presidential election victory of Donald Trump, who has said he would bring about a swift end to the war and raised uncertainty about whether his administration would continue the United States' vital military support for Ukraine. The official and the others knowledgeable about the matter were not authorized to discuss the U.S. decision publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's reaction Sunday was notably restrained. 'Strikes are not made with words,' he said during his nightly video address. 'Such things are not announced. The missiles will speak for themselves.' Zelenskyy and many of his Western supporters have been pressing Biden for months to allow Ukraine to strike military targets deeper inside Russia with Western-supplied missiles, saying the U.S. ban had made it impossible for Ukraine to try to stop Russian attacks on its cities and electrical grids. Zelenskyy's statement came shortly after he posted a message of condolence on Telegram following a Russian attack on a nine-story building that killed at least eight people in the northern city of Sumy, 40 kilometers (24 miles) from the border with Russia. Russia also launched a massive drone and missile attack, described by officials as the largest in recent months, targeting energy infrastructure and killing civilians. The attack came as fears are mounting about Moscow’s intentions to devastate Ukraine’s power generation capacity before the winter. 'And this is the answer to everyone who tried to achieve something with Putin through talks, phone calls, hugs and appeasement,' Zelenskyy said. The comment appeared to be a dig at German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who spoke Friday with Putin in the first such call with a sitting head of a major Western power in nearly two years. Some supporters have argued that the limitation and other U.S. constraints could cost Ukraine the war. The debate has become a source of disagreement among Ukraine’s NATO allies. Biden had remained opposed, determined to hold the line against any escalation that he felt could draw the U.S. and other NATO members into direct conflict with nuclear-armed Russia. Putin has warned that Moscow could provide long-range weapons to others to strike Western targets if NATO allies allow Ukraine to use their arms to attack Russian territory. News of Biden's decision followed meetings over the last two days with the leaders of South Korea, Japan and China. The addition of North Korean troops was central to the talks, which took place on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Peru. Biden did not mention the decision during a speech at a stop in the Amazon rainforest in Brazil on his way to the Group of 20 summit. Asked about the decision, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told reporters that the U.N. position is 'to avoid a permanent deterioration of the war in Ukraine.' 'We want peace, we want fair peace,' Guterres said Sunday before the summit in Rio de Janeiro. He didn't elaborate. The longer-range missiles are likely to be used in response to North Korea’s decision to support Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, according to one of the people familiar with the development. The overall supply of ATACMS missiles is short, so U.S. officials in the past have questioned whether they could give Ukraine enough to make a difference. Some supporters of Ukraine say that even a few strikes deeper inside Russia would force its military to change deployments and expend more of its resources. North Korea has provided thousands of troops to Russia to help Moscow try to claw back land in the Kursk border region that Ukraine seized this year. The introduction of North Korean troops to the conflict comes as Moscow has seen a favorable shift in momentum. Trump has signaled that he could push Ukraine to agree to give up some land seized by Russia to find an end to the conflict. As many as 12,000 North Korean troops have been sent to Russia, according to U.S., South Korean and Ukrainian assessments. U.S. and South Korean intelligence officials say North Korea also has provided Russia with significant amounts of munitions to replenish its dwindling weapons stockpiles. Trump, who takes office in January, spoke for months as a candidate about wanting Russia’s war in Ukraine to be over, but he mostly ducked questions about whether he wanted U.S. ally Ukraine to win. He also repeatedly slammed the Biden administration for giving Kyiv tens of billions of dollars in aid. His victory has Ukraine’s international backers worrying that any rushed settlement would mostly benefit Putin. America is Ukraine’s most valuable ally in the war, providing more than $56.2 billion in security assistance since Russian forces invaded in February 2022. Worried about Russia’s response, however, the Biden administration repeatedly has delayed providing some specific advanced weapons sought by Ukraine, agreeing only under pressure from Kyiv, its supporters and in consultation with allies. That includes initially refusing Zelenskyy’s pleas for advanced tanks, Patriot air defense systems and F-16 fighter jets, among other systems. The White House agreed in May to allow Ukraine to use U.S.-provided weaponry for limited strikes just across the border with Russia. ___ Long, Miller, Knickmeyer and Lee reported from Washington.

Protesters in separatist Georgian region occupy government buildings, calling for leader's ouster	TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — Opposition protesters in Georgia’s breakaway province of Abkhazia on Sunday refused to cede control of key government buildings seized during rallies earlier in the week during which at least 14 people were injured in clashes with police. Demonstrators stormed the buildings Friday to protest new measures allowing Russians to buy property in the seaside region. Protesters on Sunday continued to demand the ouster of self-styled Abkhazian President Aslan Bzhania, and one prominent politician vowed that the opposition would form a rival government if he refuses to step down. 'If our demands for the president’s resignation are not met, we will have to form a temporary government to ensure the normal functioning of state bodies,' Temur Gulia told his supporters, according to local agencies. Bzhania, who is backed by Russia, signaled Sunday that he was prepared to step aside temporarily and hold early elections, even as he continued to slam the demonstrations as 'an attempted coup d’etat.' Opponents of the property agreement say it will drive up prices of apartments and boost Moscow’s dominance in the region. On Saturday, Bzhania announced that he would only agree to a snap election if demonstrators vacated the region’s parliament building. But crowds that gathered in the Abkhazian capital, Sukhumi, rejected the deal and opposition leaders said they would only accept Bzhania’s unconditional resignation. Meanwhile, protesters on Sunday began dismantling the security barriers around the government complex in Sukhumi. One prominent opposition figure called the metal barriers a symbol of the authorities being out of touch. 'This barrier shows that the government has decided to fence itself off from its people,' Adgur Ardzinba said, according to local media. Most of Abkhazia broke away from Georgia in fighting that ended in 1993, and Georgia lost control of the rest of the territory in the short war with Russia in 2008. Russia recognizes Abkhazia as an independent country, but many Abkhazians are concerned that the region of about 245,000 people is a client state of Moscow. Abkhazia’s mountains and Black Sea beaches make it a popular destination for Russian tourists and the demand for holiday homes could be strong. At least 14 people were injured Friday when opposition protesters clashed with police, Russian state agencies reported. Lawmakers had gathered at the region’s parliament building to discuss ratifying measures allowing Russian citizens to buy property in the breakaway state. However, the session was postponed as demonstrators broke down the gate to the building’s grounds with a truck and streamed inside. Some threw rocks at police, who responded with tear gas. The arrest of five opposition figures at a similar demonstration Monday set off widespread protests the next day in which bridges leading to Sukhumi were blocked.	https://apnews.com/article/georgia-abkhazia-unrest-protests-parliament-russia-bzhania-668d5b04d44cf59547b3d93e674b304a	2024-11-17T08:34:53-08:00	
Small plane crashes in Slovenia, killing 3 people	LJUBLJANA, Slovenia (AP) — A small plane crashed on Sunday in foggy weather in northeast Slovenia, killing three people on board, police said. Police said they were informed about the accident around noon on Sunday. The Cessna Skyhawk plane was on a panoramic flight in the area of Prekmurje when it fell, police told Slovenia's public broadcaster RTV Slovenia. The report said the plane was initially set to carry four people but one person stayed behind.	https://apnews.com/article/slovenia-small-plane-crash-cessna-prekmurje-f11cebca2e9f871786c0076b6b22e786	2024-11-17T07:43:57-08:00	
Bangladesh will seek extradition of ex-premier Sheikh Hasina from India	DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — Bangladesh’s interim leader and Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus said Sunday that his administration will seek the extradition of ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina from India, where has been in exile since fleeing a mass uprising in August. In a televised address to the nation on his first 100 days in office, Yunus said that the interim government will try those responsible including Hasina for hundreds of deaths during the student-led uprising that ended her 15-year rule. Yunus took the helm on Aug. 8, three days after Hasina fled the country. He said that not only the deaths in the uprising but all other violations of human rights, including alleged enforced disappearances while Hasina was in power, would be investigated. Bangladesh has sought help from the global police organization Interpol in issuing a red notice for the arrest of Hasina and her associates. 'We will seek the return of the fallen autocrat Sheikh Hasina from India,' Yunus said. 'I have already discussed the issue with chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court Karim Khan.' While Hasina and her close associates are facing numerous criminal charges at home, the Yunus-led government is also pushing for the ICC to take up the case. Seeking Hasina's extradition could also pose a challenge for India, which has treated her as a trusted friend. Yunus said his government's most important task was to hold a new election to hand over power to an elected government, but he did not spell out any timeframe. He said his administration would first bring about reforms in various sectors including in the electoral system. He promised that once the electoral reforms are completed, a roadmap for the new election would be unveiled. Yunus has been talking to political parties including the Bangladesh Nationalist Party headed by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, Hasina's main rival, which has sought an election in two to three months. The party believes it will form the next government as Hasina's Awami League party and its allies face a political debacle following her ouster. Yunus said the Election Commission will be reconstituted soon. 'But as we move forward, we need to complete a lot of work. The train will reach its final station depending on how quickly we can lay down the railway tracks, and this will happen through consensus among the political parties,' he said. Yunus also downplayed as 'exaggerated' reports of attacks on minorities, especially Hindus, many of whom complained that hard-line Islamists are becoming increasingly influential since Hasina’s ouster.	https://apnews.com/article/bangladesh-sheikh-hasina-extradition-india-4265a19fe3144af5f7347072e8c64a14	2024-11-17T05:49:29-08:00	
Tropical Storm Sara makes landfall in Belize after drenching Honduras	SAN PEDRO SULA, Honduras (AP) — Tropical Storm Sara on Sunday made landfall in Belize, where forecasters expect heavy rain to cause life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides. The storm moved inland in Belize after drenching the northern coast of Honduras, where it stalled since Friday, swelling rivers and trapping some people at home. The U.S. National Hurricane Center’s tropical storm warning as of Sunday included the Caribbean coast of Guatemala; the coast of Belize; and northward into the coast of Mexico’s state of Quintana Roo, from Chetumal to Puerto Costa Maya. Those areas, along with portions of El Salvador and western Nicaragua, could see up to 5 inches (13 cm), with localized totals reaching 15 inches (38 cm). The conditions 'will result in areas of flash flooding, perhaps significant, along with the potential of mudslides,' according to the Hurricane Center. 'A storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet above ground level near and to the north of where the center of Sara crosses the coast of Belize,' the center said Sunday. 'Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.' Meanwhile, northern Honduras is not in the clear yet. The center expects Sara to drop up to 3 inches (8 cm) of rain there, but some areas could see totals hit 40 inches (1 meter), with 'catastrophic and life-threatening flooding' still possible.	https://apnews.com/article/tropical-storm-sara-belize-honduras-rain-flooding-f107d30b264401bbcc4bd48d240cc86b	2024-11-17T05:21:21-08:00	
Putin critics lead a march in Berlin calling for democracy in Russia and an end to war in Ukraine	BERLIN (AP) — Prominent Russian opposition figures led a march of at least 1,000 people in central Berlin Sunday, criticizing Russian President Vladimir Putin and his war in Ukraine and calling for democracy in Russia. Behind a banner that read 'No Putin. No War,' the protesters were led by Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of top Putin critic Alexei Navalny, as well as Ilya Yashin and Vladimir Kara-Murza, who were freed from Russian detention in a high-profile prisoner exchange this summer. Shouting 'Russia without Putin' and other chants in Russian, the demonstrators held up signs with a wide array of messages on a red background, including 'Putin = War' and 'Putin is a murderer' in German. Some marched with the flags of Russia or Ukraine, as well as a white-blue-white flag used by some Russian opposition groups. Organizers said the march began near Potsdamer Platz and went through the Brandenburg Gate and Checkpoint Charlie and was expected to end outside the Russian Embassy. 'The march demands the immediate withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine, the trial of Vladimir Putin as a war criminal, and the release of all political prisoners in Russia,' the protesters said in a statement. Yashin, in a statement before the demonstration, said demonstrators were 'using the freedom we have here in Berlin to show the world: A peaceful, free, and civilized Russia exists.' Navalnaya, Yashin and Kara-Murza have all billed Sunday’s rally as a show of unity at a time when recent rounds of acrimony have roiled the anti-war camp. Russia’s exiled anti-war opposition has so far largely failed to speak with one voice and present a clear plan of action. The landmark East-West prisoner swap in August freed key dissidents and promised to reinvigorate a movement unmoored by the death in prison of Navalny, a charismatic anti-corruption campaigner and arch-Kremlin foe. Instead, tensions have spiked in recent months, as Navalny’s allies and other prominent dissidents swapped accusations that appeared to dash any hopes of a united anti-Kremlin front. Many opposition-minded Russians have voiced deep frustration with the infighting, and with what some view as efforts by rivaling groups to discredit and wrest influence from one another. ___ Associated Press writer Joanna Kozlowska in London contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/karamurza-yashin-russia-berlin-putin-ukraine-1b0da07d13ed9bc7d9df2ffe282b9527	2024-11-17T05:14:22-08:00	
Rhodes scholarship recipients for 2025 include 32 US students	A group of 32 students from the United States have been selected to attend the University of Oxford as part of the prestigious Rhodes scholar program in the coming year among an international class representing more than 70 nations, scholarship officials announced. Nearly 3,000 U.S. students began the application process for the scholarship covering all expenses at the storied university in Oxford, England, to pursue graduate degrees beginning in October 2025, the Office of the American Secretary of the Rhodes Trust in McLean, Virginia, said in a statement early Sunday. The 32 recipients include students from 19 states and the District of Columbia attending 20 U.S. colleges and universities. During the application process, 865 students were endorsed by 243 colleges and universities. Committees in 16 U.S. districts then selected 238 finalists for interviews. Four of the recipients are from the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, New York, the most selected from the service academy in one year since 1959. Others include the first Rhodes scholars chosen from Eastern Mennonite University in Virginia and California's Pepperdine University. Returning students to the program for the first time in decades, Coe College in Iowa had its first scholarship winner in more than 53 years and North Carolina's Davidson College placed a scholar after 25 years without the recognition. The trust touted the wide-ranging interests of the scholarship winners: a DJ who uses AI in music and medicine, a religious studies major proficient in six languages, an amateur boxer and the youngest elected official in Missouri. Ramona L. Doyle, American secretary of the Rhodes Trust, said in the statement that in addition to academic excellence, 'a Rhodes Scholar should also have great ambition for social impact, and an uncommon ability to work with others to achieve one’s goals.' 'They should be committed to make a strong difference for good in the world, be concerned for the welfare of others, and be acutely conscious of inequities,' Doyle said. The sponsorships were created in 1902 by the will of Cecil Rhodes, a founder of the diamond mining and manufacturing company De Beers. The inaugural class entered Oxford in 1903 and the first U.S. Rhodes scholars arrived the next year. Scholars pursue advanced degrees in subjects ranging from social sciences and humanities to biological and physical sciences, according to the trust. The Rhodes scholarship is 'the oldest and best-known award for international study, and arguably the most famous academic award available to American college graduates,' Doyle said. Sunday's announcement brings the total number of Americans selected for Rhodes scholarships to 3,674 representing 329 colleges and universities, the trust said, noting 675 U.S. women have won the scholarship despite only having been eligbile to apply since 1976. The U.S. scholars chosen for the 2024 class were the first to take part in a screening process in person following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. During the previous three years, the selection process was conducted online. The scholarships are typically for two to three years but may extend to four. The award covers all fees, a living expense stipend and transportion between England and the recipient’s location. The scholarship is valued at about $75,000 annually, reaching to about $250,000 for scholars who remain in their departments for four years.	https://apnews.com/article/rhodes-scholars-united-states-oxford-university-fcb74fb00691e5dda500e1a1c885ff71	2024-11-17T00:20:39-08:00	
Senegal votes in election that will decide if president can carry out the reforms he promised	DAKAR, Senegal (AP) — Polls opened in Senegal on Sunday for a parliamentary election that is set to determine whether the country’s newly elected president can carry out ambitious reforms. More than 7 million registered voters in the West African country are choosing 165 lawmakers in the national assembly, where the party of President Bassirou Diomaye Faye currently does not hold a majority. Faye, who was elected in March on an anti-establishment platform, says that has blocked him from executing the reforms he pledged during his campaign, including fighting corruption, reviewing fishing permits for foreign companies and securing a bigger share from the country’s natural resources for the population. In September, he dissolved the opposition-led parliament, paving the way for a snap legislative election. His party is facing the Takku Wallu opposition platform led by former President Macky Sall, alongside 39 other registered parties and coalitions. Polls will close at 6 p.m (1800 GMT). The first provisional results are expected to be known by Monday morning, but the final count will only be published later in the week. Faye’s political party, PASTEF, needs at least 83 seats in order to gain a majority in the assembly. Analysts say it has a high chance of securing that, given its popularity and Faye's margin of victory in the March presidential election. Faye, 44, was elected with 54% in the first round, becoming Africa’s youngest elected leader, less than two weeks after he was released from prison. His rise has reflected widespread frustration among Senegal’s youth with the country’s direction — a common sentiment across Africa, which has the world’s youngest population and a number of leaders accused of clinging to power for decades. Over 60% of Senegalese are under 25 and 90% work in informal jobs. Senegal has been hit by skyrocketing inflation in recent years, making it difficult for them to get by. The country is also a major source of irregular migration to Europe, with thousands leaving every year on rickety, artisanal fishing boats in search of economic opportunities. The campaign for the legislative election was marked by sporadic clashes between supporters of different parties. The headquarters of an opposition party were set on fire in the capital, Dakar, and clashes have erupted between supporters in central Senegal in recent weeks, the interior ministry said Monday, On Tuesday, Ousmane Sonko, the country’s prime minister who helped catapult Faye to victory, denounced attacks against supporters of PASTEF in Dakar and other cities. 'May each patriot they have attacked and injured be proportionally avenged. We will exercise our legitimate right to respond,' he wrote on X, before back-pedalling and asking his supporters to remain peaceful in a speech later that day. Last month, Sonko’s vehicle was attacked with stones as clashes broke out between his supporters and unidentified attackers while he was campaigning in Koungueul, in the center of the country. The leader of an allied party, former minister Malick Gackou, had his arm broken in the incident, according to local media. Faye called for peace and urged his supporters to respect the results of the election regardless of the outcome. 'There will be winners and losers but in the end, it is the people that win,' Faye said after casting his vote in his native town of Ndiaganiao, more than 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of Dakar. 'We have an obligation to preserve the international community’s view of our democracy. We are an exception and we must continue to protect that,' he added, referring to Senegal’s reputation as a stable democracy in West Africa, a region rocked in recent years by coups and attempted coups. The presidential election in March had tested this reputation. Both Faye and Sonko had been imprisoned on charges that were largely seen as political, leading to months of protests that were unprecedented in Senegal. Rights groups said dozens of people were killed and about 1,000 people were jailed. Opposition supporters also had been concerned that Sall would seek a third term in office despite being prevented from doing so by the constitution. After a bid to delay the election was blocked by the courts, the government released hundreds of political prisoners, including Faye and Sonko, less than two weeks before the vote. Faye was catapulted into the presidency when Sonko — who was barred from running due to a previous conviction — put his backing behind the political novice and Faye easily beat the candidate backed by Sall. —— Associated Press writer Babacar Dione in Dakar contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/senegal-election-bassirou-diomaye-faye-pastef-52d97319ade0efc750ea3bc5f50877f6	2024-11-16T23:45:02-08:00	
Russia launches one of the fiercest missile and drone attacks at Ukraine's infrastructure	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia on Sunday launched a massive drone and missile attack on Ukraine, described by officials as the largest over the past months, targeting energy infrastructure and killing civilians. The attack came as fears are mounting about Moscow’s intentions to devastate Ukraine's power generation capacity ahead of the cold winter. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Russia had launched a total of 120 missiles and 90 drones in a large-scale attack across Ukraine. Various types of drones were deployed, he said, including Iranian-made Shaheds as well as cruise, ballistic and aircraft-launched ballistic missiles. Ukrainian defenses shot down 140 air targets, Zelenskyy said in a statement on the Telegram messaging app. 'The enemy’s target was our energy infrastructure throughout Ukraine. Unfortunately, there is damage to objects from hits and falling debris. In Mykolaiv, as a result of a drone attack, two people were killed and six others were injured, including two children,' Zelenskyy said. Two others were killed in the Odesa region, where the attack damaged energy infrastructure and disrupted power and water supplies, said local Gov. Oleh Kiper. The combined drone and missile attack was the most powerful in three months, according to the head of Kyiv’s City Military Administration Serhii Popko. Russian strikes have hammered Ukraine’s power infrastructure since Moscow’s all-out invasion of its neighbor in February 2022, prompting repeated emergency power shutdowns and nationwide rolling blackouts. Ukrainian officials have routinely urged Western allies to bolster the country’s air defenses to counter assaults and allow for repairs. Explosions were heard across Ukraine on Sunday, including in capital Kyiv, the key southern port of Odesa, as well as the country’s west and central regions, according to local reports. The operational command of Poland’s armed forces wrote on X that Polish and allied aircraft, including fighter jets, have been mobilized in Polish airspace because of the 'massive' Russian attack on neighboring Ukraine. The steps were aimed to provide safety in Poland's border areas, it said. One person was injured after the roof of a five-story residential building caught fire in Kyiv’s historic center, according to Popko. A thermal power plant operated by private energy company DTEK was 'seriously damaged,' the company said. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/zelenskyy-russia-missiles-drones-ukraine-infrastructure-6af214839d9436731e9b960f0d3a7a8a	2024-11-16T23:31:14-08:00
