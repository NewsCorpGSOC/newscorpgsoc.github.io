Italy sends another 8 migrants to Albania, despite failing to process the first group	SHENGJIN, Albania (AP) — An Italian navy ship docked Friday at the Albanian port of Shengjin with eight migrants who will be processed there after they were intercepted in international waters, a month after another group was turned away for failing the vetting process. It is only the second transfer of migrants since two migrant processing centers started operating in October. The same ship transferred to Albania the first 16 migrants from Bangladesh and Egypt. Four were taken to Italy the same day because they were minors or had health issues. Twelve others were brought back to Italy three days later, following a ruling by Rome judges who rejected their detention because their countries of origin — Bangladesh and Egypt — were not safe enough for them to be sent back. The naval ship Libra, which can carry 200 people besides crew, left Italy’s southernmost island of Lampedusa on Wednesday with eight men on board, according to the Italian media. Italian Interior Ministry spokesperson Francesco Kamel had confirmed the Libra was heading to Albania, but declined to give out any further information until the operation was complete. He didn't say when it would arrive, nor how many people were on board. The Italian media reported that, out of 1,200 migrant arrivals on Lampedusa over the past two days, just eight male adults traveling without families met Albania's screening criteria, including that they come from countries deemed 'safe' for repatriation. The number of people reaching Italy along the central Mediterranean migration route — mainly from Bangladesh, Syria, Tunisia and Egypt — has fallen by 60% in 2024 compared to 2023. As of Nov. 7, according to the Italian Interior Ministry, 57,767 migrants have arrived by sea in 2024. A court ruling out of Rome had shortened the list of countries considered 'safe' by law, meaning that Rome can repatriate migrants from those countries who didn’t win asylum using a fast-track procedure. Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni slammed the Rome court ruling, and said that deeming countries such as Bangladesh and Egypt unsafe means that virtually all migrants would be barred from the Albania program, making it unworkable. On Oct. 21, Italy’s far-right government approved a new decree aimed at overcoming those judicial hurdles that risked derailing a controversial five-year migration deal with Albania, signed in 2023 by Meloni and her Albanian counterpart, Edi Rama. Under the deal, up to 3,000 migrants intercepted by the Italian coast guard in international waters each month will be sheltered in Albania, and vetted for possible asylum in Italy or be sent back to their countries. Italy has agreed to welcome those migrants who are granted asylum, while those whose applications are rejected face deportation directly from Albania. The agreement to outsource the housing of asylum-seekers to a non-European Union member country, defended by Meloni as a new model to handle illegal migration, has been hailed by some countries that, like Italy, are experiencing a high level of migrant arrivals. Visiting Albania in October, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen refused to give her opinion of the agreement, saying only that it was being closely monitored. Human rights groups and non-governmental organizations that are active in the Mediterranean have slammed the agreement as a dangerous precedent that conflicts with international laws. ___ Semini reported from Tirana; Colleen Barry contributed from Milan. ___ Follow Llazar Semini at: https://x.com/lsemini Follow AP’s global migration coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/migration	https://apnews.com/article/albania-italy-migrant-processing-de9379f062f00b96aac6837ea3283bfe	2024-11-07T22:29:31-08:00	
AP PHOTOS: Tens of thousands of Hindu devotees flock to rivers for prayers to the sun god	NEW DELHI (AP) — Tens of thousands of Hindu devotees flocked to rivers and bodies of water across India to pray to the sun god as part of the Chhath festival this week. In Noida, on the outskirts of the capital New Delhi, families gathered at the Yamuna river, which is covered with white toxic foam as a result of pollutants discharged from nearby industries. Women in brightly colored saris waded into the knee-deep water flecked with blobs of white foam. Some carried a coconut or other fruits as an offering to thank Lord Surya, the god of the sun, for sustaining life on earth as they sought divine blessings. The Yamuna is considered one of India’s most sacred rivers, and Hindu devotees have continued to use it despite warnings about the toxic foam. A court in Delhi on Wednesday forbade worshipers from performing rituals on the bank of the heavily polluted river over health and safety concerns, local media reported, yet thousands gathered on Thursday and Friday at the river banks to immerse themselves in the river and drinks it water. From the financial capital Mumbai to Hyderabad in the south and Guwahati in the east, thousands of men, women and children did the same. The Chhath festival, celebrated after the Hindu festival of Diwali, originated in the country's eastern states, with large celebrations in Bihar and Jharkand, and extends to Nepal. Over the years, it has grown more popular across India, often introduced as migrants from eastern states mark the festival away from home. The rituals, which stretch over four days, include a holy dip in the river and a period of fasting and abstaining from drinking water. On the last two days, devotees stand in the waters to pray to the sun as it rises and sets, with some families camping out overnight along the banks.	https://apnews.com/article/india-hindu-chhath-sun-festival-yamuna-river-21c03117b6906667a4a7d2654dd429d1	2024-11-07T21:45:18-08:00	
The Berlin Wall: A divide that once shaped German women's lives still echoes today	BERLIN (AP) — Like many other young women living in communist East Germany, Solveig Leo thought nothing about juggling work and motherhood. The mother of two was able to preside over a large state-owned farm in the northeastern village of Banzkow because childcare was widely available. Contrast that with Claudia Huth, a mother of five, who grew up in capitalist West Germany. Huth quit her job as a bank clerk when she was pregnant with her first child and led a life as a traditional housewife in the village of Egelsbach in Hesse, raising the kids and tending to her husband, who worked as a chemist. Both Leo and Huth fulfilled roles that in many ways were typical for women in the vastly different political systems that governed Germany during its decades of division following the country’s defeat in World War II in 1945. As Germany celebrates the 35th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall on Nov. 9, 1989 — and the country’s reunification less than a year later on Oct. 3, 1990 — many in Germany are reflecting on how women’s lives that have diverged so starkly under communism and capitalism have become much more similar again — though some differences remain even today. 'In West Germany, women — not all, but many — had to fight for their right to have a career,' said Clara Marz, the curator of an exhibition about women in divided Germany for the Federal Foundation for the Study of the Communist Dictatorship in Germany. Women in East Germany, meanwhile, often had jobs — though that was something that 'they had been ordered from above to do,' she added. Built in 1961, the Wall stood for 28 years at the front line of the Cold War between the Americans and the Soviets. It was built by the communist regime to cut off East Germans from the supposed ideological contamination of the West and to stem the tide of people fleeing East Germany. Today only a few stretches of the 156.4-kilometer (97.2-mile) barrier around the capitalist exclave of West Berlin remain, mostly as a tourist attraction. 'All the heavy industry was in the west, there was nothing here,' Leo, who is now 81 years old, said during a recent interview looking back at her life as a woman under communism. 'East Germany had to pay war reparations to the Soviet Union. Women needed to work our own way out of that misery.' By contrast, Leo said, women in the West didn't need to work because they were 'spoiled by the Marshall Plan' — the United States’ generous reconstruction plan that poured billions of dollars into West Germany and other European countries after the war. In capitalist West Germany, the economy recovered so quickly after the total devastation of WWII that people soon started talking of a Wirtschaftswunder, or 'economic miracle,' that brought them affluence and stability less than 10 years after the war. That economic success, however, indirectly hampered women’s quest for equal rights. Most West German women stayed at home and were expected to take care of their household while their husbands worked. Religion, too, played a much bigger role than in atheist East Germany, confining women to traditional roles as caregivers of the family. Mothers who tried to break out of these conventions and took on jobs were infamously decried as Rabenmütter, or uncaring moms who put work over family. Not all West German women perceived their traditional roles as restrictive. 'I always had this idea to be with my children, because I loved being with them,' said Huth, now 69. 'It never really occurred to me to go to work.' More than three decades after Germany’s unification, a new generation of women is barely aware of the different lives their mothers and grandmothers led depending on which part of the country they lived in. For most, combining work and motherhood has also become the normal way of life. Hannah Fiedler, an 18-year-old high school graduate from Berlin, said the fact that her family lived in East Germany during the decades of the country's division has no impact on her life today. 'East or West — it's not even a topic in our family anymore,' she said, as she sat on a bench near a thin, cobble-stoned path in the capital's Mitte neighborhood, which marks the former course of the Berlin Wall in the then-divided city. She also said that growing up, she had not experienced any disadvantages because she's female. 'I'm white and privileged — for good or worse — I don't expect any problems when I enter the working world in the future,' she said. Some small differences between the formerly divided parts of Germany linger on. In the former East, 74% of women are working, compared to 71.5% in the West, according to a 2023 study by the Hans-Böckler-Stiftung foundation. Childcare is also still more available in the former East than in the West. In 2018, 57% of children under the age of 3 were looked after in a childcare facility in the eastern state of Saxony. That compares with 27% in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia and 44% in Hamburg and Bremen, according to Germany's Federal Statistical Office. Germany as a whole trails behind some other European countries when it comes to gender equality. Only 31.4% lawmakers in Germany's national parliament are female, compared to 41% in Belgium's parliament, 43.6% in Denmark, 45% in Norway and 45.6% in Sweden. Nonetheless, Leo, the 81-year-old farmer from former East Germany, is optimistic that eventually women all over the country will have the same opportunities. 'I can’t imagine that there are any women who don’t like to be independent,' she said. ___ Jan M.

AP Photos: 35 years after the Berlin Wall opened, fragments of East Germany's border remain	BERLIN (AP) — Most of communist East Germany's heavily fortified border was torn down quickly after it was opened in 1989, but there are still places where visitors can see the remains of the Berlin Wall and other sections of the frontier. East Germany closed the border in Berlin on Aug. 13, 1961, and expanded the Wall into an increasingly elaborate fortification snaking through the city and around the capitalist enclave of West Berlin. The Wall plugged the last gap in the border between east and west. East Germany's leadership had already sealed off the country's main frontier with West Germany, snaking from the Baltic Sea to Czechoslovakia, in 1952. It stayed that way until the border was opened on Nov. 9, 1989. The Bornholmer Strasse crossing in Berlin was the first to open that night. Border guards, who hadn't received orders to let anyone pass, gave way under pressure from a large crowd demanding to be let through after an off-handed announcement of new regulations by Politburo spokesperson Günter Schabowski. Today, a section of Wall slabs with photos of those events and a series of plaques marking the night's main developments — including an alert sent by The Associated Press’ German service — stands at the former crossing. The longest section of Wall remaining in Berlin is the East Side Gallery, where the once-gray concrete slabs are covered with murals that were painted by 118 artists after the opening of the border. Otherwise, the Wall has largely disappeared now and much of the former 'death strip' — between the exterior wall that faced West Berlin and an interior wall that faced east — has been built over. Among the exceptions is a strip of the former border at the Bernauer Strasse memorial site in downtown Berlin, and there are fragments dotted around elsewhere in the city and on its edges. In most cases, the main East-West German border outside Berlin consisted of heavily fortified fences rather than walls. There were a few exceptions, however: most famously in the village of Moedlareuth, divided between Bavaria and the eastern region of Thuringia, which earned the nickname 'Little Berlin.' Part of Moedlareuth's border can still be seen today. Germany was reunified on Oct. 3, 1990, less than a year after the border opened.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-berlin-wall-35th-anniversary-photos-638cb701a1405edd8bea7cd3059d2a0e	2024-11-07T20:12:47-08:00	
In an Israeli settlement named after Trump, residents see opportunity after the election	RAMAT TRUMP, Golan Heights (AP) — Israeli residents of 'Trump Heights' are welcoming the election of their namesake, hoping Donald Trump's return to the U.S. presidency will breathe new life into this tiny, remote settlement in the central Golan Heights. During his first term, Trump became the first and only foreign leader to recognize Israel’s control of the Golan, which it seized from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war. Israel thanked him by rebranding this outpost after him. But a large-scale influx of new residents never materialized after that 2019 ceremony, and just a couple dozen families live in Trump Heights, or 'Ramat Trump' in Hebrew. Job opportunities are limited, and Israel’s more than yearlong war against Hezbollah militants in nearby Lebanon has added to the sense of isolation. Trump’s election has inspired hope in the community that it will attract more members and also more funding for security improvements. 'Maybe it can raise more awareness and maybe some support to help here and help our kids here,' said Yarden Freimann, Trump Heights’ community manager. Ori Kallner, head of the Golan’s regional council, showed off dozens of plots of land, replete with new asphalt roads, lampposts and utility lines, that residents have prepared for future housing developments. 'President Trump’s return to the White House definitely puts the town in the headlines,' he said. Hanging on while war rages nearby Kallner stood next to a metal statue of an eagle and a menorah, symbolizing the United States and Israel, as Israeli warplanes flew overhead. Two explosions from rockets fired from Lebanon punched the hills nearby, and just across the border in Lebanon, plumes of smoke rose into the air from Israeli airstrikes. An enormous sign with the settlement’s name in Hebrew and English gleamed in the sun, while two large sunbaked metal flags of Israel and the United States were faded almost beyond recognition. Surrounded by ashen ruins of villages fled by Syrians in the 1967 war, the town is perched above the Hula Valley, where Israel has amassed tanks, artillery and troops for its fight in Lebanon. Most towns in the valley have been evacuated. Trump Heights sends its kids to a makeshift daycare in a nearby settlement after the government shuttered all schools in the region in the wake of the Oct. 1 invasion of Lebanon. 'We find ourselves hanging by our fingernails to be in our own community, not be evacuated, and on the other hand, we cannot work, we cannot send our kids to any kind of an education system,' said Freimann. Trump Heights is only about 7 miles (12 kilometers) from Lebanon and Syria. Alerts for incoming fire gives residents about 30 seconds' head start to get to a bomb shelter. Trump broke with other leaders on the Golan Heights Israel annexed the Golan, a strategic plateau overlooking northern Israel, in 1981 in a move that is not internationally recognized. That changed in March 2019 when Trump, without notice, tweeted that the U.S. would 'fully recognize' Israel’s control of the territory. His announcement drew widespread condemnation from the international community, which considers the Golan to be occupied Syrian territory and Israel’s settlements to be illegal. The Biden administration left the decision intact, but the U.S. remains the lone country to recognize the Israeli annexation. Kallner said he hopes Trump will now persuade European countries to recognize Israeli sovereignty there. According to Israeli figures, the Golan is home to about 50,000 people — roughly half of them Jewish Israelis and the other half Arab Druze, many of whom still consider themselves Syrians under occupation. Israel has encouraged and promoted settlements in the Golan, and the Druze residents operate farms and a tourism and restaurant sector popular with Israelis. But the area has struggled to develop because of its remoteness, several hours from Israel’s economic center in Tel Aviv. That economic hardship has only worsened during the war as the hospitality sector cratered. On July 28, a rocket killed 12 Druze children on a soccer field in the city of Majdal Shams, about 12 miles (20 kilometers) away. Israel invaded Lebanon months later. In June 2019, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu led an inauguration ceremony for Trump Heights. The U.S. ambassador at the time, David Friedman, noted that the ceremony came days after Trump’s birthday and said: 'I can’t think of a more appropriate and a more beautiful birthday present.' As president, Trump was close with Netanyahu The Golan recognition was among a series of diplomatic gifts that Trump delivered to Israel during his first term. They included recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and moving the American embassy to the contested city, and a series of diplomatic agreements with Arab countries known as the Abraham Accords. He has vowed to bring peace to the tumultuous region during his second term, but has not said how. Netanyahu enjoyed a close relationship with Trump during his first term but ran afoul of the former president when he congratulated Joe Biden on his 2020 victory. The Israeli prime minister announced Tuesday that he was one of the first foreign leaders to call the president-elect and congratulate him on his victory. An official in his office, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal communications, said aides were upbeat and giddy. 'Congratulations on history’s greatest comeback!' the Israeli leader said in a statement. 'Your historic return to the White House offers a new beginning for America and a powerful recommitment to the great alliance between Israel and America.' At Trump Heights, Kallner was optimistic too: 'The Golan community is strong and resilient, and people that want to come and live here are from the same material. I believe we will overcome these challenging times and won’t stop growing.'	https://apnews.com/article/trump-heights-golan-settlement-israel-syria-lebanon-e0ca8d2720524d92f423fbe212354909	2024-11-07T20:04:54-08:00	
Trump victory spurs worry among migrants abroad, but it's not expected to halt migration	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election instantly changed calculations for millions of migrants or potential migrants across the globe. But perhaps not in the way Trump imagined. Trump has pledged to reduce immigration. But by narrowing the already limited legal pathways into the U.S., migrants will just recalibrate their plans and resort in greater numbers to hiring smugglers, experts say. In many cases that will mean turning to organized crime groups that increasingly profit from migrant smuggling. Those potentially affected come from dozens of countries and many have already sold their homes and their possessions to fund the trip. Venezuelans continue arriving at the U.S. southern border in reduced, but still large numbers. Mexicans made up half of U.S. Border Patrol arrests in September. Chinese come through Ecuador and make their way up through the Americas. Senegalese buy multi-stop flights to Nicaragua, then move north. The U.N.’s International Organization for Migration estimates there are around 281 million international migrants in the world, or 3.6% of the global population. An increasing number of people will be displaced for political, economic and violence reasons, and more migrants will seek asylum, according to its annual report. It warns that when people cannot find regular pathways, they start looking for 'irregular channels that are extremely hazardous.' During Trump's first administration, Mexican border cities were saturated with migrants. Cartels preyed on them, kidnapping them, extorting their families for ransoms and forcibly recruiting them into their ranks. There were hundreds of arrivals every day, as well as thousands who were made to wait out the potentially yearslong U.S. asylum application process in Mexico. A U.S. program called CBP One brought some order after it was introduced by the Biden administration in early 2023. Migrants no longer have to come to the border to schedule an appointment and can do it on their smartphones. Once overflowing border shelters have emptied and many families are making every effort to go the legal route. Trump has pledged to end CBP One. He also wants to again restrict refugee resettlement and warned throughout his campaign of mass deportations. While his victory was deflating and worrisome to those en route to the United States, it was not a deal-breaker. On Tuesday night, Bárbara Rodríguez, a 33-year-old Venezuelan, should have been sleeping after walking more than eight miles through southern Mexico's tropical heat with some 2,500 others from at least a dozen countries. Instead, she was watching U.S. election results on her cellphone. Back in Caracas, Rodríguez helped monitor a polling place for the opposition during Venezuela's July election. After President Nicolas Maduro claimed reelection, his supporters began to harass her family. 'Either my family’s lives were going to be at risk or I had to leave the country,' she said. In September, she sold her house and left her three children with her mother. Now her plan of waiting for a CBP One appointment to request asylum at the U.S. border has an expiration date. 'Plans changed. We have until Jan. 20,' she said, referring to inauguration day. She has not ruled out hiring a smuggler, she added. Martha Bárcena, Mexico’s former U.S. ambassador during most of Trump’s first administration, said migrants were the losers from his immigration policies and that could happen again. 'Organized crime is the big beneficiary, because the income from illegal human trafficking is already equal to or greater than the income from drugs,' she said. Estefanía Ramos of Guatemala woke up worried Wednesday in a Ciudad Juarez shelter across from El Paso, Texas. 'We’re trying to figure out what’s going to happen to us,' the 19-year-old said. 'This wasn’t the plan.' She and her husband left Guatemala after a gang threatened to harm him and kidnap her, she said. They have been waiting for three months for a CBP One appointment. Two months ago they had a baby girl. 'If we can keep waiting for an appointment we will,' Ramos said, adding that she doesn’t want to risk an illegal crossing with the baby. On Wednesday in Ciudad Juarez, a few dozen asylum seekers with appointments waited patiently to be called across the international bridge. Gretchen Kuhner, director of IMUMI, a nongovernmental legal services organization in Mexico, was in the southern Mexican city of Tuxtla Gutierrez last week, where she found migrant families with young children living in the streets waiting for CBP One appointments. 'They are getting their cellphones charged every day at some makeshift place on the street so they can check their CBP One appointments ... while they’re breastfeeding and sleeping in a tent without any water,' she said. 'People who need protection are really trying to do it the right way.' Further restrictions on the already difficult process would leave vulnerable populations with few options, said Mark Hetfield, CEO of the U.S.-based refugee support organization HIAS. 'It would mean they have no place to go because there are many, many countries in the hemisphere where there is effectively no asylum system or where even if you could get asylum, you’re not necessarily safe,' he said. And then there's the specter of massive deportations. Trump made a similar threat before and didn't deliver, but there's real concern. Deportations to countries like Cuba and Venezuela could be complicated by icy relations, though Venezuela’s Maduro issued a conciliatory message congratulating Trump Wednesday. Advocates in Haiti on Thursday demanded countries, including the U.S., halt deportations because of the country's domestic crisis. And no country stands to be more impacted than Mexico. There are some 11 million Mexicans living in the U.S., about 5 million of whom don’t have legal status. Mexicans sent home more than $63 billion in remittances last year, mostly from the United States. Mass deportations would shake the finances of millions of families and the Mexican economy would struggle to absorb them. Migrant advocates and shelter directors in Mexico said they've heard of no government plans to deal with large numbers of deportees. Mexican aid groups are 'not in a position to receive that quantity of people and let's be honest, it's civil society that carries on its shoulders most of the humanitarian response toward those who are deported or in transit,' said Rafael Velásquez García, Mexico director for the International Rescue Committee. Mexico needs to prepare itself for all manner of pressures coming from a Trump administration, said Carlos Pérez Ricart, a professor of international relations at Mexican public research center CIDE. 'What Mexico has to accept is that our country is going to be a holding country for migrants, whether they want it or not,' he said. 'Trump is going to deport thousands, if not millions of people and he's going to impede the flow of migrants.' ___ Pesce reported from Ciudad Juarez, Mexico.

Leader of the free world has never been a role Trump has embraced. The world has gotten the message	WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. presidents usually pay lip service at least to being leaders of the free world, at the helm of a mighty democracy and military that allies worldwide can rally around and reasonably depend upon for support in return. Not so under President-elect Donald Trump, a critic of many existing U.S. alliances, whose win of a second term this week had close European partners calling for a new era of self-reliance not dependent on American goodwill. 'We must not delegate forever our security to America,' French President Emmanuel Macron said at a European summit Thursday. Based on Trump’s first term and campaign statements, the U.S. will become less predictable, more chaotic, colder to allies and warmer to some strongmen, and much more transactional in picking friends globally than before. America’s place in world affairs and security will fundamentally change, both critics and supporters of Trump say. His backers say he simply will be choosier about U.S. alliances and battles than previous presidents. When it comes to the U.S. role on the world stage, no more talk of the country as leader of the free world, said Fiona Hill, a former Russia adviser to Trump and preceding U.S. presidents. Maybe 'the free-for-all world, his leadership?' Hill suggested in a recent European Council for Foreign Relations podcast. 'I mean, what exactly is it that we’re going to be leading here?' Trump, with varying degrees of consistency, has been critical of NATO and support for Ukraine and Taiwan, two democracies under threat that depend on U.S. military support to counter Russia and China. Trump has shown little interest in the longstanding U.S. role as anchor of strategic alliances with European and Indo-Pacific democracies. Before the election, partners and adversaries already were reevaluating their security arrangements in preparation for Trump's possible return. European allies in particular bolstered efforts to build up their own and regional defenses, rather than rely on the U.S. as the anchor of NATO, the mutual-defense pact both Trump and running mate JD Vance have spoken of scathingly. Within hours of Trump’s win over Vice President Kamala Harris this week, defense chiefs of France and Germany scheduled talks to address the impact. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Russian President Vladimir Putin have appeared to shape war strategies with hopes that Trump could allow them freer rein. Victoria Coates, a security adviser to Trump in his first term, rejects any portrayal of him as isolationist. 'I think he is extremely judicious about the application of the American military, and about potentially getting embroiled in conflicts we can’t resolve,' she said recently on a security podcast. As evidence of his engagement globally, Coates pointed to Trump's support of Israel as it wages wars against Iranian-backed militant groups in Gaza and Lebanon. She called Iran's nuclear program the 'greatest concern' abroad and suggested its progress toward the possibility of nuclear weapons meant Trump might have to act more forcefully than in his first term, when he surged sanctions on Iran in what he called a 'maximum pressure' campaign. Trump, long an open admirer of Putin, has been most consistent in pointing to U.S. support of Ukraine for possible policy change. Philip Breedlove, a former Air Force general and top NATO commander, said he can see both positive expectations and deep concerns for Ukraine and NATO in the next four years under Trump. While Trump’s NATO rhetoric during his first administration was often harsh, it didn’t lead to any actual U.S. troop reductions in Europe or decreased support for the alliance, Breedlove said. And 23 NATO nations are spending at least 2% of their gross domestic product on defense, compared with 10 in 2020 — a showing that now negates a persistent Trump complaint. More concerning, Breedlove said, is Trump’s vow to end the war in Ukraine right away. While that goal is noble, 'ending wars on terms that are appropriate is one thing. Capitulating to an enemy in order to stop a conflict is a different thing. And that’s what worries me,' Breedlove said. He and others have warned that an end to the war that gives Russia additional territory in Ukraine will set a bad precedent. European nations fear it will embolden Putin to come after them. So do supporters of Taiwan, a democratically run island that China has said it will one day annex, by force if necessary. Trump has ranged from saying Taiwan should pay the U.S. for its defense support to claiming he could charm Chinese President Xi Jinping out of threatening Taiwan. 'One thing that does make me nervous about Trump vis-à-vis the Taiwan Strait is his reliance on unpredictability, his reliance on being something of a chaotic actor in a situation that is finely balanced,' said Paul Nadeau, an assistant professor of international affairs and political science at Temple University's Japan campus. The situation is one 'that requires a profound reading of very subtle signals between Taiwan, between the United States, between China,' Nadeau said. The world that Trump will face has changed, too, with Russia, North Korea, Iran and China further consolidating in a loose, opportunistic alliance to counter the West, and particularly the U.S. In places where the U.S. has withdrawn, Russia, China and at times Iran have been quick to extend their influence, including in the Middle East. During his first term, Trump repeatedly vowed to pull all U.S. forces out of Iraq and Syria, at times blindsiding Pentagon officials with sudden statements and tweets that left officials fumbling for answers. A backlash from some Republican lawmakers and counterproposals by U.S. military leaders slowed those plans, including suggestions that some U.S. troops should remain in Syria to protect oil sites. The U.S. still has about 900 troops in Syria, which could plunge under Trump. The number of U.S. forces in Iraq is already dwindling based on a new agreement between the Biden administration and Baghdad. The plan would wrap up the U.S.-led coalition’s mission to fight the Islamic State group by next year but likely shift at least some U.S. troops to northern Iraq to support the fight against IS in Syria. Trump's first term — followed by Joe Biden's foreign policy increasingly becoming consumed by unsuccessful efforts to reach cease-fires in the Middle East — already have spurred allies to speak of building up their own military strength and that of smaller regional alliances for security. 'Factored into calculations is there’s going to be less United States than before' on the world stage, Hill said. 'There can’t be this dangerous dependency on what happens in Washington, D.C.' ___ AP reporters Didi Tang and Tara Copp in Washington and Ayaka McGill in Tokyo contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-foreign-alliances-russia-ukraine-china-b2ec5e845db76eaadba0abd3bf61cc50	2024-11-07T20:01:15-08:00	
Runway fire breaks out at Sydney Airport after emergency landing	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — An engine failure on a passenger plane taking off from Sydney, Australia on Friday prompted the aircraft to circle before a safe emergency landing, the airline Qantas said. At the same time, a grass fire broke out along one side of a runway, Sydney Airport said in a statement. It was not known if the two events were linked. The fire has been brought under control, but flight delays are expected. Qantas did not say how many passengers were on board the twin jet Boeing 737-800 bound for Brisbane when the engine failed with a loud bang. No injuries were reported. 'We understand this would have been a distressing experience for customers and we will be contacting all customers this afternoon to provide support,' Qantas Chief Pilot Captain Richard Tobiano said in a statement. 'We will also be conducting an investigation into what caused the engine issue.' Sydney Airport said its main runway was still in service. The grass fire broke out along the side of a parallel runway which was being inspected before it could be used again, the airport said in a statement. It said delays were expected and advised travelers to check their flight's status with the airline. Mark Willacy, an Australian Broadcasting Corp. reporter, told the news outlet that an off-duty pilot who was a passenger on the plane had helped the Qantas pilot during the emergency landing. A flight tracking website shows the aircraft was airborne for about 20 minutes, flying in circles above the airport.	https://apnews.com/article/sydney-airport-fire-qantas-plane-engine-failure-australia-fd1e7095e0242073de7f272da5106ec7	2024-11-07T19:47:51-08:00	
The Temple of Satan gains ground in Chile as faith in traditional religions wanes	SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) — It’s Friday night in Downtown Santiago, the capital of Chile, and a group of 15 people gather around a table, sharing a bottle of wine as the smell of tobacco and incense fill the air. Black candles burn on top of an altar decorated with chalices and knives. The members of the Temple of Satan are about to start a ritual. Five years after the Satanic Temple of the United States made headlines — and unleashed a wave of panic — when it was designated a church, a similar organization in Chile, a conservative country where half of its population of 18 million identifies as Catholic, is asking the government to recognize them legally as a religious association. Scholars, believers and residents consulted by The Associated Press note that Chile, where a long-lasting tradition of Catholicism has played a leading role in public discussions, is experiencing a crisis of faith, following revelations of multiple sexual abuse scandals within the Catholic church over the years. 'These types of organizations now feel that they have greater support to challenge what was virtually impossible before,' said Luis Bahamondes, a professor at the Center for Judaic Studies at the University of Chile. And that’s because, 'until very recently, the Catholic Church enjoyed an unprecedented power. It had an opinion on everything: politics, economics, geopolitics, sexuality and education.' Despite its name, The Temple of Satan: Satanists and Luciferians of Chile does not embark on sacrifices nor asks its congregants to worship the devil. Among its 100 members are people who work as publicists, firefighters, police officers, lawyers and psychologists, who have found in the organization a way to defy moral norms, dogmas and religious impositions. While they embrace the term Satanist, they don’t revere or believe in Satan. Instead, they worship rationality, individualism, pleasure and the mundane life. Rather than gods, they praise humankind. 'You are the owner of your present and future, there is no God that makes decisions for you,' said Haborym, a spokesperson for the group, during a walk through tombs and mausoleums at the General Cemetery of Santiago. He notes that the figure of Satan is purely symbolic and their rituals are performed 'to bring out the emotions and leave the intellect aside.' Haborym and other members of the Temple of Satan in Chile spoke on condition their real names not be used, particularly with many hold public-facing jobs, citing growing threats. While Hollywood movies like 'Rosemary’s Baby' and TV series such as 'True Detective' helped to portray the idea of Satanists as linked to sacrifice, evil, pain and death, modern groups like Chile’s Temple of Satan are strongly against animal abuse, prohibit the affiliation of people with criminal records, see pleasures as a delight rather than a sin, and do not express their opinions unless asked. 'We don’t want people killing in the name of Satan,' said Haborym. In order to join Chile’s Temple of Satan, applicants are requested to go through a lengthy process that includes filling out a form, showing proof of not having a criminal record, being interviewed by a special commission and, finally, being evaluated by a psychologist. Once they are accepted, members can choose a new name — normally that of a demon or fallen angel — with which they will be identified inside the Temple and among other associates. Founded in 2021, Chile’s Temple of Satan has 100 members, and more than 400 people applied to join in the past few weeks, said Haborym. The interest spiked at the end of July, when the group formally requested the country’s Ministry of Justice to legally recognize it as a religious association. A media frenzy followed, unleashing a heated debate and causing a stir among Chile’s main religious denominations. 'The history of Satanism is well known (and) it has often been the cause of tragedies,' the leaders of several churches in Chile, including the Catholic, Anglican, Jewish and Evangelical, said in a joint statement. Following the steps of the Church of Satan founded in 1966 by Anton Szandor LaVey, modern Satanists praise skepticism and logic over celestial or supernatural beings. Its followers are free to formulate their own beliefs, rites and spiritual practices. Many self-described Satanists and Luciferians are atheists, others are witches or believe in the power of magic. 'We do accept that there are certain bases, both academic and esoteric, that give meaning to our existence and reality,' said Azazel, who quit Judaism four years ago and, one year later, founded the Temple of Satan of Chile. His words resonate in the darkness of the chamber and are interspersed with chants, clapping, mantras and readings of passages from the Satanic Bible and the Bible of the Adversary, the main guidelines of the group. Just like Azazel, others have turned to the Temple of Satan out of disappointment with traditional religions. The new congregants include not only occultists and esotericists, but also Catholics, Jews, Protestants and Evangelicals. 'In Satanism there are no solutions or absolute truths. You are your own god and you create your own reality,' said Kali Ma, a dentistry student who was born and raised in a Jehovah’s Witness family. 'If we compare both, Jehovah’s Witnesses are the real sect,' she said. 'They don’t let you do certain things, they tell you how to dress, what to do, how to behave, whether or not to grow a beard.' Néstor da Costa, an expert in secularism and religion at the Catholic University of Uruguay, said the influx of people seeking answers through different perspectives might be linked to the search for less dogmatic approaches. 'It may be a readjustment of the religious side of people who leave Catholicism but continue to believe in something,' he said. It is unclear if the Chilean government will legally recognize the Temple of Satan as a legitimate religious association, but its very existence has already helped to spark a discussion that until recently was unthinkable in this conservative society. Demanding recognition is the ultimate expression of everything praised by Satanic aesthetics: the rebellion against the status quo and the breakup with deep-rooted traditions. 'We comply with everything that is requested of us as a religious entity,' says Haborym. 'So there would be no reason to reject us beyond the fact that we’re a controversial figure.' ___ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/chile-satan-temple-religious-recognition-2bf57ed268b6f9d3056e20ccab985a6e	2024-11-07T19:36:35-08:00	
Typhoon floods villages, rips off roofs and damages 2 domestic airports in northern Philippines	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Typhoon Yinxing battered the northern Philippines with floods and landslides before blowing away from the country on Friday, leaving two airports damaged and aggravating a calamity caused by back-to-back storms that hit in recent weeks. There were no immediate reports of casualties from Yinxing, the 13th major storm to hit the disaster-prone Southeast Asian archipelago this year. The typhoon, locally called Marce, was last tracked over the South China Sea about 100 kilometers (62 miles) west of the northern Philippine province of Ilocos Norte with sustained winds of up to 150 kilometers (93 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 205 kph (127 mph), according to government forecasters. It is expected to weaken further before hitting Vietnam. The typhoon flooded villages, toppled trees and electricity poles, and damaged houses and buildings in Cagayan province, where Yinxing made landfall Thursday afternoon, provincial officials said. More than 40,000 villagers were evacuated to safer ground in the province. In the northernmost island province of Batanes, Gov. Marilou Cayco said Yinxing’s fierce winds and rain blew away roofs of houses and damaged seaports and two domestic airport terminals. More details of damage, including in two northern mountain towns hit by landslides, were expected after provinces battered by the typhoon complete an assessment, officials said. The new damage will complicate recovery efforts from two powerful storms that lashed the northern region in recent weeks. Tropical Storm Trami and Typhoon Kong-rey left at least 151 people dead in the Philippines and affected nearly 9 million others, mostly in the northern and central provinces. More than 14 billion pesos ($241 million) in rice, corn and other crops and infrastructure were damaged. Trami dumped one to two months’ worth of rain in just 24 hours in some regions. In the hardest-hit province of Batangas, south of Manila, at least 61 people died in floods and landslides. More than 630,000 people were still displaced due to Trami and Kong-rey as of Thursday, officials said, including 172,000 who remained in emergency shelters as Yinxing blew across the country's mountainous north. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. decided not to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Peru next week to focus on recovery efforts, Communications Secretary Cesar Chavez said. In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest recorded tropical cyclones, left more than 7,300 people dead or missing, flattened entire villages and caused ships to run aground and smash into houses in the central Philippines. The archipelago also lies in a region often hit by earthquakes and has more than a dozen active volcanoes, making it one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world.	https://apnews.com/article/philippines-typhoon-yinxing-51b689a712c6bb793cc7d08929eb3143	2024-11-07T19:31:38-08:00	
Why people with disabilities in Nairobi are looking beyond public transport to navigate busy city	NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — Caroline Mwikali lost her ability to walk at age 13 after an illness. She quickly learned how difficult it is to get around in Kenya’s busy capital, Nairobi. Mwikali, who now works at a car financing company, said public transport is not designed to accommodate wheelchair users like her. Nairobi's most popular modes of transport include motorbikes along with minivans and minibuses that are not fitted with ramps. They also are not designed to fit wheelchairs in their aisles, so users must be hoisted up the stairs and placed on regular seats while their wheelchairs are put with luggage. 'In most cases, the people manning the bus terminals have to lift you off the wheelchair to help you board the buses. This is not only uncomfortable but leaves you attracting unnecessary attention from the public,' Mwikali told The Associated Press. She is among 2.2% of Kenya’s population, or about 900,000 people, who live with a disability. The most common type of disability is mobility-related at 42%. One entrepreneur, Daniel Gatura, founded Ace Mobility in Nairobi in 2021. Its vehicles are modified with ramps and swivel seats to accommodate people with disabilities and anyone else who needs support commuting. Gatura said he was inspired by a personal experience growing up. 'My father sustained a spinal cord injury in an accident that left him in a wheelchair when he was just 5 years old. I witnessed the challenges my father faced, including losing his job due to transportation issues,' Gatura said. Users can book rides through the Ace Mobility app. Drivers are trained as caregivers, ensuring they understand how to provide respectful and appropriate assistance to passengers with disabilities. Gatura said they have 5,000 users. 'We are changing the narrative around disability and reduced mobility. Just because you have a disability doesn’t mean you cannot earn for yourself; it doesn’t mean you are a nobody in the society,' he said. The transport is more expensive than public transport, charging the equivalent of $1 per kilometer (0.6 miles). The same amount can be used to pay for a 40-kilometer (24-mile) ride in public transport vehicles. But Gatura noted it delivers people directly to their homes. 'I find the charges quite fair considering the convenience that it offers. I get to travel comfortably and without necessarily moving from my chair. It also somehow preserves my dignity,' said Mwikali, who has used the service for four months after a referral from a former classmate. But others like Cindy Cherotich can't afford the service. She must jostle for space on minibuses while on crutches. 'When I go to the bus station sometimes the public vehicles do not allow me to board,' she said. 'When they see my crutch and (see) somebody who is OK without crutches, they will let them in and I will be left.' Lucy Nkatha, a disability advocate and coordinator of Kiengu Women Challenged to Challenge Group, an NGO, said she had never heard of Ace Mobility and called for marketing support for such companies. 'It should also be made affordable,' she said. Sandra Nyawira, the disability inclusion adviser at United Disabled Persons of Kenya, noted that Kenya has a number of policies in place to address accommodations for people with disabilities, but implementation is rare. She called for more political will. 'It’s one thing to have a policy that speaks to your issues, but then it’s another to implement them,' she said. ___ The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

Myanmar's conflict-torn Rakhine state could face an imminent acute famine, UN report warns	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Myanmar’s Rakhine state, home to the Rohingya minority and engulfed in conflict between government forces and a powerful ethnic group, could face an imminent acute famine, the United Nations development agency warned in a new report. The U.N. Development Program said in the report issued Thursday that 'a perfect storm is brewing' which has put western Rakhine 'on the precipice of an unprecedented disaster.' It pointed to a chain of interlinked developments including restrictions on goods from elsewhere in Myanmar and neighboring Bangladesh, the absence of income for residents, hyperinflation, significantly reduced food production, and a lack of essential services and social safety net. As a result, UNDP said, 'an already highly vulnerable population may be on the brink of collapse in the coming months.' Buddhist-majority Myanmar has long considered the Rohingya Muslim minority to be 'Bengalis' from Bangladesh even though their families have lived in the country for generations. Nearly all have been denied citizenship since 1982. In August 2017, attacks by a Rohingya insurgent group on Myanmar security personnel triggered a brutal campaign by the military which drove at least 740,000 Rohingya to Bangladesh. The military is accused of mass rape, killings and burning thousands of homes. Since Myanmar’s military seized power in 2021 from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, pro-democracy guerillas and ethnic minority armed forces have been attempting to oust the military from power. Last November, the Arakan Army, which is seeking autonomy from Myanmar’s central government, began an offensive against the military in Rakhine and has gained control of more than half of its townships. The Arakan Army, which is the well-armed wing of the Rakhine ethnic minority movement, is also a member of the armed ethnic group alliance trying to topple the military. The UNDP report said that based on data the agency collected in 2023 and 2024, 'Rakhine’s economy has stopped functioning, with critical sectors such as trade, agriculture, and construction nearly at a standstill.' With domestic and international markets no longer accessible because of blockades, UNDP said people’s incomes are collapsing because they can’t export goods, and that agricultural jobs are disappearing for the same reason. In addition, it said, imports of cement have stopped, leading to 'an exorbitant price increase' and shutting down the construction industry, a major employer. The report, titled 'Rakhine: A Famine in the Making,' said, 'Rakhine could face acute famine imminently.' 'Predictions indicate that domestic food production will only cover 20% of its needs by March-April 2025,' UNDP said. 'Internal rice production is plummeting due to a lack of seeds, fertilizers, severe weather conditions, a steep rise in the number of internally displaced people who can longer engage in cultivation, and escalating conflict,' the U.N. agency said. 'This, along with the near-total cessation of internal and external trade, will leave over 2 million people at risk of starvation.' UNDP called for immediate action to allow goods and humanitarian aid into Rakhine, enable unimpeded access for aid workers and ensure their safety, and urgently provide financial resources to enable the agricultural sector to recover. 'Without urgent action, 95% of the population will regress into survival mode, left to fend for themselves amid a drastic reduction in domestic production, skyrocketing prices, widespread unemployment, and heightened insecurity,' UNDP warned. 'With trade routes closed and severe restrictions on aid, Rakhine risks becoming a fully isolated zone of deep human suffering,' the U.N. agency said.	https://apnews.com/article/un-myanmar-rakhine-rohingya-famine-f5aa6bd4c3b73b60b850f48c8ea495d2	2024-11-07T19:01:37-08:00	
Stock market today: World shares are mostly lower after US Fed cuts interest rates	HONG KONG (AP) — European markets opened higher on Friday while Asian shares ended mixed after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates again to ease pressure on the U.S. economy. Germany’s DAX slipped 0.1% to 19,362,32. In Paris, the CAC 40 edged 0.1% lower to 7,417.13. Britain’s FTSE 100 also fell 0.1%, to 8,132.48. The futures for the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average were virtually unchanged. Markets in Hong Kong and Shanghai fell as investors awaited much-anticipated steps by Beijing to rev up the slowing Chinese economy following a meeting of the legislature’s Standing Committee. 'If Beijing delivers, we might see a powerful rally ripple through the region as investors gear up for a fresh surge in market momentum,' Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary. Officials announced a 6 trillion yuan ($839 billion), three-year plan to help local governments refinance their many trillions of debt that has ballooned during the COVID-19 pandemic and a collapse of the property market. Hong Kong's Hang Seng erased early gains, falling 1.1% to 20,728.19. The Shanghai Composite index dropped 0.5% to 3,452.30. Japan's Nikkei 225 index gained 0.3% to 39,500.37. Shares in Japanese automaker Nissan Motor Corp. plummeted 6% on Friday after the company on Thursday announced that it will dismiss 9,000 workers and slash its global production capacity by 20% due to falling sales and rising costs and inventory. In South Korea, the Kospi shed 0.1% to 2,561.15, while Australia’s S&amp;P/ASX 200 gained 0.8% to 8,295.10. On Thursday, the S&amp;P 500 climbed 0.7%, adding to its surge from the day before following Donald Trump’s presidential victory. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was virtually unchanged, while the Nasdaq composite rallied 1.5%. The Fed’s announcement that it was easing its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point caused few ripples in the market because even the precise size of it was so well anticipated by investors. The central bank began easing rates in September and indicated more cuts were likely to come, as it focuses more on keeping the job market humming after helping get inflation nearly down to its 2% target. What’s less certain in the minds of investors now is how much Trump’s victory may upset the Fed’s plans. Trump is pushing for tariffs and other policies that economists say could drive inflation higher, along with the economy’s growth. Traders have already begun paring forecasts for how many cuts to rates the Fed will deliver next year because of that. While lower rates can boost the economy, they can also give inflation more fuel. For now, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said, nothing is changing. 'In the near term, the election will have no effects' on interest-rate policy, he said. At this point, Powell said it’s still not clear what the policies will be after Trump returns to the White House. 'We don’t guess, we don’t speculate and we don’t assume,' he said. The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond eased to 4.33% from 4.44% late Wednesday. A report on Thursday showed slightly more U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits, though the number remains relatively low. A separate report suggested U.S. workers improved their productivity during the summer, which can help keep a lid on inflation, but not by quite as much as economists expected. In other dealings early Friday, U.S. benchmark crude oil lost 89 cents to $71.47 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard, gave up 88 cents to $74.75 per barrel. The dollar fell to 152.61 Japanese yen from 152.94 yen. The euro slipped to $1.0770 from $1.0804.	https://apnews.com/article/stock-markets-rates-china-af8eff52e0a9c9252b5f654b0bbaa0bf	2024-11-07T18:29:55-08:00	
Yemen's Houthi rebels shoot down what witnesses say was a US drone as American military investigates	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Yemen's Houthi rebels shot down what bystanders described as an American drone early Friday, potentially the latest downing of a U.S. spy drone as the militants continue their attacks on the Red Sea corridor. The U.S. military acknowledged the videos circulating online showing what appeared to be a flaming aircraft dropping out of the sky and a field of burning debris in what those off-camera described as an area of Yemen's al-Jawf province. The military said it was investigating the incident, declining to elaborate further. It wasn't immediately clear what kind of aircraft was shot down in the low-quality night video. The Houthis have surface-to-air missiles capable of downing aircraft such as the Iranian missile known as the 358. Iran denies arming the rebels, though Tehran-manufactured weaponry has been found on the battlefield and in seaborne shipments heading to Yemen for the Shiite Houthi rebels despite a United Nations arms embargo. The Houthis have been a key component of Iran's self-described 'Axis of Resistance' during the Mideast wars that includes Lebanon's Hezbollah, Hamas and other militant groups. The Houthis did not immediately claim responsibility for downing the aircraft. However, it can take their fighters hours or even days after an incident before they acknowledge it. Since Houthis seized the country’s north and its capital of Sanaa in 2014, the rebels have shot down MQ-9 Reaper drones in Yemen in 2017, 2019, 2023 and 2024. The U.S. military has declined to offer a total figure for the number of drones it has lost during that time. Reapers, which cost around $30 million apiece, can fly at altitudes up to 50,000 feet (15,240 meters) and have an endurance of up to 24 hours before needing to land. The aircraft have been flown by both the U.S. military and the CIA over Yemen for years. The Houthis have targeted more than 90 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip started in October 2023. They seized one vessel and sank two in the campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have included Western military vessels as well. The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the U.K. to force an end to Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran. The tempo of the Houthi sea attacks also has waxed and waned over the months. In October, the U.S. military unleashed B-2 stealth bombers to target underground bunkers used by the Houthis.	https://apnews.com/article/mideast-wars-yemen-houthi-drone-shot-down-73c12a2bfd3a882ef29dbe1b3fef4997	2024-11-07T16:48:31-08:00	
Biden will visit the Amazon rainforest as part of six-day trip to Latin America	WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden will become the first sitting president to visit the Amazon rainforest later this month when he travels to Brazil as part of a six-day trip to Latin America for a pair of international summits, the White House said Thursday. Biden will start his trip with a Nov. 14-16 visit to Lima, Peru, where he will meet with President Dina Boluarte and attend the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. From there, he will travel to Manaus and Rio de Janeiro in Brazil from Nov. 17-19. In Manaus, Biden will visit the rainforest and see local, indigenous and other leaders who are working to preserve the region, the first such visit by a U.S. president. In Rio de Janeiro, Biden will meet with Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to promote workers' rights and clean economic growth, the White House said. He will also attend the Group of 20 summit of world leaders to discuss global challenges like hunger, poverty and climate change. Biden spoke earlier Thursday with Lula to discuss the upcoming G20 summit. It may have also been an opportunity for Biden to commiserate with a sympathetic world leader. The left-leaning Lula made clear his preference for Democrat Kamala Harris ahead of the U.S. election. Lula in 2022 defeated the far right former President Jair Bolsonaro, who was known as 'Trump of the Tropics.' Biden is in the final months of his presidency and will be handing off the Oval Office to Republican Donald Trump. The two summits will offer Biden one of his last chances as president to meet with heads of state he’s worked with over the years. ___	https://apnews.com/article/biden-peru-brazil-g20-apec-rainforest-d430cb932d9ff8c065196c0f8003cbcd	2024-11-07T14:13:11-08:00	
France condemns a spat between Israeli police and French consulate staff at a Jerusalem church	JERUSALEM (AP) — Armed Israeli police forced their way into a French-owned church compound in the contested city of Jerusalem on Thursday, the French foreign ministry said, briefly detaining two consulate employees and prompting the top French diplomat to abandon his planned visit to the site. The unusual incident threatened to further strain relations between Israel and France weeks after French President Emmanuel Macron’s call for an arms embargo on Israel prompted backlash from right-wing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The French Foreign Ministry said it would summon the Israeli ambassador in protest in the coming days. A strongly worded statement from France said Israeli security forces had intruded on the courtyard of the Church of the Pater Noster, angering French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot and prompting him to abandon his scheduled visit there. The ministry said Israeli police detained two staff members of the French Consulate in Jerusalem despite their diplomatic status, adding that the employees were released only after Barrot intervened. 'This attack on the integrity of a domain placed under the responsibility of France is likely to weaken the bonds I have, in fact, come to cultivate with Israel at a time when we all need to make progress in the region on the road to peace,' Barrot told reporters in Jerusalem. Barrot was meeting with Israeli officials Thursday in the city, where he pleaded for a cease-fire to stop the Israeli bombardment of Gaza and called for a diplomatic solution in Lebanon — a former French protectorate that Israel invaded last month in its broadening military campaign against the Iran-backed Hezbollah militant group. 'These actions are unacceptable,' the French Foreign Ministry statement said of Thursday's fracas between Israeli security forces and French diplomatic staffers. 'France condemns (these actions) all the more vigorously as they come at a time when it is doing everything it can to work towards de-escalating the violence in the region.' Israeli police portrayed the controversy as a misunderstanding, saying that two church workers who declined to identify themselves had refused entry to Israeli security guards accompanying Minister Barrot on his church visit. Israeli police said they held the men for some 20 minutes and released them once they were identified as employees of the French Consulate in Jerusalem, which is the protector of French religious communities and four holy sites in the city. The Israeli police said all foreign ministers on official visits to Israel are assigned Israeli security guards for their trips. It said the logistics of Barrot's visit were worked out beforehand with the French Embassy in Israel, warning the public against contributing to 'misleading narratives' about the altercation. The compound that Barrot had planned to visit — on the Mount of Olives overlooking the Old City of Jerusalem — holds a church originally built by Crusaders that believed the site to be where Jesus taught the Pater Noster, or Lord’s Prayer. It was later acquired by Princess Héloïse de la Tour d’Auvergne, who had the prayer written in calligraphy in numerous languages on the walls of the cloisters and courtyard, also home to the the ruins of the Byzantine Eleona Church. The site was entrusted to French Carmelite nuns in 1874. 'This domain is not only one that has belonged to France for over 150 years,' Barrot said. 'It's one where France has ensured security and maintenance with enormous care.' Thursday's incident was reminiscent of several others skirmishes over the years between irritated French officials and assertive Israeli bodyguards. In 2020, President Macron lost his temper at Israeli security officers who had insisted on accompanying him inside another French church in Jerusalem. In 1996, then-French President Jacques Chirac accused Israeli security forces of pushing and shoving his entourage in a spat that even drew an apology from a young Prime Minister Netanyahu during his first year in office. Such stand-offs take on symbolic significance in Jerusalem, among the most fiercely contested swaths of real estate on earth. Israel has viewed Jerusalem as its 'unified, eternal' capital since capturing east Jerusalem, which includes the Old City, in the 1967 Mideast war, along with the West Bank and Gaza. Palestinians want those territories for their future state, with east Jerusalem serving as their eventual capital. Israel annexed the eastern part of the city in a move not recognized internationally. Since the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks on Israel more than a year ago, President Macron has stressed his support of Israel and its right to defend itself. But tensions have escalated in recent weeks as Macron has demanded that Israel do more to avoid the rapidly mounting civilian casualties in its campaigns in Gaza and Lebanon. Later Thursday, Minister Barrot held talks on the conflict with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-france-netanyahu-war-gaza-lebanon-macron-church-3f14d060106160b10cbc8abbd3825f7a	2024-11-07T10:50:22-08:00	
Putin congratulates Trump on his election victory in his first public comments on the US vote	MOSCOW (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday congratulated Donald Trump on his election victory in his first public comment on the U.S. vote, and he praised the president-elect's courage during the July assassination attempt. 'His behavior at the moment of an attempt on his life left an impression on me. He turned out to be a brave man,' Putin said at an international forum following a speech in the Black Sea resort of Sochi. 'He manifested himself in the very correct way, bravely as a man,' he added. Putin also said that what Trump has said 'about the desire to restore relations with Russia, to help end the Ukrainian crisis, in my opinion, deserves attention at least.' The Kremlin earlier welcomed Trump’s claim that he could negotiate an end to the conflict in Ukraine 'in 24 hours' but emphasized that it will wait for concrete policy steps. ″I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate him on his election as president of the United States of America,' Putin said in a question-and-answer session at the conference. As to what he expects from a second Trump administration, Putin said, 'I don’t know what will happen now. I have no idea.' 'For him, this is still his last presidential term. What he will do is his matter,' added Putin, who this year began a fifth term that will keep him in power until 2030 and could seek six more years in office after that. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Thursday the Kremlin is not ruling out the possibility of contact between Putin and Trump before the inauguration, given that Trump 'said he would call Putin before the inauguration.' Peskov has emphasized that Moscow views the U.S. as an 'unfriendly' country that is directly involved in the Ukrainian conflict. He dismissed arguments that Putin’s failure to reach out quickly to Trump could hurt future ties, saying that Moscow's relations with Washington already are at the 'lowest point in history' and arguing that it will be up to the new U.S. leadership to change the situation. The Kremlin’s cautious stand reflected its view of the U.S. vote as a choice between two unappealing possibilities. While Trump is known for his admiration of Putin, the Russian leader has repeatedly noted that during Trump’s first term, there were 'so many restrictions and sanctions against Russia like no other president has ever introduced before him.'	https://apnews.com/article/putin-trump-russia-us-election-6f388707c132bdf6554ee4e615f894ad	2024-11-07T10:06:31-08:00	
Canada's Trudeau revives a Cabinet-level panel to address concerns about a Trump presidency	TORONTO (AP) — Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Thursday he is re-establishing a special Cabinet committee on Canada-U.S. relations to address his administration's concerns about another Donald Trump presidency. Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, who is also the country's finance minister, will chair the committee, which also will include other top officials including ministers of foreign affairs, public safety and industry. 'Following the election of President Donald Trump for a second term, the Cabinet Committee will focus on critical Canada-U.S. issues,' Trudeau's office said in a statement Thursday. Canada is one of the most trade-dependent countries in the world, and 75% of Canada’s exports go to the U.S. During Trump's first time, his move to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, and reports that he was considering a 25% tariff on the auto sector were considered an existential threat in Canada at the time. Trudeau called Trump on Wednesday to congratulate him and the two discussed the new free trade deal Trump reached during his first term with Canada and Mexico, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which replaced NAFTA. Although Trump once called Trudeau 'weak' and 'dishonest' during his first term, ties between the two countries have remained among the closest in the world. Freeland addressed reporters twice on Wednesday in an effort to reassure Canadians. 'I know a lot of Canadians are anxious. I want to say with utter sincerity and conviction to Canadians that Canada will be absolutely fine,' Freeland said. 'We have a strong relationship with the United States. We have a strong relationship with President Trump and his team. Let’s remember that our trading relationship today is governed by the trade deal concluded by President Trump himself and his team,' Freeland said. During the recent election campaign, Trump has proposed tariffs of 10% to 20% on foreign goods — and in some speeches has mentioned even higher percentages. Nelson Wiseman, a political science professor at the University of Toronto, said Canada should expect new tariffs and pressure to increase its military budget. According to NATO figures, Canada was estimated to be spending 1.33% of GDP on its military budget in 2023, below the 2% target that NATO countries have set for themselves. Trump has urged NATO countries to boost their own defense spending to ease the burden on the U.S. to deter the alliance's enemies. 'I expect that the free trade deal will be slightly modified as it was during Trump’s first presidency and not dramatically,' Wiseman said. 'Tariffs will hurt the Canadian economy economy but not cripple it. Canada has some cards to play in negotiations including countervailing tariffs, the concerns of American business leaders, and Canada’s storehouse of critical minerals.' The Canadian government notes that the U.S. and Canada are each other’s largest trade partners with nearly $3.6 billion Canadian (US$2.7 billion) worth of goods and services crossing the border each day in 2023. The ties between the two countries are without parallel anywhere in the world. There is close co-operation on defense, border security and law enforcement, and a vast overlap in culture, traditions and pastimes — with shared baseball, hockey, basketball and soccer leagues. About 400,000 people cross the world’s longest international border each day and about 800,000 Canadians live in the U.S. Robert Bothwell, a professor of Canadian history and international relations at the University of Toronto, said Canadians should be worried about potential rash actions on tariffs and trade. 'How would you feel if old Uncle Donald was feeling whimsical one morning and decided to do … oh, whatever he’d just heard on Fox News?,' Bothwell said.	https://apnews.com/article/canada-trump-trudeau-us-trade-075ccb2e68238c3b00c4b5cd24a19b4e	2024-11-07T09:56:57-08:00	
Belarus' hardline president releases 31 political prisoners but crackdown persists	TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — Belarus's authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko, who has led a harsh crackdown on opposition, pardoned and released 31 political prisoners, his office announced Thursday. The names of those released were not announced, but Lukashenko's office said three of them are invalids and 17 have chronic illnesses. Human rights activists and former prisoners say medical care and health conditions in Belarusian prisons are poor. The announcement said the freed prisoners had been convicted of 'crimes of an extremist nature,' a description widely used for opposition figures and people arrested in the mass protests that arose in 2020 after the disputed results of a presidential election gave Lukashenko a sixth term in office. The crackdown forced many opposition members to flee the country, while major activists who stayed in the country have been imprisoned. Lukashenko has released a total of 115 political prisoners this year, even while continuing the crackdown. The intention of the releases, which come ahead of new presidential elections in January, is unclear. 'Lukashenko is giving very contradictory signals — he has released 30 political prisoners, but at the same time arrested more than 100 people in the last week alone,' Pavel Sapelka of the human rights group Viasna told The Associated Press. 'We are seeing an escalation of fear and increased repression in Belarus on the eve of the presidential elections, and it is not entirely clear to whom and what signals Minsk is giving.' Viasna counts 1278 political prisoners in Belarus, including its Nobel Peace Prize-winning founder Ales Bialiatski.	https://apnews.com/article/lukashenko-belarus-crackdown-political-prisoners-released-b2a052cb791bce83ccc4f34827ece970	2024-11-07T09:50:52-08:00	
Why Mozambique's election has sparked weeks of protests and a violent crackdown by police	CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — Thousands protested in Mozambique's capital on Thursday and security forces responded by firing tear gas and rubber bullets, as weeks of post-election unrest continued in the southern African country. The protests were sparked by a vote last month that will keep the ruling party in power for more than a half-century amid allegations of rigging. Opposition parties and many citizens have rejected the results of the Oct. 9 presidential election as fraudulent and growing protests in the capital, Maputo, and other cities have been met by deadly force from police. Thursday's protest was the biggest yet. International rights groups say at least 20 people have been killed by police since the unrest began nearly a month ago, while local groups say the death toll is more than 50. Authorities are threatening to deploy the army as protesters set fires on the streets and burn ruling party offices. The internet is being restricted and social media sites have been blocked, according to Human Rights Watch. Neighboring South Africa has shut its border post with Mozambique and heightened security around it. What happened in the election? The candidate for the ruling Front for the Liberation of Mozambique, Daniel Chapo, was declared the winner of the presidential election on Oct. 24. That keeps the party that has governed Mozambique since independence from Portugal in 1975 in power for another five years. Even before the results were announced, opposition parties claimed fraud, accusing the ruling party, known as Frelimo, of ballot stuffing, manipulating voter lists and staffing polling stations with officials loyal to it. Frelimo has long been accused of rigging elections in the country of around 34 million. The European Union's observer team said there were irregularities in the election, including the altering of some results. Mozambican media has reported that the Constitutional Council, the supreme body for election law, has asked the commission that ran the election to explain discrepancies. Senior opposition figures killed Independent candidate Venancio Mondlane, who was second behind Chapo in the official results, has led criticism of the vote. He called for a national strike and for people to stay at home in the days after the election in protest at the alleged tampering. But the mood changed when two senior opposition figures were killed in their car in a late-night shooting by unidentified gunmen on Oct. 18. The men who were killed were the lawyer for Mondlane and the official spokesperson for the political party that supported Mondlane in the election. Mondlane said they were assassinated and he and opposition supporters gathered near the site of the killings the day after to protest. Police fired tear gas canisters at Mondlane, his aides and journalists who were interviewing him, forcing them to flee. Growing protests Since then, there have been waves of protests across the country. In one city, protesters toppled and cut the head off a statue of current President Filipe Nyusi, who is stepping down after serving a maximum two terms. Mondlane said on social media that he had gone into exile in fear for his life after the killing of his lawyer. His whereabouts are unknown, but he has called on social media for more protests 'so that we can then be freed from these shackles that have held us up for 50 years.' Authorities have said little other than the protests have been violent and needed to be quelled. They have not given information on the number of people killed or injured in the protests. Rights groups accused the police of shooting at peaceful protests in the days after the election and said children were among the victims. Anger among opposition supporters has swelled. The presidential palace is under heavy guard. A history of civil war and violence Mozambique is still in the shadow of a bloody 15-year civil war the leftist Frelimo fought against rebel group Renamo after independence. The country only held its first elections in 1994 and this was the first vote where there were no armed groups connected to political parties after a process to disarm militias. The country, which has rich natural resources including large, newly discovered natural gas fields, was already struggling with a yearslong insurgency by an Islamic State-affiliated group in the northern province of Cabo Delgado. Mondlane, who broke away from Renamo, has support among Mozambique's disaffected youth and he and the new Podesa party that is backing him have become the biggest challenge to Frelimo's long rule. ___ AP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa	https://apnews.com/article/mozambique-election-protests-violence-unrest-frelimo-e732c78af8f39f89862c85f408d40975	2024-11-07T08:27:46-08:00	
Notre Dame marks arrival of Paris Olympics’ iconic trackside bell as cathedral reopening nears	PARIS (AP) — Paris’s Notre Dame cathedral, whose historic bells were silenced following 2019’s devastating fire, will soon echo again with fresh chimes. On Thursday, the Gothic landmark took delivery of three new bells, including one that was used in the city’s Stade de France stadium during this year’s Paris Olympic Games. The Olympic bell, a gift from the Paris 2024 organizing committee, will be installed alongside two smaller bells, named Chiara and Carlos, above the altar where they will be rung during Mass, officials said. Their arrival ahead of Notre Dame's reopening on Dec. 8 marks a milestone in the painstaking restoration and modernization of the 861-year-old cathedral, made famous around the world by Victor Hugo's 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame.' Olivier Ribadeau Dumas, rector of Notre Dame, expressed gratitude for the bells’ arrival during a ceremony. 'What a joy it is,' he said. 'At the most important moment of the Mass these bells will ring, just as they did when the victor of a competition could celebrate their victory.' During the Paris 2024 Games, the iconic Olympic bell was rung by each track and field winner. It bears the mark 'Paris 2024,' while the two others are adorned with a round symbol combining the image of Notre Dame’s iconic rosary window with a monstrance, a religious vessel central to the cathedral’s altar. Crafted by the renowned Cornille Havard foundry, in Villedieu-les-Poêles, Normandy, the bells embody France’s distinguished bell-making tradition. In a solemn moment, Dumas consecrated the bells with holy water and a tree branch. Standing on the square outside the cathedral, he and Tony Estanguet, head of the Paris 2024 organizing committee, struck the bells with a wooden mallet to mark the occasion. 'What a powerful symbol it is to see this second life given to the Paris 2024 bell, which brought us so many emotions during these Games,' Estanguet said. The bells replace three that were previously positioned near Notre Dame’s 19th-century spire, which dramatically collapsed during the fire which ripped through the cathedral’s rafters and roof. The new bells will be placed in a different location within the cathedral, officials said, where their return will add to the soundscape of Notre Dame’s daily life. They join the eight historic bells from the cathedral’s north tower that were reinstalled in September after being cleaned and renovated. Those bells—Gabriel, Anne-Geneviève, Denis, Marcel, Étienne, Benoît-Joseph, Maurice, and Jean-Marie—were originally cast in 2013 for Notre Dame’s 850th anniversary. The cathedral’s two larger bells remain intact on the south tower and were unaffected by the blaze, officials added. The reconstruction of Notre Dame has involved more than 250 companies and hundreds of skilled craftsmen. The Olympic bell isn't the only symbol of old meeting new in Notre-Dame’s evolving restoration. Perched atop the newly designed spire, a golden rooster, reimagined by chief architect Philippe Villeneuve, marks a blend of the cathedral’s ancient spirit with a modern touch. The weathervane, which resembles a phoenix with flames licking its wings, is described as a testament to hope and revival.	https://apnews.com/article/notre-dame-bells-restoration-22c181d4a67556e96378acc618d9adfe	2024-11-07T05:02:15-08:00	
For many Iranians, Trump’s return intensifies worries about war. Yet some see reasons for hope	TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iranians, like many around the world, are divided on what Donald Trump's next presidency will bring: Some foresee an all-out war between Tehran and Washington, particularly as other conflicts rage in the region. Others hold out hope that America's 47th president might engage in unexpected diplomacy as he did with North Korea. But nearly all believe something will change in the U.S.-Iran relationship. 'Trump will use tougher levers against Iran,' warned Ahmad Zeidabadi, a political analyst. 'Iranian officials will keep rejecting him and that could make him escalate his pressure.' And while Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has final say on all matters of state, has repeatedly expressed his own disgust with Trump, Iran’s new reformist president has kept the door open to talks with Trump to seek relief from international sanctions to buoy a cratering economy. The Iranian rial, in a free fall for years, hit its lowest value against the dollar on Wednesday before slightly recovering. The U.S. and Iran have had an adversarial relationship since Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution and the takeover of the U.S. Embassy and 444-day hostage crisis that followed. Trump’s first term in office was marked by a particularly troubled period, when he pursued a policy of 'maximum pressure' against Tehran. He unilaterally withdrew America from Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers, leading to the sanctions hobbling the economy, and ordered the killing of the country's top general. Confirmation of Trump’s reelection came too late for most Wednesday papers. On Thursday, hewing to the official line, many decried the victory. The newspaper Hamshahri put an artist’s rendering of Trump in an orange prison jumpsuit and handcuffs under the headline: 'Return of the murderer.' The hard-line Javan newspaper said it was 'back to the crime scene.' On the streets of Tehran, opinions varied more. Some feared a return to the low points of Trump's first presidency. Others expressed joy. 'I’m very happy that Trump has won because he is really a powerful man,' said Fatemeh Kaveh, 40. 'I see him as a role model in terms of personality, and I always watch his stories (on social media), and I believe in him. I’m very happy he won.' But the one opinion that matters above all in Iran’s theocracy is that of Khamenei, who has been the country’s paramount ruler for six American presidencies. He has made his views on Trump clear. 'I do not consider Trump as a person worth exchanging any message with and I have no answer for him, nor will I respond to him in the future,' Khamenei told the late Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in 2019. Those comments came a year after Trump withdrew the U.S. from the nuclear accord, which offered Iran relief from international sanctions in return for restrictions meant to prevent it from building an atomic bomb. Then came Trump’s decision to assassinate Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani, a prominent figure within Iran, in a 2020 drone strike in Baghdad. Khamenei’s personal website still hosts a video that imagines Trump being killed in an Iranian drone strike as he plays golf with former U.S. Secretary of State and CIA chief Mike Pompeo. Both men have received additional protection over Iranian threats to their lives — and the country has been accused of hacking Trump campaign associates in hopes of hurting his prospects. Iranians have also not forgotten Soleimani’s killing. 'It is a good time for Iran to retaliate — the murderer of our hero has come back,' said Tehran resident Reza Solatani, 39. 'He should eventually pay for his crime.' The question now is how that hard-line approach will fare amid the economic crisis and other challenges. A string of mass protests have escalated in the last few years, most recently with the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini and women rejecting the state-mandated headscarf, or hijab. Iran remains locked in the Mideast wars roiling the region, and its leaders have threatened a retaliatory strike after Israel’s Oct. 26 attack. It allies are battered, including the militant groups of its self-described 'Axis of Resistance,' like Hamas, Lebanon’s Hezbollah and Yemen’s Houthi rebels. Support for those groups while Iranians struggle economically has been a protest cry. Trump's election means 'peace will return to Lebanon and Gaza and Iran will not spend our money there,' said Zohreh Naghavi, a 36-year-old who works in a clothing store. 'It is good news.' Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, who will mark his first 100 days in office next week, campaigned on a promise of outreach to the West to lift sanctions over Iran’s nuclear program — which now enriches uranium to near weapons-grade levels. On Thursday, Pezeshkian appeared to remain open to talks with Washington — even in the wake of Trump's victory — saying that 'it doesn’t matter who has won the U.S elections.' 'We will in no way have a closed and limited approach in the expansion of ties with other countries,' he said, according to the state-run IRNA news agency. That leaves open the possibility for negotiations. Trump in his first term famously courted North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Some Iranians have imagined the president-elect doing the same in Tehran. 'Because Trump is a showman he might announce that he wants to talk to Pezeshkian in person,' said Zeidabadi, the analyst. 'Unfortunately, the problem is that (the government) can’t accept that. Even if some people in the government are interested in doing that, the majority of hard-liners won’t let that happen and this can make Trump more angry too.' Still, some feel Iran already is at its breaking point. 'I think Iran has no choice but to make peace with Trump, considering the situation of the dollar (exchange rate) and the livelihoods of people and the high prices,' said Sina Khaledian, a 32-year-old nurse. 'There is lack of medicine and health care. They have to do this. I think the country’s capacity to endure has been exhausted.' ___ Gambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Associated Press writers Nasser Karimi and Amir Vahdat in Tehran, Iran, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-us-trump-election-nuclear-tensions-mideast-wars-9a8012fdfabc3cb0fd2340bf99c0aaf7	2024-11-07T04:53:31-08:00	
The Latest: Biden guarantees a ‘peaceful transfer of power,’ House control hangs in the balance	President Joe Biden delivered remarks to the nation midday Thursday in his first appearance on camera in the aftermath of Donald Trump ’s decisive victory over Kamala Harris. Control over the U.S. House of Representatives hangs in the balance, teetering between a Republican or Democratic majority with dozens of races left to be called. The Republicans won control of the U.S. Senate early Wednesday. Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: State Department prepares for the presidential transition The State Department says it has begun to take steps to ease the transition from the Biden administration to Trump’s incoming administration. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has directed all department employees to work with incoming staffers to ensure a peaceful and orderly transition that protects U.S. national security. Department spokesman Matthew Miller said that retired senior diplomat Stephen Mull, a former ambassador who is currently a vice provost at the University of Virginia, has been tasked with leading the effort to work with Trump’s team. Miller said though that the department has not yet been contacted by the Trump team, which is being led by Brian Hook, a former special representative for Iran during the Trump administration, and Joel Rayburn, a former special envoy for Syria. Miller said the department will put together information on policy and procedures and be ready to answer any questions. ‘The Handmaid’s Tale’ is selling again Since former President Trump clinched his return to the White House, Margaret Atwood’s dystopian classic about a country where women are brutally repressed has been high on the Amazon bestseller list. 'The Handmaid’s Tale' was popular throughout Trump’s first term, along with such dark futuristic narratives as George Orwell’s '1984' and Ray Bradbury’s 'Fahrenheit 451,' both of which were back in the Amazon top 40 as of Thursday afternoon. Another best-seller from Trump’s previous time in office, Timothy Snyder’s 'On Tyranny: Twenty Lessons from the Twentieth Century,' was in the top 10. Pro-Trump books also were selling well. Former first lady Melania Trump’s memoir, 'Melania,' was the No. 1 seller, and Vice President-elect JD Vance’s 'Hillbilly Elegy' was in the top 10. Donald Trump’s photo book, 'Save America,' was in the top 30. Federal Reserve Chair says Trump has no legal authority to fire him At a press conference today, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said he would not resign if President-elect Donald Trump asked him to, and underscored that in his view, the president wouldn’t have the legal authority to fire him, as Trump reportedly sought to do the last time he was in the White House. 'Not permitted under the law,' Powell said, when asked if he was worried that Trump could demote him or other Fed officials, such as Michael Barr, the Fed’s top banking regulator, who has sought to tighten financial regulations. Most experts agree that a president generally doesn’t have the authority to fire a member of the Fed’s governing board, but there is more ambiguity about whether Trump could remove Powell as chair while leaving him as a member of the board. Democrat Steven Horsford wins reelection to US House in Nevada’s 4th Congressional District Democratic Rep. Steven Horsford won reelection to a U.S. House seat representing Nevada on Thursday. Horsford, a four-term congressman, became the first Black person to represent Nevada in Congress when he was first elected to the House. This year, he defeated former North Las Vegas Mayor John Lee. The district stretches north from Las Vegas, toward Nye County in the west and along the Utah border in the eastern portion of the district. The Associated Press declared Horsford the winner at 2:36 p.m. EST. Democrat Kim Schrier wins reelection to US House in Washington’s 8th Congressional District Democratic Rep. Kim Schrier won reelection to a U.S. House seat representing Washington on Thursday. She defeated Republican Carmen Goers, who works in financial services. Schrier, a pediatrician, first won her seat in 2018, becoming the first Democrat to represent the district. Of the seven Washington state congressional districts Democrat Joe Biden carried in 2020, the 8th district had the smallest margin. The district covers much of the middle of the state, from the eastern suburbs of Seattle to the Columbia River. The Associated Press declared Schrier the winner at 2:10 p.m. EST. Democrat Don Davis wins reelection to US House in North Carolina’s 1st Congressional District Democratic Rep. Donald Davis won reelection to a U.S. House seat representing North Carolina on Thursday. Davis ran in territory that became less favorable to Democrats in 2023 after North Carolina passed new maps that brought more Republican-leaning voters into the 1st District. President Joe Biden still narrowly carried areas in 2020 that make up the district’s current configuration. Davis defeated Army veteran Laurie Buckhout. The Associated Press declared Davis the winner at 2:03 p.m. EST. Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulates Donald Trump on his election victory Putin’s congratulations were the Russian leader’s first public comment on the outcome of the U.S. balloting and came after a speech during an international forum conference in the Black Sea resort of Sochi. ″I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate him on his election as president of the United States of America,' Putin said in a question-and-answer session. Canada’s Trudeau revives a Cabinet-level panel to address concerns about a Trump presidency Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Thursday he is re-establishing a special Cabinet committee on Canada-U.S. relations to address his administration’s concerns about another Donald Trump presidency.

'Following the election of President Donald Trump for a second term, the Cabinet Committee will focus on critical Canada-U.S. issues,' Trudeau’s office said in a statement Thursday. ▶ Read more about what the committee will focus on White evangelical voters show steadfast support for Donald Trump’s presidency After Donald Trump gave his victory speech early Wednesday at the Palm Beach Convention Center, dozens of his supporters gathered in a lobby to sing 'How Great Thou Art,' reciting from memory the words and harmonies of a classic hymn, popular among evangelical Christians. It was a fitting coda to an election in which Trump once again won the support of about 8 in 10 white evangelical Christian voters, according to AP VoteCast, a sweeping survey of more than 120,000 voters. That margin — among a group that represented about 20% of the total electorate — repeats similarly staggering margins of evangelical support that Trump received in 2020. Evangelicals said they believed Trump would implement their policy priorities on religious as well as general issues such as immigration and the economy. But critics fear Trump’s administration will implement Christian nationalist policies that will give Christianity a privileged status in public life, rather than maintaining a separation of church and state and treating people of all beliefs equally. ▶ Read more about Evangelicals’ support of Trump Republican Scott Perry wins reelection to US House in Pennsylvania’s 10th Congressional District Republican Rep. Scott Perry won reelection to a U.S. House seat representing Pennsylvania on Thursday. The former Freedom Caucus chairman found himself in an expensive race against Janelle Stelson, a longtime local TV news anchor, in a Harrisburg district that Republican Donald Trump carried in the 2020 presidential election. Perry, a four-term congressman, was the only lawmaker to have his cellphone seized by FBI agents investigating the web of Trump loyalists who were central to the former president’s bid to remain in power after his 2020 election loss. The Associated Press declared Perry the winner at 1:47 p.m. EST. Republican Robert Bresnahan wins election to US House in Pennsylvania’s 8th Congressional District, beating incumbent Matt Cartwright Republican Rob Bresnahan won election to a U.S. House seat representing Pennsylvania on Thursday, defeating Democratic Rep. Matt Cartwright. Republicans have long sought to unseat Cartwright in this Scranton-based seat that Republican Donald Trump carried in the 2020 presidential election. Bresnahan is a first-time candidate and the CEO of an electrical contracting company founded by his grandfather. Cartwright has represented the district for six terms. The Associated Press declared Bresnahan the winner at 1:46 p.m. EST. Republican Ryan Mackenzie wins election to US House in Pennsylvania’s 7th Congressional District, beating incumbent Susan Wild Republican Ryan Mackenzie won election to a U.S. House seat representing Pennsylvania on Thursday, defeating Democratic Rep. Susan Wild in the highly competitive district. Mackenzie represents parts of Lehigh County in the state House. While Democrat Joe Biden carried the Allentown district in 2020, Republican Donald Trump won it in 2016. Wild, a three-term congresswoman, is a perennial Republican target in her eastern Pennsylvania district and had staved off the challenges until now. The Associated Press declared Mackenzie the winner at 1:44 p.m. EST. Rioters who stormed the Capitol after Trump’s 2020 defeat toast his White House return As it became clear Donald Trump was returning to the White House, the Florida man who posed for photos with then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s lectern during the Capitol riot popped a bottle of Trump-branded sparkling wine. 'Y’all are in trouble,' he said after taking a sip in a video shared on social media. Rioters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, are celebrating Trump’s victory and hoping he makes good on his campaign trail promise to pardon them. Trump didn’t mention the Jan. 6 defendants, whom he’s called 'hostages' and 'patriots,' during his victory speech Wednesday. But his defeat of Vice President Kamala Harris throws into doubt the future of the largest prosecution in Justice Department history over the unprecedented assault on a seat of American democracy. More than 1,500 people have been charged with federal crimes stemming from the riot that left more than 100 police officers injured and sent lawmakers running into hiding as they met to certify Joe Biden’s 2020 victory. Trump hasn’t explained how he’ll decide who gets pardoned. But he’s suggested he would consider granting them even for those accused of assault as well as the former Proud Boys leader convicted of orchestrating a violent plot to keep Trump in power. ▶ Read more about Trump and the Capitol rioters Democrat Laura Gillen wins election to US House in New York’s 4th Congressional District, beating incumbent Anthony D’Esposito Democrat Laura Gillen won election to a U.S. House seat representing New York on Thursday, defeating Republican Rep. Anthony D’Esposito. Gillen is a former town supervisor who campaigned on supporting law enforcement and border security, an issue many Democrats blame for their losses in New York in 2022. She lost to D’Esposito by just over 3 percentage points last cycle. Gillen is one of several Democrats running against a New York Republican congressman in a district that Democrat Joe Biden carried in 2020. The district falls just outside the New York City borough of Queens. The Associated Press declared Gillen the winner at 12:39 p.m. EST. California’s governor calls special session to protect liberal policies from Trump presidency California’s Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, a fierce critic of President-elect Donald Trump, on Thursday called for lawmakers to convene a special session later this year to safeguard the state’s progressive policies on climate change, reproductive rights and immigration ahead of another Trump presidency. The move — a day after the former president resoundingly defeated Vice President Kamala Harris in the presidential race — effectively reignited California’s resistance campaign against conservative policies that state Democratic leaders started during the first Trump administration. The move is also part of a growing discussion among Democratic state officials across the country seeking to protect policies that face threats under Trump’s leadership. ▶ Read more about what California and other blue states are doing Republican Jeff Hurd wins election to US House in Colorado’s 3rd Congressional District Republican Jeffrey Hurd won election to a U.S. House seat representing Colorado on Thursday, maintaining Republican control of the 3rd District seat now represented by GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert. Boebert, who nearly lost her seat to Democrat Adam Frisch in 2022, decided this year to run for former Republican Rep. Ken Buck’s vacant seat in territory that’s even friendlier to Republicans. The victory by Hurd, an attorney seen as a moderate alternative to Boebert, marked the second loss in a row for Frisch, a former City Council member from Aspen, who campaigned as a pragmatic businessman. The Associated Press declared Hurd the winner at 12:10 p.m. EST. Democrat Dina Titus wins reelection to US House in Nevada’s 1st Congressional District Democratic Rep. Dina Titus won reelection to a U.S. House seat representing Nevada on Thursday. The Las Vegas district picked up Republican-leaning suburban areas after redistricting, turning it into a target for the GOP. But for the second election in a row, Titus defeated Republican Mark Robertson, a retired Army colonel. She has served seven terms in Congress. The Associated Press declared Titus the winner at 12:04 p.m. EST. House Democratic leader says ‘we must count every vote’ in the tight race for House control Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, the House Democratic leader, issued a statement Thursday thanking the Harris-Walz campaign for running 'an inspired and positive campaign focused on lifting people up.' But the New York lawmaker issued caution on the status of the House races, saying 'we must count every vote' in outstanding states like Arizona and California. 'I am proud that the Democratic Party does not believe in election denial,' Jeffries said. 'Our Democracy is precious and it involves elevating public trust in our system of free and fair elections, not undermining it.' He also quoted President Joe Biden, adding 'We cannot love America only when we win.' Wisconsin Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin pledges to work with Trump and calls for less division Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin pledged during her reelection victory speech Thursday to work with President-elect Donald Trump when possible, but she also vowed to fight him to protect the national health care law and abortion rights. Baldwin narrowly won reelection to a third term over Republican businessman Eric Hovde, who was endorsed by Trump. Hovde has yet to concede in a race where the margin is so close he could seek a recount. 'We deserve a politics with less vitriol, less division, less hatred and fewer lies. Actually, no lies,' Baldwin said to a room of supporters at a steamfitters union training center. Baldwin defeated Hovde by just under 29,000 votes, a margin of 0.9%, based on unofficial results. State law allows for the race losers within 1 percentage point of the winner to seek a recount, but Hovde hasn’t yet said whether he’ll do that. Hovde’s campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday. ▶ Read more about Wisconsin’s Senate race Biden delivers remarks following Trump's victory over Harris President Joe Biden delivered remarks to the nation Thursday in what was his first appearance on camera following Donald Trump’s decisive victory over Kamala Harris. 'In a democracy, the will of the people always prevails,' he said near the beginning. Biden said he had spoken with Trump and assured him that he would direct his administration to ensure a 'peaceful and orderly transition,' because that’s what the people deserve. Biden was subtly nodding to how Trump, in 2020, refused to accept he lost the election. Trump was reelected this week. Biden spoke from the Rose Garden at the White House after Democrat Kamala Harris lost this week to Donald Trump, speaking to his supporters and Americans. The president reiterated that the U.S. election system 'is honest, it is fair, and it is transparent. And it can be trusted, win or lose.' He closed by saying that defeat doesn't mean one is defeated. 'America endures,' he said. 'We’re going to be ok, but we need to stay engaged.' Democrat Val Hoyle wins reelection to US House in Oregon’s 4th Congressional District Democratic Rep. Val Hoyle won reelection to a U.S. House seat representing Oregon on Thursday. Hoyle, a first-term congresswoman, defeated Republican Monique DeSpain, an Air Force veteran. Hoyle succeeded longtime Democratic U.S. Rep. Peter DeFazio in 2022. The 4th District runs along the western portion of the state and includes Eugene. The Associated Press declared Hoyle the winner at 10:38 a.m. EST. Independent Angus King wins reelection to the US Senate from Maine Independent Sen. Angus King won a third term in the U.S. Senate representing Maine on Thursday, turning back challenges from a former Republican state party chair and a Democratic environmental activist. The 80-year-old former governor would be the oldest senator from Maine to serve if he completes his term, which ends in 2030, but he wasn't dogged by questions about his age like President Joe Biden, the former Democratic presidential nominee. King caucuses with Democrats and was first elected to the Senate in 2012. The Associated Press declared King the winner at 10:14 a.m. EST. Here’s how 5 key demographic groups voted in 2024 Donald Trump won the presidency after holding tight to his core base of voters and slightly expanding his coalition to include several groups that have traditionally been part of the Democratic base. That finding comes from AP VoteCast, a sweeping survey of more than 120,000 voters nationwide that shows what issues mattered to voters in this election. Trump picked up a small but significant share of Black and Hispanic voters and made narrow gains with men and women. As Trump chipped away at parts of the Democratic coalition, Vice President Kamala Harris wasn’t able to make enough of her own gains. Trump succeeded in locking down his traditionally older, white base of voters, and he slightly expanded his margins with other groups into a winning coalition. ▶ Read more about how five key demographic groups voted Many European leaders at summit stress the need for defense self-reliance in wake of Trump’s reelection Around 50 European leaders on Thursday called for a stronger defense posture across the continent that no longer necessitates a fundamental dependence on Washington as they gave a guarded welcome to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. The European Political Community summit on Thursday in Hungary’s capital of Budapest reassessed trans-Atlantic relations in the hope that Trump’s second U.S. presidency will avoid the strife of his first administration. 'He was elected by the American people. He will defend the American interests,' French President Emmanuel Macron told the other leaders, adding that it was not the role of European Union leaders to 'comment on the election ... to wonder if it is good or not.' 'The question is whether we are willing to defend the European interest. It is the only question. It is our priority,' Macron said. There are concerns, too, that the robust military aid Ukraine has enjoyed under President Joe Biden will be cut under Trump, particularly if Republicans take control of the House. ▶ Read more about how European leaders are responding to Trump’s election Feds set to cut interest rates again amid post-election uncertainty Federal Reserve officials are poised Thursday to reduce their key interest rate for a second straight time, responding to a steady slowdown of inflation pressures that exasperated many Americans and contributed to Donald Trump’s presidential election victory. Yet the Fed’s future moves are now more uncertain in the aftermath of the election, given that Trump’s economic proposals have been widely flagged as potentially inflationary. His election has also raised the specter of meddling by the White House in the Fed’s policy decisions, with Trump having proclaimed that as president he should have a voice in the central bank’s interest rate decisions. The Fed has long guarded its status as an independent institution able to make difficult decisions about borrowing rates, free from political interference. Yet during his previous term in the White House, Trump publicly attacked Chair Jerome Powell after the Fed raised rates to fight inflation, and he may do so again. ▶ Read more about interest rate cuts FACT FOCUS: A multimillion-vote gap between 2020 and 2024 fuels false election narratives Less than 24 hours after Donald Trump was elected the 47th president of the United States, social media users began pushing two conflicting narratives to suggest election fraud, one that revived false claims by Trump that the 2020 vote was stolen from him and the other questioning how Vice President Kamala Harris could have received so many fewer votes in 2024 than President Joe Biden in 2020. Both narratives hinge on a supposed 20 million vote gap between Harris and Biden. Here’s a closer look at the facts. CLAIM: President Joe Biden won approximately 20 million more votes in the 2020 election than Vice President Kamala Harris earned in the 2024 race, proving either that Trump has cheated his way to a second term or that there was widespread fraud four years ago. THE FACTS: The claims are unfounded. Votes from Tuesday’s presidential election are still being counted, so any comparison with previous races would not be accurate. In addition, election officials and agencies monitoring the vote have reported no significant issues with Tuesday’s election. Claims of widespread fraud in 2020 have been debunked countless times. ▶ Read more on this fact focus Trump’s return elicits both worry and hope among Iranians Iranians, like many around the world, are divided on what Donald Trump’s next presidency will bring: Some foresee an all-out war between Tehran and Washington, particularly as other conflicts rage in the region. Others hold out hope that America’s 47th president might engage in unexpected diplomacy as he did with North Korea. But nearly all believe something will change in the U.S.-Iran relationship. And while Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has final say on all matters of state, has repeatedly expressed his own disgust with Trump, Iran’s new reformist president has kept the door open to talks with Trump to seek relief from international sanctions to buoy a cratering economy. The Iranian rial, in a free fall for years, hit its lowest value against the dollar on Wednesday before slightly recovering. ▶ Read more about the response in Iran to Trump’s election win What could US diplomacy look like under Trump?

Bernie Sanders did not mince words in a scathing statement Wednesday. 'It should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working class people would find that the working class has abandoned them,' Sanders, Vermont’s senior senator, said. 'First, it was the white working class, and now it is Latino and Black workers as well,' Sanders said. Sanders won reelection to a fourth term on Tuesday. He singled out wealth inequality, a slipping standard of living in the U.S., a lack of full health care guarantees and support for Israel’s recent military campaigns as problems Democrats need to focus on. Sanders’s 2016 presidential run was a key factor in pushing the dialogue in the Democratic party to the left. Sanders has built his political career outside — and often criticizing — the Democratic Party, but he caucuses with Democrats in the Senate. Vatican No. 2: Holy See hopes Trump will help end the wars in Ukraine and Gaza 'At the start of his mandate, we wish him much wisdom because this is the main virtue of rulers according to the Bible,' Cardinal Pietro Parolin said, speaking on the sidelines of a Rome conference on Thursday, according to Vatican News. While acknowledging no one had a 'magic wand' to end wars in Ukraine and Gaza, Parolin said the Holy See hoped Trump 'can indeed be an element of détente and pacification in the current conflicts that are bleeding the world.' Parolin also said he hoped Trump would work to end polarization in the U.S., including over abortion. On migration, he recalled Pope Francis’ call to welcome those fleeing wars, poverty and climate change. After visiting the U.S.-Mexico border in 2016 and asked about Trump’s call to build a wall, Francis famously said anyone who builds a wall to keep out migrants was 'not Christian.' More recently, Francis recommended U.S. voters choose the 'lesser evil' when asked how a U.S. Catholic should vote given Trump’s pledge to deport migrants and Vice President Kamala Harris’ support of abortion rights. The Dalai Lama congratulates Trump on his election win 'I have long admired the United States of America as the champion of democracy, freedom and the rule of law,' the Tibetan spiritual leader said in a message to Trump from the northern Indian town of Dharamshala where he has lived in exile since fleeing Tibet in 1959. 'The Tibetan people and I have been honored to have received the support of respective U.S. Presidents and the American people, in our endeavor to protect and preserve our ancient Buddhist culture — a culture of peace, non-violence and compassion that has the potential to benefit humanity as a whole,' he said. Turkey’s president spoke with Trump late on Wednesday Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan conveyed his hopes in a call for strengthened cooperation between their two countries during Trump’s new term in office, according to a statement from the Turkish president’s office. Trump’s presidential transition starts now. Here’s how it will work Trump’s impending return to the White House means he’ll want to stand up an entirely new administration from the one that served under President Joe Biden. His team is also pledging that the second won’t look much like the first one Trump established after his 2016 victory. The president-elect now has a 75-day transition period to build out his team before Inauguration Day arrives on Jan. 20. One top item on the to-do list: filling around 4,000 government positions with political appointees, people who are specifically tapped for their jobs by Trump’s team. That includes everyone from the secretary of state and other heads of Cabinet departments to those selected to serve part-time on boards and commissions. Around 1,200 of those presidential appointments require Senate confirmation, which should be easier with the Senate now shifting to Republican control. ▶ Read more about Trump’s transition Neither party has a dominant pathway to House majority The House contests remain a tit-for-tat fight to the finish, with no dominant pathway to the majority for either party. Rarely, if ever, have the two chambers of Congress flipped in opposite directions. Each side is gaining and losing a few seats, including through the redistricting process, which is the routine redrawing of House seat boundary lines. The process reset seats in North Carolina, Louisiana and Alabama. Much of the outcome hinges on the West, particularly in California, where a handful of House seats are being fiercely contested, and mail-in ballots arriving a week after the election will still be counted. Hard-fought races around the 'blue dot' in Omaha, Nebraska and in far-flung Alaska are among those being watched. Updates on the last two presidential races left to be called With a win in Wisconsin early Wednesday, Trump cleared the 270 electoral votes needed to clinch the presidency. But his exact margin of victory is still unclear — there are two presidential races that the AP has yet to call: Arizona: Officials in Arizona’s Maricopa County said late Wednesday they’ve got more than 700,000 ballots left to count, which means the races for president and senate were too early to call. In all, AP estimates there are at least a million ballots to be added to the results in Arizona. County election officials are expected to firm up those numbers on Thursday. Nevada: AP estimated late Wednesday evening that there are more than 200,000 ballots left to count in Nevada — including more than 130,000 in Clark County. Given the narrow margins in the races for president and U.S. Senate, both are too early to call. The AP will further review results released by Nevada election officials on Thursday.

Control of the US House hangs in the balance with enormous implications for Trump’s agenda The U.S. House majority hung in the balance Wednesday, teetering between Republican control that would usher in a new era of unified GOP governance in Washington or a flip to Democrats as a last line of resistance to a Trump second-term White House agenda. A few individual seats, or even a single one, will determine the outcome. Final tallies will take a while, likely pushing the decision into next week — or beyond. After Republicans swept into the majority in the U.S. Senate by picking up seats in West Virginia, Ohio and Montana, House Speaker Mike Johnson predicted his chamber would fall in line next.

Italy opens procedure against China's Sinochem for possible breach of Pirelli governance	MILAN (AP) — Italy has opened an administrative procedure against China’s Sinochem, the largest shareholder in Italian tiremaker Pirelli, for a possible breach of restrictions designed to protect national strategic assets. Pirelli announced Wednesday that the procedure was launched under the so-called 'golden power' provisions, which include restrictions to the access of some information and higher vote thresholds for strategic decisions, invoked by the Rome government in mid-2023. Pirelli said Sinochem, which controls a 37% stake in the company, has denied any violations of the restrictions, adding the Italian government had 120 days to issue a finding. In announcing the golden power provision, the government cited the sensitivity of sensors implanted in tires that can collect data such as road layouts, geolocation and the state of infrastructure, making it of a 'critical technology of national strategic importance.' The tiremaker’s second-largest investor is Camfin, the investment vehicle of Pirelli’s former CEO and current executive vice-chairman Marco Tronchetti Provera, which holds a 32.4% stake.	https://apnews.com/article/italy-golden-power-china-pirelli-sinochem-67a3276b8e391fe0c7903ae8ea9cbc8b	2024-11-07T02:46:23-08:00	
An 8-hour Russian drone barrage keeps Kyiv on edge as the war in Ukraine nears 1,000 days	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Dozens of Russian drones targeted the Ukrainian capital Kyiv in a nighttime attack that lasted eight hours, authorities said Thursday, as Russia kept up its relentless pounding of Ukraine after almost 1,000 days of war. Russian forces fired lone drones and swarms of drones that entered Ukrainian airspace from various directions and at a variety of altitudes, officials said, in an apparent attempt to stretch air defense systems and unnerve city residents. Ukrainian air defenses 'neutralized' three dozen drones, but falling debris caused damage to a hospital and residential and office buildings in the capital, local authorities said, including a blaze on the 33rd floor of an apartment building. At least two people were reported injured. Drone attacks on Kyiv have recently been occurring almost daily, with the nighttime explosions and the continuous buzzing sound of drones keeping the city on edge. Russia is deploying about 10 times more Iranian-made Shahed drones than it was this time last year, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said earlier this week. Ukraine’s forces are struggling to match the might of Russia’s military, which is much bigger and better equipped. Western support is crucial for Ukraine to sustain the costly war of attrition. The uncertainty over how long that aid will continue has deepened, however, with the election of Donald Trump as the next president of the United States. He has repeatedly taken issue with U.S. aid to Ukraine. Russia, meanwhile, is trying to grind down Ukraine’s appetite for the fight and sap the West’s support for Kyiv by drawing out the conflict. The Russian barrages mostly involve Shahed drones. They are suited to terrorizing civilians, according to Andrii Kovalenko, head of the state Center for Countering Disinformation. Russia is aiming to save and stockpile its missiles, which are much more powerful than drones, Kovalenko claimed Thursday. Russia has used missiles effectively in its campaign to knock out Ukraine’s power grid. Also, the drone attacks gradually wear down Ukraine’s air defenses, making it more vulnerable to future missile launches. Power outages were reported in the Zhytomyr region, which borders Kyiv to the west, following a Russian attack there, according to the energy company Zhytomyroblenergo. Another Russian drone attack injured one person in the southern city of Odesa, regional Gov. Oleh Kiper said, as drone debris damaged an 11-story residential building. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-drones-kyiv-attack-0160dee7ea700d4c561c8735710918d8	2024-11-07T01:15:16-08:00	
50 European leaders assess how Trump will affect their fortunes and seek a common stance on Russia	BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — Around 50 European leaders, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, were reassessing their trans-Atlantic relations at a summit Thursday in the hope that Donald Trump's second U.S. presidency will avoid the strife of his first administration. European officials will also be seeking a strong common stance on Russia at the one-day gathering. Rutte, who was Dutch prime minister during Trump's first 2017-2021 presidency, said that 'I worked with him very well for four years. He is extremely clear about what he wants. He understands that you have to deal with each other to come to joint positions. And I think we can do that.' And he insisted that the common challenges posed by Russia in Ukraine affected both sides of the Atlantic. 'Russia is delivering the latest technology into North Korea in return for North Korean help with the war against Ukraine. And this is a threat not only to the European part of NATO, but also to the U.S. mainland,' Rutte said coming into the summit. Trump strongly pushed the European NATO allies to spend more on defense during his first presidency, to up and beyond 2% of gross domestic product and to be less reliant on U.S. military cover. That point has totally sunk in. 'When he was president, he was the one in NATO who stimulated us to move over the 2%. And now, also thanks to him, NATO, if you take out the numbers of the U.S., is above the 2%.,' Rutte said. Charles Michel, the council president of the 27-nation European Union, agreed that the continent needed to become less reliant on the United States. 'We have to be more masters of our destiny,' he said. 'Not because of Donald Trump or Kamala Harris, but because of our children.' During his election campaign, Trump has threatened anything from a trade war with Europe to a withdrawal of NATO commitments and a fundamental shift of support for Ukraine in its war with Russia — all issues that could have groundbreaking consequences for nations across Europe. Trump has said he would end the war in Ukraine, now well into its third year, within days of being reelected. Ukraine and many of its European backers fear that this means a peace on terms favorable to Russian President Vladimir Putin and involving the surrender of territory. European allies in NATO hope to convince Trump that if he helps to negotiate any peace, it should be done from a position of strength, for both Ukraine and the United States. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, the summit’s host and an ardent Trump fan, said early Thursday that he already had a phone call with the incoming president overnight, announcing that 'We have big plans for the future!' So did hard-right Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who lauded the 'deep and historic strategic partnership that has always tied Rome and Washington.' That partnership came under constant pressure during Trump’s first term, from 2017-2021. Trump’s administration slapped tariffs on EU steel and aluminum in 2018, based on the claim that foreign products, even if produced by American allies, were a threat to U.S. national security. Europeans and other allies retaliated with duties on U.S.-made motorcycles, bourbon, peanut butter and jeans, among other items. The impact of the U.S. election result could be felt in Europe for years to come, on issues including the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, as well as migration and climate change. Among the leaders, Zelenskyy, who is expected to make another plea for more aid as his country fends off Moscow’s invasion. The timing is laden with significance as Trump has vowed to end the war 'within 24 hours' of being elected — something leaders in Kyiv interpret as an impending evaporation of U.S. support following Trump's win. Further compounding an already complicated situation, Germany — Europe’s troubled economic juggernaut — sank into political crisis after German Chancellor Olaf Scholz fired his finance minister. It raises the specter of an election in a few months and yet another standoff between the emboldened hard right and the establishment parties in Europe. Those two combined 'adds even more pepper and salt to this situation,' Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said. ___ Lorne Cook contributed to this report from Brussels.	https://apnews.com/article/eu-summit-trump-ukraine-elections-germany-2b11d3dc3eedebe7f37d6c4c4d9792f8	2024-11-07T00:51:51-08:00	
South Korea's president denies wrongdoing in a growing scandal	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol denied wrongdoing Thursday in a burgeoning influence-peddling scandal involving him and his wife that’s severely hurting his approval ratings and providing political munition to his rivals. The political firestorm coincides with South Korea facing a slew of critical foreign policy issues, such as Donald Trump’s election win to become the next president of the United States and North Korea’s reported entry into the Russia-Ukraine war. The scandal centers around allegations that Yoon and first lady Kim Keon Hee exerted inappropriate influence on the conservative ruling People Power Party to pick a certain candidate to run for a parliamentary by-election in 2022 at the request of Myung Tae-kyun, an election broker and founder of a polling agency who conducted free opinion surveys for Yoon before he became president. For weeks, the scandal has been making headlines in South Korea as Myung's leaked phone conversations show he boasted of his influence over the presidential couple and other top ruling party officials. Asked about his ties with Myung during a press conference Thursday, Yoon said, 'I didn’t do anything inappropriate and have nothing to hide regarding Myung Tae-kyun.' Yoon said he has never meddled in any candidate nomination processes at the PPP, and had never asked Myung to carry out surveys for him, though he acknowledged that Myung gave him some sort of help during his presidential primary campaign in 2021. The main liberal opposition Democratic Party said Yoon's response only showed his 'arrogance' and 'self-righteousness.' The party earlier demanded Yoon apologize, reshuffle top officials and accept an independent investigation into his wife. The Democratic Party recently shared what it said was an audio file of phone calls between Yoon and Myung on May 9, 2022 — a day before Yoon took office for a single five-year term. The opposition party alleges that the conversation proves Yoon provided Myung with political favors in return for free surveys. In the audio file, Yoon can be heard telling Myung that he asked a PPP committee to pick senior party member Kim Young-sun to run for one of the parliamentary by-elections the following month. Kim Young-sun eventually obtained the party’s nomination and won the election. In the file, Myung is heard saying, 'I really won’t forget this favor for my entire life. Thank you!' South Korea’s election law bars public servants, including the president, from interfering in elections, but applies no such restrictions to a president-elect, so it's unclear whether Yoon violated the law. Recent surveys showed Yoon's approval rating fell below 20% for the first time since his inauguration. Kim Keon Hee has been grappling with other scandals, such as spy camera footage purportedly showing her accepting a luxury bag as a gift from a pastor. Yoon apologized for causing public concerns about him and his wife, but stressed that many of the allegations raised were not consistent with the facts. Some ruling party lawmakers have accused the Democratic Party of deliberately ramping up political attacks on Yoon and his wife in an effort to rescue its embattled leader, Lee Jae-myung, from legal troubles. Lee, a firebrand lawmaker who narrowly lost to Yoon in the 2022 presidential election, is undergoing four separate trials over corruption and various other allegations. The first two district court rulings on Lee over his election law violation and perjury charges are set for Nov. 15 and Nov. 25. Either a prison sentence or a fine of more than 1 million won ($750) in the election law case would unseat Lee as a lawmaker and disqualify him from running in elections for five years, although he is likely to appeal any guilty verdict. Surveys show Lee is the early favorite for the 2027 presidential race to succeed Yoon. On foreign policy, Yoon — who has worked closely with Washington and Tokyo to solidify security cooperation in the face of North Korean threats — expressed optimism that the three-way partnership will continue to expand under Trump’s government. He said he wants to meet Trump and new Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba soon to coordinate policies. During his previous presidency, Trump engaged in highly orchestrated nuclear summits with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Yoon noted that North Korea’s arsenal has significantly advanced since Trump’s diplomacy with Kim collapsed in 2019. Yoon said Trump 'will be receiving comprehensive reports very soon about how North Korea’s nuclear technologies and capabilities have changed since then.' 'After he receives these reports, I think we can have more meaningful and in-depth discussions when we have the opportunity to meet,' Yoon said. When asked about concerns that Trump’s 'America first' approach would damage South Korean interests in trade through increased tariffs and other measures, Yoon said Seoul was making 'multifaceted efforts to minimize the losses to our people’s economy.' 'Things can’t be exactly the same as they were during the Biden administration,' he said, 'but we have been preparing to hedge these risks for a long time.' Earlier Thursday, Yoon had a telephone call with Trump, congratulating him on his election win and discussing strengthening bilateral cooperation. The two agreed to arrange an in-person meeting soon, according to Yoon’s office. Prospects for South Korea-U.S. relations under Trump 'could depend on whether Yoon is able to strike up positive chemistry with Trump immediately during the transition and foster a close personal friendship to convince him to want to support advance Seoul’s interests,' said Duyeon Kim, a senior analyst at the Center for a New American Security in Washington. 'This might be the only way to avert devastating consequences and surprises in the alliance relationship — including South Korean questions about Washington’s defense commitment — that we currently assume would happen based on Trump’s harsh rhetoric against allies and transactional style,' she said.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-yoon-wife-scandal-ba065a2f07d5fc4a63fe0e4d36de12f6	2024-11-06T22:55:25-08:00	
A tiny grain of nuclear fuel is pulled from ruined Japanese nuclear plant, in a step toward cleanup	TOKYO (AP) — A robot that has spent months inside the ruins of a nuclear reactor at the tsunami-hit Fukushima Daiichi plant delivered a tiny sample of melted nuclear fuel on Thursday, in what plant officials said was a step toward beginning the cleanup of hundreds of tons of melted fuel debris. The sample, the size of a grain of rice, was placed into a secure container, marking the end of the mission, according to Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, which manages the plant. It is being transported to a glove box for size and weight measurements before being sent to outside laboratories for detailed analyses over the coming months. Plant chief Akira Ono has said it will provide key data to plan a decommissioning strategy, develop necessary technology and robots and learn how the accident had developed. Despite multiple probes in the years since the 2011 disaster that wrecked the plant and forced thousands of nearby residents to leave their homes, much about the site's highly radioactive interior remains a mystery. The sample, the first to be retrieved from inside a reactor, was significantly less radioactive than expected. Officials had been concerned that it might be too radioactive to be safely tested even with heavy protective gear, and set an upper limit for removal out of the reactor. The sample came in well under the limit. That's led some to question whether the robot extracted the nuclear fuel it was looking for from an area in which previous probes have detected much higher levels of radioactive contamination, but TEPCO officials insist they believe the sample is melted fuel. The extendable robot, nicknamed Telesco, first began its mission August with a plan for a two-week round trip, after previous missions had been delayed since 2021. But progress was suspended twice due to mishaps — the first involving an assembly error that took nearly three weeks to fix, and the second a camera failure. On Oct. 30, it clipped a sample weighting less than 3 grams (.01 ounces) from the surface of a mound of melted fuel debris sitting on the bottom of the primary containment vessel of the Unit 2 reactor, TEPCO said. Three days later, the robot returned to an enclosed container, as workers in full hazmat gear slowly pulled it out. On Thursday, the gravel, whose radioactivity earlier this week recorded far below the upper limit set for its environmental and health safety, was placed into a safe container for removal out of the compartment. The sample return marks the first time the melted fuel is retrieved out of the containment vessel. Fukushima Daiichi lost its key cooling systems during a 2011 earthquake and tsunami, causing meltdowns in its three reactors. An estimated 880 tons of fatally radioactive melted fuel remains in them. The government and TEPCO have set a 30-to-40-year target to finish the cleanup by 2051, which experts say is overly optimistic and should be updated. Some say it would take for a century or longer. No specific plans for the full removal of the fuel debris or its final disposal have been decided.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-nuclear-fukushima-sample-robot-decommissioning-b7dd956a86401b39f04ae839f768d29f	2024-11-06T22:50:51-08:00	
Germany's coalition collapses dramatically. Scholz plans to lead with a minority government	BERLIN (AP) — Germany’s government coalition has collapsed in dramatic fashion after Chancellor Olaf Scholz fired Finance Minister Christian Lindner of the pro-business Free Democrats in a late-night move following a marathon of crisis meetings. The three remaining ministers of the Free Democrats resigned in response, leading to the downfall of the government coalition. Scholz is expected to lead the country with a minority government, but the opposition is calling for an immediate no-confidence vote. But early Thursday, Transport Minister Volker Wissing from the Free Democrats unexpectedly took back last night's resignation and told reporters that after talking to Scholz, he had decided to stay on as minister and leave the party instead. Lindner will receive his certificate of dismissal from President Frank-Walter Steinmeier on Thursday afternoon and, to ensure a smooth transition, a successor will likely be named right after. German news agency dpa reported that Jörg Kukies, an economic adviser to Scholz, will become the next finance minister. The posts of the research and justice ministers who resigned may also be filled Thursday, dpa reported. Scholz announced late Wednesday that he would seek a vote of confidence on Jan. 15 that he said might lead to an early election as soon as March — which otherwise would have been be due next September. Scholz had accused Lindner of breaching his trust and publicly calling for a fundamentally different economic policy, including what the chancellor said would be tax cuts worth billions for a few top earners while at the same time cutting pensions for all retirees. 'That is not decent,' Scholz said. Scholz's left-leaning Social Democrats will now effectively lead a minority government with the remaining coalition partner, the environmentalist Greens. The chancellor announced late Wednesday that he would reach out to the leader of the biggest opposition leader in parliament, Friedrich Merz from the center-right Christian Democrats, to confer on possible ways of strengthening the economy and defense, and passing important legislation through parliament. But Merz on Thursday vehemently rejected Scholz's plan to wait to hold a vote of confidence until January. 'The coalition no longer has a majority in the German Bundestag, and we therefore call on the chancellor (...) to call a vote of confidence immediately, or at the latest by the beginning of next week.' 'We simply cannot afford to have a government without a majority in Germany for several months now, and then campaign for several more months, and then possibly conduct coalition negotiations for several weeks,' Merz added. He said he was planning to meet with Scholz later Thursday to push for a quick vote of confidence. Since Scholz's government doesn't have a majority in parliament any longer, he would likely lose the vote. In that scenario, Germany's president could dissolve parliament within 21 days and an early election could then be held as soon as January. 'During these 21 days, we will have enough time to find out whether there are any issues that we may have to decide on together,' Merz said, offering his party's cooperation with the minority government. 'We are, of course, prepared to hold talks (..) we are also prepared to take responsibility for our country.' Indeed, pushing through new legislation and plugging the billion-euro hole in the 2025 budget won’t become easier for Scholz’s Social Democrats and the Greens as their government no longer has a majority in parliament. But Scholz has said his government needed that time to pass important legislation. Achim Wambach from the Leibniz Center for European Economic Research cast doubt that a prolonged period with a minority government would help Germany's economy get back on track. 'Germany’s problems are too big to tolerate political gridlock,' the analyst said. 'The government set out to reconcile the transformation towards climate neutrality with economic growth and social security,' the analyst said in a statement. 'It has not lived up to this claim. The economy is stagnating and investments are failing to materialize.' 'This daunting task was compounded by geo-economic tensions: wars in Europe and the Middle East as well as economically damaging interventions through tariffs and national subsidy policies,' he added. ' The election of Donald Trump has exacerbated these problems. Europe must do more for its security and will have to reckon with increased tariffs.' The collapse of the coalition came after weeks of disputes among the coalition partners over ways to boost the country’s ailing economy. Lindner's pro-business Free Democrats had rejected tax increases or changes to Germany’s strict self-imposed limits on running up debt. Scholz’s Social Democrats and the Greens wanted to see major state investment and rejected the Free Democrats’ proposals to cut welfare programs.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-scholz-government-coalition-collapse-struggling-economy-ca3ebd538bc0e71af272aa7f65b12c19	2024-11-06T22:28:58-08:00	
A new law allows Israel to deport the relatives of attackers. Experts expect it to be struck down	JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel’s parliament passed a law early Thursday that would allow it to deport family members of Palestinian attackers, including the country’s own citizens, to the war-ravaged Gaza Strip or other locations. The law, which was championed by members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party and his far-right allies, passed with a 61-41 vote. But legal experts said that any attempt to implement it would likely lead to it being struck down by Israeli courts. It would apply to Palestinian citizens of Israel and residents of annexed east Jerusalem who knew about their family members' attacks beforehand or who 'express support or identification with the act of terrorism.' They would be deported, either to the Gaza Strip or another location, for a period of seven to 20 years. The Israel-Hamas war is still raging in Gaza, where tens of thousands have been killed and most of the population has been internally displaced, often multiple times. It was unclear if it would apply in the occupied West Bank, where Israel already has a long-standing policy of demolishing the family homes of attackers. Palestinians have carried out scores of stabbing, shooting and car-ramming attacks against Israelis in recent years. Oded Feller, a legal adviser to the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, dismissed the law as 'populist nonsense.' He said it was unlikely to be applied, because there is no legal way for the Interior Ministry to send an Israeli citizen to another country or to Gaza. His organization doesn't plan to challenge the law unless authorities try to enforce it, in which case he expects any court challenge to succeed. Eran Shamir-Borer, a senior researcher at the Israel Democracy Institute and a former international law expert for the Israeli military, agreed that the law was likely to be struck down by the Supreme Court. 'The bottom line is this is completely nonconstitutional and a clear conflict to Israel’s core values,' Shamir-Borer said. Israel captured Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war — territories the Palestinians want for their future state. It withdrew settlers and soldiers from Gaza in 2005, but has reoccupied parts of the territory since Hamas' attack on Oct. 7, 2023 triggered the war. Israel annexed east Jerusalem in a move not recognized by most of the international community. Palestinians there have permanent residency and are allowed to apply for citizenship, but most choose not to, and those who do face a series of obstacles. Palestinians living in Israel make up around 20% of the country's population. They have citizenship and the right to vote but face widespread discrimination. Many also have close family ties to those in the territories and most sympathize with the Palestinian cause. ___ Melanie Lidman reported from Tel Aviv, Israel.

Middle East latest: Large airstrikes hit Beirut suburbs as Israel expands northern Gaza operations	Several large airstrikes hit Beirut’s southern suburbs early Thursday, including one on a site adjacent to Lebanon’s only international airport. The Israeli military had issued an evacuation notice for the site, saying Hezbollah facilities were there, without giving more details. Also Thursday, the Israeli military announced it expanded its month-old ground operation in northern Gaza to include part of Beit Lahiya, a town that has been heavily bombed since the earliest days of the war and where Israel says Hamas militants have regrouped. Hezbollah leader Naim Kassem said in a speech aired Wednesday that the Lebanese militant group is open for cease-fire negotiations only once 'the enemy stops its aggression.' His speech marked the 40-day mourning period since former Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah was assassinated in Beirut. Hezbollah began firing into Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, in solidarity with Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Since the conflict erupted, more than 3,100 people have been killed and some 13,800 wounded in Lebanon, the health ministry reported. The Israel-Hamas war began after Palestinian militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. Israel's military response in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 people, Palestinian health officials say. They do not distinguish between civilians and combatants, but say more than half of those killed were women and children. ___ Here’s the latest: Gallant has last official conversation with US defense secretary TEL AVIV, Israel — Israel’s outgoing defense minister, Yoav Gallant, says he has held his last official conversation with his U.S. counterpart. Gallant has developed a close relationship with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin throughout the war, and the two men speak several times a week. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this week fired Gallant after months of tensions and disagreements. Gallant, a former general, was replaced by a Netanyahu loyalist with little military experience. In a statement, Gallant said he thanked Austin for his 'partnership and deep commitment' to the countries’ defense ties. 'Our special bond must remain powerful and unshakeable.' 52 people killed in Lebanon in last day, health ministry reports BEIRUT — Lebanon’s health ministry says 52 people were killed and 161 wounded Wednesday, raising the total toll over the past year of conflict between Israel and Hezbollah to 3,102 killed and 13,819 wounded. One-quarter of them are women and children. Lebanon’s crisis response unit recorded 121 airstrikes and incidents of shelling Wednesday, mostly concentrated in southern Lebanon, Baalbek-Hermel province and the Nabatiyeh province. The health ministry said that over the past year, 2,230 men, 614 women and 192 children were killed. Some 1,145 centers — including educational complexes, vocational institutes, universities, and other institutions — are sheltering 190,740 people, including 45,189 families, displaced by the Israeli offensive in Lebanon, the report said. Among these shelters, 981 have reached full capacity. The fighting in Lebanon has driven 1.2 million people from their homes, including more than 400,000 children, according to the U.N. children’s agency. 14 killed at school-turned-shelter in Gaza City DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Palestinian rescue workers say Israel struck a school-turned-shelter run by the United Nations in Gaza City, killing 14 people and wounding dozens of others. The Israeli military said the attack Thursday that the building was being used by Hamas to plan and execute attacks on Israel, without giving more details. The military said it took steps to mitigate the risk of harming civilians, including using precise munitions, aerial surveillance, and additional intelligence. In recent months Israel has conducted dozens of airstrikes on schools across the embattled enclave, structures where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians displaced by fighting have sought refuge. The Gaza-based Civil Defense emergency service reported rescuers recovering the bodies of 14 people in the rubble of the school building in Shati refugee camp, just west of Gaza City along the Mediterranean coast. The school had been operated by the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency known as UNRWA. Shortly after the strike, the Israeli army ordered the evacuation of Shati camp among other neighborhoods west of Gaza City, spreading panic among Palestinians who in recent days had sought refuge in those areas from Israel’s renewed offensive against Hamas militants further north. Since the yearlong Israel-Hamas war began, schools in Gaza have been closed and served as shelters for Palestinians fleeing the fighting. Israeli military to allow 300 truckloads of aid from UAE into Gaza JERUSALEM — The Israeli military says it will allow 300 truckloads of humanitarian aid supplied by the United Arab Emirates to enter the Gaza Strip in the coming days. That’s less than the 350 trucks per day that the United States has said it wants to see enter the war-ravaged territory. COGAT, the military body in charge of civilian affairs in Gaza, said the aid was brought in by sea and unloaded at the Israeli port of Ashdod, just north of Gaza. It said the shipment, which includes food, water, medical equipment, shelter and hygiene supplies, would be inspected before being trucked into Gaza, though it did not specify a date. The amount of aid entering Gaza dropped dramatically in October as Israel launched another offensive in the territory’s north. By the end of October, an average of just 71 trucks a day were entering Gaza, according to the latest U.N. figures. The United States has warned Israel to ramp up the entry of aid by mid-November, saying failure to do so could lead to a reduction in military support. Israel says it allows plenty of aid to enter Gaza and blames U.N. agencies and other aid groups for not distributing it. Humanitarian groups say their efforts are hobbled by Israeli restrictions, ongoing fighting and the breakdown of law and order. Dozens of Lebanese killed in struck apartment building are laid to rest TYRE, Lebanon — Dozens of Lebanese were laid to rest Thursday following an Israeli airstrike that hit an apartment building in the town of Barja, just north of the port city of Sidon. The Lebanese Civil Defense said it pulled at least 30 bodies and remains following Tuesday's strike. Among the killed were many members of the Basma family, who had fled deeper into southern Lebanon for safety. Family members who survived found shelter elsewhere or weren’t in the building at the time. 'My sister was killed last week, and now my brother, my nephew, and my other nephew with members of his family,' said Hassan Basma. Nearby, Khadija Daramsis, who washes the bodies of the dead before burial in accordance with Islamic tradition, found herself doing the same for her nieces. She had just seen them last week. 'They told me they were scared of the strikes and then they were struck,' Daramsis said as she wept. 'What did they have to do with anything? Are they resistance? Are they Hezbollah?' Israel says its strikes target Hezbollah militants or the group’s assets. The strike in Barja came without warning. Khalil Basma says the war and Israel’s military escalation is the worst he’s seen in Lebanon. 'Knowing the wars we have gone through, this is regretfully the first time we see such crimes,' he said. 'May God protect everyone and end this crisis.' Israeli drone strike kills 3 in southern Lebanon city of Sidon, Lebanese state media says BEIRUT — Lebanon’s state news agency says an Israeli drone strike has hit a car at an army checkpoint in the southern port city of Sidon, killing three people and wounding several others including U.N. peacekeepers. The National News Agency said one of the wounded was taken to the hospital while the peacekeepers were treated for minor injuries at the scene of the attack at the northern entrance of Sidon, Lebanon’s third-largest city. The U.N. peacekeeping force known as UNIFIL said in a statement that a convoy bringing newly-arrived peacekeepers to south Lebanon was passing by when a drone strike took place near it. The strike lightly injured five peacekeepers, it said. 'We remind all actors of their obligation to avoid actions putting peacekeepers or civilians in danger. Differences should be resolved at the negotiating table, not through violence,' the statement said. A drone strike earlier Thursday hit a car on a main highway just outside Beirut, killing one woman, according to local media. French diplomat urges diplomatic solution PARIS — France’s top diplomat has urged action in the coming weeks toward a political solution to the wars in the Mideast. Visiting Israel, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said Thursday that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has ″never hid his wish to end the interminable wars in the Middle East.' 'So the conditions seem right to me to move in the coming weeks toward a diplomatic solution to the current conflict. Because force alone cannot suffice to guarantee Israel’s security,' Barrot said. Barrot called for a halt to Israel’s bombings of northern Gaza, saying they are contrary to Israel’s long-term interests. ″The Palestinian question will not disappear, regardless of what American administration is in office,″ Barrot told reporters. He also warned Iran against further escalation, and called for a diplomatic solution for Lebanon. He met his Israeli counterpart and heads next to the Palestinian territories for talks with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Iran's Supreme Leader says militant groups against Israel remain strong TEHRAN, Iran -- Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei says its alliance of militant groups opposed to Israel remains strong despite the killing of many of their senior leaders. 'God willing, the world will see a day when the Zionist regime will be defeated by them,' Iranian state TV reported the leader as saying Thursday. The report quoted Khamenei as saying that Hamas and other 'leaders of the resistance' are 'still fighting' even though some of their leaders have been killed by intensified Israel airstrikes. Israeli strikes and military operations in recent months have killed the top leaders of both Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, as well as many of their senior commanders. Both groups are part of what is known as the Axis of Resistance, which includes other Iran-backed groups in Syria, Iraq and Yemen. Iran and its allies have repeatedly traded fire with Israel and the United States over the past year following Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack, raising fears of a regional war. Israel announces $5.2 billion fighter jet deal with Boeing JERUSALEM — Israel has reached an agreement to purchase 25 advanced F-15 fighter jets from U.S. aerospace giant Boeing for $5.2 billion. The Defense Ministry said the agreement, concluded Wednesday, was part of a broader aid package approved by the U.S. government earlier this year. Deliveries will begin in 2031, and there’s an option to purchase an additional 25 aircraft. The United States has provided crucial military support to Israel as it has battled Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and traded fire with Iran. The Biden administration recently warned Israel that if it did not facilitate the delivery of more aid to Gaza, U.S. laws may force the administration to curb some of its military support. The State Department said this week that Israel had yet to sufficiently improve aid deliveries ahead of a mid-November deadline. President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to end the wars in the Middle East without saying how he plans to do it. He was a staunch supporter of Israel during his previous term but also cultivated close ties with Arab Gulf leaders. Israeli military extends shutdown of Al Jazeera's West Bank bureau RAMALLAH, West Bank — The Al Jazeera news network says the Israeli military has extended the order shutting down its bureau in the occupied West Bank. Walid al-Omari, the network’s bureau chief, said Israeli troops raided the office in Ramallah again early Thursday and posted a notice extending the closure for an additional 45 days. Israel had previously raided the office and shut it down on Sept. 22. Earlier this year, authorities took the rare step of barring the Qatar-based network from operating in Israel. Israel accuses Al Jazeera of serving as a mouthpiece for Hamas, an allegation denied by the network. Last month, Israel accused six Al Jazeera journalists in Gaza of being Palestinian militants, which the network also denied. Al-Jazeera has provided near 24-hour coverage from inside Gaza since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, with a heavy focus on the war’s toll among Palestinian civilians. Several of its correspondents have been killed or wounded by Israeli forces. It also routinely airs unedited Hamas videos showing attacks on Israeli forces and hostages speaking under duress. Israel passes law that would allow it to deport the families of Palestinian attackers, including citizens Israel’s parliament passed a law early Thursday that would allow it to deport family members of Palestinian attackers, including the country’s own citizens, to the war-ravaged Gaza Strip or other locations. The law, which was championed by members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud party and his far-right allies, passed with a 61-41 vote but is likely to be challenged in court. It would apply to Palestinian citizens of Israel and residents of annexed east Jerusalem who knew about their family members’ attacks beforehand or who 'express support or identification with the act of terrorism.'

Israel expands its ground operation in northern Gaza JERUSALEM — The Israeli military has expanded its month-old ground operation in northern Gaza to a town that has been heavily bombed since the earliest days of the war. The military said in a statement Thursday that 'troops started to operate' in the area of Beit Lahiya after intelligence indicated the presence of militants there. Hamas has repeatedly regrouped in areas where the military already conducted major operations. The town in the northwestern corner of Gaza was among the first targets of the ground invasion launched over a year ago, after Hamas’ attack into southern Israel. The northern third of the territory has been encircled by Israeli forces since then. Israel launched another major offensive in nearby Jabaliya, a decades-old urban refugee camp, in early October. It has sharply restricted the amount of aid entering northern Gaza and ordered a full evacuation. Tens of thousands have fled to nearby Gaza City in the latest mass displacement of the war. Airstrikes hit Beirut’s southern suburbs, including one on site adjacent to airport BEIRUT — Several large airstrikes hit Beirut’s southern suburbs early Thursday, including one on a site adjacent to Lebanon’s only international airport. The Israeli military had earlier issued an evacuation notice for the site, saying that there were Hezbollah facilities there, without giving more details. There were no immediate reports of casualties. Beirut’s airport has not been directly targeted in the war between Israel and Hezbollah, and national air carrier Middle East Airlines has continued to operate commercial flights. ___ For more Middle East news: https://apnews.com/hub/middle-east	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-hezbollah-mideast-latest-7-november-2024-9e9fe099be1b073c96cc4613a92ba6c3	2024-11-06T21:31:52-08:00	
Typhoon Yinxing slams into a northern Philippine region still recovering from back-to-back storms	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — A strong typhoon slammed into a northern Philippine province on Thursday as thousands were evacuated in a region still recovering from back-to-back storms that hit a few weeks ago. Typhoon Yinxing is the 13th to batter the disaster-prone Southeast Asian archipelago in 2024. 'I really pity our people but all of them are tough,' Gov. Marilou Cayco of the province of Batanes said by telephone. Her province was ravaged by recent destructive storms and is expected to be affected by Yinxing’s fierce wind and rain. Tens of thousands of villagers were returning to emergency shelters, and disaster-response teams were again put on alert in Cagayan and other northern provinces near the expected path of Yinxing. The typhoon blew into Santa Ana town in Cagayan province on Thursday afternoon. The slow-moving typhoon, locally named Marce, was packing sustained winds of up to 175 kilometers (109 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 240 kph (149 mph) just before it made landfall in the coastal town of Santa Ana in Cagayan province, government forecasters said. There were no immediate reports of casualties or major damage. Aside from flash floods, authorities were concerned about the higher possibilities of landslides in northern mountainous region, which has been inundated by pounding rains from two previous storms. The coast guard, army, air force and police were on high alert. Inter-island ferries and cargo services and domestic flights were suspended in northern provinces. Tropical Storm Trami and Typhoon Kong-rey hit the northern Philippines in recent weeks, leaving at least 151 people dead and affecting nearly 9 million others. More than 14 billion pesos ($241 million) in rice, corn and other crops and infrastructure were damaged. The death and destruction from the storms prompted President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to declare a day of national mourning on Monday when he visited the worst-hit province of Batangas, south of the capital, Manila. At least 61 people perished in the coastal province. Trami dumped one to two months’ worth of rain in just 24 hours in some regions, including in Batangas. 'We want to avoid the loss of lives due to calamities,' Marcos said in Talisay town in Batangas, where he brought key Cabinet members to reassure storm victims of rapid government help. 'Storms nowadays are more intense, extensive and powerful.' In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest recorded tropical cyclones, left more than 7,300 people dead or missing, flattened entire villages and caused ships to run aground and smash into houses in the central Philippines.	https://apnews.com/article/philippines-typhoon-yinxing-876e9d337a65d3c5c2069ab41d36be28	2024-11-06T20:23:15-08:00	
Trump's second term could realign US diplomacy toward authoritarian leaders	BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — Hungary's fiery, right-wing leader says Donald Trump’s victory will help his own battle against immigration and multiculturalism and restore traditional family values. In Argentina, a president who once bear-hugged Trump at a political conference in Maryland is attacking his critics as rats and parasites, ranting against what he calls a corrupt elite and calling climate change 'a socialist lie.' Trump's second term could realign U.S. diplomacy away from traditional international alliances and more toward populist, authoritarian politicians, according to both those leaders and outside observers. Prime Minister Viktor Orbán of Hungary Two days before Tuesday's election, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán made a daring prediction. 'Donald Trump will be president again, and that means by the end of the year, pro-peace political forces will be in the majority in the West,' Orbán told state radio. Orbán has been accused by the European Union of burying Hungary’s democracy by dominating media and building a network of loyal oligarchs. He has worried foreign leaders by drawing closer to Russian President Vladimir Putin. What Orbán calls 'illiberal democracy' has stigmatized civil-society organizations and cracked down on LGBTQ+ rights. It favors retaining power even if that means contravening traditional Hungarian allies' interests. President Vladimir Putin of Russia Trump has avoided publicly criticizing Putin and has consistently spoken warmly about him. 'There is clearly that sort of authoritarian-minded chemistry,' between them, said Nigel Gould-Davies of the International Institute of Strategic Studies in London. That chemistry aligns with Trump’s admiration for other authoritarian leaders, some of whom were elected by systems that were once democratic, Gould-Davies said, noting Hungary under Orbán as an example. Trump has claimed that he will bring an end to Russia’s war in Ukraine 'within 24 hours,' an assertion welcomed by the Kremlin, which currently holds an advantage on the battlefield as well as roughly 20% of Ukrainian territory. Moscow may hope that Trump will sow dysfunction in NATO given his demands that other members of the alliance meet agreed military spending levels, and his warnings that Russia could 'do whatever the hell they want' to those who fail. Gould-Davies observed before the election that the Kremlin would welcome Trump’s victory because of his apparent desire for the war in Ukraine to end on terms favorable to Russia. Putin and other authoritarian leaders will be encouraged by Trump’s reelection, which will mean 'much less emphasis in American foreign policy on the importance and value of human rights,' Gould-Davies said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is one of his country’s both beloved and polarizing political leaders. Under Modi, Hindu nationalism — once a fringe ideology in India — has become mainstream, and nobody has done more to advance this cause than the 74-year-old leader. Some critics believe Modi’s politics have divided India, especially along religious lines. He was accused of using hate speech against the country’s minority Muslim community, especially in the last phase of election campaigning this year when he ramped up rhetoric against them. To his supporters, Modi is a political outsider who broke the country’s history of dynastic politics. His rise has been boosted in part by promises to overhaul India’s economy, but also by Hindu-first politics that have resonated widely in a country where 80% of the population is Hindu. To his critics, Modi has strained democracy and threatened India's secular fabric, while his attacks on media and free speech have grown in more than a decade of his rule. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey Like Trump, Erdogan projects an image of strength that prioritizes national interests and relies on populist messages that present him as a champion of common people against elites. The Biden administration has kept Erdogan’s government at arms’ length, but Trump and Erdogan have cultivated a cordial relationship. That's despite a series of differences between their countries, like when the Trump administration removed Turkey from the F-35 fighter jet program in 2019 over Ankara’s purchase of a Russian-made missile defense system. President Javier Milei of Argentina The president of Argentina has a brash style like Trump, rebukes multilateral institutions like the United Nations and has taken a disdainful approach to diplomacy, snubbing meetings with the leaders of traditional allies like Brazil and Spain. For many observers, the most worrying parallel involves Milei’s claims that last year’s presidential election in Argentina was rigged against him. That, along with his efforts to downplay the atrocities of Argentina’s 1976-1983 bloody military dictatorship has raised concerns about his impact on democracy. Milei congratulated Trump on his election victory Wednesday by posting an image on Instagram of the two men hugging in front of their nations’ flags. 'You know you can count on Argentina to carry out your task,' the caption reads. 'Now, Make America Great Again.' Analysts say his cash-strapped government — badly in need of support from the U.S., the largest stakeholder in the International Monetary Fund — has been betting on a Trump win. Milei’s administration is pinning its hopes on the idea that Trump could exert pressure on the IMF to lend more money to Argentina, its biggest debtor. The fund is weighing whether to lend Argentina more cash, which Milei’s libertarian government needs to fully reenter the world market and exit currency controls. During Trump’s first term, the IMF granted Argentina — at the time led by conservative President Mauricio Macri — a controversial $57 billion bailout. Mariano Machado, principal analyst for the Americas at Verisk Maplecroft, a global risk intelligence firm, said that while U.S. institutions and separation of powers are designed to prevent autocratic rule, 'Argentina is now going back to a phase where the very parameters of its institutions are being pressured.' Prime Minister Robert Fico of Slovakia While a leftist, Fico has used rhetoric similar to Trump's. Fico even compared the July assassination attempt against Trump to his own wounding in a shooting in May. 'It is a carbon-copy scenario,' Fico said. 'Political opponents of Donald Trump are trying to imprison him, and when they don’t succeed, they enrage the public so much that some loser picks up a gun.' Like Trump, Fico displays contempt for the mainstream media, and has declared war on illegal immigration. Fico has faced criminal charges for organized crime, which he denounced as politically motivated. The case was eventually dismissed. The Slovak leader has condemned the West's approach to the war in Ukraine and canceled weapons shipments to Kyiv. Fico, like Orbán, is known for his pro-Russian views, opposes EU sanctions on Moscow and has said he would block Ukraine from joining NATO. ___ Suzan Fraser in Ankara, Turkey, Isabel DeBre in Buenos Aires, Krutika Pathi in New Delhi and Karel Janicek in Prague contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-reelection-world-leaders-authoritarians-ff69aeab1d5a357848d5ee4001dc1591	2024-11-06T20:19:03-08:00	
Australia plans a social media ban for children under 16	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — The Australian government announced on Thursday what it described as world-leading legislation that would institute an age limit of 16 years for children to start using social media, and hold platforms responsible for ensuring compliance. 'Social media is doing harm to our kids and I’m calling time on it,' Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said. The legislation will be introduced in Parliament during its final two weeks in session this year, which begin on Nov. 18. The age limit would take effect 12 months after the law is passed, Albanese told reporters. The platforms including X, TikTok, Instagram and Facebook would need to use that year to work out how to exclude Australian children younger than 16. 'I’ve spoken to thousands of parents, grandparents, aunties and uncles. They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online,' Albanese said. The proposal comes as governments around the world are wrestling with how to supervise young people's use of technologies like smartphones and social media. Social media platforms would be penalized for breaching the age limit, but under-age children and their parents would not. 'The onus will be on social media platforms to demonstrate they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access. The onus won’t be on parents or young people,' Albanese said. Antigone Davis, head of safety at Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, said the company would respect any age limitations the government wants to introduce. 'However, what’s missing is a deeper discussion on how we implement protections, otherwise we risk making ourselves feel better, like we have taken action, but teens and parents will not find themselves in a better place,' Davis said in a statement. She added that stronger tools in app stores and operating systems for parents to control what apps their children can use would be a 'simple and effective solution.' X did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday. TikTok declined to comment. The Digital Industry Group Inc., an advocate for the digital industry in Australia, described the age limit as a '20th Century response to 21st Century challenges.' 'Rather than blocking access through bans, we need to take a balanced approach to create age-appropriate spaces, build digital literacy and protect young people from online harm,' DIGI managing director Sunita Bose said in a statement. More than 140 Australian and international academics with expertise in fields related to technology and child welfare signed an open letter to Albanese last month opposing a social media age limit as 'too blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.' Jackie Hallan, a director at the youth mental health service ReachOut, opposed the ban. She said 73% of young people across Australia accessing mental health support did so through social media. 'We’re uncomfortable with the ban. We think young people are likely to circumvent a ban and our concern is that it really drives the behavior underground and then if things go wrong, young people are less likely to get support from parents and carers because they’re worried about getting in trouble,' Hallan said. Child psychologist Philip Tam said a minimum age of 12 or 13 would have been more enforceable. 'My real fear honestly is that the problem of social media will simply be driven underground,' Tam said. Australian National University lawyer Associate Prof. Faith Gordon feared separating children from there platforms could create pressures within families. Albanese said there would be exclusions and exemptions in circumstances such as a need to continue access to educational services. But parental consent would not entitle a child under 16 to access social media. Earlier this year, the government began a trial of age-restriciton technologies. Australia’s eSafety Commissioner, the online watchdog that will police compliance, will use the results of that trial to provide platforms with guidance on what reasonable steps they can take. Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said the year-long lead-in would ensure the age limit could be implemented in a 'very practical way.' 'There does need to be enhanced penalties to ensure compliance,' Rowland said. 'Every company that operates in Australia, whether domiciled here or otherwise, is expected and must comply with Australian law or face the consequences,' she added. The main opposition party has given in-principle support for an age limit at 16. Opposition lawmaker Paul Fletcher said the platforms already had the technology to enforce such an age ban. 'It’s not really a technical viability question, it’s a question of their readiness to do it and will they incur the cost to do it,' Fletcher told Australian Broadcasting Corp. 'The platforms say: ’It's all too hard, we can’t do it, Australia will become a backwater, it won’t possibly work.' But if you have well-drafted legislation and you stick to your guns, you can get the outcomes,' Fletcher added.	https://apnews.com/article/australia-social-media-age-limit-e8259408c0b1456f41967decd474782a	2024-11-06T19:45:20-08:00	
Indonesia's Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki erupts for the second time in a week	MAUMERE, Indonesia (AP) — Indonesia’s Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki unleashed towering columns of ash into the air on Thursday, in an even larger eruption than the one that killed nine people and injured dozens of others three days ago. There were no immediate reports of casualties from the latest eruption. The 1,584-meter (5,197-foot) volcano on the remote island of Flores shot billowing columns of ash 11 times on Thursday, with the latest and largest rising 8,000 meters (26,240 feet), said Hadi Wijaya, the head of Center for Volcanology and Geological Disaster Mitigation. The volcano had shown less activity since Monday’s deadly eruption killed nine people and injured 64 others. Monday's eruption affected more than 10,000 people in 10 villages. About 4,400 villagers moved into makeshift emergency shelters after the eruption, which destroyed seven schools, nearly two dozen houses and a convent on the majority-Catholic island. Volcanic materials, including smoldering rocks, lava and hot, thumb-size gravel and ash were thrown up to 7 kilometers (4.3 miles) from its crater on Monday. While visiting the devastated areas, officials found craters where rocks fell during eruptions, up to 13 meters (43 feet) wide and 5 meters (16 feet) deep, in several places including a destroyed school. 'It shows a difference in characteristics from the previous eruption in January,' said Wijaya, head of the volcanology center. He added that the earlier eruption mostly unleashed volcanic materials around the peak, followed by lava flows. 'We are still analyzing the change of Lewotobi's eruption character, which will be used by the government to determine a safe relocation site for residents,' Wijaya said. He said his agency has asked the local government of East Nusa Tenggara province to close the only road connecting Maumere, the island’s largest city, to the neighboring district of Larantuka, as it passes through the volcano’s danger zone. The country’s volcano monitoring agency increased Lewotobi Laki Laki's alert status to the highest level and more than doubled the exclusion zone to a 7-kilometer (4.3-mile) radius on Monday, prohibiting any activity in that area. Authorities warned the thousands of people who fled not to return home, as the government planned to move about 16,000 residents out of the danger zone, said National Disaster Management Agency head Suharyanto, who like many Indonesians uses a single name. 'Permanent relocation is considered as a long-term mitigation measure to anticipate eruption in the future,' Suharyanto told reporters after visiting the devastated areas Thursday. He said residents of the hardest-hit villages would be relocated within the next six months, and each family waiting for a new house will be compensated 500,000 rupiah ($32) per month. About 6,500 people were evacuated in January after Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki began erupting, spewing thick clouds and forcing the government to close the island’s Fransiskus Xaverius Seda Airport. No casualties or major damage were reported, but the airport has remained closed since then due to seismic activity. Lewotobi Laki Laki is one of a pair of stratovolcanoes in the East Flores district of East Nusa Tenggara province, known locally as the husband-and-wife mountains. 'Laki laki' means man, while its mate is Lewotobi Perempuan, or woman. The vulcanology center also said another volcano, Mount Marapi in West Sumatra province — one of the country’s most active volcanoes — erupted again on Thursday, spewing thick columns of ash at least three times and blanketing nearby villages with debris. No casualties were reported. Lewotobi Laki Laki is one of the 120 active volcanoes in Indonesia, an archipelago of 280 million people. The country is prone to earthquakes, landslides and volcanic activity because it sits along the 'Ring of Fire,' a horseshoe-shaped series of seismic fault lines around the Pacific Ocean. ___ Karmini reported from Jakarta.

European climate agency says this will likely be the hottest year on record -- again	CHICAGO (AP) — For the second year in a row, Earth will almost certainly be the hottest it's ever been. And for the first time, the globe this year reached more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming compared to the pre-industrial average, the European climate agency Copernicus said Thursday. 'It's this relentless nature of the warming that I think is is worrying,' said Carlo Buontempo, director of Copernicus. Buontempo said the data clearly shows the planet would not see such a long sequence of record-breaking temperatures without the constant increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere driving global warming. He cited other factors that contribute to exceptionally warm years like last year and this one. They include El Nino — the temporary warming of parts of the Pacific that changes weather worldwide — as well as volcanic eruptions that spew water vapor into the air and variations in energy from the sun. But he and other scientists say the long-term increase in temperatures beyond fluctuations like El Nino is a bad sign. 'A very strong El Nino event is a sneak peek into what the new normal will be about a decade from now,' said Zeke Hausfather, a research scientist with the nonprofit Berkeley Earth. News of a likely second year of record heat comes a day after Republican Donald Trump, who has called climate change a 'hoax' and promised to boost oil drilling and production, was reelected to the presidency. It also comes days before the next U.N. climate conference, called COP29, is set to begin in Azerbaijan. Talks are expected to focus on how to generate trillions of dollars to help the world transition to clean energes like wind and solar, and thus avoid continued warming. Buontempo pointed out that going over the 1.5 degree Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) threshold of warming for a single year is different than the goal adopted in the 2015 Paris Agreement. That goal was meant to try to cap warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times on average, over 20 or 30 years. A United Nations report this year said that since the mid-1800s on average, the world has already heated up 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) — up from previous estimates of 1.1 degrees (2 degrees Fahrenheit) or 1.2 degrees (2.2 degrees Fahrenheit). That's of concern because the U.N. says the greenhouse gas emission reduction goals of the world's nations still aren't nearly ambitious enough to keep the 1.5 degree Celsius target on track. The target was chosen to try to stave off the worst effects of climate change on humanity, including extreme weather. 'The heat waves, storm damage, and droughts that we are experiencing now are just the tip of the iceberg,' said Natalie Mahowald, chair of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Cornell University. Going over that number in 2024 doesn’t mean the overall trend line of global warming has, but 'in the absence of concerted action, it soon will,' said University of Pennsylvania climate scientist Michael Mann. Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson put it in starker terms. 'I think we have missed the 1.5 degree window,' said Jackson, who chairs the Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists who track countries’ carbon dioxide emissions. 'There’s too much warming.' Indiana state climatologist Beth Hall said she isn't surprised by the latest report from Copernicus, but emphasized that people should remember climate is a global issue beyond their local experiences with changing weather. 'We tend to be siloed in our own individual world,' she said. Reports like this one 'are taking into account lots and lots of locations that aren’t in our backyard.' Buontempo stressed the importance of global observations, bolstered by international cooperation, that allow scientists to have confidence in the new report's finding: Copernicus gets its results from billions of measurements from satellites, ships, aircraft and weather stations around the world. He said that going over the 1.5 degree Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) benchmark this year is 'psychologically important' as nations make decisions internally and approach negotiations at the annual U.N. climate change summit Nov. 11-22 in Azerbaijan. 'The decision, clearly, is ours. It’s of each and every one of us. And it’s the decision of our society and our policymakers as a consequence of that,' he said. 'But I believe these decisions are better made if they are based on evidence and facts.' ___ Associated Press science writer Seth Borenstein contributed to this report. ___ Follow Melina Walling on X, formerly Twitter: @MelinaWalling. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Stock Market Today: Asian shares retreat after Trump's victory as focus turns to the Fed	Shares retreated in Asia early Thursday after U.S. stocks stormed to records as investors wagered on what Donald Trump’s return to the White House will mean for the economy and the world. Markets also were turning their attention to the Federal Reserve’s decision on interest rates, due later in the day. Japan's Nikkei 225 shed early gains to fall 0.6% to 39,246.86, while the Kospi in Seoul fell 0.4% to 2,554.57. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 edged 0.1% lower, to 8,191.00. Chinese shares also declined. Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 0.7% to 20,386.36. The Shanghai Composite index also fell 0.7%, to 3,359.99. Trump has promised to slap blanket 60% tariffs on all Chinese imports, raising them still more if Beijing makes a move to invade the self-governing island of Taiwan. Investors are adding to bets built earlier on what the higher tariffs, lower tax rates and lighter regulation that Trump favors will mean. Higher tariffs on imports from China would add to the burdens Beijing is facing as it struggles to revive slowing growth in the world's second-largest economy. Higher tariffs on imports from China, Mexico and other countries also would raise the risk of trade wars and other disruptions to the global economy. On Wednesday, the U.S. stock market, Elon Musk’s Tesla, banks and bitcoin all stormed higher, however, as investors made bets on what Donald Trump’s return to the White House will mean for the economy and the world. Among the losers the market sees: the renewable-energy industry and potentially anyone worried about higher inflation. The S&amp;P 500 rallied 2.5% to 5,929.04 for its best day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 3.6% to 43,729.93, while the Nasdaq composite jumped 3% to 18,983.47. All three indexes topped records they had set in recent weeks. The impact of Trump's second term will likely depend on whether his fellow Republicans win control of Congress, and that’s not yet clear. Investors see Trump’s policies potentially leading to stronger economic growth. That helps push prices down and yields up for Treasurys. Tax cuts under Trump could further swell the U.S. government’s deficit, increasing borrowing and forcing yields even higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury jumped to 4.43% from 4.29% late Tuesday, which is a major move for the bond market. It’s up substantially from August, when it was below 4%. Investors expect the incoming president's policies, particularly higher tariffs, to fan inflation and add costs to U.S. household bills. Sharp cutbacks in immigration could also leave businesses shorthanded, forcing companies to raise wages for workers faster and put more upward pressure on prices. Much of Wall Street’s run to records this year was built on expectations for coming cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve, as inflation has headed back down to its 2% target. Easier interest rates help boost the economy, but they can also give inflation more fuel. The Fed will announce its latest decision on interest rates Thursday, where the expectation is still for a cut, according to data from CME Group. But traders are already paring back forecasts for how many cuts the Fed will provide through the middle of next year. In other dealings early Thursday, the U.S. dollar was holding steady against the Japanese yen, at 154.63. The euro slipped to $1.0728 from $1.0730. U.S. benchmark crude oil gained 2 cents to $71.71 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, was up 24 cents at $75.16. The price of bitcoin slipped to $$76,165 after hitting an all-time high above $76,480 on Wednesday, according to CoinDesk. Trump has pledged to make the country 'the crypto capital of the planet' and create a 'strategic reserve' of bitcoin. ___ AP Business Writer Stan Choe contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-rates-china-ab18973c20d3e48e0567768378b32c01	2024-11-06T16:36:24-08:00	
Plea deals revived for alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and others	WASHINGTON (AP) — A military judge has ruled that plea agreements struck by alleged Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and two co-defendants are valid, voiding an order by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to throw out the deals, a government official said Wednesday. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the order by the judge, Air Force Col. Matthew McCall, has not yet been posted publicly or officially announced. The plea agreements would spare Mohammed and the others the risk of the death penalty in exchange for guilty pleas in the long-running 9/11 case. Government prosecutors had negotiated the deals with defense attorneys under government auspices, and the top official for the military commission at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, had approved them. The plea deals in the Sept. 11, 2001, al-Qaida attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people spurred immediate political blowback by Republican lawmakers and others when announced in late July. The agreements, and Austin's attempt to reverse them, have been one of the most fraught episodes in a U.S. prosecution marked by delays and legal difficulties, including years of ongoing pretrial hearings to determine the admissibility of statements by the defendants given their years of torture in CIA custody. Within days of the deals becoming public this summer, Austin issued a brief order saying he was nullifying them. Plea bargains in possible death penalty cases tied to one of the gravest crimes ever carried out on U.S. soil were a momentous step that should only be decided by the defense secretary, Austin said at the time. The Pentagon is reviewing the judge's decision and had no immediate further comment, said Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon press secretary. The New York Times first reported the ruling. Military officials have yet to post the judge's decision on the Guantanamo military commission's online site. However, a legal blog that long has covered the prosecutions from the Guantanamo courtroom said McCall's 29-page ruling concludes that Austin lacked the authority to toss out the plea deals. The ruling also calls the timing of Austin's move 'fatal,' coming after Guantanamo's top official already had approved the deals, according to the blog, called Lawdragon. — AP reporter Lolita C.

Controversial Australian Olympic breaker Rachael Gunn retires from competition	SYDNEY (AP) — Australian breaker Rachael Gunn has told a Sydney radio station that she plans to retire from competition just three months after her unconventional routine at the Paris Olympics led to her being ridiculed and spawned conspiracy theories about how she qualified for the Games. The now 37-year-old Sydney university lecturer failed to get on the scoreboard in all three of her competition rounds in August, with a routine that included unorthodox moves such as a kangaroo hop. Gunn had initially planned to keep competing but said the experience had been so 'upsetting' that she changed her mind. 'I just didn’t have any control over how people saw me or who I was,' she told radio station 2DayFM. 'I was going to keep competing, for sure, but that seems really difficult for me to do now. I think the level of scrutiny that’s going to be there, and people will be filming it, and it will go online.' Breaking was being contested at an Olympics for the first time . And it might be a one-and-done, not scheduled on the Olympic program for Los Angeles in 2028 or for Brisbane, Australia in 2032. 'Raygun' as she was known, was later ridiculed on social media, with some posts also questioning the Olympic qualifying process. In a television interview for The Project on Australia’s Channel 10 in September, she told of being chased by cameras through Paris streets and how she dealt with the very public reaction to her performance. 'That was really wild,' she said. 'If people are chasing me, what do I do? That really did put me in a state of panic. I was nervous to be out in public. It was pretty nerve-wracking for a while.' She apologized for the commotion, but again defended her performance and said she was thankful for support from others in the sport. She had previously defended how she qualified for Paris, and reiterated it on the TV program. 'I won the Oceania championships. It was a direct qualifier,' Gunn said. 'There were nine judges, all from overseas. I knew my chances were slim as soon as I qualified,' for the Olympics. 'People didn’t understand breaking and were just angry about my performance,' she added. 'The conspiracy theories were just awful and that was really upsetting. People are now attacking our reputation and our integrity — none of them were grounded in facts.' Gunn’s performance was mocked online and on television, including in a sketch on Jimmy Fallon’s late-night TV show. In her Sydney radio interview Wednesday, Gunn said she won't stop breaking entirely. 'I still dance and I still break.' she said. 'But that’s like, in my living room with my partner.' ___ AP Paris Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games	https://apnews.com/article/australia-olympics-breaker-retires-909872e56fa902b4743e476c7acb4af0	2024-11-06T16:20:05-08:00	
Canada orders TikTok's Canadian business to be dissolved but won't block app	TORONTO (AP) — Canada announced Wednesday it won’t block access to the popular video-sharing app TikTok but is ordering the dissolution of its Canadian business after a national security review of the Chinese company behind it. Industry Minister François-Philippe Champagne said it is meant to address risks related to ByteDance Ltd.’s establishment of TikTok Technology Canada Inc. 'The government is not blocking Canadians’ access to the TikTok application or their ability to create content. The decision to use a social media application or platform is a personal choice,' Champagne said. Champagne said it is important for Canadians to adopt good cybersecurity practices, including protecting their personal information. He said the dissolution order was made in accordance with the Investment Canada Act, which allows for the review of foreign investments that may harm Canada’s national security. He said the decision was based on information and evidence collected over the course of the review and on the advice of Canada’s security and intelligence community and other government partners. A TikTok spokesperson said in a statement that the shutdown of its Canadian offices will mean the loss of hundreds of local jobs. 'We will challenge this order in court,' the spokesperson said. 'The TikTok platform will remain available for creators to find an audience, explore new interests and for businesses to thrive.' TikTok is wildly popular with young people, but its Chinese ownership has raised fears that Beijing could use it to collect data on Western users or push pro-China narratives and misinformation. TikTok is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company that moved its headquarters to Singapore in 2020. TikTok faces intensifying scrutiny from Europe and America over security and data privacy. It comes as China and the West are locked in a wider tug of war over technology ranging from spy balloons to computer chips. Canada previously banned TikTok from all government-issued mobile devices. TikTok has two offices in Canada, one in Toronto and one in Vancouver. Michael Geist, Canada research chair in Internet and E-commerce Law at the University of Ottawa, said in a blog post that 'banning the company rather than the app may actually make matters worse since the risks associated with the app will remain but the ability to hold the company accountable will be weakened.' Canada's move comes a day after the election in the United States of Donald Trump. In June, Trump joined TikTok, a platform he once tried to ban while in the White House. It has about 170 million users in the U.S. Trump tried to ban TikTok through an executive order that said 'the spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned' by Chinese companies was a national security threat. The courts blocked the action after TikTok sued. Both the U.S. FBI and the Federal Communications Commission have warned that ByteDance could share user data such as browsing history, location and biometric identifiers with China’s government. TikTok said it has never done that and would not, if asked. Trump said earlier this year that he still believes TikTok posed a national security risk, but was opposed to banning it. U.S. President Joe Biden signed legislation in April that would force ByteDance to sell the app to a U.S. company within a year or face a national ban. It’s not clear whether that law will survive a legal challenge filed by TikTok or that ByteDance would agree to sell.	https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-canada-china-f290fed849bcdb26edb165d55b0aa225	2024-11-06T15:37:23-08:00	
China is bracing for fresh tensions with Trump over trade, tech and Taiwan	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — The first time China faced Donald Trump in the White House, there was a trade war, a breach of protocol involving Taiwan’s former leader, and a president-to-president bromance that turned sour. As President-elect Trump prepares to start his second term in office, China is bracing for unpredictability in its ties with the United States and renewed tensions over trade, technology and Taiwan. A new tariff war looms Perhaps the biggest consequence for China — if Trump stays true to his campaign promises — is his threat to slap blanket 60% tariffs on all Chinese exports to the U.S. Tariffs like that would be a blow to China’s already unstable economy, which is suffering from high youth unemployment, a lengthy property slump and government debt. A 60% duty on Chinese imports could shave off 2.5 percentage points, or about half, of China’s projected economic growth, according to an analysis published earlier this year by UBS. During Trump's previous term in office, the U.S. imposed tariffs on more than $360 billion of Chinese products. That brought Beijing to the negotiating table, and in 2020 the two sides signed a trade deal in which China committed to improve intellectual property rights and buy an extra $200 billion of American goods. A research group a couple of years later showed China had bought essentially none of the goods it had promised. President Joe Biden retained most of those tariffs and added fresh duties this year on imports including steel, solar cells and electric vehicles. Like last time, tariffs could serve as a tool to force Beijing back to the negotiating table, said Henry Gao, a law professor at Singapore Management University who focuses on international trade. 'Given the weak economic position of China this time, I think there will be more willingness to talk,' he said. 'Thus, while the tariff might have some short-term effects on the Chinese economy, the situation might improve once they reach a deal.' Factoring into the trade talks could be Trump’s appeals to Chinese President Xi Jinping to help negotiate a resolution to the Ukraine war, which Trump has boasted he’ll be able to do quickly, without saying how. Trump previously sought Xi's help in dealing with North Korea's rogue leader Kim Jong Un. That dynamic could repeat itself, with Trump weighing trade grievances against seeking China's support in global crises, according to Wang Huiyao, founder of the Beijing-based think tank Center for China and Globalization. 'China is the largest trading partner of both Russia and Ukraine,' Wang wrote in a recent commentary. 'These close economic ties give China a unique opportunity to play a greater role in peace-making efforts.' Willing to go ‘crazy’ over Taiwan There is one scenario in which Trump has threatened to impose even higher tariffs — 150% to 200% — on Chinese goods: if China invades Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy that Beijing claims as its own. The U.S. does not recognize Taiwan as a country, but is its strongest backer and biggest arms provider. Trump angered Beijing in December 2016 by taking a congratulatory call from Taiwan’s then-president Tsai Ing-wen in a breach of diplomatic protocol. No U.S. president had spoken directly to a Taiwanese leader since Washington and Beijing established ties in 1979. Trump's move created anxiety in China-watching circles, but ultimately, he stuck to supporting the status quo in relations between Taipei and Beijing. China expects him to continue to do so, said Zhu Feng, dean of the School of International Relations at Nanjing University. 'Will (he) want to turn to support Taiwan independence? It is unlikely,' he said. As for China’s repeated threats to annex Taiwan, Trump told The Wall Street Journal last month that he would not have to use military force to prevent a blockade of Taiwan because Xi 'respects me and he knows I’m (expletive) crazy.' On the campaign trail, Trump sometimes talked up his personal connection with Xi, which started exuberantly during his first term but soured over disputes about trade and the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic. But Trump has also said that Taiwan should pay the U.S. for defending it against China, likening the relationship to insurance. Taiwan spends about 2.5% of its GDP on defense, and purchased hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of U.S. weapons this year. In a congratulatory message to Trump after his victory, Xi called for the U.S. and China to manage their differences and get along in a new era, according to Chinese state media. History has shown that both sides gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation, Xi said. Trump has purposely maintained a sense of uncertainty in his relationship with China, said Da Wei, director of the Center for International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University in Beijing. 'We are clear about the challenges,' he said. 'As for opportunities, we are yet to see them clearly.' Disputes over chips During his first term, Trump began targeting Chinese technology firms over security concerns, focusing on large companies like the telecoms giant Huawei. Biden continued in that direction by placing curbs on China’s access to advanced semiconductors, which are needed to develop strategic industries such as artificial intelligence. But Trump has criticized Biden’s CHIPS and Science Act, a bipartisan bill that earmarked $53 billion to build up domestic manufacturing of semiconductors. Currently, Taiwan produces nearly 90% of the world’s supply of the most advanced chips. The island’s largest semiconductor manufacturer, TSMC, expanded production in Arizona, partly to respond to the CHIPS Act, and to be prepared to withstand any other protectionist policies in the U.S., said Shihoko Goto, director of the Indo-Pacific Program at the Wilson Center. Trump has promised to do away with the CHIPS Act, though critics say that would undermine his campaign to reindustrialize the U.S. The president-elect has also accused Taiwan of 'stealing' the chip industry from the U.S. decades ago. 'Rather than providing a silicon shield, Taiwan’s dominance in the chip industry could actually be the source of tension between Taipei and Trump, as Taiwan’s successes in the chip sector may be seen as having only been possible as a result of the United States being taken advantage of,' Goto said.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-china-tariffs-taiwan-foreign-policy-7351ce1069654f1c1aefb560b36dcc17	2024-11-06T15:02:43-08:00	
Trump's return to White House sets stage for far-reaching immigration crackdown	SAN DIEGO (AP) — 'Build the Wall' was Donald Trump's rally cry in 2016, and he acted on his promise by tapping military budgets for hundreds of miles of border wall with Mexico. 'Mass Deportation' was the buzzword that energized supporters for his White House bid in 2024. Trump’s victory sets the stage for a swift crackdown after an AP VoteCast survey showed the president-elect’s supporters were largely focused on immigration and inflation — issues the Republican has been hammering throughout his campaign. How and when Trump's actions on immigration will take shape is uncertain. While Trump and his advisers have offered outlines, many questions remain about how they would deport anywhere close to the 11 million people estimated to be in the country illegally. How would immigrants be identified? Where would they be detained? What if their countries refuse to take them back? Where would Trump find money and trained officers to carry out their deportation? Trump has said he would invoke the Alien Enemies Act, a rarely used 1798 law that allows the president to deport any noncitizen from a country the U.S. is at war with. He has spoken about deploying the National Guard, which can be activated on orders from a governor. Stephen Miller, a top Trump adviser, has said troops under sympathetic Republican governors would send troops to nearby states that refuse to participate. Trump, who repeatedly referred to immigrants 'poisoning the blood' of the United States, has stricken fear in immigrant communities with words alone. Julie Moreno, a U.S. citizen who has been married for seven years to a Mexican man who is in the country illegally, is adjusting to the idea that she may have to live separately from her husband, who came to the United States in 2004. She can move to Mexico from New Jersey but it would be nearly impossible to keep running her business importing boxing gloves. 'I don’t have words yet, too many feelings,' Moreno said, her voice breaking as she spoke Wednesday of Trump's victory. 'I am very scared for my husband’s safety. … If they detain him, what is going to happen?' Moreno's husband, Neftali Juarez, ran a construction business and feels he has contributed to the country, paying taxes and providing employment through his company. 'Unfortunately, the sentiment of the people who voted is different,' he said. 'I feel horrible losing my wife.' Some policy experts expect Trump’s first immigration moves to be at the border. He may pressure Mexico to keep blocking migrants from reaching the U.S. border as it has since December. He may lean on Mexico to reinstate a Trump-era policy that made asylum-seekers wait in Mexico for hearings in U.S. immigration court. Andrew Arthur, a fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports immigration restrictions, highlighted campaign remarks by Vice President-elect JD Vance that deporting millions would be done one step at a time, not all at once. 'You’re not talking about a dragnet,' Arthur, a former immigration judge, told The Associated Press. 'There’s no way you could do it. The first thing you have to do is seal the border and then you can address the interior. All of this is going to be guided by the resources you have available.' Elena, a 46-year-old Nicaraguan who has been living in the United States illegally for 25 years, couldn’t sleep after Trump's victory, crying about what to do if she and her husband, 50, are deported. They have two adult daughters, both U.S. citizens, who have had stomach pain and respiratory problems from anxiety about the election. 'It is so difficult for me to uproot myself from the country that I have seen as my home,' said Elena, who lives in South Florida and gave only her first name for fear of being deported. 'I have made my roots here and it is difficult to have to abandon everything to start over.' Advocates are looking at where deportation arrests might take place and are watching especially closely to see if authorities adhere to a longstanding policy of avoiding schools, hospitals, places of worship and disaster relief centers, said Heidi Altman, federal advocacy director for the National Immigration Law Center’s Immigrant Justice Fund. 'We're taking it very seriously,' said Altman. 'We all have to have our eyes wide open to the fact that this isn't 2016. Trump and Stephen Miller learned a lot from their first administration. The courts look very different than they did four years ago.' Trump is expected to resume other far-reaching policies from his first term and jettison key Biden moves. These include: —Trump has harshly criticized Biden policies to create and expand legal pathways to entry, including an online app called CBP One under which nearly 1 million people have entered at land crossings with Mexico since January 2023. Another policy has allowed more than 500,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans to fly into the country with financial sponsors. — Trump slashed the number of refugees screened abroad by the United Nations and State Department for settlement in the U.S. to its lowest level since Congress established the program in 1980. Biden rebuilt it, establishing an annual cap of 125,000, up from 18,000 under Trump. —Trump sought to end the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which shielded people who came to the U.S. as young children from deportation. A lawsuit by Republican governors that has seemed headed for the Supreme Court challenges DACA. For now, hundreds of thousands of DACA recipients may renew their status but new applications aren't accepted. —Trump dramatically curtailed the use of Temporary Protected Status, created under a 1990 law to allow people already in the United States to stay if their homelands are deemed unsafe. Biden sharply expanded use of TPS, including to hundreds of thousands of Haitians and Venezuelans. Maribel Hernandez, a Venezuelan on TPS that allows her to stay in the United States until April 2025, burst into tears as her 2-year-old son slept in a stroller outside New York's Roosevelt Hotel as migrants discussed election fallout Wednesday. 'Imagine if they end it,' she said. ___ Salomon reported from Miami.

Deforestation in Brazil's Amazon drops by nearly 31% compared to previous year	AGUA CLARA, Brazil (AP) — Forest loss in Brazil’s Amazon dropped by 30.6% compared to the previous year, officials said Wednesday, the lowest level of destruction in nine years. In a 12-month span, the Amazon rainforest lost 6,288 square kilometers (2,428 square miles), roughly the size of the U.S. state of Delaware. The results, announced in Brazil´s presidential palace, sharply contrast with President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s predecessor, far-right leader Jair Bolsonaro, who prioritized agribusiness expansion over forest protection and weakened environmental agencies. Deforestation hit a 15-year high during his term. Deforestation in Brazil's vast savannah, known as the Cerrado, decreased by 25.7%, the first decline in five years. The area destroyed reached 8,174 square kilometers (3,156 square miles). Located in central Brazil, it is the world’s most biodiverse savannah but has fewer legal protections than the Amazon. Despite the success in curbing Amazon deforestation, Lula's government has been criticized by environmentalists for backing projects that could harm the region, such as the pavement of a highway that cuts from an old-growth area, oil drilling in the mouth of the Amazon River and building a railway to transport soy to Amazonian ports. Brazil’s deforestation monitoring system tracks Aug. 1 to July 30, so Wednesday's report doesn’t capture the destruction from the past few months, as a historic drought opened the way to a surge in forest fires that burned an area larger than Switzerland. Much of the damage from fires is classified as degradation, not clearcutting deforestation, as the fire in the Amazon rainforest spreads mostly through leaves on the ground, and not through treetops. But the full impact will be assessed in the following months through further satellite monitoring. Government officials already fear that the deforestation rate may increase next year as the Amazonian city of Belem prepares to host the annual U.N. climate talks, known as COP30. The Amazon, an area twice the size of India, holds the world’s largest rainforest, about two-thirds of it within Brazil. It stores vast amounts of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that causes climate change. The Amazon thus prevents the climate from warming even faster than it would otherwise. The basin also holds about 20% of the world’s fresh water and biodiversity includes 16,000 known tree species. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

In new term, Trump set to target measures that are making the most difference for the climate	WASHINGTON (AP) — The election of Donald Trump as president for a second time and the Republican takeback of the U.S. Senate could undo many of the national climate policies that are most reducing planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, according to climate solutions experts. When they list measures that are making the most difference, it lines up with policies Trump has said he'll target. These rollbacks will come as more lives are being lost in heat waves, record amounts of climate pollution are accumulating in the atmosphere, the United States has been hit with what may be two of its most expensive hurricanes, and nations, which will meet in Baku, Azerbaijan next week for climate negotiations, have failed to take strong action to change these realities. Here are some of the measures. The Inflation Reduction Act, the nation's landmark climate law This law is significant because it is expected to reduce U.S. emissions by about 40% by 2030, if it unfolds as planned in the coming years. It funnels money to measures that substitute clean energy for dirty. One major way it does so is by giving credits to businessespeople who build new solar and wind farms. But it's not limited to that. It encourages developers of geothermal energy and businesses that separate the carbon dioxide from their smokestacks and bury it underground. It incentivizes the next generation of nuclear power. It gives a $7,500 tax credit to people who buy electric cars. People who buy their cars used can get a credit too, as long as they don't earn too much to qualify. Trump, by contrast, has summed up his energy policy as 'drill, baby, drill' and pledged to dismantle what he calls Democrats’ 'green new scam' in favor of boosting production of fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal, the main causes of climate change. He vows to end subsidies for wind power that were included in the landmark 2022 climate law. If Trump does target the climate law, there are provisions that are likely safe. One is a credit for companies in advanced manufacturing, because it is perceived as 'America first and pro-U.S. business,' said David Shepheard, partner and energy expert at the global consultant Baringa. Incentives for electric vehicles are likely most at risk, he added. In a call Wednesday morning, Scott Segal, head of a communications group at the law firm Bracewell LLP, which represents the energy industry, said the climate law is not likely to be repealed. Dan Jasper, a senior policy advisor at Project Drawdown, said repealing parts of the climate law could backfire because most of the investments and jobs are in Republican congressional districts. Pollution from electric power plants The main U.S. rule aimed at reducing the climate change that comes from making electricity at power plants that burn coal is also considered vulnerable. This rule from the Environmental Protection Agency, announced in April, would force many coal-fired plants to capture 90% of their carbon emissions or shut down within eight years, Shepheard said. It was projected to reduce roughly 1.38 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide through 2047, along with tens of thousands of tons of other harmful air pollutants. Industry groups and Republican-controlled states have filed legal challenges to a host of EPA rules including this one and Trump’s victory means the Justice Department is unlikely to defend it. Under a Trump presidency, it is unlikely to survive, Shepheard said. The United States has been reducing carbon dioxide emissions primarily by replacing coal-fired power plants with clean, renewable power, said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson, who chairs the Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists that tracks countries’ carbon dioxide emissions. 'I hope that we don’t lose sight of the benefits of clean energy,' he said. 'It’s not just about the climate. It’s about our lives and our health.' Limiting leaks from damaging methane, or natural gas The Biden administration was under pressure to reduce one of the main pollutants contributing to drought, heat waves, flooding and stronger hurricanes — methane or natural gas. It leaks out of oil and gas equipment, sometimes deliberately when companies consider it too expensive to transport. The Biden administration issued the first national rules on this. Industry groups and Republican-leaning states have challenged the rule in court. They say the Environmental Protection Agency overstepped its authority and set unattainable standards. The EPA said the rules are squarely within its legal responsibilities and would protect the public. Fuel-efficient vehicles The Environmental Protection Agency has issued its strongest rules on tailpipe emissions from cars and trucks under the Biden administration. While it is unclear who will head the EPA under Trump, the agency is considered likely to begin a lengthy process to repeal and replace a host of standards including the one on tailpipe emissions, which Trump falsely calls an electric vehicle 'mandate.″ Trump rolled back more than 100 environmental laws as president and that number is likely to grow in a second term. Trump has said EV manufacturing will destroy jobs in the auto industry and has falsely claimed that battery-powered cars don’t work in cold weather and aren’t able to travel long distances. Trump softened his rhetoric in recent months after Tesla CEO Elon Musk endorsed him and campaigned heavily for his election. Even so, industry officials expect Trump to try to slow a shift to electric cars. Drilling in Alaska refuge Trump is almost certain to reinstate drilling in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, continuing a partisan battle that has persisted for decades. Biden and other Democratic presidents have blocked drilling in the sprawling refuge, which is home to polar bears, caribou and other wildlife. Trump reinstated the drilling program in a 2017 tax cut law enacted by congressional Republicans. Even so, no drilling has occurred in the refuge. Transition to cleaner energy, transport will continue Trump, who has cast climate change as a 'hoax,' has said he will also eliminate regulations by the Biden administration to increase the energy efficiency of lightbulbs, stoves, dishwashers and shower heads. Dan Jasper, a senior policy advisor at Project Drawdown said climate action will continue to move forward at the state and local level. Zara Ahmed, who leads policy analysis and science strategy at Carbon Direct, agreed. While there may be an abdication of leadership at the federal level on climate, she’s optimistic that states including California will continue to lead. Clean Air Task Force Executive Director Armond Cohen said on Wednesday that states, cities, utilities and businesses that have committed to net zero emissions will keep working toward those goals, driving record installations of wind and solar energy. Governors of both parties are also interested in ramping up nuclear energy as a carbon-free source of electricity, Cohen said. Trump has said he, too, is interested in developing the next generation of nuclear reactors that are smaller than traditional reactors. Gina McCarthy, a former EPA administrator who was Biden’s first national climate adviser, said Trump will be unable to stop clean energy such as wind, solar and geothermal power. 'No matter what Trump may say, the shift to clean energy is unstoppable and our country is not turning back,″ McCarthy said. Advocates for clean energy are bipartisan, well-organized 'and fully prepared to deliver climate solutions, boost local economies, and drive climate ambition,′ she said. ___ McDermott reported from Providence, R.I. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

UK identifies 4 cases of new mpox variant, the first cluster outside Africa	LONDON (AP) — British health officials say they have identified four cases of the new, more infectious version of mpox that first emerged in Congo, marking the first time the variant has caused a cluster of illness outside of Africa. Scientists said the risk to the public remains low. Authorities announced the first case of the new form of mpox in the U.K. last week, saying the case was being treated at a London hospital after recently traveling to countries in Africa with ongoing outbreaks. This week, the U.K. Health Security Agency said it had now identified three further cases who lived in the same household as the first patient. They too are now being treated at a hospital in London. 'Mpox is very infectious in households with close contact and so it is not unexpected to see further cases within the same household,' said Susan Hopkins, chief medical advisor of the U.K. Health Security Agency. The new variant of mpox was first detected earlier this year in eastern Congo. Scientists believe it causes milder symptoms that are harder to notice, which makes it easier to spread because people may not know they are infected. Its spread in Congo and elsewhere in Africa prompted the World Health Organization to declare a global emergency in August. Britain recorded more than 3,000 cases of another type of mpox during a 2022 outbreak that hit more than 100 countries. The new variant of mpox has also caused outbreaks in Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda. Single cases in travelers have also been reported in Sweden, India, Germany and Thailand. To date, there have been about 43,000 suspect cases of mpox in Africa, including more than 1,000 deaths, mostly in Congo. On Wednesday, WHO said it had allocated 899,900 vaccine doses to nine African countries struggling with mpox epidemics. __ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

Corning faces EU antitrust scrutiny over Gorilla Glass deals with phone makers	LONDON (AP) — Corning is facing European Union antitrust scrutiny after the bloc's watchdog said Wednesday it's investigating the speciality glass maker's exclusive deals for its Gorilla Glass used in cellphones. The European Commission, the 27-nation EU's top antitrust enforcer, said it opened a formal investigation to determine whether Corning Inc. abused its dominant worldwide position for the toughened glass used in smartphones, tablets and other portable devices. The commission, which is the EU's executive branch, said it was concerned about 'anti-competitive exclusive supply agreements' requiring device makers to source all or nearly all of their glass from Corning. Under these deals, manufacturers got rebates for buying only Corning glass, and could only take competing offers from rival glass makers if Corning couldn't match the price. Strong competition 'is crucial to ensure low prices and high-quality glass,' said Margrethe Vestager, the commission's executive vice-president in charge of competition policy. 'We are investigating if Corning, a major producer of this special glass, may have tried to exclude rival glass producers, thereby depriving consumers from cheaper and more break-resistant glass.' Corning is 'committed to compliance with all applicable rules and regulations where it does business,' the company said in a statement. 'As part of that commitment, we work with local regulatory authorities to ensure open discussion and cooperation.' Brussels has no deadline to wrap up the case, which could result in formal charges and a hefty fine worth up to 10% of the company's annual global revenue.	https://apnews.com/article/corning-antitrust-european-union-phone-dcdc7759ba8f7e3354d92759bff4879c	2024-11-06T08:30:16-08:00

Sorrentino's ode to Naples, 'Parthenope,' gets mixed reviews in Italy over San Gennaro sex scene	ROME (AP) — When director Paolo Sorrentino’s hit series 'The Young Pope' debuted in 2016, it took the Vatican a year to grudgingly bless his imagined and occasionally blasphemous portrayal of the pope. Not so for Sorrentino’s latest film 'Parthenope,' which has gotten an early thumbs down from Italy's Catholic Church. That has only seemed to pique interest in the film, driving it to the top of the box office here for Italian films since its release in theaters last month. Set in Sorrentino’s native Naples, the film is a lush meditation on beauty, love and death, drawn from the Greek myth of the siren Parthenope, who throws herself into the sea after she fails to entice Odysseus with her song. Parthenope is closely affiliated with Naples, such that the city is sometimes called 'Partenope' and its people 'Partenopei' in Italian. The film is by no means about the church, but toward the end of the film, there is a single scene that would make any Catholic choke. It involves a cardinal, the seductive protagonist Parthenope and the liquification of the blood of San Gennaro — the purported recurring miracle that is a sacred cow to many Neapolitans. Prominent Italian Catholics have denounced the sacrilegious sex scene as not only demeaning to the faith but Naples itself, with the newspaper of the Italian bishops conference Avvenire calling the 'sterile aesthetics' of the scene 'in poor taste.' In a roundup of negative reaction, Avvenire said Sorrentino’s fascination with the Catholic Church in 'The Young Pope' had reached new lows in 'Parthenope.' 'The impression is that they are images chosen for the image, whether nuns playing tennis or cardinals smoking cigars,' Avvenire concluded. Monsignor Vincenzo De Gregorio, who oversees the chapel that houses the relic of San Gennaro’s blood and related treasures of Naples’ patron saint, said he hadn’t seen the film in its entirety but that the clips of the scene were enough. While acknowledging that his comments would only give the film more publicity, De Gregorio told Corriere della Sera that he objected primarily to the 'superficial' treatment the film gave to one of Naples’ enduring mysteries: How San Gennaro’s blood liquifies, or doesn’t, on three specific days each year. According to legend, the purported miracle recalls the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in 1631 when the blood of San Gennaro liquified and the magma from the volcano stopped before entering the city. San Gennaro is today often invoked to protect Neapolitans, and the thrice-yearly ritual draws thousands of devotees. 'Of course Sorrentino didn’t intend to make a documentary or an in-depth, sociological, historical analysis of Naples, but simply to analyze its dreamlike aspect, because basically that’s all it is,' De Gregorio told Corriere. Sorrentino, who won an Oscar for his Fellini-esque love letter to Rome, 'The Great Beauty,' has said his ode to Naples had to focus on Parthenope, the sea and the complicated and at times contradictory relationship between them and Naples itself. 'She is a free woman, very spontaneous, she doesn’t judge, as the city doesn’t judge,' he told a press conference at the Cannes Film Festival, where 'Parthenope' debuted in May to a standing ovation. 'She’s the mirror of the city where I grew up.' And some have hailed 'Parthenope,' with the Cannes jury giving its cinematographer, Daria d’Antonio, the festival's technical award. This week, Italian media reported that T-shirts have begun circulating around Naples with 'I love Sorrentino' and 'I love Parthenope,' and new figurines for Christmas creches, for which Neapolitan artisans are famous, featuring one of the film’s characters. Sorrentino himself found adoring fans seeking selfies and autographs this week during a special screening of the film in Palermo, Sicily. It's the latest brush of recent cinematic attention for Naples, the backdrop for the HBO television series 'My Brilliant Friend' based on the best-selling quartet of novels by Elena Ferrante. Sorrentino’s last feature film, 'The Hand of God,' was also based in Naples and featured another sacred but secular icon to Neapolitans, Maradona. Before that, he made a splash with his 10-episode series 'The Young Pope,' starring Jude Law as an improbable and controversial pope, which was followed by 'The New Pope,' starring John Malkovich. A year after the initial HBO and Sky series began airing in Italy in late 2016, the Vatican newspaper L’Osservatore Romano finally offered generally positive reviews despite what it called the 'frivolous,' ’’caustic' and 'grotesque' way it painted the Vatican. L’Osservatore Romano hasn’t commented on 'Parthenope.' The Vatican is a perennial topic for directors, with a host of films in recent years focusing on the papacy including Nanni Moretti’s 'Habemus Papam,' Netflix’s 'The Two Popes' and most recently 'Conclave' starring Ralph Fiennes. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Trump promises to bring lasting peace to a tumultuous Middle East. But fixing it won't be easy	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Donald Trump will return to the U.S. presidency at a time of unprecedented conflict and uncertainty in the Middle East. He has vowed to fix it. But Trump's history of strong support for Israel coupled with his insistence during the campaign that the war in Gaza should end quickly, the isolationist forces in the Republican party and his penchant for unpredictability raise a mountain of questions over how his second presidency will affect the region at this pivotal moment. Barring the achievement of elusive cease-fires before the inauguration, Trump will ascend to the highest office in the country as a brutal war in Gaza still rages and Israel presses its offensive against the Lebanese Hezbollah militant group. A conflagration between Iran and Israel shows no signs of abating — nor do Israel’s conflicts with Iranian proxies in Iraq and Yemen — and Iran’s nuclear program remains a top concern for Israel. Trump says he wants peace, but how? Throughout his campaign, Trump has vowed to bring peace to the region. 'Get it over with and let’s get back to peace and stop killing people,' Trump said of the conflict in Gaza in an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt in April. Israel launched the war in response to Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attacks, when militants killed 1,200 people in Israel and kidnapped 250, with dozens still in Gaza. Israel’s offensive has killed more than 43,000 people, according to Gaza health officials, whose count does not distinguish between civilians and fighters, though they say more than half of the dead are women and children. The war has ignited a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, driven Israel into increasing international isolation, with two world courts examining charges of war crimes, and has sparked a wave of protests on American campuses that have fueled debate over the U.S. role as Israel's key military and diplomatic supporter. International mediators from the U.S., Egypt and Qatar have tried unsuccessfully to bring about a lasting cease-fire. Yet Trump has repeatedly urged to Israel 'finish the job' and destroy Hamas — but hasn’t said how. 'Does finish the job mean you have a free hand to act in dealing with the remnants of Hamas? Or does finish the job mean the war has to come to an end now?' asked David Makovsky, director of the program on Arab-Israel Relations at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. 'That’s part of the enigmas here.' Netanyahu is pinning his hopes on a pro-Israel Trump administration Uncertainty also shrouds how Trump will engage with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. During his first term, Trump offered broad support for the Israeli leader’s hard-line policies, including unilaterally withdrawing from a deal meant to rein in Iran’s nuclear program that Netanyahu long opposed. Trump also recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, bolstering its claim over the disputed city, and Israel’s annexation of the Golan Heights, captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war. He presented a peace plan with the Palestinians widely seen as favoring Israel. Settlement-building in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, seen as an obstacle to Palestinian statehood, surged under his presidency. Trump also helped secure agreements between Israel and four Arab countries to normalize ties that were not contingent on progress toward Palestinian statehood — a major victory for Netanyahu. The Israeli leader hopes to replicate those successes with a deal with Saudi Arabia. The leaders had a falling out after Netanyahu congratulated President Joe Biden following the 2020 elections — a move Trump viewed as a slight from his loyal ally, though Netanyahu visited Trump in Florida this year. Under Biden, the U.S. has been critical at times and slowed some weapons deliveries in response to Israel's conduct in Gaza. Netanyahu is likely hoping that Trump's return will loosen any restraints on Israel to pursue its war goals. The American leader could also work to challenge a potential international war crimes arrest warrant for Netanyahu. And a smoother relationship with Washington could help improve the Israeli leader's own popular support. 'He has the most pro-Israel record of any president,' said Michael Oren, a former Israeli ambassador to Washington. 'The hope is here that there’ll be more of the same.' Neither Netanyahu nor Trump has a clear vision for postwar Gaza Netanyahu leads a far-right government whose key members have vowed to topple his rule if the war in Gaza ends with anything short of Hamas' destruction. They support resettling Gaza and are enthusiastic about a Trump presidency — and their influence will only grow now that Netanyahu has fired his defense minister over his more pragmatic approach to the conflict. Their grip on the government and over Netanyahu’s political future helps explain why Netanyahu has not spelled out a clear vision for a postwar Gaza. The Biden administration has favored having the war-ravaged territory governed by the Western-backed Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the West Bank. Netanyahu has rejected that idea and insists on the right for the Israeli military to operate there. Trump has not outlined a clear vision, although he has said developers could make Gaza 'better than Monaco' because it has 'the best location in the Middle East, the best water, the best everything.' Diana Buttu, a former adviser to Palestinian leaders, said a lack of a firm U.S. vision for Gaza, coupled with a politically powerful Israeli far right, made the future for people in Gaza and for Palestinians in general grim. 'I don’t see this as a president who is going to care about Palestinians,' she said. Will Trump help defend Israel against Iran or choose America first? In Lebanon, Israel is battling the Iranian-backed Hezbollah with both a ground invasion and strikes on Hezbollah targets. The militant group has fired thousands of rockets and drones at Israeli communities, killing dozens and displacing 60,000. Israel’s offensive, meanwhile, has displaced over 1 million people in Lebanon and killed more than 3,000. U.S. mediation efforts there too have been fruitless. Trump, who has a Lebanese-American son-in-law, recently posted on the social platform X that as president he would 'stop the suffering and destruction in Lebanon.' But a key question is how much Trump will be swayed by his America First instincts. The U.S. has played a central role in diplomatic efforts throughout the war, and an even more robust role in helping Israel defend itself against Iran and its allies. The U.S. has sent military assets to the region, helped Israel thwart two missile attacks by Iran and even has U.S. soldiers in Israel to operate a sophisticated air defense system. But any effective Israeli attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities, a target it avoided in its strike last month, will likely need greater U.S. military involvement. Accusations that Iran has hacked campaign associates and concerns about the potential for Tehran to carry out violence against Trump or members of his administration could deepen his antipathy toward the country. While Trump has indicated he will focus on domestic affairs, the Mideast could be an outlier. He enjoys a wide base of support from evangelical Christians, who are staunchly pro-Israel, and his son-in-law and former adviser Jared Kushner was a prominent voice in support of the country in his first administration. 'As Trump is likely to navigate between those forces mostly based on his intuition,' said Udi Sommer, an expert on U.S.-Israel relations at Tel Aviv University, 'uncertainty will likely define his approach.'	https://apnews.com/article/trump-mideast-netanyahu-israel-gaza-iran-wars-2e37305522d19bdc34e956586cce99bd	2024-11-06T06:13:55-08:00	
4 dead, 25 survivors in Greece after migrant smuggler allegedly forced his passengers overboard	ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Greek authorities have recovered the bodies of four people from the sea just off the coast of the eastern Aegean island of Rhodes, while another 25 people have been found alive on land after a migrant smuggler allegedly forced his passengers overboard while transferring them from Turkey to Greece, the coast guard said Wednesday. The bodies of three men and one woman were recovered near the coast on the southern tip of Rhodes early Wednesday, the coast guard said. The group of 25 survivors were found on land, with police originally locating an initial group of 11 people shortly after midnight, and the rest found afterwards. Survivors told authorities they had been traveling to the Greek island from the nearby Turkish coast by speedboat when the smuggler driving the vessel forced them overboard into the water and left, the coast guard said. A search and rescue operation in the area was called off Wednesday afternoon once authorities ascertained from survivors that there were no further people missing. The nationalities of the passengers weren't immediately known. It was the latest fatal case involving migrants trying to make their way into the European Union using the sea route either from the nearby Turkish coast or across the Mediterranean from North Africa. Greece lies on a popular route into the European Union for people fleeing war and poverty in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, with tens of thousands heading to Greek islands, usually in smuggling boats from the nearby Turkish coast, or making the longer and more treacherous journey across the Mediterranean from North Africa. Migration Minister Nikos Panagiotopoulos has said the government is seeking stricter EU migration policies and is considering creating detention facilities on the islands of Rhodes and Crete after the rate of arrivals by sea has more than doubled, starting last fall. Just over 50,000 migrants were registered as having arrived in Greece by early November, with more than 43,000 of them arriving by sea, according to figures from the U.N. refugee agency. ___ Follow AP’s global migration coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/migration	https://apnews.com/article/migration-greece-rhodes-people-thrown-overboard-85e32a23ecc264ca3640f93f807d8179	2024-11-06T05:35:38-08:00	
Lebanon files complaint against Israel at UN labor body over deadly pager explosions	GENEVA (AP) — Lebanon filed a complaint against Israel at the U.N.’s labor organization over the string of deadly attacks involving exploding pagers, saying workers were among those killed and injured, a Lebanese government minister said Wednesday. The wave of remotely triggered explosions that hit pagers and walkie-talkies carried by Hezbollah members in mid-September were widely blamed on Israel, which has neither confirmed nor denied involvement. The blasts which went off in grocery stores, homes and on streets killed at least 37 people, including two children, and wounded around 3,000 people, according to Lebanese authorities, deeply unsettling even Lebanese who have no Hezbollah affiliation. In addition to fighters, the detonating devices hit workers in Hezbollah’s civilian institutions, including its health care and media operations. Lebanese Labor Minister Moustafa Bayram and other officials said he traveled to Geneva and formally filed the complaint Tuesday against Israel at the International Labor Organization, a sprawling U.N. agency that brings together governments, businesses and workers. 'This method of warfare and conflicts may open the way for many who are evading international humanitarian law to adopt this method of warfare,' he told reporters at the U.N. compound in Geneva. 'It’s a very dangerous precedent, if not condemned,' he said. 'We are in a situation where ordinary objects — objects used in daily life — become dangerous and lethal.' Speaking in Arabic, Bayram insisted that ILO conventions guarantee the safety and security of workers, who 'were in their workplace and had their pagers or walkies-talkies exploding all of a sudden,' according to an interpreter. 'I do not know where the outcome (of the complaint) will go, but at least we raised our voices to say and warn against this dangerous approach that strikes at human relations and leads to more conflicts,' he added. An ILO spokeswoman said she was not immediately aware of the complaint or what redress might be possible through it.	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-pagers-explosion-israel-moustafa-bayram-un-bcafb4419834d9d4f83aab3ffd82b1e3	2024-11-06T05:00:56-08:00	
Donald Trump has sweeping plans for a second administration. Here's what he's proposed	WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump has promised sweeping action in a second administration. The former president and now president-elect often skipped over details but through more than a year of policy pronouncements and written statements outlined a wide-ranging agenda that blends traditional conservative approaches to taxes, regulation and cultural issues with a more populist bent on trade and a shift in America's international role. Trump's agenda also would scale back federal government efforts on civil rights and expand presidential powers. A look at what Trump has proposed: Immigration 'Build the wall!' from his 2016 campaign has become creating 'the largest mass deportation program in history.' Trump has called for using the National Guard and empowering domestic police forces in the effort. Still, Trump has been scant on details of what the program would look like and how he would ensure that it targeted only people in the U.S. illegally. He’s pitched 'ideological screening' for would-be entrants, ending birth-right citizenship (which almost certainly would require a constitutional change), and said he’d reinstitute first-term policies such as 'Remain in Mexico,' limiting migrants on public health grounds and severely limiting or banning entrants from certain majority-Muslim nations. Altogether, the approach would not just crack down on illegal migration, but curtail immigration overall. Abortion Trump played down abortion as a second-term priority, even as he took credit for the Supreme Court ending a woman’s federal right to terminate a pregnancy and returning abortion regulation to state governments. At Trump’s insistence, the GOP platform, for the first time in decades, did not call for a national ban on abortion. Trump maintains that overturning Roe v. Wade is enough on the federal level. Still, Trump has not said explicitly that he would veto national abortion restrictions if they reached his desk. And in an example of how the conservative movement might proceed with or without Trump, anti-abortion activists note that the GOP platform still asserts that a fetus should have due process protections under the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause. That constitutional argument is a roadmap for conservatives to seek a national abortion ban through federal courts. Taxes Trump’s tax policies broadly tilt toward corporations and wealthier Americans. That’s mostly due to his promise to extend his 2017 tax overhaul, with a few notable changes that include lowering the corporate income tax rate to 15% from the current 21%. That also involves rolling back Democratic President Joe Biden’s income tax hikes on the wealthiest Americans and scrapping Inflation Reduction Act levies that finance energy measures intended to combat climate change. Those policies notwithstanding, Trump has put more emphasis on new proposals aimed at working- and middle class Americans: exempting earned tips, Social Security wages and overtime wages from income taxes. It’s noteworthy, however, that his proposal on tips, depending on how Congress might write it, could give a back-door tax break to top wage earners by allowing them to reclassify some of their pay as tip income — a prospect that at its most extreme could see hedge-fund managers or top-flight attorneys taking advantage of a policy that Trump frames as being designed for restaurant servers, bartenders and other service workers. Tariffs and trade Trump’s posture on international trade is to distrust world markets as harmful to American interests. He proposes tariffs of 10% to 20% on foreign goods — and in some speeches has mentioned even higher percentages. He promises to reinstitute an August 2020 executive order requiring that the Food and Drug Administration buy 'essential' medications only from U.S. companies. He pledges to block purchases of 'any vital infrastructure' in the U.S. by Chinese buyers. DEI, LGBTQ and civil rights Trump has called for rolling back societal emphasis on diversity and for legal protections for LGBTQ citizens. Trump has called for ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs in government institutions, using federal funding as leverage. On transgender rights, Trump promises generally to end 'boys in girls’ sports,' a practice he insists, without evidence, is widespread. But his policies go well beyond standard applause lines from his rally speeches. Among other ideas, Trump would roll back the Biden administration’s policy of extending Title IX civil rights protections to transgender students, and he would ask Congress to require that only two genders can be recognized at birth. Regulation, federal bureaucracy and presidential power The president-elect seeks to reduce the role of federal bureaucrats and regulations across economic sectors. Trump frames all regulatory cuts as an economic magic wand. He pledges precipitous drops in U.S. households’ utility bills by removing obstacles to fossil fuel production, including opening all federal lands for exploration — even though U.S. energy production is already at record highs. Trump promises to unleash housing construction by cutting regulations — though most construction rules come from state and local government. He also says he would end 'frivolous litigation from the environmental extremists.' The approach would in many ways strengthen executive branch influence. That power would come more directly from the White House. He would make it easier to fire federal workers by classifying thousands of them as being outside civil service protections. That could weaken the government’s power to enforce statutes and rules by reducing the number of employees engaging in the work and, potentially, impose a chilling effect on those who remain. Trump also claims that presidents have exclusive power to control federal spending even after Congress has appropriated money. Trump argues that lawmakers’ budget actions 'set a ceiling' on spending but not a floor — meaning the president’s constitutional duty to 'faithfully execute the laws' includes discretion on whether to spend the money. This interpretation could set up a court battle with Congress. As a candidate, he also suggested that the Federal Reserve, an independent entity that sets interest rates, should be subject to more presidential power. Though he has not offered details, any such move would represent a momentous change to how the U.S. economic and monetary systems work. Education The federal Department of Education would be targeted for elimination in a second Trump administration. That does not mean that Trump wants Washington out of classrooms. He still proposes, among other maneuvers, using federal funding as leverage to pressure K-12 school systems to abolish tenure and adopt merit pay for teachers and to scrap diversity programs at all levels of education. He calls for pulling federal funding 'for any school or program pushing Critical Race Theory, gender ideology, or other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content on our children.' In higher education, Trump proposes taking over accreditation processes for colleges, a move he describes as his 'secret weapon' against the 'Marxist Maniacs and lunatics' he says control higher education. Trump takes aim at higher education endowments, saying he will collect 'billions and billions of dollars' from schools via 'taxing, fining and suing excessively large private university endowments' at schools that do not comply with his edicts. That almost certainly would end up in protracted legal fights. As in other policy areas, Trump isn’t actually proposing limiting federal power in higher education but strengthening it. He calls for redirecting the confiscated endowment money into an online 'American Academy' offering college credentials to all Americans without a tuition charges. 'It will be strictly non-political, and there will be no wokeness or jihadism allowed—none of that’s going to be allowed,' Trump said on Nov. 1, 2023. Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid Trump insists he would protect Social Security and Medicare, popular programs geared toward older Americans and among the biggest pieces of the federal spending pie each year. There are questions about how his proposal not to tax tip and overtime wages might affect Social Security and Medicare. If such plans eventually involved only income taxes, the entitlement programs would not be affected. But exempting those wages from payroll taxes would reduce the funding stream for Social Security and Medicare outlays. Trump has talked little about Medicaid but his first administration, in general, defaulted to approving state requests for waivers of various federal rules and it broadly endorsed state-level work requirements for recipients. Affordable Care Act and Health Care As he has since 2015, Trump calls for repealing the Affordable Care Act and its subsidized health insurance marketplaces. But he still has not proposed a replacement: In a September debate, he insisted he had the 'concepts of a plan.' In the latter stages of the campaign, Trump played up his alliance with former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime critic of vaccines and of pesticides used in U.S. agriculture. Trump repeatedly told rally crowds that he would put Kennedy in charge of 'making America healthy again.' Climate and energy Trump, who claims falsely that climate change is a 'hoax,' blasts Biden-era spending on cleaner energy designed to reduce U.S. reliance on fossil fuels. He proposes an energy policy – and transportation infrastructure spending – anchored to fossil fuels: roads, bridges and combustion-engine vehicles. 'Drill, baby, drill!' was a regular chant at Trump rallies. Trump says he does not oppose electric vehicles but promises to end all Biden incentives to encourage EV market development. Trump also pledges to roll back Biden-era fuel efficiency standards. Workers’ rights Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance framed their ticket as favoring America’s workers. But Trump could make it harder for workers to unionize. In discussing auto workers, Trump focused almost exclusively on Biden’s push toward electric vehicles. When he mentioned unions, it was often to lump 'the union bosses and CEOs' together as complicit in 'this disastrous electric car scheme.' In an Oct. 23, 2023, statement, Trump said of United Auto Workers, 'I’m telling you, you shouldn’t pay those dues.' National defense and America’s role in the world Trump’s rhetoric and policy approach in world affairs is more isolationist diplomatically, non-interventionist militarily and protectionist economically than the U.S. has been since World War II. But the details are more complicated. He pledges expansion of the military, promises to protect Pentagon spending from austerity efforts and proposes a new missile defense shield — an old idea from the Reagan era during the Cold War. Trump insists he can end Russia’s war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war, without explaining how. Trump summarizes his approach through another Reagan phrase: 'peace through strength.' But he remains critical of NATO and top U.S. military brass. 'I don’t consider them leaders,' Trump said of Pentagon officials that Americans 'see on television.' He repeatedly praised authoritarians like Hungary’s Viktor Orban and Russia’s Vladimir Putin.	https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-wins-second-term-policies-de3dcf0f173b42602b258042fd7aaafb	2024-11-06T03:38:40-08:00	
On Ukraine's front and in Kyiv, hope and pragmatism compete when it comes to Trump's election	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Soldiers in a Ukrainian artillery battery on the front lines of the country’s east were only vaguely aware of American election results pointing to Donald Trump’s victory Wednesday — but firm in their hopes for the next president of the United States. Their entrenched artillery battery fires on Russian forces daily — and takes fire nearly as often. Just the other day, one of their overhead nets snared a Russian drone. 'I hope that the quantity of weapons, the quantity of guns for our victory will increase,' the unit's 39-year-old commander, who goes by the name Mozart, said in the hours before Trump’s win was confirmed. 'We don't care who is the president, as long as they don't cut us off from help, because we need it.' Though Trump's election throws into doubt American support for Ukraine — and ultimately whether Kyiv can beat back Russia's invasion — the soldiers who use their Starlink connection to the internet sparingly learned of the results from Associated Press journalists. Mozart — who like other soldiers Wednesday did not give his name in keeping with Ukrainian military protocol and has given musical monikers to the battlefield positions — is among many Ukrainians who hope that Trump will hold the line on American support for their country. Russian forces have recently made gains in the east, although the commander described the front-line situation as 'static.' It was under Trump that the United States first sent weapons to Ukraine in its fight against Russia, in 2017. Those Javelin anti-tank missiles were crucial to Ukraine's ability to fend off the full-scale invasion in 2022. But Trump overall is wary of U.S. involvement in foreign conflicts. Trump, who has touted his good relationship with President Vladimir Putin and called the Russian leader 'pretty smart' for invading Ukraine, has repeatedly criticized American backing of Ukraine. He characterized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as 'the greatest salesman on Earth' for winning U.S. aid. Zelenskyy was among the first world leaders to publicly congratulate Trump and said the two discussed how to end 'Russian aggression against Ukraine' when they met in September. 'I appreciate President Trump’s commitment to the ‘peace through strength’ approach in global affairs. This is exactly the principle that can practically bring just peace in Ukraine closer. I am hopeful that we will put it into action together,' he wrote on the social platform X. Trump has said repeatedly he would have a peace deal done between Ukraine and Russia within a day if elected, although he has not said how. During his debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, he twice refused to directly answer a question about whether he wanted Ukraine to win — raising concerns that Kyiv would be forced to accept unfavorable terms in any negotiations he oversaw. In Kyiv, which comes under attack from Russian drones near daily, 18-year-old Viktoriia Zubrytska was pragmatic about her expectations for the next American president. She thinks Ukraine will be forced to give up territory in exchange for peace under a Trump presidency. But she said she preferred that to what she called the false hope that the Biden administration offered. 'We will live in a world of facts where we will be certain on what awaits us,' said the law student. 'Certainty and objective truth is much better than lies and life in illusions.' According to VoteCast, 74% of voters who supported Harris favored continuing aid to Ukraine, while only 36% of Trump’s voters did. AP VoteCast is a survey of the American electorate conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago. On the front lines in Ukraine's eastern Kharkiv region, Andriy, who goes by 'Rodych' or 'Relative,' was resigned to the fact that he has no power to influence the American vote. 'We will come up with something' whatever happens, he said. 'We are a shield between Europe and Russia,' he added. 'Other countries do not understand what is happening here, they see it on TV and for them it is far away.' America's NATO allies were also closely watching the election. France and Germany arranged a last-minute, top-level defense meeting Wednesday in Paris to discuss the results, and Ukraine is likely to be central to the meeting. The two leading powers in the European Union provide significant support to Ukraine to defend it against Russia’s war. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, citing a 'more aggressive Russia,' also invoked Trump's motto of 'peace through strength.' Rutte praised Trump for his work during his first term to persuade countries in the alliance to ramp up defense spending. In Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he had no information on whether Putin plans to congratulate Trump but emphasized that Moscow views the U.S. as an 'unfriendly' country. Peskov reaffirmed the Kremlin’s claim that the U.S. support for Ukraine amounted to its involvement in the conflict, telling reporters: 'Let’s not forget that we are talking about, the unfriendly country that is both directly and indirectly involved in a war against our state.' Still, he noted Trump's promise to end the war swiftly once elected. 'The U.S. can help end the conflict,' Peskov said, adding that 'it certainly can’t be done overnight.' ___ Konovalov reported from the Kharkiv region.

Rescuers pull 30 bodies from a building in central Lebanon hit in an Israeli strike	BARJA, Lebanon (AP) — Lebanese rescuers pulled 30 bodies out of the rubble after a late night Israeli strike on an apartment building in the town of Barja, Lebanon’s Civil Defense service said Wednesday as the Mideast wars press on with no signs of abating. It remained unclear if there were any survivors or bodies still trapped under the rubble following the Tuesday night airstrike, which came without warning. There was no statement from the Israeli military and the strike's intended target also was unknown. Barja, a town just north of the port city of Sidon in central Lebanon, has not been regularly targeted so far in the conflict. 'Something pulled me hard, and then the explosion happened,' said Moussa Zahran, who was at home with his wife and son when the building was hit. He said he couldn't see but started digging through the rubble until he found his wife and son — alive but injured — and pulled them out. Both are still in the hospital, he said. Another building resident, Muhyiddin Al- Qalaaji, said he was at work when the strike happened and heard the news from his wife who called him frantically. 'There are many dead and injured,' he said as he carried out what he could salvage of the family's belongings on Wednesday morning. Civil defense official Mostafa Danaj said some of the neighbors have reported there are still people missing. Israeli forces and the Hezbollah militant group have been clashing for more than a year, since Hezbollah started firing rockets across the border soon after the Palestinian Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack from Gaza into southern Israel sparked the ongoing war there. The war on the Lebanese front has substantially escalated since mid-September, with Israel launching a massive aerial bombardment and ground invasion. On Wednesday, sirens blared across northern and central Israel, including in the populous metropolitan area of Tel Aviv, as Hezbollah launched 10 rockets. There were no reports of injuries. A large portion of a rocket slammed into a parked car in the central Israeli city of Raanana. Rockets also struck an open area near Israel’s main airport, Israeli media reported, though the airport said flights were operating as normally. On Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed Defense Minister Yoav Gallant in a surprise announcement that sparked protests across the country. Gallant’s replacement is Foreign Minister Israel Katz, a longtime Netanyahu loyalist and veteran Cabinet minister. Israeli police said they arrested 40 people during protests on Tuesday night when the demonstrators blocked Israel’s main highway in Tel Aviv. Another night of protests over Gallant’s firing was planned across Israel on Wednesday evening. Netanyahu and Gallant have repeatedly been at odds over the war in Gaza but the prime minister had avoided letting go of his rival before the U.S. presidential election on Tuesday, in which former President Donald Trump made a comeback victory. Gallant had pushed back on some of Netanyahu's demands during indirect negotiations with Hamas over a cease-fire and hostage release, and was seen as more open to reaching at least a temporary truce. The Hamas attack that triggered the war killed some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and Palestinian militants abducted 250 others that day. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, around a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s offensive has killed more than 43,000 people, Palestinian health officials say. They do not distinguish between civilians and combatants, but say more than half of those killed were women and children. Since the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah erupted in 2023, at least 3,000 people have been killed and some 13,500 have been wounded in Lebanon, about a quarter of them women and children, the Health Ministry reported. Hezbollah continues to send dozens of rockets and drones towards Israel. The projectiles have killed 72 people in Israel so far, including 30 soldiers, according to Netanyahu’s office. ___ Associated Press writers Abby Sewell in Beirut and Melanie Lidman in Tel Aviv, Israel, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-lebanon-hezbollah-iran-11-06-2024-75daf6b9a4214ff64de58a4314b00e5b	2024-11-06T02:16:46-08:00	
Global leaders congratulate Trump but his victory looks set to roil the world -- again	LONDON (AP) — The verdict of U.S. voters was more decisive than most pollsters and pundits had predicted. Now the world waits to see whether the election of Donald Trump as president for a second time will prove as destabilizing as many American allies fear. Trump secured victory Wednesday when he surpassed the 270 electoral college votes needed to win. In a victory speech before the official declaration, he vowed to 'put our country first' and bring about a 'golden age' for America. Trump’s first term saw him insult and alienate many of the United States’ longstanding allies. His return to the White House, four years after losing office to President Joe Biden, has huge consequences for everything from global trade to climate change to multiple crises and conflicts around the world. Trump has pledged to ramp up a tariff feud with China, the United States’ growing economic and strategic rival. In the Middle East, Trump has pledged, without saying how, to end the conflicts between Israel, Hamas and Hezbollah. He has also vowed to end the Russia-Ukraine war within 24 hours of taking office – something Ukraine and its supporters fear would be on terms favorable to Moscow. Here’s how leaders and others around the world are reacting: NATO is nervous and Ukraine is anxious NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte congratulated Trump, saying, 'I look forward to working with him again to advance peace through strength through NATO' in the face of 'a growing number of challenges globally,' including 'the increasing alignment of China, Russia, North Korea and Iran.' Trump was a strong critic of the North Atlantic military alliance during his first term, accusing its other members of failing to pull their weight. Earlier this year he said the United States would not defend NATO members that don’t meet defense spending targets. Rutte emphasized the positive, praising Trump for his work persuading member states to ramp up defense spending and saying NATO was now 'stronger, larger, and more united.' America’s allies are — belatedly, some say — grappling with what to do if they cannot depend on the U.S. for their defense. 'The existential concern for Europeans has been what happens to Ukraine, what happens to Europe’s security, what happens to America’s commitment to NATO?' said Leslie Vinjamuri, director of the U.S. and Americas program at the think tank Chatham House. 'Will America be there for Europe?' The U.S. is by far Kyiv’s biggest military backer as it battles Russian invasion, though the Biden administration resisted pressure from President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to do even more. Zelenskyy, like Rutte, said he welcomed Trump’s 'peace through strength' approach. 'This is exactly the principle that can practically bring just peace in Ukraine closer,' Zelenskyy wrote on social media. 'I am hopeful that we will put it into action together. We look forward to an era of a strong United States of America under President Trump’s decisive leadership.' No congratulations were forthcoming from Moscow, where President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, declared that Russia-U.S. relations were at the 'lowest point in history.' European congratulations mask deep divisions European leaders rushed to congratulate Trump even before his victory was officially declared — some more effusively than others. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer called it a 'historic election victory' and said that 'as the closest of allies, the U.K. and U.S. will continue to work together to protect our shared values of freedom and democracy.' Like governments of U.S. allies around the world, Starmer’s center-left administration has worked hard to forge ties with Trump and his team. Starmer had dinner with Trump at Trump Tower in September. France’s centrist President Emmanuel Macron offered congratulations, 'respect and ambition.' Social Democratic German Chancellor Olaf Scholz congratulated Trump and said he wanted continued close ties, even if 'surely many things will be different under a Donald Trump-led administration.' Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, whose far right-led government is in some ways close to Trump politically, said Italy and the U.S. had a 'strategic bond, which I am sure we will now strengthen even more.' European leaders are keen to stress that the transatlantic relationship transcends individual politicians, but Trump’s protectionist economic leanings are causing concern. During his last term he slapped tariffs on European steel and aluminum, roiling the bloc’s economy. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stressed that the EU and the U.S. 'are bound by a true partnership between our people, uniting 800 million citizens. Let us work together on a transatlantic partnership that continues to deliver for our citizens.' Europe’s populist politicians, meanwhile, welcomed the victory of a politician they consider a kindred spirit. 'They threatened him with prison, they took his property, they wanted to kill him ... and he still won,' said Hungary’s nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, who will hold a summit in Budapest for some 50 European leaders on Thursday. A Middle East in turmoil awaits Trump’s moves During his first term, Trump pushed to remake the Middle East by reconciling Israel and Saudi Arabia, and all eyes now are on how he intervenes in the region’s raging conflicts between Israel and Hamas in Gaza and Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon — and the chief backer of the two militant groups, Iran. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Trump’s election win 'history’s greatest comeback.' 'Your historic return to the White House offers a new beginning for America and a powerful recommitment to the great alliance between Israel and America. This is a huge victory!' he wrote on social media. Trump and Netanyahu — a fellow conservative nationalist — had a tight relationship during the former president’s first term, but the ties soured when Netanyahu congratulated President Joe Biden on winning in 2020. Netanyahu’s inner circle hopes Trump will allow Israel free rein against its enemies, but the president-elect is famously unpredictable, and the Israeli leader faces strong opposition at home. On Tuesday he fired popular Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, a surprise announcement that sparked protests across the country. Hamas issued a terse statement saying, 'Our position on the new U.S. administration depends on its positions and practical behavior towards our Palestinian people, their legitimate rights and their just cause.' Washington is one of the key mediators of so-far unsuccessful Gaza cease-fire talks and has publicly accused Hamas of turning down several deals. Hamas has denied this, blaming Israel for demanding last-minute changes to the proposals. The challenge of China still looms The Chinese government said its approach to the U.S. was unchanged by Trump's victory. 'We will continue to view and handle China-U.S. relations in accordance with the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and cooperation for win-win,' said foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning. But analysts in China were pessimistic, citing the likelihood of escalating tariffs and an intensifying confrontation over Taiwan. 'It is not all dark, but there are more challenges than opportunities,' said Da Wei, director of the Center for International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University in Beijing. 'We are clear about the challenges. As for opportunities, we are yet to see them clearly.' Long-seething territorial disputes in the South China Sea are a fault line in the U.S.-China rivalry in Asia and likely will remain a major foreign policy concern for the next American president. Phillips O’Brien, professor of strategic studies at the University of St. Andrews, said Washington's allies in the Indo-Pacific, including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and even Australia, 'can no longer look for the U.S.A. to be a reliable partner in defense.' Asian leaders apprehensive about China’s growing clout and North Korea's nuclear program, clamored for Trump’s attention in congratulatory messages. 'I hope to closely cooperate with President-elect Trump to further elevate Japan-U.S. alliance and relations to even higher levels,' Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said the Korea-U.S. alliance 'will shine brighter,' under Trump's 'strong leadership.' Neighbors hope for good relations The United States’ neighbors in the Americas, some of whom bore the impact of Trump's protectionist instincts during his first term, also braced for uncertainty. Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum told Mexicans 'there is no reason to worry,' despite Trump’s previous threats to impose trade tariffs on Mexican products unless the country does more to stem the flow of migrants and drugs to the U.S. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau — previously derided by Trump as 'weak' and 'dishonest' — wrote on X: 'The friendship between Canada and the U.S. is the envy of the world. I know President Trump and I will work together to create more opportunity, prosperity, and security for both of our nations.' ___ Associated Press writers around the world contributed to this story.	https://apnews.com/article/us-election-trump-global-reaction-7f7d4c5f6b84f263d7c49bb4978ab418	2024-11-06T01:53:29-08:00	
Germany's quarrelsome government meets in last-minute effort to find solution for its ailing economy	BERLIN (AP) — The leaders of Germany’s quarrelsome governing coalition are meeting again on Wednesday in another last-minute effort to find a joint solution to fix the country's struggling economy. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz of the center-left Social Democrats, Finance Minister Christian Lindner of the pro-business Free Democrats and Economy Minister Robert Habeck of the environmentalist Greens want to boost the economy but are at odds over how to do it. A meeting of the coalition committee later Wednesday will focus on how the billion-euro hole in the 2025 budget can be plugged and how the German economy can be put back on track. However, they disagree fundamentally over how to kickstart the economy again, and after weeks of government infighting many Germans wonder if the current government will actually survive the coming 11 months before the next election is due. Uncoordinated summit meetings and differing proposals by the leaders have fueled the conflict among the coalition partners. If the leaders fail to reach an agreement later on Wednesday, the government could be on the brink of collapse. Scholz appealed to all coalition partners to find a solution and prioritize the country over different party convictions. 'As far as the situation of the government’s further work is concerned, it is about feeling committed to the country, not about ideology,' he said Tuesday in Berlin. 'And it is clear that we can. In this respect, the question is not whether it can be done at all, but whether it is possible, and everyone has to work on that now.' The Free Democrats have pushed for changes in the country's economic policy, some of which Lindner expressed in an 18-page paper last week that was leaked to the media. The party categorically rejects tax increases or changes to Germany’s strict self-imposed limits on running up debt, and say it’s time to save money — for example, on benefits for the long-term unemployed. Politicians on the left want to see massive state investment and reject talk of cutting welfare programs and many other ideas Lindner proposed in his paper last week. Germany's economy is expected to shrink in 2024 for the second year in a row, or at best stagnate, battered by external shocks and home-grown problems including red tape and a shortage of skilled labor.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-scholz-government-struggling-economy-coalition-lindner-1cae2cd0266453103fc89800e47e7ce7	2024-11-06T00:47:27-08:00	
Russia ratifies North Korea pact after US says up to 10,000 North Korean troops deployed to Kursk	MOSCOW (AP) — The upper house of Russian parliament on Wednesday ratified a treaty with North Korea envisioning mutual military assistance, a move that comes as the U.S. has confirmed the deployment of 10,000 North Korean troops to Russia. The 'comprehensive strategic partnership treaty,' which Russian President Vladimir Putin signed with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on a visit to Pyongyang in June, obliges Russia and North Korea to immediately provide military assistance using 'all means' if either is attacked. It marked the strongest link between Moscow and Pyongyang since the end of the Cold War. The pact's endorsement by the upper house, the Federation Council, follows its ratification by the lower house, the State Duma, on Oct. 24. On Monday, U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters that up to 10,000 North Korean soldiers were in Russia’s Kursk region and were preparing to join Moscow’s fight against Ukraine in the coming days. If they engage in combat, it would be North Korea’s first participation in a large-scale conflict since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War. Moscow and Pyongyang have responded vaguely to South Korean and Western claims of the North Korean troop deployment to Russia, emphasizing that their military cooperation conforms with international law, without directly admitting the presence of the North’s forces in Russia. On Monday, Putin met with North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui, who was on an official visit to Russia since late last week. During her talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, Choe reiterated Pyongyang’s support 'for the just fight of Russia’s military and people to defend their country’s sovereign rights and security interests' in Ukraine. Russia and North Korea have previously rejected assertions by the U.S. and its allies that Pyongyang has given Moscow ballistic missiles and millions of artillery shells for use in Ukraine. South Korean and Western officials voiced concerns about Russia’s possible transfer of technology to North Korea to enhance its nuclear and missile programs in exchange for its troops. On Tuesday, North Korea fired a barrage of short-range ballistic missiles into the sea in a demonstration of its military capability hours before the U.S. presidential election.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-north-korea-treaty-ratification-ukraine-fighting-bcf2a2ac3a45560e90fce586b010e05c	2024-11-06T00:26:32-08:00	
Middle East latest: Rescue workers pull 30 bodies from apartments in Lebanon after Israeli strike	Lebanon’s Civil Defense service says they have pulled 30 bodies from the rubble of an apartment building that Israel struck the night before. Search efforts were ongoing Wednesday, and it was unclear how many survivors or bodies were still trapped under the rubble. The airstrike Tuesday night came without warning. There was no statement from the Israeli military on the strike, and it was not immediately clear what the intended target was. On Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed Defense Minister Yoav Gallant in a surprise announcement that sparked protests across the country. Gallant’s replacement is Foreign Minister Israel Katz, a longtime Netanyahu loyalist and veteran Cabinet minister. While Netanyahu has called for continued military pressure on Hamas, Gallant said military force created the necessary conditions for at least a temporary diplomatic deal that could bring home hostages held by the militant group. The Israel-Hamas war began after Palestinian militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. Israel's military response in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 people, Palestinian health officials say. They do not distinguish between civilians and combatants, but say more than half of those killed were women and children. Since the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah erupted in 2023, at least 3,000 people have been killed and some 13,500 wounded in Lebanon, the Health Ministry reported. A report by Lebanon’s crisis response unit said 361,300 Syrians and over 177,800 Lebanese crossed into Syria between Sept. 23 and Nov. 1. ___ Here’s the latest: Hezbollah leader says group is not concerned with results of US election BEIRUT — Hezbollah’s leader Naim Kassem said in a speech aired Wednesday the Lebanese militant group 'is not basing its expectations on the results of the American elections.' 'We will make the enemy seek to demand an end to the aggression,' Kassem said, speaking from an undisclosed location in a pre-recorded televised address. 'Our military capabilities are available for a long time, and we do not rely on the results of the American elections.' His speech marked the 40-day mourning period since former Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah was assassinated in Beirut. 'Whether Harris wins or Trump wins, they have no value to us,' Kassem said. He said that Hezbollah is open for cease-fire negotiations only once 'the enemy stops its aggression.' 'The only thing that will stop the war is the battlefield,' he said. U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein visited Israel nearly a week ago, raising hopes for an imminent cease-fire between Hezbollah and Israel. However, he immediately returned to the U.S. without traveling to Lebanon, which many saw as a sign of a setback. As Kassem spoke, the Israeli army issued evacuation warnings for three buildings in Burj al-Barajneh, a district in Beirut’s southern suburbs with a strong Hezbollah presence. Since the hostilities escalation, the suburb has faced repeated Israeli strikes, which have leveled hundreds of buildings. Hezbollah rockets target Israel, reaching as far as Tel Aviv and central city of Raanana JERUSALEM — Sirens blared across northern and central Israel on Wednesday, including in the populous metropolitan area of Tel Aviv, as Hezbollah launched 10 rockets towards Israel. Israel’s Magen David Adom rescue services said there were no reports of injuries. A large portion of a rocket slammed into a parked car in the central Israeli city of Raanana. Rockets also struck an open area near Israel’s main airport, Israeli media reported, though the airport said flights were operating as normally. Israel’s Magen David Adom rescue services said there were no injuries. Israeli police said they arrested 40 people during protests on Tuesday night when the demonstrators blocked Israel’s main highway in Tel Aviv. The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah continues to send dozens of rockets and drones towards Israel. The projectiles have killed 72 people in Israel so far, including 30 soldiers, according to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office. 30 bodies are pulled from the rubble of a Lebanon apartment building struck by Israel BEIRUT — Lebanon’s Civil Defense service said Wednesday they have pulled 30 bodies and remains out of the rubble of an apartment building in the town of Barja that Israel struck the night before. Search efforts were ongoing. The airstrike Tuesday hit an area that had not been regularly targeted by Israeli military operations. It came without warning. There was no statement from the Israeli military on the strike, and it was not immediately clear what the intended target was. Civil defense official Mostafa Danaj said it was unclear how many survivors or bodies were still trapped under the rubble. 'We hope that there isn’t anyone else, but the neighbors have said that there are still people (missing),' he said. Israeli forces and the Hezbollah militant group have been clashing for more than a year, since Hezbollah started firing rockets across the border on Oct. 8, 2023 — a day after the deadly Hamas-led incursion into southern Israel sparked the war in Gaza. The war on the Lebanese front has substantially escalated since mid-September, with Israel launching a massive aerial bombardment of much of Lebanon and a ground invasion. More than 3,000 people have been killed by Israeli strikes in Lebanon, the vast majority of them since Sept. 23. Israel has said it targets Hezbollah militants and weapons caches, but hundreds of civilians have also been killed. ___ For more Middle East news: https://apnews.com/hub/middle-east	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-hezbollah-mideast-latest-6-november-2024-64bae4547ba0dca7042cf87d32e55cc1	2024-11-06T00:25:12-08:00	
Iran's currency falls to an all-time low as Trump is on the verge of clinching the US presidency	TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iran’s currency fell on Wednesday to an all-time low as former President Donald Trump was on the verge of clinching the U.S. presidency again, signaling new challenges ahead for Tehran as it remains locked in the wars raging in the Middle East. The rial traded at 703,000 rials to the dollar, traders in Tehran said. The rate could still change throughout the day. Iran’s Central Bank could flood the market with more hard currencies as an attempt to improve the rate, as it has done in the past. The slide comes as the rial already faces considerable woes over its sharp slide in value. In 2015, at the time of Iran's nuclear deal with world powers, the rial was at 32,000 to $1. On July 30, the day that Iran's reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian was sworn in and started his term, the rate was 584,000 to $1. Trump unilaterally withdrew America from the accord in 2018, sparking years of tensions between the countries that persist today. Iran's economy has struggled for years under crippling international sanctions over its rapidly advancing nuclear program, which now enriches uranium at near weapons-grade levels. Pezeshkian, elected after a helicopter crash killed hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi in May, came to power on a promise to reach a deal to ease Western sanctions. However, Iran's government has for weeks been trying to downplay the effect on Tehran of whoever won Tuesday's election in the United States. That stance continued on Wednesday with a brief comment from Fatemeh Mohajerani, a spokeswoman for Pezeshkian's administration. 'The election of the U.S. president doesn't have anything specifically to do with us,' she said. 'The major policies of America and the Islamic Republic are fixed, and they won’t heavily change by people replacing others. We have already made necessary preparations in advance.' But tensions remain high between the nations, 45 years after the 1979 U.S. Embassy takeover and 444-day hostage crisis that followed. Iran remains locked in the Mideast wars roiling the region, with its allies battered — militant groups and fighters of its self-described 'Axis of Resistance,' including the militant Palestinian Hamas, lebanon's Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthi rebels. Israel is pressing its war in the Gaza Strip targeting Hamas and its invasion of Lebanon amid devastating attacks against Hezbollah. At the same time, Iran still appears to be assessing damage from Israel’s strikes on the Islamic Republic on Oct. 26 in response to two Iranian ballistic missile attacks. Iran has threatened to retaliate against Israel — where U.S. troops now man a missile defense battery. ___ Associated Press writer Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-us-election-rial-currency-falls-b9cd891cfb864f51c5c3f2a7735804fc	2024-11-05T23:30:39-08:00	
Australian High Court overturns law that forced scores of migrants to wear tracking bracelets	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Australia’s highest court ruled Wednesday that migrants can’t be forced by law to wear electronic tracking bracelets or to comply with curfews. The ruling is a blow to the government, whose lawyers have unsuccessfully argued that laws imposing curfews and tracking technology are justified to protect the community. Five of the seven High Court judges ruled that the tough restrictions placed on more than 100 migrants, usually because of their criminal records, were unconstitutional because the conditions amounted to punishment. The constitution states that punishment must be imposed by judges, not lawmakers. The restrictions were part of emergency laws hastily passed in December in response to another High Court ruling that non-citizens could no longer be detained indefinitely as an alternative to deportation. That ruling in the case of a stateless Rohingya man reversed a 28-year-old High Court precedent that allowed indefinite detention where there were security concerns. Wednesday's ruling means the government can no longer electronically track the more than 200 non-citizens with criminal records who were released and, for a variety of reasons, couldn’t be deported. Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said he would introduce legislation to Parliament on Thursday that 'will allow for an adjusted process for electronic monitoring devices and curfews to be used.' He did not detail those adjustments. 'The court’s decision is not the one the government wanted — but it is one the government has prepared for,' Burke said in a statement. 'The security and safety of the Australian community will always be the absolute priority for this government,' he added. The latest High Court case was brought by a 36-year-old stateless man, identified as YBFZ, who was born in Eritrea. His family initially fled to Ethiopia because they feared persecution in their homeland as Jehovah’s Witnesses, and they arrived in Australia as refugees in 2002. His refugee visa was canceled in 2017 due to convictions including burglary and recklessly causing injury, part of a criminal record that extended for more than a decade. He was held in custody until 2023, when the High Court outlawed indefinite detention. YBFZ’s lawyer, David Manne, described Wednesday’s verdict as a 'major victory' for fundamental freedoms and the rule of law in Australia. 'This is an important ruling because it underscores the bedrock principle that for everyone, whether citizen or non-citizen, the government does not have the power to punish people by stripping them of their fundamental rights to freedom and dignity,' Manne told reporters. Opposition lawmakers described the High Court decision as an 'embarrassing loss' for the government. 'The effect of this decision will be that 215 dangerous non-citizen offenders including 12 murderers, 66 sex offenders, 97 people convicted of assault, 15 domestic violence perpetrators and others will be free in the community without any monitoring or curfews,' an opposition statement said.	https://apnews.com/article/australia-bracelets-law-overturned-curfews-migrants-69e8b7860fe7da12d98f476e7222f141	2024-11-05T21:30:33-08:00	
The Latest: Trump inches towards a victory, GOP reclaims Senate majority	Republican Donald Trump has won Pennsylvania, Georgia and North Carolina, capturing three of the seven heavily contested battlegrounds and coming within a few electoral votes of winning the presidency. Republicans reclaimed control of the Senate, picking up seats in West Virginia and Ohio. Top House races are focused in New York and California, where Democrats are trying to claw back some of the 10 or so seats where Republicans have made surprising gains in recent years. Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: Race to control the House intensifies with Michigan flip Republicans have flipped a House seat that was previously held by Democrats, giving them a valuable pickup in a frenzied race for House control. At this point, practically every seat matters when it comes to building a House majority. In Michigan’s 7th district, Republican Tom Barrett picked up a seat that Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin vacated to run for U.S. Senate. Barrett, a former state senator, defeated another former state lawmaker, Democrat Curtis Hertel. On the campaign trail, Barrett didn’t back away from his record of supporting abortion restrictions in the statehouse, but he also described abortion access as a settled issue in Michigan. Zelenskyy says he appreciates Trump’s ‘peace through strength’ mentality Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he appreciates Trump’s commitment to 'peace through strength' as the Republican presidential nominee closes in on the electoral votes needed to win the White House. 'I recall our great meeting with President Trump back in September, when we discussed in detail the Ukraine-U.S. strategic partnership, the Victory Plan, and ways to put an end to Russian aggression against Ukraine,' said Zelenskyy on X. Zelenskyy said that Ukraine is interested 'in developing mutually beneficial political and economic cooperation that will benefit both of our nations.' 'We look forward to an era of a strong United States of America under President Trump’s decisive leadership,' said Zelenskyy. 'I appreciate President Trump’s commitment to the ‘peace through strength’ approach in global affairs. This is exactly the principle that can practically bring just peace in Ukraine closer. I am hopeful that we will put it into action together,' he said. European Commission president says she’s looking forward to working with Trump The European Union’s top official says she’s looking forward to working with Trump again as the former president is on the cusp of victory in the U.S. presidential race. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that the E.U. and U.S. 'are more than just allies. We are bound by a true partnership between our people, uniting 800 million citizens.' 'Let us work together on a transatlantic partnership that continues to deliver for our citizens. Millions of jobs and billions in trade and investment on each side of the Atlantic depend on the dynamism and stability of our economic relationship,' she said in a statement. The tariffs that Trump slapped on steel and aluminum exports during his last term roiled the bloc’s economy. NATO leader looks forward to working with Trump NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte says he looks forward to working with Trump 'to advance peace through strength' as the former president closes in on the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House. 'We face a growing number of challenges globally, from a more aggressive Russia, to terrorism, to strategic competition with China, as well the increasing alignment of China, Russia, North Korea and Iran,' Rutte said. 'Working together through NATO helps to deter aggression, protect our collective security and support our economies,' he added. Rutte also praised Trump for his work during his first term to persuade U.S. allies in NATO to ramp up defense spending. He noted that around two-thirds of the 32 NATO allies are due to meet the organization’s main defense spending target this year. World leaders offer their congratulations to Trump The AP’s current count has Trump three electoral votes shy of winning the White House, though he is leading in key battleground states. 'Congratulations on history’s greatest comeback!' wrote Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on X. 'Your historic return to the White House offers a new beginning for America and a powerful recommitment to the great alliance between Israel and America.' French President Emmanuel Macron posted on X: 'Ready to work together as we were able to do during four years. With your convictions and mine. In respect and ambition. For more peace and prosperity.' Trump, a longtime source of division, calls on country to unite in election night speech Trump, someone whose political career has been defined by division and acrimony, told the audience at his election night party early on Wednesday that it was 'time to unite' as a country. 'It’s time to put the divisions of the past four years behind us,' Trump said. 'It’s time to unite.' 'We have to put our country first for at least a period of time,' he added. 'We have to fix it.' Trump speaks at election party flanked by family, friends and top political supporters Most of the important people in Trump’s personal and political life have joined him on stage in West Palm Beach, Florida. Former first lady Melania Trump stood near her husband and was joined by Barron, the former president’s youngest son. Trump’s older children, Don Jr., Eric, Ivanka and Tiffany, all joined their father on stage, too. Trump’s top political minds, including top campaign advisers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, joined Trump on stage. And his political allies were on stage, too, including House Speaker Mike Johnson. Trump also celebrated a few celebrities in the audience and on stage. Dana White, the CEO of UFC, was on stage with Trump, and the former president called golfer Bryson DeChambeau on stage. Trump also shouted out Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of X, who has become one of his most high-profile supporters. 'We have a new star. A star is born: Elon,' Trump said. Trump hails GOP’s congressional wins Donald Trump made sure to recognize GOP wins in down ballot races in his speech in the early morning Wednesday. 'The number of victories in the senate was absolutely incredible,' Trump said. Republicans have so far won 51 seats, giving them a majority. But Montana, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Nevada have not been called, and it’s possible Republicans could pick up more seats. Trump also said he expected Republicans to hold the House and complimented House Speaker Mike Johnson. The House, however, is still up for grabs. There are over 70 House races across the country that have not been called, and neither party has a convincing edge in the tally of House races. Trump vows in his election night speech to fight ‘for your family and your future’ He promised that he would 'not rest until we have delivered the strong safe and prosperous America.' 'Every single day,' Trump said, 'I will be fighting for you with every breath in my body.' Donald Trump has taken the stage The AP’s current count has him at 267 of the 270 electoral votes he needs to win the White House. He is leading in key races left to be called, including Michigan and Wisconsin. Pennsylvania puts Trump three electoral votes short of the presidential threshold Trump’s victory in Pennsylvania has put him three electoral votes short of winning the presidency. He could win the White House by capturing Alaska or any remaining swing state. Hugs, calls and celebration at Trump’s watch party Trump supporters gathered at his election night watch party were hugging one another, making calls, jumping up and down, and throwing their MAGA hats in the air every chance they got to celebrate as results continued to trickle in. Guests are still arriving at the convention center in West Palm Beach. Democrats flip another House seat in New York The pickups for House Democrats have mostly come from New York so far as the party flipped its second seat in the state. Democrat Josh Riley defeated Republican Rep. Mark Molinaro in a district that spans across the center of the state. Democrats earlier flipped a seat held by Rep. Brandon Williams. While a House majority is still up for grabs, the victories will buoy Democrats’ hopes, especially in House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries’ home state. Nevada polls close nearly 3 hours later Polls closed in Nevada nearly three hours late after voters waited in long lines to cast ballots, the state’s top election official said, and initial election results began to be posted just before 10 p.m. PST. Polls had been scheduled to close at 7 p.m., but state law allows anyone in line at that time to cast a ballot. Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar acknowledged Nevada’s position as an electoral battleground and promised to keep updating results as the counties receive 'and cure' additional ballots. Mailed ballots are accepted and counted until Saturday, and thousands of voters whose ballots were set aside to allow for signature verification, or 'curing,' have until 5 p.m. Nov. 12 to validate their vote with election officials. Aguilar, a Democrat, called Nevada’s elections 'safe, secure and transparent' and said he was proud of reports of high voter turnout. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. joins Trump watch party The former presidential candidate has arrived at the Palm Beach Convention Center, entering and walking briskly as he made his way near the stage among crowds of supporters. Trump has said he will play a role when it comes to health policy but has not specified what that would be. Kennedy, who launched his own presidential bid as an independent before dropping out of the race and endorsing Trump, joined him at several rallies in the last stretch of the campaign. Republicans celebrate early turnout among Black and Hispanic voters As the election stretched into the early hours of Wednesday, Republicans — seeing a map trending positively for their party — began to point to a shift in demographic support among key voting groups who often lean Democrat. Preliminary AP VoteCast data suggested a shift among Black and Latino voters, who appeared slightly less likely to support Harris than they were to back Biden four years ago. About 8 in 10 Black voters backed Harris, down from the roughly 9 in 10 who backed Biden. More than half of Hispanic voters supported Harris, but that was down slightly from the roughly 6 in 10 who backed Biden in 2020. Trump’s support among those groups appeared to rise slightly compared to 2020. Republican Sen. Marco Rubio told AP at Trump’s election watch party in West Palm Beach, Florida, that he’s excited for the exit polling in states like Pennsylvania and Georgia, where Republicans are already seeing overperformance compared to this time in the election in 2020. 'I’m just really excited not just because I think it’s going to be a victory but about how we won,' the Florida lawmaker said. There are serious 2016 echoes in Harris’ 2024 election night Forgive Democrats if they are having a bit of déjà vu. There are noticeable similarities between then-Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s election night in 2016 and the one that Harris had planned for tonight at Howard University. Neither Clinton nor Harris, appeared at their election night party, despite both heading into Election Day believing they were about to defeat Donald Trump. Both sent top aides to inform the demoralized audience that the woman would not speak. And there were noticeable similarities between what each man said. 'We still have votes to count. We still have states that have not been called yet. We will continue overnight to fight to make sure that every vote is counted,' Cedric Richmond, Harris’ campaign co-chair, told the audience Tuesday. 'So you won’t hear from the vice president tonight, but you will hear from her tomorrow.' 'We’re still counting votes,' John Podesta, Clinton’s campaign chairman, said in 2016. 'And every vote should count. Several states are too close to call. So we’re not going to have anything more to say tonight.' Even the mood of the events — and the trajectory they took over the course of the night — was similar. The vibe at Clinton’s event at Javits Center started jubilantly, with people dancing, smiling and eager to make history — the campaign had even planned to launch reflective confetti in the air when Clinton won to resemble a glass ceiling shattering. The same was true for Harris, with the event resembling a dance party on the campus of the Democrat’s alma mater. By the time Podesta and Richmond had taken the stage, the party had stopped, people had left, and those who remained looked forlorn. Harris’ path to the White House is growing less forgiving Harris still has a path to the White House through the Northern battleground states, but the map is getting less forgiving. Harris’ campaign has long said her surest way to 270 electoral votes was through Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, states Trump won in 2016 and Biden captured narrowly in 2020. Harris cannot lose Pennsylvania and reach 270 electoral votes. However, she can lose pieces of the blue wall — so named for its longtime reputation as a Democratic firewall — and still reach 270. If she loses Michigan, she can make it up by winning Arizona and Nevada. She can lose Wisconsin and make up for it with Arizona. But the map has surely shrunk for Harris, who cannot lose more than one in the three-state northern arc. Trump campaign comments on Harris’ watch party mood A Trump campaign spokesperson is weighing in as the mood has shifted over at Harris’ watch party. 'Sounds like the joy has left the building,' posted Karoline Leavitt, a campaign spokeswoman on X. The Harris campaign turned off its projected CNN broadcasts at its election night watch party at Howard University as midnight approached. And some Harris supporters began leaving the event. Harris’ Howard party cuts CNN, resumes music as tough race calls roll in As midnight approached on the East Coast, the Harris campaign turned off its projected broadcasts of CNN at its election night watch party at Howard University. Instead, various high-energy remixes blared from speakers alongside floodlights flickering in tempo to hype the crowd. The cheers in the crowd had become less frequent as more results came in from battleground states showing a tight race or victories for Trump. Some attendees began leaving the event though the vast majority of rallygoers remained. It is unclear if Harris will make an appearance at her alma mater. Melania Trump shows image of her son Barron voting 'Voted for the first time - for his dad,' she shared on X. Barron Trump turned 18 years old in March and began his freshman year at New York University this fall. Republicans secure Senate control The GOP has won control of the Senate as Sen. Deb Fischer secures reelection in Nebraska. With at least 51 Senate seats secured, Republicans will retake control of the chamber for the first time in four years. It gives the party a major power center in Washington and important power in confirming the next president’s Cabinet, as well as any Supreme Court justice if there is a vacancy. With a handful of battleground races yet to be decided, Republicans still have an opportunity to grow their majority. GOP senators have already been looking at ways to extend tax cuts that were passed during Donald Trump’s first term, as well as sending funding towards toughened border security measures. However, the extent of Republicans’ power in Washington will also be determined by the results of the presidential and House races. Rashida Tlaib wins reelection in Michigan House race Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., the only Palestinian American in Congress, has won a fourth term in the House. Tlaib represents a district with a large Arab-American population. She has been highly critical of Israel in its war against Hamas, describing its actions in Gaza as genocide. But her comments have also evoked outrage from many of her colleagues. The Republican-led House voted last year to censure her for her statements regarding the war. Tlaib said her criticism was directed toward Israel’s government and its leadership under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and vowed she 'will not be silenced.' Sen. Ted Cruz calls victory in Texas a mandate for tougher border measures Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas says he considers his reelection victory over Democratic U.S. Rep. Colin Allred a mandate for stronger enforcement along the U.S.-Mexico border. During a victory speech in front of supporters in his hometown of Houston, Cruz praised strong support from Hispanic voters. He singled out South Texas, where Cruz was performing much better in large border counties than he did during a narrow victory in 2018 over Beto O’Rourke. 'Tonight we are witnessing incredible results, especially with Hispanics across the state of Texas,' Cruz told the crowd. 'And we are seeing tonight generational change in South Texas. The results tonight, this decisive victory should shake the Democratic establishment to its core.' Last poll closures Polls will close at midnight EST in Alaska and Hawaii. Ohio sends its first Latino to U.S. Senate Bernie Moreno will be the first Latino that Ohio has sent to the U.S. Senate, thanks to his victory over Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown. Moreno was born in Bogota, Colombia. He moved with his family to the United States at age 5 and became an American citizen when he was 18. He built his fortune as a luxury car dealer and blockchain entrepreneur and will come to the Senate as one of its wealthiest members. Daughter fills in late mother’s congressional seat The daughter of late Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee won a special election Tuesday night to finish her mother’s congressional term. Erica Lee Carter defeated two Republican challengers in the race for the Houston-area district where her mother served for almost 30 years. Jackson Lee died in July at age 74 after a battle with pancreatic cancer. Her funeral was filled with high profile mourners, including Vice President Harris who gave Jackson Lee’s eulogy just days after declaring her candidacy for president. Republicans gain steam towards Senate control The GOP’s victory in the Ohio Senate race puts them on track to gain a Senate majority as long as they keep their seats in Texas and Nebraska. In Ohio, Republican Bernie Moreno defeated three-term Sen. Sherrod Brown. The long-serving Ohio Democrat had tried to appeal to working-class voters and make access to abortion a top priority, but Moreno, a Cleveland businessman, cast Brown as too liberal for the conservative state, tying the long-serving Ohio Democrat to President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. As long as Republican Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Deb Fischer of Nebraska secure reelection, the GOP will have the Senate in hand. Trump’s North Carolina win gives him options toward 270 threshold By winning North Carolina, Trump maintains options to reach the 270 electoral vote threshold. Trump can reach the magic number by carrying Georgia and Pennsylvania or by carrying Georgia, Michigan and Wisconsin. He also can win by carrying Wisconsin and Arizona, as well as other combinations involving Nevada. But that would require him to crack the blue wall of northern states Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Trump blitzed North Carolina in the final days of the campaign, stopping in four cities over four days and finishing his North Carolina campaign in Raleigh on Monday. Harris’ Howard night energy turns from festive to fretting as race calls roll in The mood at Harris’ election night party at Howard University shifted from electric to anxious as race calls began rolling in. The musical performances and triumphant speeches on display earlier in the evening have been replaced by occasional DJ mixes and broadcast race calls. Anxious faces and hushed talk spread through the crowd as the night stretched on and the tightness of the race became apparent. The still-packed crowd periodically went quiet as attendees watched returns come in on a giant projection of CNN.

European leaders seek to chart a common future at summit but all eyes are glued on Washington	BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — Dozens of European leaders will be gingerly seeking to chart a more common future during a one-day summit in Hungary's capital on Thursday. Yet despite myriad economic challenges and two wars in the neighborhood, all eyes will be glued on Washington to see whether the pivotal U.S. election will cause a political rift throughout the continent. The transatlantic relationship will doubtless change after the vote, leaders and experts have said. But the question is whether that change will be gradual under Kamala Harris or possibly seismic under Donald Trump. The impact of the U.S. results could be felt for years to come, on issues including the war in Ukraine, the European Union's trade relations with the rest of the world, migration, the Middle East conflict and climate change. 'All this is putting peace, stability and prosperity at risk in our region,' said the invitation letter to the leaders of the European Political Community, which unites almost 50 nations in Europe and its near abroad, bar Russia and Belarus. Among the leaders likely to attend on Thursday is Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who is expected to make another plea for more aid as his country fends off Moscow's invasion. The timing is laden with significance as Trump has vowed to end the war 'within 24 hours' of being elected — something leaders in Kyiv interpret as an impending evaporation of U.S. support should Trump win. Orbán makes plain his support for Trump Not so long ago, such a meeting — which is also expected to include leaders from non-EU countries like Turkey, Serbia and the United Kingdom — would end with praise for European unity and a common political direction. Yet with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán as the host of the summit, friction is as good as assured. Orbán, who has openly thrown his weight behind Trump and argued the former president is a 'man of peace,' has predicted a Trump victory and suggested that civil and criminal cases against him were the result of a politically motivated Department of Justice — a common Trump refrain. Having played the obstructionist for years within the 27-nation EU, Orbán now holds the bloc's rotating presidency, giving him a more prominent platform and making him the host of Thursday's EPC summit, as well as another gathering of EU leaders on Friday. The presidency under Orbán caused turmoil from day one, when he declared 'Make Europe Great Again' the motto of his six months in charge. It was a strikingly clear reference to his affection for Trump, which he followed up with unannounced visits to Moscow and Beijing, angering EU leaders who said he was not acting on their behalf. In response to Orbán's self-styled 'peace mission,' many EU countries began boycotting presidency meetings in Budapest, or sending only lower-level bureaucrats rather than ministers. However, no boycotts are expected for this week's summits. While Orbán has cast the result of U.S. elections as determinative of Europe's future — he's even delayed passing Hungary's 2025 national budget until after a new president is elected — not all EU leaders are comfortable with the bloc's fate being so tightly bound up with the movements of American politics. Donald Tusk, the center-right prime minister of Poland, said Europe must forge a more independent path that is less sensitive to changes across the Atlantic. 'Some claim that the future of Europe depends on the American elections, while it depends first and foremost on us, on the condition that Europe finally grows up and believes in its own strength,' Tusk said in the days ahead of the summit. 'Whatever the outcome, the era of geopolitical outsourcing is over.'	https://apnews.com/article/eu-summit-us-elections-russia-ukraine-uk-315e9b04685807d419415662137b0fa2	2024-11-05T21:06:09-08:00

Stock market today: Stocks, bond yields and bitcoin advance as US election brings Republican gains	HONG KONG (AP) — Share prices and bond yields surged Wednesday as the Republican party gained control of the Senate and former President Donald Trump closed in on the 270 electoral votes needed to return him to the White House. The full results of Tuesday's election may not be known for days as officials count all the votes, but investors already were repositioning in anticipation of sweeping gains by the Republicans, who took control of the Senate for the first time in four years. The results of the House elections were not yet finalized. Trump won the battleground state of Georgia, a Republican stronghold that had voted for Democrats in 2020. A win in North Carolina helped Trump narrow Vice President Kamala Harris’ pathways to victory. Clinching Pennsylvania took him within 3 electoral votes of the 270 votes needed to become the next president. The expectation is that a victory by Trump will lead to faster economic growth and more market-friendly policies. Auguring gains for U.S. markets on Wednesday, the future for the S&amp;P 500 gained 1.9% and that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 2.2%. The Nasdaq composite future was 1.7% higher. The price of bitcoin jumped nearly 8% to a record $75,345.00, as investors bet on a victory for Trump, who has pledged support for cryptocurrencies. It later fell back to $73,720.00. Bond yields also surged, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury climbing to 4.4% from 4.28% on Tuesday. 'The markets are scrambling to figure out what happens next, but for the time being, the market is pricing in a higher growth and higher inflation outlook,' Peter Esho of Esho Capital said in a commentary. In early European trading, Germany's DAX climbed 1.3% to 19,503.40, while the CAC 40 in Paris advanced 1.9% to 7,550.36. Britain's FTSE 100 was up 1.4% at 8,285.06. Markets worldwide have been fixated on what the election will mean for U.S. economic, monetary and trade policy, as well as geopolitics. A split in Congress between political parties would complicate policymaking, and a White House headed by Trump could have far reaching ramifications given his support for sharp increases in tariffs, especially on imports from China. The broad U.S. stock market has historically tended to rise regardless of which party wins the White House, even if each party’s policies can help and hurt different industries’ profits. Since 1945, the S&amp;P 500 has risen in 73% of the years where a Democrat was president and 70% of the years when a Republican was the nation’s chief executive, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. The S&amp;P 500 has risen nearly 70% since the 2020 election brought President Joe Biden into office. It rallied to records as the U.S. economy bounced back from the COVID-19 pandemic and managed to avoid a recession despite a jump in inflation. In Asian share trading Wednesday, Japan's Nikkei 225 index gained 2.6% to 39,480.67, while the Kospi in Seoul shed 0.9% to 2,553.90. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 rose 0.8% to 8,199.50. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index fell 2.2% to 20,538.38, ending a three-day rally, as investors sought safe-haven assets amid the uncertainties surrounding the U.S. election. The Hang Seng Tech Index slipped 2.5%, while the Shanghai Composite index edged 0.1% lower, to 3,383.81. Trump has vowed to sharply raise tariffs on imports from China and other countries, darkening the outlook for Chinese exporters at a time when Beijing has relied heavily on ramping up manufacturing to try to revive its slowing economy. 'Positive outcomes for Harris are expected to boost Asian assets, while Trump gains may exert downward pressure,' Anderson Alves of ActivTrades said in a commentary. Chinese markets have been among the most active in the region this week as leaders hold a meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the country's legislature. The gathering is expected to deliver more moves to help spur faster economic growth and resolve mounting levels of local government debt. On Tuesday, upbeat comments by Premier Li Qiang about the potential for both fiscal and monetary policies helped lift share benchmarks in Hong Kong and Shanghai by more than 2%. Li also expressed confidence that China will attain its growth target of about 5% this year. In other dealings early Wednesday, U.S. benchmark crude oil lost 90 cents to $71.09 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, gave up $1.00 cents to $74.53 per barrel. A Trump win was expected to bolster the value of the dollar, which surged to 154.08 Japanese yen from 151.62 yen late Tuesday. The euro slipped to $1.0756 from $1.0931.	https://apnews.com/article/stock-markets-rates-china-93421462d761eb1402d813cb381fe6e9	2024-11-05T16:40:43-08:00	
Tropical Storm Rafael strengthens to Category 1 hurricane as it barrels toward Cuba	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Tropical Storm Rafael strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane on Tuesday as it swirled past the Cayman Islands and chugged toward western Cuba, where it's forecast to hit as a Category 2 hurricane. It was another stroke of bad news for Cuba, which has been struggling with blackouts while recovering from another hurricane two weeks ago that killed at least six people in the eastern part of the island. The storm was located 60 miles (95 kilometers) northeast of Little Cayman in the Cayman Islands on Tuesday morning. It had maximum sustained winds of 80 mph (130 kph) and was moving northwest at 13 mph (2o kph), according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami. Forecasters warned that Rafael was expected to slam into Cuba on Wednesday after dumping rain on Jamaica and the Cayman Islands on Tuesday. The center warned of floods, storm surges and mudslides. The U.S. State Department issued an advisory for Cuba on Tuesday afternoon, offering departure flights to non-essential staff and American citizens, and advising others to 'reconsider travel to Cuba due to the potential impact of Tropical Storm Rafael.' On Tuesday morning, the Cuban Civil Defense called on Cubans to prepare as soon as possible, because when the storm makes landfall 'it’s important to stay where you are.' The day before, authorities said they had issued an evacuation order for 37,000 people in far eastern Cuba, in the province of Guantanamo, due to bad weather. A hurricane warning was in effect Tuesday for the Cayman Islands and the Cuban provinces of Pinar del Rio, Artemisa, La Habana, Mayabeque, Matanzas and the Isle of Youth. A tropical storm warning was in effect for the Cuban provinces of Villa Clara, Cienfuegos, Sancti Spiritus and Ciego de Avila, as well as the lower and middle Florida Keys from Key West to west of the Channel 5 Bridge, and Dry Tortugas. The warning was lifted in Jamaica after the storm passed by the western coast. A tropical storm watch was in effect for the Cuban provinces of Camaguey and Las Tunas. Officials in the Cayman Islands closed schools and government offices as they urged residents to prepare. Long lines were reported at grocery stores as the storm approached. Forecasters warned Rafael would unleash heavy rains across the western Caribbean that could lead to flooding and mudslides in parts of Cuba and the Cayman Islands. Heavy rainfall also was expected to spread north into Florida and nearby areas of the southeast U.S. during the middle to late part of the week. The Hurricane Center predicted storm surges in Florida could reach 1 to 3 feet in Dry Tortugas and 1 to 2 feet in the Lower Florida Keys. A few tornadoes also were expected Wednesday over the Keys and southwestern Florida. Rafael is the 17th named storm of the season. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted the 2024 hurricane season was likely to be well above average, with between 17 and 25 named storms. The forecast called for as many as 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes. An average Atlantic hurricane season produces 14 named storms, seven of them hurricanes and three major hurricanes. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/rafael-tropical-storm-hurricane-cuba-f96033ae40b18d745f95d9dd17868457	2024-11-05T15:46:12-08:00

North Korean test of ICBM is condemned by two-thirds of UN Security Council	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — A U.S.-led statement approved by 10 of the 15 U.N. Security Council members Tuesday condemned a recent North Korean intercontinental ballistic missile launch and called on Pyongyang to return to negotiations and abandon its missile programs. The statement follows a series of recent North Korean missile launches, including the test Thursday of the country’s newest ICBM that is designed to reach the United States. The 10 Security Council members said that launch — in addition to more than 100 North Korean ballistic missile launches since 2022 — violates multiple Security Council resolutions prohibiting the North from using ballistic missile technology and jeopardizes international peace and security. The foreign ministers of the Group of Seven wealthy democracies also decried last week's launch in a statement Tuesday, saying North Korea 'continues to advance its unlawful nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities and to escalate its destabilizing activities.' The G7 is Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the U.S. At the United Nations, U.S. deputy ambassador Robert Wood read the statement to reporters surrounded by diplomats from the nine other nations that signed on — Ecuador, France, Japan, Malta, South Korea, Sierra Leone, Slovenia, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. They were joined by representatives from three countries that will join the council in January — Denmark, Greece and Panama. Five Security Council nations didn’t support the statement — Russia, China, Algeria, Mozambique and Guyana. In the statement, the 10 council members said the United States sought the required approval of all 15 council members for a press statement condemning the ICBM test and calling for North Korea to adhere to the Securitiy Council's legally binding sanctions. But the statement said two countries — identified by council members as North Korea’s allies Russia and China — refused to join the denunciation of Pyongyang’s actions. The 10 members stressed that all council nations are obligated to implement sanctions on North Korea, urging all the nations on the Security Council to abide by that responsibility, maintain international peace and security, and uphold the treaty banning the proliferation of nuclear weapons. While Russia and China were not named, the statement appeared aimed especially at Russia, which has reportedly received munitions and troops from North Korea for its war against Ukraine. At a Security Council meeting Monday, the U.S. and its allies sparred with Russia, China and North Korea over Pyongyang's ICBM tests and troop deployment to Russia. Ukrainian officials said Tuesday that their troops engaged North Korean units for the first time in Russia’s Kursk border region, which Ukrainian forces occupy. The Security Council imposed sanctions after North Korea’s first nuclear test explosion in 2006 and tightened them over the years, seeking — so far unsuccessfully — to cut funds and curb its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. The last sanctions resolution was adopted by the council in December 2017. China and Russia vetoed a U.S.-sponsored resolution in May 2022 that would have imposed new sanctions over a spate of ICBM launches and have blocked any council action since then.	https://apnews.com/article/un-north-korea-missiles-nuclear-russia-ukraine-5f78bb1a9ff3d5edb223a8ead98712ec	2024-11-05T11:58:31-08:00

Police fire tear gas at protest over deadly canopy collapse in Serbia	NOVI SAD, Serbia (AP) — Protesters on Tuesday threw flares and red paint on the City Hall building in the Serbian city of Novi Sad in rage over last week's collapse of a concrete canopy at the railway station that killed 14 people. Police responded by firing tear gas canisters. The protesters surrounded the building in the city center, broke windows and threw stones and other objects despite calls by organizers to remain calm. Special police troops were deployed inside the building. Serbia’s autocratic President Aleksandar Vucic said police were 'showing restraint,' while warning that 'horrific, violent protests are underway.' 'People of Serbia, please do not think violence is allowed,' he said on X. 'All those taking part in the incidents will be punished.' Miran Pogacar, an opposition activist, said 'one glass window can be mended but we cannot bring back 14 lives. People are angry. Serbia won’t stand for this.' Protest organizers said they wanted to enter the City Hall building and submit their demands, including that those responsible for the canopy collapse face justice. Some of the protesters trying to get inside the building wore masks and were believed to be soccer hooligans who are close to the populist government. Bojan Pajtic, an opposition politician, said he believed violence was being stoked by provocateurs, a tactic used before in Serbia to derail peaceful anti-government protests and paint the opposition protesters as enemies of the nation. Earlier, thousands of demonstrators had marched through the city streets demanding that top officials step down because of the fatal outer roof collapse last Friday, including President Vucic and Prime Minister Milos Vucevic. The protesters first gathered outside the railway station where they held a moment of silence for the victims as organizers read their names. The crowd responded by chanting: 'arrest the gang' and 'thieves.' The protest started peacefully but some demonstrators later hurled plastic bottles and bricks at the headquarters of Vucic’s ruling Serbian Progressive Party and smeared red paint on posters of the Serbian president and the prime minister — a message that they have blood on their hands. The protesters removed most of the Serbian national red, blue and white national flags that were apparently hung on the headquarters to prevent it from an attack. That triggered an angry reaction from the president. 'Our Serbian tri-color has been destroyed, hidden and removed by all those who do not love Serbia,' Vucic wrote on X. 'Tonight, in Novi Sad, this is being done by those who tell us that they love Serbia more than us, the decent citizens of this country.' As protests wound down later in the evening, Vucic made a surprise trip to Novi Sad and made a brief appearance before his several hundred supporters gathered outside the party headquarters. Critics of Serbia’s populist government have attributed the disaster to rampant corruption in the Balkan country, a lack of transparency and sloppy work during renovation work on the station building which was part of a wider railway deal with Chinese state companies. The accident happened without warning. Surveillance camera footage showed the massive canopy on the outer wall of the station building crashing down on the people sitting below on benches or going in and out. Officials have promised full accountability and, faced with pressure, Serbia’s construction minister submitted his resignation on Tuesday. Prosecutors have said that more than 40 people already have been questioned as part of a probe into what happened. Many in Serbia, however, doubt that justice will be served with the populists in firm control of the judicial system and the police. Opposition parties behind Tuesday’s protest said they are also demanding the resignation of Vucevic and that documentation be made public listing all the companies and individuals involved. The victims included a 6-year-old girl. Those injured in the roof collapse remained in serious condition on Tuesday. The train station has been renovated twice in recent years. Officials have insisted that the canopy had not been part of the renovation work, suggesting this was the reason why it collapsed but giving no explanation for why it was not included. The Novi Sad railway station was originally built in 1964, while the renovated station was inaugurated by Vucic and his populist ally, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, over two years ago as a major stopover for a planned fast train line between Belgrade and Budapest.	https://apnews.com/article/serbia-canopy-collapse-protest-novi-sad-9f4c6e14c01aca29aa4f2c6720bbebff	2024-11-05T10:01:28-08:00	
Israel's Netanyahu dismisses his defense minister as wars rage. Protests erupt across country	JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday dismissed his popular defense minister, Yoav Gallant, in a surprise announcement that came as the country is embroiled in wars on multiple fronts across the region. The move sparked protests across the country, including a mass gathering that paralyzed central Tel Aviv. Netanyahu and Gallant have repeatedly been at odds over the war in Gaza. But Netanyahu had avoided firing his rival before taking the step as the world's attention was focused on the U.S. presidential election. Netanyahu cited 'significant gaps' and a 'crisis of trust' in his Tuesday evening announcement as he replaced Gallant with a longtime loyalist. 'In the midst of a war, more than ever, full trust is required between the prime minister and defense minister,' Netanyahu said. 'Unfortunately, although in the first months of the campaign there was such trust and there was very fruitful work, during the last months this trust cracked between me and the defense minister.' In the early days of the war, Israel's leadership presented a unified front as it responded to Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack. But as the war has dragged on and spread to Lebanon, key policy differences have emerged. While Netanyahu has called for continued military pressure on Hamas, Gallant had taken a more pragmatic approach, saying that military force has created the necessary conditions for at least a temporary diplomatic deal that could bring home hostages held by the militant group. In a late-night news conference broadcast on national TV, Gallant said that he had disagreed with Netanyahu over three main issues: the need to end controversial exemptions from the military draft for ultra-Orthodox men, the urgent need for a hostage deal and the need to establish an official commission of inquiry into the political and security failures of Oct. 7, when Hamas militants stormed into Israel and killed 1,200 people and took 250 others hostage. Israel estimates that about 100 hostages remain in captivity, only about 65 of them still alive. With military service compulsory for most Jews, Gallant said that drafting the ultra-Orthodox was both an issue of fairness and security at a time when Israel faces so many challenges. He said a hostage deal was needed 'as quickly as possible, when they are still alive' and said there will be 'no forgiveness' for neglecting them. And he said a full investigation into the events of Oct. 7 was the only way to ensure the government would learn the proper lessons. Netanyahu has rejected calls for an inquiry, saying it should only take place when the war is over. Gallant ended his statement by honoring the soldiers serving in the army and those who have died in the wars. He held up his hand and saluted as he walked away from the podium. Many of the families of the hostages, along with tens of thousands of people who have joined anti-government protests, accuse Netanyahu of scuttling a deal in order to maintain his hold on power. Netanyahu's hard-line partners have threatened to bring down the government if he makes concessions to Hamas, raising the risk of early elections at a time when the prime minister's popularity is low. This week, authorities announced the arrest of a Netanyahu aide on suspicion of leaking classified information to foreign media that gave the prime minister political cover as hostage talks fell apart. 'Firing Gallant in the middle of a war is an act of madness,' opposition leader Yair Lapid said on X. 'Netanyahu is selling Israel’s security and the Israeli army soldiers for a disgraceful political survival.' Israel's president, Isaac Herzog, whose largely ceremonial office is meant to help unify the country, called the dismissal 'the last thing Israel needs.' The grassroots forum representing hostage families said Gallant’s dismissal is 'a direct continuation of the ‘efforts’ to torpedo the abductee deal.' Within hours, thousands of protesters gathered in central Tel Aviv, blocking the city's main highway and crippling traffic. The crowd, many holding blue and white Israeli flags and others blowing whistles and pounding drums, gathered around multiple bonfires. Several thousand people demonstrated outside Netanyahu's home in Jerusalem and elsewhere in the city. Protesters gathered and blocked roads in several other spots across the country, and Israeli TV stations showed images of police scuffling with protesters. The dismissal comes at a delicate time. Israeli troops remain bogged down in Gaza, over a year after invading the territory in a war that has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, including tens of thousands of civilians, and caused widespread destruction, while Israeli ground troops are pressing ahead with a month-old ground invasion against Hezbollah militants in Lebanon. Hundreds of Israeli soldiers have been killed in the fighting. Israel also has clashed with Iranian-backed groups in Iraq, Syria and Yemen, and is facing the possibility of another strike by Iran. Iran has vowed to avenge an Israeli strike that came in response to an Oct. 1 Iranian missile attack, itself a reprisal for earlier Israeli attacks on Iranian-linked targets. On Monday, Gallant announced he had sent out thousands of draft notices to young ultra-Orthodox men. The system of exemptions for religious men has bred widespread resentment among the secular majority, and Israel's Supreme Court has ordered the government to scrap the system. Netanyahu, whose governing coalition depends on ultra-Orthodox parties, has not yet implemented the order. Channel 13 TV said Netanyahu had also taken advantage of the U.S. election, when American attention is focused elsewhere, to dismiss his rival. The White House on Tuesday declined to comment on the firing but called Galant 'an important partner on all matters related to the defense of Israel.' 'As close partners, we will continue to work collaboratively with Israel’s next minister of defense,' the White House National Security Council said. Gallant, a former general with a gruff, no-nonsense demeanor, has emerged as the most popular figure with the public in Israel's wartime government. Gallant has worn a simple, black buttoned shirt throughout the war in a sign of sorrow over the Oct. 7 attack and developed a strong relationship with his U.S. counterpart, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. A previous attempt by Netanyahu to fire Gallant in March 2023 sparked widespread street protests against Netanyahu. He also flirted with the idea of dismissing Gallant over the summer but held off until Tuesday's announcement. Israel Katz, his replacement, currently serves as foreign minister and is a longtime Netanyahu loyalist and veteran Cabinet minister. Katz thanked Netanyahu and pledged to lead the security establishment to victory in the wars against Israel’s enemies. Katz, 69, was a junior officer in the military decades ago and has little military experience, though he has been a key member of Netanyahu's Security Cabinet over the years. Gideon Saar, a former Netanyahu rival who rejoined the government in September, will take the foreign affairs post. Netanyahu has a long history of neutralizing his rivals. In his statement, he claimed he had made 'many attempts' to bridge the gaps with Gallant. 'But they kept getting wider,' he said. 'Our enemies enjoyed it and derived a lot of benefit from it.' ___ Associated Press writers Eleanor H.

Western officials suspect Russia was behind a plot to put incendiary packages on cargo planes	WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Western security officials suspect Russian intelligence was behind a plot to put incendiary devices in packages on cargo planes headed to North America, including one that caught fire at a courier hub in Germany and another that ignited in a warehouse in England. Poland said last month that it has arrested four people suspected to be linked to a foreign intelligence operation that carried out sabotage and is searching for two others. Lithuania's prosecutor general Nida Grunskiene said Tuesday there were an unspecified number of people detained in several countries, offering no elaboration. The events come as Western officials say they are seeing an intensification of a hybrid war of sabotage by Russia targeting Ukraine’s allies, including election disinformation and arson attacks in Europe this year. Several officials said they believe the attacks were the work of Russian military intelligence, the GRU, although Moscow denied involvement. Poland’s Internal Security Agency, or ABW, says that incidents in Poland, as well as other EU and NATO members, had intensified this year. ABW believes they are initiated and coordinated by the Russian special services. So far, 20 people have been charged in investigations led by the prosecutor’s office, the ABW and police. Polish Prosecutor Katarzyna Calów-Jaszewska said the investigation focuses on foreign agents conducting acts of sabotage, including damaging industrial facilities or critical infrastructure such as airports, airplanes and other vehicles, and as well as arson using self-combustible parcels sent to EU countries and the U.K. that would ignite during road or air transport. She added that the group tested a channel for sending such parcels to the United States and Canada. The Wall Street Journal first reported the details of the cargo plane incidents. The U.S. Transportation Security Administration said it has put extra security measures in place in recent months for certain cargo shipments heading to the United States. 'We continually adjust our security posture as appropriate and promptly share any and all relevant information with our industry partners, to include requirements and recommendations that help them reduce risk,' the TSA said. There was no active threat targeting flights heading to the United States, according to a U.S. official, who was not authorized to comment publicly. Dirk Heinrichs, a spokesperson for DHL in Germany, said in an emailed statement to The Associated Press that the company could not provide details about the matter but was 'fully cooperating with the relevant authorities to protect our people, our network and our customers’ shipments.' The head of Britain’s domestic intelligence agency, MI5, said last month the U.K. is facing a 'staggering rise' in attempts at assassination, sabotage and other crimes on its soil by Russia as well as Iran. Calów-Jaszewska said Oct. 25 that parcels with camouflaged explosives were sent via cargo companies to EU countries and Britain to 'test the transfer channel for such parcels' that were ultimately destined for the U.S. and Canada. The incendiary devices in Germany and the U.K. both ignited in July. One was at at stopover at a DHL logistics center at an airport in the city of Leipzig, according to Thomas Haldenwang, head of the German intelligence service. The German news agency dpa reported that the connecting flight containing the package, which came from one of the Baltic nations, was delayed in Leipzig and was on the ground when it ignited and set fire to a freight container. British counterterrorism police are investigating whether Russian agents were behind an incendiary device in a parcel that caught fire in a DHL warehouse in Minworth, near Birmingham, in central England on July 22. The incident, first reported by the Guardian newspaper and German broadcasters, was similar to the one in Germany. The Polish newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza also reported that a fire was reported in a courier truck near Warsaw. 'We are observing aggressive action by the Russian intelligence services. In particular Russian espionage and sabotage in Germany are on the rise, both quantitatively and qualitatively,' Haldenwang told the German Budestag, or parliament, last month while discussing the Leipzig incident. 'The activities of Russian intelligence services in the real world as well as in cyberspace show that Germany is the focus of this Russia’s hybrid war against Western democracies,' he added. 'Russia is using its entire toolbox: from influencing political discussions within Germany to cyber attacks against critical infrastructure and sabotage. Russia’s willingness to use force proves that it is also willing to put human lives at risk.' In a rare public speech setting out the major threats to the U.K., MI5 Director General Ken McCallum said 'the GRU in particular is on a sustained mission to generate mayhem on British and European streets: We’ve seen arson, sabotage and more. Dangerous actions conducted with increasing recklessness.' Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday called media reports about the alleged sabotage plot an example of a 'vague fabrication.' ___ Associated Press writers Jill Lawless and Danica Kirka in London, Dasha Litvinova in Tallinn, Estonia, Kirsten Grieshaber in Berlin, Aamer Madhani in Washington, D.C., :and Liudas Dapkus in Vilnius, Lithuania, contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-poland-germany-sabotage-cargo-planes-b7f559805d7a996dd6aabe8e69041607	2024-11-05T08:41:17-08:00

Maldives recalls its ambassador in Pakistan over unsanctioned meeting with Kabul's envoy	ISLAMABAD (AP) — Pakistani officials said on Tuesday they were aware the Maldives government had recalled its ambassador to Pakistan after he met with the Afghan Taliban government's top diplomat in Islamabad without clearing it with his government. The Maldives does not recognize the Taliban government which seized power in August 2021 as United States and NATO forces withdrew from the country. The Taliban has been widely isolated for human rights violations since the takeover, including bans on Afghan girls and women. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Maldives said in a statement on Nov. 3 that the recent meeting between Mohamed Thoha, the High Commissioner of Maldives in Pakistan and Ahmad Shakib, Afghanistan’s chargé d’affaires was not 'sanctioned by the Government of Maldives.' Without elaborating, the statement said an 'appropriate action' was taken against Thoha on Saturday. It said 'Maldives is guided by the practice followed by the United Nations General Assembly when questions arise about the representative character of a government. Consistent with this practice, the Maldives recognizes the Government representing Afghanistan at the United Nations as the legitimate Government of Afghanistan.' This came days after the Afghan embassy in Islamabad said in a statement the two officials met to discuss ways to enhance cooperation and trade relations between Maldives and Central Asian Countries through Afghanistan. It also stated that the Afghan envoy while thanking Thoha said 'Afghanistan seeks constructive relations with all countries and is striving through its economy-focused policies to transform Afghanistan into a regional connectivity hub'. The high commission of Maldives in Islamabad took down Thoha's photo from its website.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-maldives-ambassador-recalled-meeting-taliban-envoy-f1f16910ef724d228417a575d40d5ec6	2024-11-05T06:34:48-08:00

The church of Saint-Sulpice in Paris shines in an immersive light show	PARIS (AP) — As dusk falls over the City of Light, a new spectacle is illuminating Saint-Sulpice church, a monument whose interiors are even larger than Notre Dame's — and arguably just as breathtaking. The cavernous walls of the neoclassical gem on Paris' Left Bank are coming alive with 360-degree video projections, sparkling cutting-edge technology and actors, all telling the story of the church and its place in French history. Blending centuries of intrigue, revolution and family drama, the show reimagines the Saint-Germain district during the Fronde, the 17th-century civil war, and the lead-up to the French Revolution. 'Paris Cœur de Lumières' (Paris Chancel of Lights), which runs until Nov. 23, transforms the church’s sprawling 6,000-square-meter (65,000-square-foot) interior into a digital stage through advanced video mapping. 'From a technological standpoint, it’s a laser scan of the entire building that allows us to reconstruct the space in three dimensions,' director Damien Fontaine explained. 'We then ‘unfold’ it like origami ... and put it back into 3D to be projected as a single unified image. We have over 45 projectors, each covering a part of the vaults, a section of a pillar, or a piece of the nave. It’s ... a mosaic of images to form one large picture.' Projections transform stone carvings into animated storytellers, while immersive soundscapes, paired with an original score, wrap the audience in a sensory experience. The actors brought history to life. Over 350 performers and volunteers, clad in more than 500 historical costumes, move among the audience portraying local families and rivalries, threading personal narratives into the broader history. Many of those who volunteered themselves marveled at learning about little known aspects of French history. Anne Dubosc, a 65-year-old amateur actress, played Anne of Austria, mother of Sun King Louis XIV. 'She was a remarkable woman, very involved in politics and religion,' Dubosc said. 'I hadn’t realized how important she was. If Louis XIV became the man he was, it was partly thanks to this woman, this mother who was like a tigress, doing everything to protect her son and teaching him to be a great statesman.' Performing in Saint-Sulpice, she added, was extraordinary: 'It’s exceptional. You lose track of what’s happening, of where fiction ends and history begins.' Her historic costume shaped her performance — literally. 'I have a corset that squeezes me so tightly,' she said. 'You realize there’s a very 18th-century way of holding yourself, of carrying your shoulders and neck, which gives a natural majesty. The costume really impacts how you carry your body, and that posture influences your mind, giving character to this woman of state.' The production underscored a growing trend in Paris of using light technology to show off the city's storied church interiors. A similar illuminations display took place at Saint-Eustache church until September, featuring video projections, lighting effects and spatialized electronic soundtrack. ___ Associated Press writer Marine Lesprit contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/paris-light-illuminations-saintsulpice-c60f37c0514825b87aa00897ce9bd61e	2024-11-05T05:44:54-08:00

UK introduces a bill that would eventually make the purchase of cigarettes illegal	LONDON (AP) — Legislation intended to ban today’s British children from ever legally being able to smoke began its journey through Parliament on Tuesday. The Tobacco and Vapes Bill would also bar smoking and vaping in some outdoor spaces such as playgrounds and the entrances to schools and hospitals. But a proposed ban on smoking in pub beer gardens has been dropped after opposition from bar owners. Health Secretary Wes Streeting said the hospitality industry had 'taken a real battering in recent years' and it is not 'the right time' to ban smoking outside pubs. The bill also proposes to restrict vape flavors and ban bright vape packaging aimed at children, to combat 'a cynical industry that has sought to addict a new generation of children to nicotine,' Streeting said. It also continues a plan by the previous Conservative government, which was ousted in July’s general election, to raise the minimum age for buying tobacco by one year each year, so that no one born after Jan. 1, 2009 will ever be able to buy cigarettes legally in Britain. It is currently illegal to sell cigarettes, tobacco products or vapes to people under 18. If passed – as is likely because of the governing Labour Party’s large majority in Parliament -- the bill would give Britain some of the toughest anti-smoking measures in the world. The government said the bill 'breaks the cycle of addiction and paves the way for a smoke-free U.K.' The number of people who smoke in Britain has declined by two-thirds since the 1970s, but some 6.4 million people — or about 13% of the population — still smoke, according to official figures. Authorities say smoking causes some 80,000 deaths a year in the U.K, and remains the number one preventable cause of death, disability and poor health.	https://apnews.com/article/uk-smoking-ban-vapes-children-health-tobacco-pubs-0a25159ad4536d4a30f652486c6fc585	2024-11-05T03:46:22-08:00	
French court convicts 18 in a major trial that casts light on the deadly migrant-smuggling trade	LILLE, France (AP) — A French court found 18 people guilty Tuesday in a major migrant-smuggling trial that shed light on the lucrative but often deadly clandestine business of transporting people on flimsy boats across the perilous sea from France to the U.K. The defendants were swept up in a pan-European police operation in 2022 that led to dozens of arrests and the seizure of boats, life jackets, outboard engines, paddles, and cash. The court in Lille, northern France, sentenced one of the ringleaders, from Iraq, to 15 years in prison and a fine of 200,000 euros ($218,000). Other sentences ranged from two years to 10 years in prison. 'These sentences are obviously very severe,' said Kamel Abbas, a lawyer who represented one of the defendants already imprisoned in France. 'That’s a testimony of the scale of the case, and of the intention to severely punish the smugglers.' Most of the defendants were not in court for the verdicts and sentencing. Some attended the trial remotely from various prisons in northern France, while others are not in custody. Fourteen of the 18 defendants were from Iraq, with the others from Iran, Poland, France and the Netherlands. The trial comes in what has been a particularly deadly year for attempted crossings of the English Channel, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes. More than 31,000 migrants have made the perilous Channel crossing so far this year, more than in all of 2023, though fewer than in 2022. At least 56 people have perished in the attempts this year, according to French officials, making 2024 the deadliest since the crossings began surging in 2018. The route, despite French and British efforts to stop it, remains a major smuggling corridor for people fleeing conflict or poverty. Migrants favor the U.K. for reasons of language, family ties, or perceived easier access to asylum and work. Europe’s increasingly strict asylum rules, growing xenophobia and hostile treatment of migrants are also pushing many migrants north. On Monday, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer called for international cooperation against smuggling gangs, likening the issue to a global security threat on par with terrorism. Starmer told a conference of international police organization Interpol that 'people-smuggling should be viewed as a global security threat similar to terrorism.' He said intelligence and law-enforcement agencies should try to 'stop smuggling gangs before they act' in the same way they do in counterterrorism operations. ___ AP journalists John Leicester in Paris and Jill Lawless in London contributed. ___ Follow all AP stories on global migration at https://apnews.com/hub/migration	https://apnews.com/article/migration-france-britain-iraq-ddac64d4ffbe832740dd19e561c7838c	2024-11-05T03:21:14-08:00	
A week after Spain's floods, families hold out hope that loved ones are not among the dead	SEDAVI, Spain (AP) — Francisco Murgui went out to try to salvage his motorbike when the water started to rise. He never came back. One week after catastrophic flooding devasted eastern Spain, María Murgui still holds out hope that her father is alive and among the unknown number of the missing. 'He was like many people in town who went out to get their car or motorbike to safety,' the 27-year-old told The Associated Press. 'The flash flood caught him outside, and he had to cling to a tree in order to escape drowning. He called us to tell us he was fine, that we shouldn’t worry.' But when María set out into the streets of Sedaví to try to rescue him from the water washing away everything in its path, he was nowhere to be found. 'He held up until 1 in the morning,' she said. 'By 2, I went outside with a neighbor and a rope to try to locate him. But we couldn’t find him. And since then, we haven’t heard anything about him.' At least 218 have been confirmed dead after a deluge caused by heavy rains late on Oct. 29 and the next morning swamped entire communities, mostly in Spain's Valencia region. Most people were caught off guard. Regional authorities have been heavily criticized for having issued alerts to mobile phones some two hours after the disaster had started. Authorities have yet to any give an estimate of the missing. Spanish state broadcaster RTVE shows a steady stream of appeals by people searching for family members. María Murgui herself has posted a missing person’s message on social media with a photo of her father, a 57-year-old retiree. 'This is like riding a rollercoaster. Sometimes I feel very bad and sometimes I feel better. I try to stay positive,' she said. 'This truly is madness. We don’t know what else to do. Neither does anybody else in town.' Central government passes relief package While many search for their loved ones, the gargantuan recovery efforts in Sedaví and dozens of other communities slowly moved forward. The central government approved a 10.6-billion-euro relief package for 78 communities on Tuesday. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez compared it to the measures taken during the COVID-19 pandemic. The package includes direct payments of 20,000 euros to 60,000 euros to owners of damaged homes, and financial aid for businesses and municipal governments. 'We have a lot of work left to do, and we know it,' Sánchez said. Sánchez said he will ask the European Union to help pay for the relief, saying 'it is time for the European Union to help.' Many people are still without basic goods amid scenes of devastation The floods have left behind post-apocalyptic scenes. In town after town, streets are still covered with thick brown mud and mounds of ruined belongings, clumps of rotting vegetation and wrecked vehicles. A stench arises from the muck. In many places, people still face shortages of basic goods, and lines form at impromptu emergency kitchens and stands handing out food. Water is running again but authorities say it is not fit for drinking. The ground floors of thousands of homes have been ruined. It is feared that inside some of the vehicles that were washed away or trapped in underground garages there could be bodies waiting to be recovered. Thousands of soldiers are working with firefighters and police reinforcements in the immense emergency response. Officers and troops are searching in destroyed homes, and in the countless cars strewn across highways and streets or lodged in the mud in canals and gorges. Authorities are worried about other health problems in the aftermath of the deadliest natural disaster in Spain's recent history. They have urged people to get tetanus shots, to treat any wounds to prevent infections and to clean the mud from their skin. Many people wear face masks. Thousands of volunteers are helping out, but frustration over the crisis management boiled over on Sunday when a crowd in hard-hit Paiporta hurled mud and other objects at Spain’s royals, Sánchez and regional officials when they made their first visit to the epicenter of the flood damage. ___ Wilson reported from Barcelona, Spain.	https://apnews.com/article/spain-floods-missing-people-valencia-dead-d032b706a16c1051ee2d741af10afa7b	2024-11-05T03:12:07-08:00	
An Iran official claims Iranian-German prisoner died before he could be executed	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — An Iranian official claimed Tuesday that Iranian-German prisoner Jamshid Sharmahd died before Tehran could execute him — directly contradicting the country's earlier announcement he had been put to death. The comment by Asghar Jahangir comes after Germany shut down all three Iranian consulates in the country over Sharmahd's death, leaving only the embassy in Berlin open. Germany later disputed Jahangir's remark. Meanwhile, even Iran's reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian has offered his own criticism of Germany's response to Sharmahd's death as tensions remain high between Tehran and the West over its rapidly advancing nuclear program and the ongoing Mideast wars. The judiciary’s Mizan news agency quoted Jahangir as saying: 'Jamshid Sharmahd was sentenced to death, his sentence was ready to be carried out, but he passed away before implementation of the sentence.' He did not elaborate. Jahangir's remarks were made to the state-affiliated Quds newspaper after a weekly news conference, when journalists typically buttonhole the spokesman into answering questions he didn't take from the podium. Germany's Foreign Ministry, reacting to the official's comment, said: 'His death was confirmed to us by the Iranian side.' 'Jamshid Sharmahd was abducted by Iran and held for years without a fair trial, in inhumane conditions and without the necessary medical care,' the ministry said. 'Iran is responsible for his death.' Germany added it was 'lobbying the Iranian government to hand over his body to his family.' The State Department in the U.S., where Sharmahd once lived, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Jason Poblete, a lawyer representing Sharmahd's family, told The Associated Press that the conflicting comments from Iran were 'deeply concerning.' 'This inconsistency raises serious questions about the circumstances of the death and the transparency of the Iranian system,' Poblete said. 'The family has been urging the German and U.S. authorities to investigate this matter to ascertain the truth, ensure accountability thoroughly and reunite Jimmy with his family in California.' Iran had said it executed Sharmahd on Oct. 28. He was 69. Iran accused Sharmahd, who lived in Glendora, California, of planning a 2008 attack on a mosque that killed 14 people — including five women and a child — and wounded over 200 others, as well as plotting other assaults through the little-known Kingdom Assembly of Iran and its Tondar militant wing. Iran also accused Sharmahd of 'disclosing classified information' on missile sites of Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard during a television program in 2017. His family disputed the allegations and had worked for years to see him freed. Germany, the U.S. and international rights groups have dismissed Sharmahd's trial as a sham. Amnesty International said the proceedings against Sharmahd had been a 'grossly unfair trial' because he had been denied access to an independent lawyer and 'the right to defend himself.' However, Amnesty also noted that Sharmahd ran a website for the Kingdom Assembly of Iran and its Tondar militant wing that included claims of 'responsibility for explosions inside Iran,' though he repeatedly denied being involved in the attacks. Sharmahd was apparently kidnapped while on a layover in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, in 2020. His family received their last message from him on July 28, 2020. It’s unclear how the abduction happened, but tracking data showed that Sharmahd’s cellphone traveled south from Dubai to the city of Al Ain on July 29, crossing the border into Oman. On July 30, tracking data showed the phone traveled to the Omani port city of Sohar, where the signal stopped. Two days later, Iran announced it had captured Sharmahd in a 'complex operation.' The Intelligence Ministry published a photograph of him blindfolded. In the time since his execution, Germany shut the consulates. It's a diplomatic tool Germany seldom uses and signals a major downgrade in relations with Tehran. However, Iran has responded by criticizing Germany and the West, including Pezeshkian, who campaigned on a promise of getting sanctions on the Islamic Republic lifted. 'When someone, who has slaughtered dozens, is executed, they say you do not observe human rights,' Pezeshkian said. ___ Associated Press writer Kirsten Grieshaber in Berlin contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-sharmahd-execution-acb36064d51847f7e46c6886585e8bba	2024-11-05T02:40:06-08:00	
The Latest: Trump and Harris cede stage to voters who'll also decide control of House and Senate	Election Day is here. Voters are gearing up to head to the polls to cast their ballots for either Donald Trump or Kamala Harris in one of the nation’s most historic presidential races. They'll also be determining which party will control the House and Senate. Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: Voter Voice: ‘I got my sticker. I’m showing that off today’ Geoff Grace has a tremor, and filling out the little circles on his Wisconsin ballot was a difficult task. But he got it done — with some help from his mother — and got a round of applause from poll workers for getting through the process when his ballot was deposited. 'They were very nice and accommodating for that,' Grace said. 'And I got my sticker. I’m showing that off today.' Grace voted for Harris. 'I strongly believe a woman should have a chance at being president,' he said. Where are the voters who could decide the presidential election? When you hear the term bellwether, you might think about states in the presidential election that always vote with the White House winner. The true meaning of a bellwether is an indicator of a trend. For that, you need to think about counties. Across the seven main battleground states in 2024, there are 10 counties — out of more than 500 — that voted for Trump in 2016 and then flipped to Biden in 2020. Most are small and home to relatively few voters, with Arizona’s Maricopa a notable exception. So it’s not likely they’ll swing an entire state all by themselves. What these counties probably will do is provide an early indication of which candidate is performing best among the swing voters likely to decide a closely contested race. It doesn’t take much for a flip. For example, the difference in Wisconsin, during both 2016 and 2020, was only about 20,000 votes. ▶ Read more about the states that might matter the most on Election Day An Alabama county is printing emergency ballots after discovering a missing page St. Clair County Probate Judge Andrew Weathington said the problem was discovered Tuesday morning when packs of sealed ballots were opened at polling places and many were found to be missing the back page, which contains proposed constitutional amendments. He said it appeared to be a printing error. The proposed ballots were proofed before printing and were correct, he added. The Alabama Secretary of State’s Office confirmed emergency ballots are being printed. The ACLU of Alabama has asked the St. Clair probate office to extend voting hours by the number of hours it takes to get new ballots, a spokesman for the organization said. Weathington said he is seeking legal guidance from the Alabama secretary of state and the county attorney. Alabama voters are deciding local constitutional amendments and one statewide amendment. The statewide amendment relates to allowing a local school board to sell land, located in another Alabama county, to a developer. Voters in the county were also voting on a local amendment related to local school board governance. Florida’s voter information website is experiencing issues Florida voters turning to a state-run website to check their voter registration status were getting an error message Tuesday morning. A spokesperson for Florida Secretary of State Cord Byrd confirmed the state’s online Voter Information Lookup tool was experiencing technical issues but did not answer questions about what was causing the problem. 'We’re working to resolve it,' spokesperson Mark Ard said. 'We’re providing alternative websites and locations for voters to find their voter information, their precinct.' Floridians can check their voter registration status and find their polling place by going to their county supervisor of elections website. Foreign election interference issues quiet so far Cait Conley, senior adviser to the director of the Cybersecurity Infrastructure and Security Agency, said during a briefing that 'we are not currently tracking any national level, significant incidents impacting the security of our election infrastructure. We are tracking instances of extreme weather and other temporary infrastructure disruption to certain areas of the country, but these are largely expected routine and planned for events.' Conley said CISA, the FBI and intelligence communities did anticipate that foreign actors would try to influence the election later today and in the following weeks. Nancy Mace tries to cement her hold on her US House seat in South Carolina South Carolina Republican U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace is trying to cement her hold on her seat in a state that doesn’t mind sending people back to Congress for decades. There have been questions over whether Mace’s attention-seeking personality and brashness and willingness to buck her party’s establishment could be a liability. But so far, she’s been embraced by her coastal 1st District. Mace flipped the seat back to Republicans in 2020 after a stunning upset of incumbent Democratic Rep. Joe Cunningham. She fought off a GOP challenger endorsed by former President Donald Trump in 2022 and breezed to a surprisingly easy win — this time with Trump’s backing — in the 2024 Republican primary without a runoff. Her fellow Republicans in the South Carolina General Assembly also did her a favor by redrawing the district and sending traditional Democratic precincts in and around downtown Charleston to the state’s only majority-minority district. Under the old map in 2020, Mace won less than 51% of the vote. With the new maps in 2022 she received more than 56%. Mace’s Democratic challenger as voting ends Tuesday is businessman and former International African American Museum CEO Michael Moore. His campaign has struggled to gain momentum and Mace has barely acknowledged he’s in the race. ▶ Read more about the South Carolina House race Why you hear about Dixville Notch every presidential election It’s practically an Election Day tradition now. The news media gathers in tiny Dixville Notch, New Hampshire, a picturesque town near the Canadian border, to watch the first voters cast their ballots at midnight. Dixville Notch started its tradition in 1960. Neil Tillotson, who owned the town’s Balsams Grand Resort Hotel, heard about midnight voting from an Associated Press reporter, his son Tom told CBS News. The elder petitioned the legislature to let the community create its own voting precinct. Even though two other towns had midnight voting — including one that opened early for railroad workers — Dixville Notch was the only one with a hotel that made it convenient for reporters and photographers to file, with phone lines and a dark room. The first polling place was inside Tillotson’s resort. Per the tradition, AP reporter Nick Perry was on hand when a half-dozen voters cast their ballots at the polling place, which has moved to the living room of the Tillotson home. He documented the scene, and made sure not to miss that the polling place featured ' a couple of very friendly dogs.' NFL, NBA facilities in use on Election Day There are no NFL or NBA games today. Plenty of fans will be going to stadiums anyway. At least 17 NFL and NBA facilities are either polling locations or ballot drop-off stations. Some teams even offered voters personalized 'I Voted' stickers with team logos. Tuesdays aren’t game days in the NFL. The NBA, for the third consecutive year, isn’t playing any games on Election Day to support 'civic engagement,' the league said. And players from all 30 NBA teams wore warm-up shirts with a simple message Monday night: 'Vote,' they said. Giuliani ordered to appear in court after missing deadline to turn over possessions U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman issued the order late Monday after lawyers for Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea 'Shaye' Moss — two former Georgia election workers who were awarded a $148 million defamation judgment — reported to the court that Rudy Giuliani cleared out his Manhattan apartment weeks before the Oct. 29 deadline to surrender his possessions. Lawyers for Freeman and Moss say Giuliani has not yet surrendered any of the items that he was ordered to turn over — including his $5 million New York apartment, a 1980 Mercedes once owned by movie star Lauren Bacall and a variety of other belongings including sports memorabilia. Giuliani spokesperson Ted Goodman said Tuesday that Giuliani has made his property available and accused Freeman and Moss’ lawyers of deception and attempting to 'further bully and intimidate Mayor Giuliani until he is rendered penniless and homeless.' Giuliani was ordered to pay the former election workers for falsely accusing them of ballot fraud during the 2020 presidential election, as part of Donald Trump’s unfounded claims that the election was stolen from him. Harris campaign stresses patience as votes are tallied The seven battleground states have varying rules on when votes are counted, so it is expected to take some time before all votes are tallied in the key states that are expected to decide the razor-tight race. 'We’re going to be patient,' Harris campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon said during a Tuesday appearance on MSNBC. 'We’re going to be very focused on what’s happening in the early part of the night. But we know some of our bigger battleground states are not going to be fully tallied until later in the night or early in the morning.' O’Malley Dillon was hopeful that early turnout in Georgia and North Carolina was a positive sign for the Harris campaign. By the time early voting in North Carolina had ended on Saturday, over 4.4 million voters — or nearly 57% of all registered voters in the state — had cast their ballots. It was particularly robust in the 25 western counties affected by Hurricane Helene and was even stronger at 59% of registered voters. Georgia meanwhile saw more than 4 million voters cast early ballots, a record-breaking number for the state. Voter Voice: Harris is ‘going to go out and get the ball’ on Social Security Atlanta audio-visual technician Mark Butler wasn’t working on Tuesday and planned to watch election coverage after he cast his ballot in the morning. He said he voted for Harris. 'What matters to me is Social Security,' Butler said. 'I think she’s going to go out and get the ball on that one.' Butler, a lifelong Atlanta resident, said he’s fully aware of the weight Georgia will likely carry in deciding who wins the White House. 'It’s very important. We’re a swing state, probably one of the most important swing states,' he said. Democrats hope to flip a reliably Republican Louisiana congressional seat with new boundaries In a critical election year, Democrats are looking to flip a once reliably Republican Louisiana congressional seat, where political boundaries were recently redrawn to form the state’s second mostly Black congressional district. With five people on the ballot for Louisiana’s Sixth Congressional District, Democrats have thrown their support behind longtime politician Cleo Fields, 61. The state senator has been involved in state politics for three decades and served two terms in Congress after being elected in 1992. Across the aisle, Republicans are looking to preserve the seat, especially in an election year where the GOP is trying to hold on to their majority in the U.S. House. The only Republican on the ballot is former state lawmaker Elbert Guillory, 80. For nearly 50 years, only one Democrat has won the seat in Louisiana’s 6th Congressional District. But the district’s boundaries have recently been recrafted. ▶ Read more about Louisiana’s House race Migrant caravan starts walking in southern Mexico Some 2,500 migrants from at least a dozen countries have started walking in southern Mexico, hoping Mexican authorities will allow them to eventually reach the U.S. border. The caravan departed on U.S. Election Day after a tight race that frequently put immigration at its center. Those walking voiced more immediate concerns than U.S. politics like safety for their families and job opportunities. Groups of several hundred to several thousand migrants moving together en masse has become more common in recent years. In October 2020, a caravan that formed in Honduras ahead of the U.S. election was stopped by authorities in Guatemala. In October 2018, ahead of U.S. midterms, another caravan that started in Honduras grew to about 7,000 and eventually reached the U.S. border. In recent years, caravans haven’t made it out of southern Mexico. FBI warns of fabricated videos misusing its name and insignia A news clip that purports to come from the FBI tells voters that they should vote remotely because of a high terror threat at polling stations. But the FBI said that the clip is bogus, did not come from the bureau and does not accurately represent concerns about safety at polling locations. Also false is a video depicting a fabricated FBI press release claiming that the management of prisons in several key battleground states rigged inmate voting and colluded with one of the political parties. The FBI did not identify anyone who it thought might be responsible for the manufactured videos. Over the past two weeks, the agency has blamed Russian influence actors for a variety of manufactured internet postings and videos officials say were released as part of a broader disinformation campaign. Puerto Rico will also vote on new House delegate and statehood Voters in Puerto Rico will elect a new resident commissioner, the island’s representative with limited voting powers in the U.S. House. The outgoing resident commissioner, Jenniffer González of the pro-statehood New Progressive Party, is running for governor. There’s another item on the ballot that involves Congress: statehood. Voters will be asked for a seventh time about Puerto Rico’s political status. The nonbinding referendum offers three options: statehood, independence and independence with free association, under which issues like foreign affairs, U.S. citizenship and use of the U.S. dollar would be negotiated. Regardless of the outcome, a change in status requires approval from Congress. Nearly 2 million voters are eligible to participate in Tuesday’s election, although it remains to be seen how many people will do so. Voter apathy has dominated recent elections. The post office is open today, but it may be too late to send your mail-in ballot The U.S. Postal Service is open as usual on Election Day, but before voters drop their ballots in they should check their state’s deadlines. Some states require mail-in ballots to arrive byElection Day. Others only require ballots to be postmarked by Election Day. And some states, too, allow mail-in ballots to be dropped off in ballot boxes or at polling places through Election Day. Voters should check their state election websites to determine the deadlines. Vance casts his ballot in Ohio Republican Vice Presidential candidate JD Vance voted in Cincinnati this morning. 'Look, I feel good. You never know until you know, but I feel good about this race,' Vance said after he and his wife cast their ballots. Vance said he would depart for Palm Beach, Florida, later today to be with Donald Trump as results come in. Trump and Harris are on the ballot in Puerto Rico. But it’s symbolic As a presidential campaign that engendered fury on the island over a comedian’s incendiary remarks at a Trump rally culminates, Puerto Ricans can support Harris or Trump in a symbolic vote if they wish. While Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens, those on the island are not allowed to vote in U.S. presidential elections. The election is still consequential, as voters will elect a new governor. If Jenniffer González of the pro-statehood New Progressive Party wins, it will mark the first time in the island’s history that the party secures three consecutive terms. If Juan Dalmau, who is running for Puerto Rico’s Independence Party and Citizen Victory Movement, wins, it will be the first win for a candidate not representing either of the two main parties that have dominated the island’s politics for decades. Voters also will be asked for a seventh time about Puerto Rico’s political status. Nearly 2 million voters in Puerto Rico are eligible to participate in Tuesday’s election, though it remains to be seen how many will do so. Voter apathy has dominated recent elections. Voters fend off stormy weather as they head to the polls It’s raining across much of the nation’s midsection this morning and forecasters say storms are possible in large swaths of the country later today. In Houston, local television cameras showed voters huddled together under umbrellas as they waited to enter polling locations. In Miami Lakes, Florida, at least one voter held a sample ballot over his head in a largely futile effort to fend off a quick downpour. And it’s not just rain in the forecast. Voters in Colorado and Montana might see snow later today, forecasters say. Andy Kim and Curtis Bashaw face off in a New Jersey Senate race opened up by a bribery scandal New Jersey voters are deciding between Democratic U.S. Rep. Andy Kim and hotel developer Curtis Bashaw, a Republican, in the race to fill the Senate seat occupied until recently by Democrat Bob Menendez, who resigned following a federal bribery conviction. The Senate race has attracted attention because of Democrats’ razor-thin majority. There’s little margin of error for the party in a state like New Jersey, which hasn’t elected a Republican to the Senate in more than 50 years. 'I very much feel the pressure to make sure that we’re delivering not just for New Jersey, but delivering a majority for this country so I can get the important things done,' Kim said recently. The contest pits Kim, a three-term House member from New Jersey’s 3rd District, against Bashaw, a first-time candidate and businessman from Cape May. Four others including Green, Libertarian and Socialist party candidates are on the ballot. ▶ Read more about New Jersey’s Senate race Voter Voice: ‘I was just waiting for this day to come’ In Scranton, Pennsylvania, Liza Fortt, a 74-year-old Black woman, arrived at her polling location in a wheelchair and not feeling well. But she ventured out anyway to vote for Harris. 'It means a lot to me and my grandkids, my granddaughters, my nieces. ... I was just waiting for this day to come,' Fortt said. She said she never thought she’d have such an opportunity, to cast a ballot for a Black woman in a presidential race. 'I’m proud, to see a woman, not only a woman, but a Black woman,' Fortt said. A Palm Beach precinct is preparing for Trump’s arrival at the polls In Palm Beach, Florida, precinct 5604 had a large police presence Tuesday morning, about an hour after polls opened. At least 15 officers — from local sheriff’s deputies to Secret Service agents — were seen using the same walkway that voters were utilizing on their walk into the polling location, preparing for Trump’s arrival. The former president is expected to vote there later in the day. The voting line flowed without interruption, with a steady stream throughout the early hours. Democratic Rep. Angie Craig seeks a 4th term in Minnesota’s tightest congressional race Democratic U.S. Rep. Angie Craig is seeking a fourth term in Minnesota’s tightest congressional race, a faceoff against Republican former federal prosecutor Joe Teirab. And in the race for the open seat being vacated by Democratic U.S. Rep. Dean Phillips, Kelly Morrison, a Democratic former state senator, was favored over retired Washington County District Judge Tad Jude. He’s a Republican who also served on the Hennepin County Board and in both chambers of the state Legislature, where in 1972 at age 20 he became the youngest member ever elected to the House. Craig and Teirab ran in the 2nd District, which includes a political mix of outer suburbs of Minneapolis and St. Paul south of the Minnesota River, and rural areas farther south that trend Republican. It’s Minnesota’s sole swing district. Morrison and Jude competed in the 3rd District, which includes suburbs surrounding Minneapolis and has gone Democratic in recent elections. ▶ Read more about Minnesota’s congressional races Federal judge says Missouri can’t block federal election monitors in St. Louis A federal judge says Missouri can’t block federal officials from observing elections in St. Louis. At issue is a settlement agreement with the St. Louis Board aimed at ensuring people with mobility and vision impairments can access polling places. The settlement was reached in 2021 under Trump’s Justice Department after federal officials found problems, such as ramps that were too steep and inaccessible parking, according to the court papers. But Missouri is among several states pushing back against federal election monitors. And on Monday, Missouri Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft argued in a lawsuit that state law 'clearly and specifically limits who may be in polling places.' He also accused the federal government of 'attempting to illegally interfere in Missouri’s elections.' U.S. District Judge Sarah Pitlyk wrote Monday night that the case boils down to two individuals at one polling place to ensure compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, as has happened at least twice before without any problems. 'Being prevented from enforcing its election laws may also be a harm to the State of Missouri, but that harm also has a counterweight in the United States’ interest in enforcing the ADA,' Pitlyk wrote. Bernie Sanders seeks a fourth Senate term representing Vermont Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent beloved by progressives, is seeking to win a fourth six-year term in the U.S. Senate on Tuesday. The 83-year-old senator is a self-described democratic socialist who caucuses with the Democrats and twice came close to winning the presidential nomination. More recently, he’s worked closely with the Biden administration to craft its domestic policy goals on health care, education, child care and workers’ rights. The longest-serving independent in Congress is being challenged by Republican Gerald Malloy, a U.S. Army veteran and businessman. Also on the ballot are independent Steve Berry, as well as minor party candidates Mark Stewart Greenstein, Matt Hill and Justin Schoville. Sanders says he’s running again because the country faces some of its toughest and most serious challenges of the modern era. He described those as threats to its democratic foundations, massive levels of income and wealth inequality, climate change, and challenges to women’s ability to control their own bodies. 'I just did not feel with my seniority and with my experience that I could walk away from Vermont, representing Vermont, at this difficult moment in American history,' he said at a recent WCAX-TV debate. Malloy, 62, who served 22 years in the Army and was a defense contractor for 16 years, said he thought Sanders was going to retire — and thinks he should — after 34 years in Congress. Malloy said Sanders isn’t delivering results. ▶ Read more about the Vermont Senate race Most Florida voters cast their ballot before Election Day When polls opened at 7 a.m. local time in Florida on Tuesday, a majority of the state’s registered voters had already cast a ballot early — including voting by mail and early in-person voting, according to an analysis of state data by the University of Florida Election Lab. Of those who waited to vote on Election Day, many were getting their civic duty out of the way early, according to elections officials. In Orange County, home to the city of Orlando, more than 4,700 people voted in the first 20 minutes of polls being open, according to a social media post by the county elections supervisor’s office. Attorneys general urge a ‘peaceful transfer of power’ The attorneys general from 47 states and three U.S. territories are urging people to remain peaceful and to preemptively 'condemn any acts of violence related to the results.' The statement, released Tuesday, was signed by chief prosecutors from every U.S. state except Indiana, Montana and Texas. Attorneys general from the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories of American Samoa, Northern Mariana Islands and U.S. Virgin Islands also signed. 'We call upon every American to vote, participate in civil discourse and, above all, respect the integrity of the democratic process,' they wrote. 'Violence has no place in the democratic process; we will exercise our authority to enforce the law against any illegal acts that threaten it.' Fears of election violence persist nearly four years after Trump supporters rioted at the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to stop the election certification. Rather than condemning the violence during his campaign, Trump has celebrated the rioters, pledging to pardon them and featuring a recorded chorus of prisoners in jail for their roles in the Jan. 6 attack singing the national anthem. Where are Trump and Harris? Trump spent the very early hours of Election Day in Michigan, where he wrapped up a late-night rally in Grand Rapids. The Republican candidate plans to spend the day in Florida, where he is expected to vote in person — despite previously saying he would vote early. He’s scheduled to hold a campaign watch party in Palm Beach on Tuesday night. Harris plans to attend an election night party at Howard University in Washington, a historically Black university where she graduated with a degree in economics and political science in 1986 and was an active member of Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority. Aside from Howard, she has no public schedule announced for Election Day. Harris said Sunday that she had 'just filled out' her mail-in ballot and it was 'on its way to California.' ▶ Read more on what to watch on Election Day DC braces for potential election-related violence Businesses around the White House on Tuesday morning continued to board up windows and erect temporary fencing, precautions being taken amid worries that Election Day — and the days ahead — could lead to unrest. DC Mayor Muriel Bowser says the police department is also stepping up its presence in commercial districts in all eight wards of the city. Metropolitan Police Chief Pamela Smith at a Monday new conference also sought to assure the city’s residents that her department is prepared for whatever Election Day might bring. 'Our team has been fully engaged and vigilant,' she said. 'We are the best in the country at what we do, and we will keep working around the clock to keep Washington, D.C., safe and keep our residents safe.' How Harris and Trump wrapped up the final day before the election Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump both spent the waning hours of their campaigns in the well-trodden swing states of Pennsylvania and Michigan, widely seen as critical to winning the White House. Harris wrapped her day in Philadelphia, where Lady Gaga sang 'God Bless America' and Oprah Winfrey appeared on stage with first-time voters. Ricky Martin, who is from Puerto Rico, was also there to draw out Puerto Rican voters turned off by a comedian who called their homeland a 'floating island of garbage' at a recent Trump rally. 'Our people-powered movement reflects a simple and undeniable truth: that we are all in this together,' Harris said. Harris didn’t arrive at the vice president’s residence, the Naval Observatory, until 1:41 a.m. Trump, meanwhile, spent the final hours of the day in Grand Rapids, Michigan, wrapping up around 2 a.m. He took shots at Harris for campaigning alongside celebrities. 'We don’t need a star because we have policy. We have great policy,' he said. Later, he boasted of his own stars: 'So many celebrities here, it’s incredible: Mike Pompeo, please stand up,' introducing his former secretary of state. Trump landed in Florida around 6 a.m. North Carolina voter reveals how he voted: ‘Carefully’ In Black Mountain, North Carolina, soil conservationist JD Jorgensen, 35, did not reveal what his presidential choice was after he voted around 7 a.m. But when asked how he voted, he said, 'Carefully.' 'I tried to do it as informed as I could be,' he added. 'I tried to stick to my values and just tried to pick candidates that align to those values and who I thought were going to be best for the offices they were running for.' Jorgensen said the choice he made was 'not really that tough.' 'I think that the candidates, both being in the public eye for as long as they have been, if you were on the fence you’re not really paying attention,' Jorgensen said.	https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-donald-trump-election-2024-a2352c1cc3289d206d21260c5dc34da8	2024-11-05T02:18:20-08:00	
Prince William walks nature trails near South Africa's Table Mountain to promote conservation	CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — Prince William went on an early-morning nature walk near South Africa's Table Mountain on Tuesday to promote the work of conservation rangers in a unique urban national park. The Prince of Wales and heir to the British throne met with some of the rangers who guard the Table Mountain National Park, an 85-square-mile (220-square kilometer) area that overlooks Cape Town and spills into the city's suburbs in some areas. William didn't go to the top of the famous flat-topped mountain, instead strolling through nature trails on Signal Hill, a foothill that sits by the ocean's edge. The prince was accompanied on the walk by Megan Taplin, the park manager, and Robert Irwin, an Australian conservationist and the son of the late Steve Irwin, who was known as 'The Crocodile Hunter.' William met with rangers, park firefighters and members of a K-9 dog unit. 'He got to learn about what they do on a daily basis and what challenges they face,' Taplin said. 'We also spoke a lot about ranger wellness and how that's really important that rangers are supported, that their families are supported, because they are doing quite dangerous work and difficult work.' William is in South Africa to promote his annual Earthshot Prize, which awards $1.2 million in grants to five entrepreneurs or organizations for innovative ideas that help the environment and combat climate change. William set up the Earthshot Prize in 2020 through his Royal Foundation and the awards ceremony will be held in Cape Town — the first time it's been in Africa — on Wednesday night. The prince's four-day visit is a kind of environmental roadshow and is heavily focused on climate and conservation, though he did break away from those issues on his first day in Cape Town on Monday to attend a rugby practice at a local high school and play a little of South Africa's favorite sport with some of the kids. William also met with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa at the president's Cape Town residence on Tuesday. The prince was joined by U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy, who is in the country for a bilateral meeting with South Africa's foreign minister. Cape Town is renowned for its natural beauty and while Table Mountain is its most iconic landmark, the national park forms part of the Cape Floral Kingdom, which is a UNESCO world heritage site. Some of the plants growing on the slopes of the mountain and across the wider Cape Peninsula are not found anywhere else in the world. William's engagements this week include meetings with young environmentalists, attending a wildlife summit, visiting a botanical garden and spending time at a sea rescue institute and with a Cape Town fishing community. At one event, he'll learn how seaweed is being used to help regenerate oceans. Officials said he will wear sustainable clothes during his visit to promote a climate-friendly clothing industry. William last visited Africa in 2018 but he has a long-standing connection to the continent. He traveled there as a boy after the death of his mother, Princess Diana, in a Paris car crash in 1997. He and his wife, Kate, got engaged at a wildlife conservancy in Kenya in 2010. And he said he came up with the idea for the Earthshot awards while in Namibia in 2018. Before the visit to Cape Town, William said that Africa has always had 'a special place in my heart.' William's brother, Prince Harry, also retains links to Africa and visited South Africa and neighboring Lesotho last month for a charity he set up in southern Africa. William's wife Kate, the Princess of Wales, and their children Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis did not travel to South Africa. Kate only recently returned to some public duties after completing treatment for an undisclosed type of cancer. ___ AP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa	https://apnews.com/article/prince-william-royal-british-south-africa-earthshot-04b295e44e6549e0fc362b31766f11f7	2024-11-05T01:42:07-08:00	
Tropical Storm Rafael near hurricane intensity as it barrels toward Cuba and Cayman Islands	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Tropical Storm Rafael strengthened to near hurricane intensity Tuesday night, as it barreled toward the Cayman Islands and Cuba, where it was forecast to hit as a hurricane. The storm was located 25 miles (45 kilometers) southeast of Little Cayman in the Cayman Islands on Tuesday after passing by Jamaica, where little damage was reported. It was picking up speed with maximum sustained winds of 70 mph (110 kph) and was moving northwest at 15 mph (24 kph), according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami. Hurricane force winds start at 74 mph. The center said it expected 'steady to rapid intensification' over the next 24 hours. It was expected to pass over or by the Cayman Islands on Tuesday night and make landfall in western Cuba on Wednesday. 'Rafael is expected to become a hurricane as it passes near the Cayman Islands with further strengthening before it makes landfall in Cuba,' the center said. The U.S. State Department issued an advisory for Cuba on Tuesday afternoon, offering departure flights to non-essential staff and American citizens, and advising others to 'reconsider travel to Cuba due to the potential impact of Tropical Storm Rafael.' Meanwhile, on Tuesday morning, the Cuban Civil Defense called on Cubans on social media to prepare as soon as possible, because when the storm makes landfall 'it’s important to stay where you are.' The day before, authorities said they had issued an evacuation order for 37,000 people in far eastern Cuba, in the province of Guantanamo, due to bad weather. A hurricane warning was in effect for the Cayman Islands and the Cuban provinces of Pinar del Rio, Artemisa, La Habana, Mayabeque, Matanzas and the Isle of Youth. A tropical storm warning was in effect for the Cuban provinces of Villa Clara, Cienfuegos, Sancti Spiritus and Ciego de Avila, as well as the lower and middle Florida Keys from Key West to west of the Channel 5 Bridge, and Dry Tortugas. The warning was lifted in Jamaica after the storm passed by the western coast. A tropical storm watch was in effect for the Cuban provinces of Camaguey and Las Tunas. 'The storm is currently situated in an atmospheric and oceanic environment that is quite conducive for strengthening,' the hurricane center said. In the Cayman Islands, officials closed schools and government offices as they urged residents to prepare. Long lines were reported at grocery stores as the storm approached. The storm is bad news for Cuba, which is still struggling to recover from Hurricane Oscar, which battered the island about two weeks ago after making landfall in the eastern part of Cuba, killing at least six people. The storm also coincided with a large-scale blackout on the island. Forecasters warned Rafael would unleash heavy rains across the western Caribbean that could lead to flooding and mudslides in parts of Cuba and the Cayman Islands. Heavy rainfall also was expected to spread north into Florida and nearby areas of the southeast U.S. during the middle to late part of the week. The Hurricane Center predicted storm surges in Florida could reach 1 to 3 feet in Dry Tortugas and 1 to 2 feet in the Lower Florida Keys. A few tornadoes also were expected Wednesday over the Keys and southwesternmost Florida mainland. Rafael is the 17th named storm of the season. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted the 2024 hurricane season was likely to be well above average, with between 17 and 25 named storms. The forecast called for as many as 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes. An average Atlantic hurricane season produces 14 named storms, seven of them hurricanes and three major hurricanes.	https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-rafael-caribbean-cuba-cayman-islands-a6e887bf385bddae926629ed8aa0ea53	2024-11-05T01:22:03-08:00	
An Israeli airstrike kills 20 people in northern Gaza, Palestinian officials say	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — An Israeli airstrike in northern Gaza has killed at least 20 people, mostly women and children, Palestinian officials said Tuesday, as Israel wages a nearly monthlong air and ground operation in what was already the most isolated and heavily destroyed part of the territory. The strike late Monday hit a home where several displaced families were sheltering in the town of Beit Lahiya, near the border with Israel, according to Hossam Abu Safiya, the director of the recently raided and barely functioning Kamal Adwan Hospital, which received the casualties. The Israeli military said it targeted a weapons storage facility from which a militant had operated, and that 'numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians.' The dead included eight women and six children, according to a list provided by the Gaza Health Ministry’s emergency service. Separate strikes elsewhere in Gaza early Tuesday killed another 10 people, according to health officials. Israel launched the offensive in the north after saying Hamas militants had regrouped there. The army has returned to several areas of Gaza multiple times after previous operations, as Hamas continues to carry out hit-and-run attacks on troops and fire occasional rockets into Israel. The military has ordered the complete evacuation of Beit Lahiya, the nearby town of Beit Hanoun and the urban Jabaliya refugee camp, and has allowed almost no humanitarian aid into the area for over a month. That has drawn rebukes from the Biden administration, which has warned that U.S. laws might force it to curb military aid to Israel if more aid is not allowed in. The U.N. estimates about 100,000 people remain in the area, after tens of thousands of people fled to nearby Gaza City since Israel’s offensive there began, the latest wave of displacement within the besieged territory. Around 90% of the population of 2.3 million have fled during the 13-month-old war, often multiple times. The three hospitals serving the area have been largely inaccessible because of the fighting, and ambulances have stopped operating. Israeli troops raided Kamal Adwan Hospital last month, saying Hamas militants were sheltering there, allegations denied by Palestinian health officials. The offensive has raised fears among Palestinians that Israel is implementing a surrender-or-starve plan for northern Gaza proposed by former generals, in which civilians would be ordered out, aid would be cut off and anyone remaining would be considered a fighter. The Israeli military has denied receiving such orders, but the government has not said whether it is adopting part or all of the plan. Palestinian officials said a separate wave of Israeli strikes early Tuesday killed 10 people, including four children and two women. One strike hit a house in the Tufah neighborhood in Gaza City, killing two children and their parents, according to the Health Ministry’s emergency service. Two other children were wounded, it said. In the central town of Zuweida, an Israeli airstrike hit a tent where a displaced family was sheltering, killing four people, including a mother and her two children, according to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the nearby city of Deir al-Balah. Another strike hit a house in Deir al-Balah, killing two people, the hospital said. An Associated Press journalist counted the bodies at the hospital morgue. The Israeli military says it only targets militants and accuses them of hiding among civilians. It rarely comments on individual strikes, which often kill women and children. The war began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, taking another 250 people hostage. Around 100 captives are still inside Gaza, about a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed over 43,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its toll but says over half of those killed were women and children. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

Pakistani guard shoots, wound 2 Chinese working in a textile mill in Karachi	KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) — A Pakistani guard shot and wounded two Chinese nationals working in a textile mill in the southern port city of Karachi on Tuesday, but authorities said the attack was not related to militant violence. China has frequently demanded better security for its nationals working in Pakistan. Last month, two Chinese were killed in a suicide car bombing outside the Karachi airport. Thousands of Chinese are in Pakistan to work for Beijing’s multibillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative, which is building major infrastructure projects. An unknown number of Chinese are also working at factories in the country. Suhail Jokhoio, the spokesperson for the provincial home department, said the guard involved in the textile mill attack was arrested and police are still investigating to determine why the man to opened fire. He said the wounded Chinese were taken to a hospital. Pakistan has said it is committed to providing full security to Chinese working in the country.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-chinese-attack-4520da93c7281a616588ead0ed7a43a1	2024-11-04T23:25:27-08:00	
Qataris decide whether to end limited voting for legislative seats in shadow of US election	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Qatar opened a snap poll Tuesday to decide whether to end its limited voting for legislative seats, a measure likely to pass and end its short-lived experiment in electing members of the country’s advisory Shura Council. Voting began as the world's attention focused on the U.S. presidential election, with even Qatar’s state-funded satellite news network Al Jazeera offering brief acknowledgments of the vote wedged between coverage of the U.S. and the Mideast wars. Though Qatar's ruling emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, announced last month a vote would take place, it was only Sunday that authorities announced the date of the poll. Voting will run until 7 p.m. (1600 GMT) and results are expected on Wednesday. All Qatari employees in the country also were granted permission to leave work beginning from 11 a.m. to vote. Qatar's state news agency described the voting as 'an enthusiastic atmosphere and a historic moment, clearly confirming everyone’s keenness to make this national celebration a success.' The vote will 'strengthen the social fabric in the most beautiful image and form, which honestly represents an important stage in the country’s victorious march and its national unity,' the news agency added. Qatar first introduced plans for legislative elections in its 2003 constitution, but authorities repeatedly postponed implementing the vote. The country finally held elections for two-thirds of the Shura Council, which drafts laws, approves state budgets and advises the ruler, in October 2021. The elections came after the end of a boycott of Qatar by Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates that tore the Gulf Arab states apart. It also came about a year ahead of Qatar hosting the 2022 FIFA World Cup, an event that drew intense scrutiny from the West of the country's treatment of foreign laborers and its system of governance. Qatar remains an important nation to the West as it hosted the Taliban and assisted in the chaotic 2021 NATO withdrawal from Afghanistan and as a mediator as the Israel-Hamas war rages in the Gaza Strip and has expanded to Lebanon. But the election created problems in the energy-rich nation. Electoral law distinguishes between born and naturalized Qatari citizens and bars the latter from electoral participation. Human Rights Watch described the system as 'discriminatory,' excluding thousands of Qataris from running or voting. The disqualifications sparked minor protests that led to several arrests. In announcing the vote on changing the constitution, Sheikh Tamim said: 'The contest between candidates for membership in the Shura Council took place within families and tribes, and there are different views regarding the repercussions of such competition on our norms, traditions, as well as the conventional social institutions and their cohesion.' 'The contest assumes an identity-based character that we are not equipped to handle, with potential complications over time that we would rather avoid,' he added. The vote marks yet another rollback in the hereditarily ruled Gulf Arab states of halting steps to embrace representational rule following efforts by the United States to push harder for democratic reforms in the Middle East after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Hopes for democracy in the region also rose in the wake of the 2011 Arab Spring. In May, the ruler of oil-rich Kuwait dissolved his country’s parliament for as much as four years. While the Kuwaiti parliament had struggled, it represented the Gulf Arab state’s most free-wheeling legislative body and could challenge the country’s rulers.	https://apnews.com/article/qatar-constitutional-amendment-vote-elections-9c9125cb4bb6d6e98bc73cf5a7cbdaea	2024-11-04T22:54:08-08:00	
Indonesian rescuers dig through volcanic ash after eruption kills 9 and destroys buildings	MAUMERE, Indonesia (AP) — Rescue workers on Tuesday were sifting through smoldering debris and thick mud in search of survivors, a day after a volcano on Indonesia’s remote island of Flores erupted with fury, killing at least nine people with its searing lava and ash. Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki spewed thick brownish ash as high as 2,000 meters (6,500 feet) into the air, and searing lava, gravel and ash were thrown up to seven kilometers (4.3 miles) from its crater, blanketing nearby villages and towns with tons of volcanic debris and forcing residents to flee. The National Disaster Management Agency on Tuesday lowered the known death toll from an earlier report of 10, saying it had received updated information from rescuers that a victim trapped under tons of debris in a collapsed house who was feared dead was eventually rescued alive and was now in critical condition at a hospital. The agency said 63 other people were hospitalized, 31 of them with serious injuries. More than 2,400 villagers streamed into makeshift emergency shelters after Monday's powerful eruption that burned down seven schools and 23 houses, including a convent of nuns, on the majority-Catholic island, said the agency’s spokesperson, Abdul Muhari. Smoldering debris, thick mud and a power blackout hampered the evacuation and search efforts, said Kensius Didimus, a local disaster agency chief, 'We’ll do everything we can to evacuate villagers by preparing trucks and motorbikes for them to flee at any time,' he said, adding that the debris and lava mixed with rainfall formed thick mud that destroyed the main roads on the island. Authorities warned the thousands of people who fled the volcano’s wrath not to return during Tuesday’s lull in activity. But some were desperate to check on livestock and possessions left behind. In several areas, everything — from the thinnest tree branch to couches and chairs inside homes — was caked with ash. Videos released by the National Search and Rescue Agency showed roads that were covered in heavy gray ash and houses covered by thick gray mud, rocks and uprooted trees. The country’s geology agency said a series of eruptions since Thursday had created an accumulation of hidden energy due to a blockage of magma in the crater, which reduced detectible seismic activity while building up pressure. 'The eruptions have eased pressure that had been building under a lava dome perched on the crater,' said Priatin Hadi Wijaya, who heads the Center for Volcanology and Disaster Mitigation. 'But we should anticipate hot ash and debris could tumble down from the crater due to heavy rains.' Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto has instructed his Cabinet and disaster and military officials to coordinate the response, said Coordinating Minister for Human Development and Culture Pratikno, who like many Indonesians uses a single name. The country’s volcano monitoring agency increased the volcano’s alert status to the highest level and more than doubled the exclusion zone to a seven-kilometer (4.3-mile) radius after midnight on Monday as eruptions became more frequent. Lewotobi Laki Laki is one of a pair of stratovolcanoes in the East Flores district of East Nusa Tenggara province known locally as the husband and wife mountains. 'Laki laki' means husband, while its mate is Lewotobi Perempuan, or woman. About 6,500 people were evacuated in January after Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki began erupting, spewing thick clouds and forcing the government to close the island’s Frans Seda Airport. No casualties or major damage were reported, but the airport has remained closed since then due to seismic activity. This is Indonesia’s second volcanic eruption in as many weeks. West Sumatra province’s Mount Marapi, one of the country’s most active volcanos, erupted on Oct. 27, spewing thick columns of ash at least three times and blanketing nearby villages with debris, but no casualties were reported. Lewotobi Laki Laki is one of the 120 active volcanoes in Indonesia, an archipelago of 280 million people. The country is prone to earthquakes, landslides and volcanic activity because it sits along the 'Ring of Fire,' a horseshoe-shaped series of seismic fault lines around the Pacific Ocean. ___ Niniek Karmini and Andi Jatmiko in Jakarta, Indonesia, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/indonesia-volcano-eruption-3300ed5bc84ed023465eef626007a2c9	2024-11-04T22:47:57-08:00	
Middle East latest: Israeli strikes kill 10 people in Gaza and 2 in the West Bank	Israeli strikes early Tuesday killed 10 people in the Gaza Strip, including four children and two women, Palestinian officials say. In the occupied West Bank, Israeli forces killed two people in an airstrike and shot a third person dead. Despite growing pressure from the United States and others in the international community for a cease-fire in Gaza and Lebanon, intensified Israeli strikes against the Hezbollah militant group are expanding beyond Lebanon’s border areas. Israel is also fighting a seemingly endless war against Hamas in northern Gaza. Since the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah erupted in 2023, at least 3,000 people have been killed and some 13,500 wounded in Lebanon, the Health Ministry reports. More than a year of Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 people, Palestinian health officials say. They do not distinguish between civilians and combatants, but say more than half of those killed were women and children. The war began after Palestinian militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. ___ Here’s the latest: Israeli strikes kill 10 in Gaza DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Palestinian officials say Israeli strikes early Tuesday killed 10 people in the Gaza Strip, including four children and two women. One strike hit a house in the Tufah neighborhood in Gaza City, killing two children and their parents, according to the Gaza Health Ministry’s emergency service. Two other children were wounded, it said. In the central town of Zuweida, an Israeli airstrike hit a tent where a displaced family was sheltering, killing four people, including a mother and her two children, according to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the nearby city of Deir al-Balah. Another strike hit a house in Deir al-Balah, killing two people, the hospital said. An Associated Press journalist counted the bodies at the hospital morgue. The Israeli military says it only targets militants and accuses them of hiding among civilians. It rarely comments on individual strikes, which often kill women and children. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking another 250 hostage. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s offensive has killed over 43,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which says over half were women and children. It does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. Israeli forces kill 3 people in the occupied West Bank RAMALLAH, West Bank — Palestinian officials say Israeli forces have killed three people in the occupied West Bank. Two were killed in an airstrike early Tuesday near the northern city of Jenin, a flashpoint for Israeli-Palestinian violence in recent years. A third person was shot in the village of Tamoun, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. The Israeli military said it called in an airstrike on a militant cell near Jenin. There was no immediate comment on the shooting. Israeli forces have carried out near-daily military raids in the West Bank since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack out of the Gaza Strip triggered the Israel-Hamas war. The Health Ministry says at least 767 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since then. Most appear to have been militants killed in battles with Israeli forces, but the dead also include civilian bystanders and people killed during protests. Israel says the raids are aimed at dismantling Hamas in the West Bank and preventing attacks. Palestinians have carried out dozens of stabbing, shooting and car-ramming attacks against Israelis since the start of the war. Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war, and the Palestinians want it to form the main part of their future state.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-hezbollah-mideast-latest-5-november-2024-c2a90bdb0fdd4f3f643e20114fd70e0a	2024-11-04T22:41:51-08:00	
A tiny village in India where Kamala Harris has ancestral roots is praying for her victory	THULASENDRAPURAM, India (AP) — The temple reverberated with rhythmic Sanskrit and Tamil hymns, as a Hindu priest held a flame before the god. As this tiny South Indian village gathered to pray for Kamala Harris, a gaggle of reporters jostled for space and camera angles. There's little to distinguish the village of Thulasendrapuram from any other rural community in Tamil Nadu, except its connection to a woman who could become America's first leader with South Asian roots. As millions of Americans vote, Harris has people rooting for her from thousands of miles away in a village surrounded by rice paddies and coconut trees, where her mother's family has ancestral ties. They talk about her at the local tea shop. Banners and billboards bearing her face are seen throughout the community. 'Our deity is a very powerful God. If we pray well to him, he will make her victorious,' said M. Natarajan, the temple priest that led the prayers in front of the image of Hindu deity Ayyanar, a form of Lord Shiva. Harris’ maternal grandfather was born in the village, about 350 kilometers (215 miles) from the southern coastal city of Chennai, more than 100 years ago. As an adult, he moved to Chennai, where he worked as a high-ranking government official until his retirement. Harris has never visited Thulasendrapuram and she has no living relatives in the village, but people here still venerate the family that made it big in the U.S. 'Our village ancestors' granddaughter is running as a U.S. presidential candidate. Her victory will be happy news for every one of us,' Natarajan said. The village's sudden fame has helped bring money into the village. Recently, construction began on a water storage tank with funds donated by a local bank. Village residents say it will carry a plaque with Harris’ name. Harris’ late mother, Shyamala Gopalan, was born in India. After moving to the U.S. to study, she married a Jamaican man, and they named their daughter Kamala, a Sanskrit word for 'lotus flower.' Other than trips during her childhood, Harris hasn’t visited India much — particularly not since becoming vice president — but she has often spoken emotionally about her ties to her late mother’s country of birth. On Tuesday, she released a campaign video highlighting her mother, who arrived in the U.S. at age 19 and became a cancer researcher. Titled 'Mother,' the video ends with a narrator saying: 'This daughter of Shyamala, this daughter of the American story, is ready to lead us forward.' Harris has often talked about how she was guided by the values of her Indian-born grandfather and mother. She has also spoken of her love of south Indian food, especially a type of steamed rice cake called idli. Harris’ name is engraved in a list of donors — her aunt Sarala Gopalan gave money to the temple in her name — along with that of her grandfather. Outside, a large banner wishes 'the daughter of the land' success in the election. On Tuesday, the village temple also received rare international visitors: two American tourists and one from the U.K., all wearing black t-shirts that said 'Kamala Freakin Harris.' Manikandan Ganesan, a villager who runs a small store near the temple, said Harris’ bid for the presidency has made the village famous. He hopes Harris will eventually visit them. 'Even if she mentioned that she would visit our village, it would make us very happy,' Ganesan said. 'Her victory itself will be a big source of happiness for us.' Village residents also prayed for Harris’ victory in 2020, and set off firecrackers when she became the U.S. Vice President. For women of the village, the candidate's journey is a source of inspiration. Local politician Arulmozhi Sudhakar said Harris embodies a significant step toward female empowerment in places like Thulasendrapuram, where a majority of women continue to face discrimination and gender inequality. 'From the time when women were not even allowed to step out of their house, to now a woman from our village contesting in the U.S. presidential election — this brings happiness for us,' Sudhakar said. 'The coming generations will see her as a role model to succeed in life.'	https://apnews.com/article/india-kamala-harris-village-us-election-a2c1bf50db407b8e9503d763bc9fd572	2024-11-04T22:37:57-08:00	
Puerto Rico holds general election that promises to be historic	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Puerto Rico is holding elections that will be historic regardless of which of the top two gubernatorial candidates wins. If Jenniffer González of the pro-statehood New Progressive Party wins Tuesday's election, it will mark the first time in the island’s history that the party secures three consecutive terms. If Juan Dalmau, who is running for Puerto Rico’s Independence Party and Citizen Victory Movement, wins, it will be the first win for a candidate not representing either of the two main parties that have dominated the island’s politics for decades. Trailing González and Dalmau in polls is Jesús Manuel Ortiz of the Popular Democratic Party, which supports the island’s territorial status. Also running is Javier Jiménez of Project Dignity, a conservative party created in 2019. For decades, the New Progressive Party and the Popular Democratic Party would receive at least 90% of all votes, but that began to change in 2016, with newer parties attracting more voters amid economic and political turmoil. 'That has been a very big change,' said Jorge Schmidt Nieto, a political analyst and university professor. Delayed results Results are not expected late Tuesday, with analysts warning it might be a couple of days before that happens. During the 2020 elections, it took officials four days to release preliminary results. Puerto Rico’s State Elections Commission is still counting more than 220,000 early and absentee votes it received, with officials from various political parties noting the process is slow-going. The counting of those votes began more than two weeks later than usual. Jessika Padilla, the commission’s alternate president, said in a press conference that some 40% of those votes had been counted as of Monday. 'This validation process is one that we are not going to take lightly,' she said. More than 5,000 inmates out of some 7,400 total in Puerto Rico also have voted, although it’s unclear how many of those votes have been counted. The commission and other officials also are still receiving allegations about electoral crimes, including from people who said they received confirmations for early voting when they made no such request. Meanwhile, energy generators have been dispatched to more than two dozen polling stations to guarantee electricity given the chronic power outages that have plagued Puerto Rico in recent years. A status question and a symbolic vote On Tuesday, voters also will be asked for a seventh time about Puerto Rico’s political status. The nonbinding referendum offers three options: statehood, independence and independence with free association, under which issues like foreign affairs, U.S. citizenship and use of the U.S. dollar would be negotiated. Regardless of the outcome, a change in status requires approval from the U.S. Congress. In addition, Puerto Ricans on Tuesday can support Kamala Harris or Donald Trump in a symbolic vote if they wish. While Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens, those on the island are not allowed to vote in U.S. presidential elections. Nearly 2 million voters are eligible to participate in Tuesday’s election, although it remains to be seen how many people will do so. Voter apathy has dominated recent elections. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/puerto-rico-elections-dalmau-jenniffer-f32de13cb3d7aad4f4264d1b3d86352f	2024-11-04T20:06:25-08:00	
Australian foreign minister raises allegations with Indian counterpart of targeting Sikhs in Canada	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Australia’s foreign minister said Tuesday she raised allegations with her Indian counterpart that India has targeted Sikh activists in Canada. Foreign Minister Penny Wong said she discussed the Canadian allegations with Indian Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar while he was in the Australian capital, Canberra. India has denied Canada’s allegation that Indian Home Minister Amit Shah ordered the targeting of Sikh activists inside Canada. Wong said her message to the Sikh community was that people have a right to be safe and respected in Australia, regardless of who they are. 'We’ve made clear our concerns about the allegations under investigation. We’ve said that we respect Canada’s judicial process,' Wong said at a news conference with Jaishankar. 'We convey our views to India as you would expect us to do and we have a principled position in relation to matters such as the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary and also, frankly, the sovereignty of all countries,' she added. Jaishankar said Canada has put Indian diplomats under surveillance, which was 'unacceptable.' 'Canada has developed a pattern of making allegations without providing specifics,' he said. Australia has close intelligence-sharing ties with Canada as members of the Five Eyes alliance that also includes the United States, Britain and New Zealand. Over the weekend, India officially protested Canada's allegation of Sikh activists being targeted there as 'absurd and baseless.' Jaishankar on Tuesday also condemned reports of vandalism at a Hindu temple near Toronto in Canada on Sunday as 'deeply concerning.' In videos on social media, demonstrators carrying yellow flags in support of the Sikh separatist movement can be seen clashing with others, including some holding India's national flag, inside the temple complex. Indian consular officials were visiting the temple where the clashes erupted. It was unclear how the violence began. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the violence at the temple 'unacceptable,' adding that 'every Canadian has the right to practice their faith freely and safely.' The attack on the temple also drew a strong rebuke from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday. 'Equally appalling are the cowardly attempts to intimidate our diplomats. Such acts of violence will never weaken India’s resolve,' he wrote on the social media platform X, adding that India expects Canada to ensure justice. Relations between the two countries soured after Trudeau said last year there were credible allegations the Indian government had links to the assassination of Sikh activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Canada. India has vehemently rejected the accusation. New Delhi, long anxious about Sikh separatist groups, has increasingly accused the Canadian government of giving free rein to separatists from a once-strong movement to create an independent Sikh homeland, known as Khalistan, in India. The diplomatic row led to the expulsion of each side's top diplomats last month. Jaishankar said, 'We believe in freedoms, but we also believe freedom should not be misused.' Canada is not the only country that has accused Indian officials of plotting an assassination on foreign soil. The United States Justice Department announced criminal charges in mid-October against an Indian government employee in connection with an alleged foiled plot to kill a Sikh separatist leader living in New York City. The Justice Department said Vikash Yadav, who authorities say directed the New York plot from India, faces murder-for-hire charges in an alleged planned killing that prosecutors have previously said was meant to precede a string of other politically motivated murders in the United States and Canada. ___ Associated Press writer Krutika Pathi in New Delhi contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/australia-india-canada-sikh-foreign-minister-4aa2d7dfdc83212fcb77c3f38fe5f1bb	2024-11-04T19:56:30-08:00	
Stock market today: World shares are mixed as investors eye the US election	World shares were mixed on Tuesday, with major benchmarks in Asia gaining more than 1%, as investors awaited the outcome of the U.S. presidential election and other potentially market-rattling events this week. This week brings bring various potential flashpoints, among them Election Day in the United States. But the results may not be known for some time as officials count all the votes, and the uncertainty could roil markets. Adding to the potential for volatility, the Federal Reserve will also be meeting on interest rates later this week. The widespread expectation is for it to cut its main interest rate for a second straight time. The futures for the S&amp;P 500 and for the Dow Jones Industrial Average were 0.1% higher. In early European trading, Germany's DAX edged 0.1% lower to 19,125.18 while the CAC 40 in Paris shed 0.2% to 7,356.02. Britain's FTSE 100 was down 0.1% at 8,179.73. Share prices surged on Chinese markets as investors anticipated moves by Beijing to boost the world’s second-largest economy during a meeting of the Standing Committee of China’s National People’s Congress. Hong Kong's Hang Seng jumped 2.1% to 21,006.97, while the Shanghai Composite index surged 2.3% to 3,386.99. Officials are expected to endorse major spending initiatives to boost economic growth amid troubles for the country’s real-estate industry. The official Xinhua News Agency reported that the lawmakers had reviewed legislation to raise ceilings on local government debt to replace existing hidden debts, part of a plan announced earlier to arrange debt swaps to help resolve the financial woes brought on by the pandemic and by a collapse in the property market in recent years. So far, no specific amount of funding for such efforts has been announced. Elsewhere in Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 index gained 1.1% to 38,474.90, reopening after a holiday on Monday. South Korea's Kospi fell 0.4% to 2,576,88 after the country's military said North Korea launched multiple short-range ballistic missiles toward its eastern sea, continuing its weapons demonstrations ahead of the U.S. presidential election. The S&amp;P/ASX 200 in Australia dropped 0.4% to 8,131.80 as the central bank kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged. On Monday, the S&amp;P 500 slipped 0.3%, remaining near its record set last month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.6%, while the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.3%. The hope that’s propelled U.S. stock indexes to records recently is that the U.S. economy can remain resilient and avoid a long-feared recession, in part because of the coming cuts to rates expected from the Fed. The broad U.S. stock market has historically risen regardless of which party wins the White House. And in 2020, U.S. stocks climbed immediately after Election Day and kept going even after former President Donald Trump refused to concede and challenged the results, creating plenty of uncertainty. A large part of that rally was due to excitement about the potential for a vaccine for COVID-19, which had just shut down the global economy. A Trump victory would be less of a surprise to markets this time around than in 2016, when Treasury yields soared on expectations for tax cuts that could further inflate the nation’s debt or fuel a stronger U.S economy. In the oil market early Tuesday, the price for a barrel of U.S. crude gained 27 cents to $71.74. On Monday, it rose 2.8% after Saudi Arabia and other oil producers said they would delay plans to increase the amount of crude they produced. Brent crude, the international standard, advanced 23 cents to $75.31 per barrel. It rose 2.7% on Monday. The price of Brent is still down for the year so far, in part because of worries about how much demand will come from China given its economic challenges. In currency dealings, the dollar rose to 152.36 Japanese yen from 152.10 yen. The euro climbed to $1.0886 from $1.0880.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-election-china-f7739620ddf23f012aa2ba7559e2f486	2024-11-04T17:28:09-08:00	
Kenyan man is convicted of plotting a 9/11-style attack on the US	NEW YORK (AP) — A Kenyan man was convicted Monday of plotting a 9/11-style attack on a U.S. building on behalf of the terrorist organization al-Shabab. A federal jury in Manhattan found Cholo Abdi Abdullah guilty on all six counts he faced for conspiring to hijack an aircraft and slam it into a building, according to court records. He’s due to be sentenced next March and faces a mandatory minimum of 20 years in prison. Abdullah represented himself during the trial, which opened last week. He declined to give an opening statement and did not actively participate in questioning witnesses. In court papers filed ahead of the trial, prosecutors said Abdullah intended to 'merely sit passively during the trial, not oppose the prosecution and whatever the outcome, he would accept the outcome because he does not believe that this is a legitimate system.' Lawyers appointed to assist Abdullah in his self-defense didn't respond to an email seeking comment Monday. Federal prosecutors, who rested their case Thursday, said Abdullah plotted the attack for four years, undergoing extensive training in explosives and how to operate in secret and avoid detection. He then moved to the Philippines in 2017 where he began training as a commercial pilot. Abdullah was almost finished with his two-year pilot training when he was arrested in 2019 on local charges. He was transferred the following year to U.S. law enforcement authorities, who charged him with terrorism related crimes. Prosecutors said Abdullah also researched how to breach a cockpit door and information 'about the tallest building in a major U.S. city' before he was caught. The State Department in 2008 designated al-Shabab, which means 'the youth' in Arabic, as a foreign terrorist organization. The militant group is an al-Qaida affiliate that has fought to establish an Islamic state in Somalia based on Shariah law.	https://apnews.com/article/alshabab-9-11-plot-cc02311a9658695f172054a380e59963	2024-11-04T15:54:11-08:00	
Russian rocket launches Iranian satellites into orbit as Moscow and Tehran expand ties	MOSCOW (AP) — A Russian rocket on Tuesday blasted off successfully to carry a pair of Iranian satellites into orbit, a launch that reflected growing cooperation between Moscow and Tehran. The Soyuz rocket lifted off as scheduled from Vostochny launchpad in far eastern Russia and put its payload into a designated orbit nine minutes after the launch. It was carrying two Russian Ionosphere-M Earth observation satellites and several dozen smaller satellites, including the two Iranian ones. Iran’s two satellites, named Kowsar and Hodhod, were the first launched on behalf of the country’s private sector. In 2022, a Russian rocket launched an Iranian Earth observation satellite called Khayyam that was built in Russia on Tehran’s order, and in February Russia put another Iranian satellite named Pars-1 into orbit. Tuesday's launch comes as Russia and Iran have expanded ties in various spheres. Ukraine and the West have accused Tehran of providing Moscow with hundreds of exploding drones for use on the battlefield in Ukraine and helped launch their production in Russia. The Iranian drone deliveries, which Moscow and Tehran have denied, have allowed for a constant barrage of long-range drone strikes at Ukraine’s infrastructure. Moscow and Tehran are planning to further bolster their ties with a 'comprehensive strategic partnership' that is set to be signed during Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian’s planned visit to Russia. The date for that visit hasn’t been set yet, but the Kremlin said it could happen soon. Tuesday’s successful launch of the Iranian satellites atop a Russian rocket follows a series of failed launches suffered by Iran’s civilian space program in recent years. There have been five failed launches in a row for the Simorgh program, a satellite-carrying rocket. A fire at the Imam Khomeini Spaceport in February 2019 killed three researchers, authorities said at the time. A launchpad rocket explosion later that year drew the attention of then-President Donald Trump, who taunted Iran with a tweet showing what appeared to be a U.S. surveillance photo of the site. At the same time, a separate Iranian space program run by the country’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard has seen successful launches from a military base outside of Shahroud, some 350 kilometers (215 miles) east of the capital, Tehran. However, satellite images analyzed by The Associated Press show Israel likely bombed the site during its Oct. 26 retaliatory strike on Iran. The U.S. intelligence community’s worldwide threat assessment this year said Iran’s development of satellite launch vehicles 'would shorten the timeline' for Iran to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile because it uses similar technology. Intercontinental ballistic missiles can be used to deliver nuclear weapons. Iran is now producing uranium close to weapons-grade levels after the collapse of its nuclear deal with world powers. Tehran has enough enriched uranium for 'several' nuclear weapons, if it chooses to produce them, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency has warned. Iran has always denied seeking nuclear weapons and says its space program, like its nuclear activities, is for purely civilian purposes. However, U.S. intelligence agencies and the IAEA say Iran had an organized military nuclear program up until 2003.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-iran-satellites-space-launch-944a6bc87aa2511e38acf58e37c02c28	2024-11-04T14:49:34-08:00

Belarus' authoritarian ruler will face only token challengers in presidential vote	TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — Belarus' election commission on Monday allowed seven politicians loyal to President Alexander Lukashenko to start collecting signatures to run against him in January's election, in an apparent bid to create a semblance of competition to the longtime authoritarian ruler. Lukashenko, who has ruled the country for more than 30 years, is seeking a seventh term following a relentless crackdown on the opposition and free media. The election, scheduled for Jan. 26, would come 4 1/2 years after the 2020 presidential vote that was rejected by the opposition and the West as rigged with fraud and triggered massive nationwide protests. Belarusian authorities responded to the demonstrations with a sweeping crackdown on dissent, resulting in about 65,000 people arrested. Major opposition figures were either imprisoned or fled the country in the crackdown. Human rights activists say Belarus now holds about 1,300 political prisoners and that many of them are denied adequate medical care and contact with their families. Lukashenko has relied on subsidies and political support from his main ally, Russia, to survive the protests. He allowed Moscow to use Belarusian territory to send troops into Ukraine in February 2022. Last week, Belarus' Central Election Commission registered an initiative group for Lukashenko to prepare for the race. On Monday, it also permitted seven politicians to begin collecting signatures to be able to run, including Sergei Syrankov of the Communist Party, Oleg Gaidukevich, the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party, and former Interior Ministry spokeswoman Olga Chеmоdanova. 'Those are alternative candidates, and I believe they just want to safeguard the incumbent,' Lukashenko said of his aspiring token challengers. Each of the candidates is required to collect at least 100,000 signatures until Dec. 6 to enter the race. Last week, the commission refused to register initiative groups for two opposition politicians who aspired to enter the race. 'There are candidates, but no competition in this election,' said Valery Karbalevich, an independent political analyst. 'Lukashenko fears a replay of the 2020 protests, his trauma is still fresh and so he will carry out the vote in a format when the result is predetermined.' Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who is in exile after challenging Lukashenko in the 2020 presidential election, denounced January's vote as a farce and urged Belarusians to vote against all candidates. 'We are offering people to voice their protest by voting against all those who are robbing us of our right to vote,' said Tsikhanouskaya, whose husband Siarhei Tsikhanouski is serving a 19 1/2-year prison sentence after trying to run against Lukashenko. 'This is not an election but an imitation of an electoral process held amid terror when alternative candidates and observers aren't allowed.' During February's parliamentary and local elections, in which only candidates loyal to Lukashenko were allowed to compete, Belarus for the first time also refused to invite observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to monitor the vote.	https://apnews.com/article/belarus-election-lukashenko-crackdown-29a9853ffa5d542cdcca389097364c1b	2024-11-04T13:56:26-08:00	
North Korea fired a ballistic missile toward its eastern sea, South Korea's military says	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea on Tuesday fired at least one ballistic missile toward its eastern sea, according to the South Korean military, as the country continued its weapons demonstrations hours before the U.S. presidential elections. South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff on Tuesday didn’t immediately say what type of missile it was or how far it flew. Japan’s Defense Ministry said the missile was believed to have already landed at sea. The launch came days after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un supervised a flight test of the country’s newest intercontinental ballistic missile designed to reach the U.S. mainland. In response to that launch, the United States flew a long-range B-1B bomber in a trilateral drill with South Korea and Japan on Sunday in a show of force. That drew condemnation from Kim’s powerful sister, who on Tuesday accused the North’s rivals of raising tensions with 'aggressive and adventuristic military threats.' North Korean state media claimed last week that the Hwasong-19 it tested on Oct. 31 was 'the world’s strongest' ICBM, but experts say the solid-fuel missile was too big to be useful in a war situation. Experts say the North has yet to acquire some critical technologies to build a functioning ICBM, such as ensuring that the warhead survives the harsh conditions of atmospheric re-entry. The latest launches came after South Korean officials said the North was likely to dial up its military displays around the U.S. presidential elections to command the attention of Washington. South Korea’s military intelligence agency said last week that North Korea has also likely completed preparations for its seventh nuclear test. Tensions between the Koreas are at their highest point in years as Kim has repeatedly flaunted his expanding nuclear weapons and missile programs, while reportedly providing Russia with munitions and troops to support President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine. After a meeting in Seoul on Monday, South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul and EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, expressed 'deep concern' over the possibility that Russian transfers any nuclear or ballistic missile-related technology to the North in exchange for its arms and military personnel. Such transfers would ' jeopardize the international non-proliferation efforts and threaten peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and across the globe,' they said, while calling on North Korea and Russia to immediately withdraw the troops from Russia. In response to North Korea’s growing nuclear threats, South Korea, the United States and Japan have been expanding their combined military exercises and updating their nuclear deterrence plans built around U.S. strategic assets. __ Associated Press writer Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-missile-launch-sea-us-elections-3c00eaae880d1cdeb79f7c9aa0aded9d	2024-11-04T13:50:34-08:00	
US gives Israel a 'fail' grade on improving aid to Gaza so far	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration is stepping up criticism of Israel for not doing enough to improve humanitarian conditions in Gaza as a 30-day deadline looms for Israeli officials to meet certain requirements or risk potential restrictions on military assistance. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller on Monday gave Israel a 'fail' grade in terms of meeting the conditions for an improvement in aid deliveries to Gaza laid out in a letter last month to senior Israeli officials from Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. He said there were still roughly nine days until the deadline expires, but that limited progress so far has been insufficient. 'As of today, the situation has not significantly turned around,' Miller told reporters. 'We have seen an increase in some measurements. But if you look at the stipulated recommendations in the letter — those have not been met.' A day before the U.S. election, the Biden administration called out its close ally, with support for Israel a key issue for many voters and the humanitarian crisis for Palestinians also a factor for many in the race. Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have been competing for Muslim and Arab American voters and Jewish voters in battleground states like Michigan and Pennsylvania. Among other conditions, Austin and Blinken's letter from mid-October said that Israel must allow in a minimum of 350 trucks a day carrying desperately needed food and other supplies for Palestinians besieged by more than a year of war between Israel and Hamas. By the end of October, an average of just 71 trucks a day were entering Gaza, according to the latest U.N. figures. 'The results are not good enough today,' Miller said. 'They certainly do not have a pass. … They have failed to implement all the things that that we recommended. Now, that said, we are not at the end of the 30-day period.' He would not say when asked what the U.S. would do when the deadline comes up next week, just that 'we will follow the law.' Blinken spoke Monday with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, urging additional steps to 'substantially increase and sustain humanitarian aid' to civilians in Gaza, according to a State Department readout of their call. Similarly, Austin has been reinforcing 'how important it is to ensure that humanitarian assistance can flow and flow faster into Gaza' in calls with Gallant, said Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon press secretary. The Israeli military body in charge of humanitarian aid to Gaza, known as COGAT, said it had evacuated 72 patients from hospitals in northern Gaza to other medical facilities Monday and had brought medical supplies as well as fuel, food, water and units of blood. The head of UNICEF, the U.N. agency for children, said over the weekend that 'the entire Palestinian population in North Gaza, especially children, is at imminent risk of dying from disease, famine, and the ongoing bombardments.' Miller also said the U.S. is looking into a decision by the Israeli government to end an agreement facilitating the work of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, which is the main aid provider in Gaza. It followed the passage of Israeli laws last week to sever ties with UNRWA, a move that Blinken and Austin opposed in their letter. The Israeli Foreign Ministry said in a statement Monday that it has notified the U.N. of the cancellation of an agreement dating back to 1967 that facilitates UNRWA’s work. It said UNRWA 'is part of the problem in the Gaza Strip and not part of the solution.' Israel alleges that UNRWA has been infiltrated by Hamas, which the agency denies and says it takes measures to ensure its neutrality. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres reiterated that UNRWA is essential and there is no alternative to its work in the Palestinian territories, spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. At the same time, Miller said the U.S. is 'deeply concerned' by a recent escalation in attacks by Israeli settlers on Palestinians in the West Bank, including several cars being torched overnight just a few kilometers (miles) away from the Palestinian Authority’s headquarters and attacks on Palestinians harvesting olives, their livestock and other property. 'These violent actions cause intense human suffering for Palestinians and they threaten Israel’s security,' Miller said. 'It is critical that the government of Israel deter extremist settler violence and take measures to protect all communities from harm in accordance with its international obligations.' He noted that the U.S. has since the beginning of the year imposed sanctions against Israeli groups and people implicated in violence against Palestinian civilians and warned of more to come. ___ AP reporters Ellen Knickmeyer and Lolita C.

Spain's king stood his ground under a mud barrage. What will the iconic moment mean for his reign?	BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Mud splattered the cheek of Spain's monarch as survivors of catastrophic floods unleashed their fury in a barrage of muck and mire. Felipe VI took it, literally, on the chin, and his determination to stay and speak to the enraged crowd could redefine his reign. It instantly became an iconic moment. But what it will mean remains to be seen. Spain’s royals, prime minister and the Valencian regional president were greeted by a crowd hurling mud and other debris on Sunday when they tried to visit Paiporta, where over 60 people perished in last week's floods. The deluge has killed over 200 people in Spain and shattered communities. It was the officials' first visit to the devastated area. Sticky brown globs hit Felipe on the face and all over his black jacket, while Queen Letizia's hands were streaked with the mud that, nearly a week after the floods, still coats street after street of the southern outskirts of Valencia city. Many in the crowd wielded the shovels they are using to dig out their homes. The anger appeared directed not at the king specifically but at the entire state for its management of the worst natural disaster in Spain's living memory. The government is also saying there were far-right agitators among the locals, implying they wanted to go after the Socialist prime minister. In any case, for Montserrat Nebrera, professor of constitutional law at the International University of Catalonia, the shocking sight of a muddied monarch could set a precedent for more fervent protests, since 'never had such anger been shown to the king.' Monarchists like Nebrera and even republicans agreed that Felipe, who holds a largely ceremonial position, cut the figure of a man of state. The king insisted that his bodyguards, who tried to cover him with umbrellas, let him get close to talk with residents, some of whom screamed 'Get out!' and 'Killers!' Letizia has likewise been praised for staying put and speaking with distraught people. A monarch seen as aloof extends himself 'It could go down as the greatest day of Felipe’s reign,' Oriol Bartomeus, a political science professor at the Autonomous University of Barcelona, told The Associated Press. 'If he had sought protection from his bodyguards and run away, now that would have been the darkest day of his reign. Instead he showed why he is king, demonstrating composure and serenity, and by getting as close as he could to the people.' There is no doubt it was the most memorable moment of his reign. The 56-year-old Felipe took over a Royal House whose reputation was in tatters after the financial and lifestyle scandals of his father, Juan Carlos, who abdicated in 2014. Earlier in his reign, Juan Carlos was loved or at least grudgingly respected after helping Spain’s restoration of democracy after the death of dictator Francisco Franco. He was seen as down to earth and fun-loving compared to other European royals. His son, by contrast, has been perceived as aloof, and has relied on Letizia, a former journalist, to help him run a relatively frugal palace in a nation where republican sentiment is strong. Felipe heard some jeers when he took part in a tribute to the dead of the 2017 terror attack in Barcelona, but that was nothing compared to Sunday’s reception. The prime minister and others were struck On Sunday, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez was whisked away by his security detail after he also was pelted. Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska said 'there was a clear danger and (Sánchez) had received a blow.' The back window of the prime minister’s car was broken. The minister did not specify what hit the prime minister. One of Letizia’s bodyguards had a bloody forehead. An investigative judge has opened a preliminary probe into possible assault. Felipe stood his ground for over half an hour. It was impossible to hear what was said, but he spoke to several shouting people in an intimate and apparently serious tone. Bartomeus, who said he is not a fervent defender of the monarchy, noted what the king didn’t do: He didn’t appear to patronize the people. 'He didn’t console the people, like for example you see the British royals do,' Bartomeus said. Instead, 'he dialogued with them. He put the state on his back, got down off the pedestal and went down to the people who were telling him that the state had not arrived, and he told them that it will.' Did Felipe's involvement promise more than he can deliver? Later Sunday, Felipe attended a gathering of the heads of the emergency response in Valencia, along with Sánchez and other politicians. He asked them to give 'hope to those affected by the flood and attend to their needs, guaranteeing that the state is there for them.' On Monday, he presided over the government's crisis committee at a military airbase outside Madrid. But that, Nebrera said, could compound his problems. In going to Paiporta with elected officials, Nebrera said, Felipe has created the impression that he has a real role to play in managing the gargantuan recovery effort, when his powers are mostly representing Spain on state visits and playing an institutional role in the post-election process. In other words, it looks like he owns it. 'If there already existed a certain confusion among some people as to what powers the king has, now he runs the danger of people thinking he is responsible for something which he is not,' she said. 'It is very likely that regardless of how many meetings he presides over, there will be nothing but more bad news coming from Valencia. They are only going to find more and more of the dead.'	https://apnews.com/article/spain-floods-royals-mud-felipe-letizia-903a0f29591049ff54e9778e916882b8	2024-11-04T10:40:51-08:00	
Serbian minister to resign over concrete canopy crash that killed 14 people	BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Serbia's construction minister said Monday he was stepping down days after a concrete canopy collapsed at a railway station, killing 14 people and severely injuring three. Minister Goran Vesic announced his resignation at a hastily called press conference as anger mounted in the Balkan country over the fatal collapse that happened just before noon on Friday in the northern city of Novi Sad. Vesic's resignation needs to be confirmed in Serbia's parliament. 'I would like to inform you that I will formally submit my resignation tomorrow morning,' said Vesic. 'Once the parliament accepts it, I will no longer perform this duty.' Surveillance camera footage showed the massive canopy on the outer wall of the station building crashing down on the people sitting below on benches or going in and out. The train station has been renovated twice in recent years. Critics of Serbia’s populist government attributed the disaster to rampant corruption, a lack of transparency and sloppy work during the reconstruction. The renovation was part of a wider deal with Chinese construction companies. Opposition parties have demanded the resignation of top officials, including President Aleksandar Vucic and Prime Minister Milos Vucevic, accusing them of being responsible for the deadly accident. The opposition says Vesic is just a scapegoat for the real culprits behind the tragedy. Opposition groups plan to hold a rally on Tuesday in Novi Sad and more protests later if their demands are not met. Vesic said that he does not accept any guilt for the deaths of the victims. 'I cannot accept guilt for the death of 14 people because neither I, nor the people who work with me, bear even a shred of responsibility for the tragedy that happened,'' he said. 'I urge the authorities to determine as soon as possible who was responsible for this tragedy.' On Sunday, angry protesters in the capital, Belgrade, left red handprints on government buildings, telling officials, ''You have blood on your hands.' The dead included a 6-year-old girl. The three injured, who are between 18 and 24 years old, all had to have limbs amputated. They were still in serious condition on Monday without improvement, doctors said. Populist officials have accused opposition parties of using the tragedy for political gains while pledging accountability. President Vucic on Monday promised those responsible will be punished. 'I am certain that the state authorities will determine criminal responsibility for the tragedy that happened in our country,' said Vucic. Serbian prosecutors said they have already questioned more than 40 people — including Vesic — since opening the probe on Saturday. But critics believe that justice is unlikely to be served with the populists in firm control of the judicial system and the police. Officials have insisted that the canopy had not been part of the renovation work, suggesting this was the reason why it collapsed but giving no explanation for why it was not renovated. The Novi Sad railway station was originally built in 1964, while the renovated station was inaugurated by Vucic and his populist ally, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, over two years ago as a major stopover for a planned fast train line between Belgrade and Budapest.	https://apnews.com/article/serbia-roof-collapse-resignation-minister-vesic-novisad-3ce61658fec23c8606954b9d3483ae22	2024-11-04T09:18:42-08:00	
The death toll in Lebanon crosses 3,000 in the 13-month Israel-Hezbollah war, Health Ministry says	BEIRUT (AP) — The 13-month war between Israel and Hezbollah has killed more than 3,000 people in Lebanon, the country’s Health Ministry said on Monday, more than double the number of people killed since their last major war two decades ago. The war shows no signs of ending, and Israel has said it is carrying out new operations targeting Hezbollah infrastructure across Lebanon and in parts of Syria while Hezbollah continues to launch dozens of rockets into northern Israel. Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel the day after Hamas’ surprise attack into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023 ignited the war in Gaza. Hezbollah and Hamas are both allied with Iran. For nearly a year, the conflict was mostly contained to the areas along the border between Israel and Lebanon. The conflict dramatically escalated on Sept. 23 with intense Israeli airstrikes on south and east Lebanon as well as Beirut’s southern suburbs, leaving hundreds dead and leading to the displacement of nearly 1.2 million people. Israel began a ground invasion of south Lebanon on Oct. 1, causing wide destruction in border villages but making little advances on the ground inside Lebanon. Israel says it is destroying Hezbollah weapons and command centers near the border, including an extensive tunnel system built by Hezbollah. The Lebanese Health Ministry said 16 people were killed and 90 injured in attacks on Sunday, bringing the death toll to 3,002. At least 13,492 have been injured. The ministry does not differentiate between civilians and Hezbollah fighters in its toll. Israel claimed hundreds of Hezbollah fighters have been killed. In Israel, 72 people have been killed by Hezbollah attacks, including 30 soldiers, according to the prime minister's office. More than 60,000 people have been displaced from their homes. Also on Monday, Israel announced it terminated the agreement facilitating the work of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, the main aid provider in Gaza. It was the first step in implementing legislation passed last week that would sever ties with the agency, which Israel says has been infiltrated by Hamas, and prevent it from operating in Israel. The agency, known as UNRWA, denies the allegations and says it takes measures to ensure its neutrality. The Israeli Foreign Ministry said in a statement Monday that it has notified the U.N. of the cancellation of an agreement dating back to 1967 that facilitates UNRWA’s work. It said UNRWA 'is part of the problem in the Gaza Strip and not part of the solution.' Israel controls all entry into Gaza, and aid groups groups have warned that the legislation could severely hamper UNRWA’s work, creating further obstacles to addressing a severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Israel says that UNRWA is responsible for only 13% of aid entering Gaza and it says other U.N. agencies and aid groups can fill the gap. But aid organizations say UNRWA is essential, and the agency says the Israeli figures do not account for the key role it plays in coordinating aid deliveries. 'Without UNRWA coordination, without UNRWA logistics platforms ... no U.N. agency could operate at the scale required,' said Jonathan Fowler, a spokesman for the agency. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said the US was clear about their opposition to the legislation, and gravely concerned about the insufficient number of aid trucks entering Gaza. 'We have serious concerns about the implications of it being fully implemented, as well as our concerns about the underlying humanitarian situation in, Gaza, even before Israel passed the legislation,' he told reporters in Washington on Monday. The agency provides education, health and other basic services to Palestinian refugees from the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation and their descendants, who now number nearly six million across the region. Refugee families make up the majority of Gaza’s population. The remainder of the legislation is set to go into effect in three months. — Lidman reported from Jerusalem.

The Latest: The campaign for president enters its final push on the eve of Election Day	The presidential campaign comes down to a final push across a handful of states on the eve of Election Day. Kamala Harris will spend all of Monday in Pennsylvania, whose 19 electoral votes offer the largest prize among the states expected to determine the Electoral College outcome. Donald Trump plans four rallies in three states, beginning in Raleigh, North Carolina and stopping twice in Pennsylvania with events in Reading and Pittsburgh. Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here's the latest: Trump supporter says she ‘might try to go to another planet’ if Harris wins RALEIGH, N.C. — Ebony Coots is excited for Trump to win but says she’s tired of seeing all the negative political ads. Coots also feels a bit nervous — not about Trump’s chances of winning but rather what Democrats 'might try to do,' she said. In 2016, Coots cast her ballot for Hillary Clinton because of the 'girl power' sentiment, which she now says was a mistake. Wearing a shirt memorializing Corey Comperatore — the volunteer firefighter who was shot and killed at Trump’s July rally in Butler, Pennsylvania — the 48-year-old delivery driver said animosity toward police during the widespread protests against the killing of George Floyd pushed her to vote for Trump in 2020 and support him since. Monday’s rally in Raleigh, North Carolina, was her ninth since 2022, Coots said. If Vice President Kamala Harris wins the election, Coots summed up what she’ll do in one sentence. 'You know, actually, I might try to go to another planet,' she said. On the ground in Raleigh RALEIGH, N.C. — There are plenty of empty seats at the Raleigh, North Carolina, arena where Trump is kicking off a busy last day of campaigning, with four rallies planned across three battleground states. Trump was scheduled to take the stage at 10 a.m. at the J.S. Dorton Arena, a 5,000-seat venue with additional seating on the floor. Trump has held events in North Carolina each of the past three days, underscoring the importance of a state he carried in both 2016 and 2020. More people are still filing in so the arena could fill up more by the time Trump takes the stage. A presidential campaign unlike any other ends on Tuesday. Here’s how we got here It’s the election that no one could have foreseen. Not so long ago, Donald Trump was marinating in anger at Mar-a-Lago after being impeached twice and voted out of the White House. Even some of his closest allies were looking forward to a future without the charismatic yet erratic billionaire leading the Republican Party, especially after his failed attempt to overturn an election ended in violence and shame. When Trump announced his comeback bid two years ago, the New York Post buried the article on page 26. At the same time, Kamala Harris was languishing as a low-profile sidekick to President Joe Biden. Once seen as a rising star in the Democratic Party, she struggled with both her profile and her portfolio, disappointing her supporters and delighting her critics. No one was talking about Harris running for the top job — they were wondering if Biden should replace her as his running mate when he sought a second term. ▶ Read more about how we got here Star power to fuel Harris’ final day of campaigning The vice president is holding a rally in Allentown with rapper Fat Joe before visiting a Puerto Rican restaurant in Reading with New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez. She’ll also hold an evening Pittsburgh rally featuring performances by DJ D-Nice, Katy Perry and Andra Day, before rallying at Philadelphia’s Museum of the Arts’ 'Rocky Steps,' featuring a statue of the fictional boxer. The final event includes remarks from DJ Cassidy, Fat Joe, Freeway and Just Blaze, as well as Lady Gaga, DJ Jazzy Jeff, Ricky Martin, The Roots, Jazmine Sullivan and Adam Blackstone, and Oprah Winfrey. Where will Trump be on the eve of Election Day? Former President Donald Trump is closing out what he says will be his last campaign day for the White House with a jam-packed schedule that includes four rallies across three battleground states. He’ll begin Monday in Raleigh, North Carolina, underscoring the significance of a state he has visited the past three days. He then heads to Pennsylvania — perhaps the biggest prize on the electoral map — for rallies in Reading and Pittsburgh. He will end his night — and likely spend the early hours of Election Day morning — in Grand Rapids, Michigan. That’s a campaign tradition for the former president who also held last-day rallies there during his 2016 and 2020 campaigns. Harris to focus on heavily Puerto Rican areas as she campaigns across Pennsylvania After a visit to Scranton, Harris will speak in Allentown — a majority Hispanic city that’s home to tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans — at an event with rapper Fat Joe, whose parents were of Puerto Rican and Cuban descent. Pennsylvania is a swing state that could decide the election. But the stop also comes after a comic at a recent Donald Trump rally suggested that Puerto Rico was 'garbage.' Harris later heads to Reading, where she plans to visit a Puerto Rican restaurant with New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro.	https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-donald-trump-election-2024-5baa17fca251b138056203276386ce9b	2024-11-04T04:54:02-08:00	
Tropical Storm Rafael forms in the Caribbean and could hit Cuba as a hurricane	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Tropical Storm Rafael formed Monday in the Caribbean and will bring heavy rain to Jamaica and the Cayman Islands before strengthening into a hurricane and likely hitting Cuba, forecasters said. Later in the week it also is expected to bring heavy rainfall to Florida and portions of the U.S. Southeast, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami. A tropical storm warning was in effect for Jamaica, and a hurricane watch was in effect for the Cayman Islands and for parts of Cuba including the provinces of Pinar del Rio, Artemisa, La Habana, Mayabeque, Matanzas, and the Isle of Youth. A tropical storm watch was issued for Villa Clara, Cienfuegos, Sancti Spiritus, Ciego de Avila, Camaguey, and Las Tunas in Cuba. A tropical storm watch also was issued for the lower and middle Florida Keys from Key West to west of the Channel 5 Bridge, and for the Dry Tortugas. The storm was located about 175 miles (280 kilometers) south of Kingston, Jamaica. It had maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (75 kph) while moving north at 9 mph (15 kph), the center said. The storm was expected to move near Jamaica late Monday, be near or over the Cayman Islands late Tuesday as a hurricane and approach Cuba on Wednesday. Most forecasts show the storm peaking as a Category 1 hurricane, 'but conditions over the next few days will favor strengthening so we’ll need to monitor how quickly it organizes, and a stronger hurricane can’t be ruled out,' wrote Michael Lowry, hurricane specialist and storm surge expert, in an analysis Monday. On Monday morning, the government of the Cayman Islands offered people sandbags and announced schools would close on Tuesday. 'Residents are urged to take immediate precautions to protect themselves and their properties,' the government said in a statement. Meanwhile, the Jamaica Observer newspaper reported a large landslide in a rural area north of the Kingston capital on Sunday that officials blamed on persistent rains ahead of the potential storm. No injuries were reported, but a couple of communities were left isolated. Heavy rainfall will affect the western Caribbean with totals of 3 to 6 inches (7 to 15 centimeters) and up to 9 inches (23 cm) expected locally in Jamaica and parts of Cuba. Flooding and mudslides are possible. On the opposite side of the Atlantic Ocean, Tropical Storm Patty dissipated.	https://apnews.com/article/tropical-storm-rafael-caribbean-jamaica-cuba-florida-51616234e364f9b0f754d0632408274e	2024-11-04T04:01:47-08:00	
Philippine military drills to seize an island in the South China Sea	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The Philippine military opened two weeks of combat drills Monday that would include seizing an island in the disputed South China Sea and likely be frowned upon by China. More than 3,000 Filipino army, navy and air force personnel will take part in the maneuvers, which Philippine military officials said were not directed against any country. China has rapidly expanded its military and has become increasingly assertive in pursuing territorial claims in the South China Sea, which Beijing claims virtually in its entirety. The tensions have led to more frequent confrontations, primarily with the Philippines and Vietnam, though the longtime territorial disputes also involve Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei and Taiwan. Last month, Indonesia said its patrol ships drove away a Chinese coast guard ship that disrupted a survey being undertaken by a state-owned energy company in a part of the South China Sea disputed by both countries. 'Our mission today is very clear, to prepare ourselves comprehensively to respond to any external threats that might challenge our sovereignty,' Armed Forces of the Philippines chief Gen. Romeo Brawner Jr. said in the opening ceremony of the exercises. The maneuvers will include live-fire drills using artillery and assault rifles and beach landing drills. In the South China Sea, Filipino forces would simulate taking control of an island, Philippine army Col. Michael Logico told reporters without elaborating. Asked how China may react, Logico said he expected Chinese forces to undertake surveillance from a distance but added they would not likely make any hostile move. 'They have a front seat to the exercise. They’ll watch and we don’t mind,' Logico said. China has opposed such combat drills in the South China Sea, particularly if American and allied forces were involved. The outgoing Biden administration has moved to strengthen an arc of military alliances in the Indo-Pacific to better counter China, including in any future confrontation over Taiwan. America’s moves dovetail with Philippine efforts to shore up its territorial defense amid a long-seething dispute mainly with China in the South China Sea. Next year, U.S. and Philippines forces plan to stage their largest annual combat drills called Balikatan, Tagalog for shoulder-to-shoulder, that are also expected to include maneuvers in contested South China Sea areas.	https://apnews.com/article/philippines-combat-drills-china-206c0b6458e2c15bb5009dc8ba4445bf	2024-11-04T03:26:16-08:00

Germany's top diplomat is in Kyiv as Ukraine girds for impact of US election on the war	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Germany’s top diplomat arrived Monday in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv on an unannounced visit, in what appeared to be a show of European support for Ukraine on the eve of a U.S. presidential election that could bring far-reaching changes in Washington’s policy toward Russia’s all-out invasion of its neighbor. Germany is Ukraine’s second biggest weapons supplier after the U.S., and Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock vowed that Berlin’s backing would remain steadfast. 'Together with many partners around the world, Germany stands firmly by Ukraine’s side,' she said, German news agency dpa reported. 'We will support the Ukrainians for as long as they need us so that they can continue on their path to a just peace.' The war is at a critical moment for Ukraine, with the Russian army making creeping gains on the battlefield and another hard winter ahead after Russia relentlessly battered the Ukrainian power grid. With his army under severe Russian pressure in the eastern Donetsk region, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday that Western military aid deliveries have accelerated, including for artillery. The grinding attritional warfare being fought in Ukraine requires large amounts of ammunition, and Ukrainian officials have long grumbled that Western pledges of support take too long to arrive. Zelenskyy said Ukraine is also trying to strengthen its air defense systems. Russia is currently deploying about 10 times more Iranian-made Shahed drones than it was this time last year, he said. Ahead of the U.S. election, Zelenskyy attempted to lock Ukraine’s Western supporters into a long-term 'victory plan,' including a formal invitation for Ukraine to join NATO and permission to use Western long-range missiles to strike military targets in Russia, but the response was disappointing for Kyiv officials. Russia is using its superior numbers to heap pressure on Ukrainian positions along the front line. Ukraine’s top commander, Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi, said Saturday his troops are struggling to hold back 'one of the most powerful (Russian) offensives' of the war. Russia is now adding to its offensive push what Western intelligence sources say is a force of about 10,000 North Korean combat troops sent by Pyongyang under a pact with Moscow. That has deepened Zelenskyy’s frustration with Western help. On Saturday, he urged allies to stop 'watching' and take steps before the North Korean troops reach the battlefield. Zelenskyy said Kyiv knows at which Russian camps the North Korean troops are being trained but Ukraine can’t strike them without permission from allies to use the Western-made long-range weapons to hit targets deep inside Russia. Baerbock arrived in Kyiv hours after debris from drones intercepted by air defenses fell in two districts of the city, starting small fires, officials said. No people or property were harmed, according to the head of the Kyiv city administration, Serhii Popko. A Russian glide bomb attack on Sunday night injured 15 people in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city in the northeast, regional police said. Russia fired some 80 Shahed drones at Ukrainian cities overnight, Ukraine’s air force said. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-germany-us-election-ebccb34322560ea412f9115d0d14938f	2024-11-04T00:32:28-08:00	
South Korea and EU worry about Russia's technology transfer in return for North Korea troops	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korean and the European Union on Monday strongly condemned North Korea’s reported dispatch of troops to aid Russia’s war against Ukraine and expressed concerns that Russia could reward North Korea with transfers of sensitive technology to enhance its nuclear and missile programs. North Korea’s troop deployment, which was confirmed by the U.S. and NATO, threatens to expand the almost 3-year-long war and is causing security jitters in South Korea and elsewhere about what Russia could give North Korea in return. After a meeting in Seoul, South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul and EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell issued a joint statement condemning in the 'strongest possible terms' North Korea’s deployment and voicing worries about Russia's possible provision of materials and technology to North Korea in support of its military objectives. 'We are also deeply concerned about the possibility for any transfer of nuclear- or ballistic missile-related technology to the DPRK, which would jeopardize the international non-proliferation efforts and threaten peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and across the globe,' the statement said. DPRK stands for the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, North Korea’s official name. Cho and Borrell called North Korea's deployment a 'flagrant' violation of multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions and called on North Korea and Russia to immediately withdraw the troops from Russia. Earlier Monday, Borrell met South Korean Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun and they agreed to work together with the international community to try to obstruct Russian-North Korean security cooperation, according to the South Korean Defense Ministry. North Korea and Russia haven't explicitly confirmed the North Korean deployment. But they've both argued that their military cooperation conforms with international laws. The U.S. government said that about 8,000 North Korean soldiers were in Russia near Ukraine’s border and preparing to join Russia’s fight against Ukraine in the coming days. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged allies to stop just 'watching' and take steps before North Korean troops deployed in Russia reach the battlefield. According to U.S., South Korean and Ukrainian intelligence assessments, North Korea was estimated to have moved a total of about 10,000-12,000 troops to Russia. If they start fighting against Ukraine forces, it would mark North Korea’s first participation in a large-scale conflict since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has used the Russia-Ukraine war as a way to expand defense and economic cooperation with Russia in the face of an intensifying U.S.-led pressure campaign against his advancing nuclear program. The U.S., South Korea and others accuse North Korea of having already exported artillery shells, missiles and other conventional arms to Russia. Besides Russia's possible weapons technology transfer, South Korean officials also worry that Moscow might offer defense commitment to North Korea in the event of a war on the Korean Peninsula. The North Korean troops in Russia could also learn valuable combat experience and get Russian help to modernize their outdated conventional weapons systems. In the past two years, Kim has ramped up tests of nuclear-capable missile systems, as Russia and China have repeatedly blocked U.S.-led attempts to toughen international sanctions on North Korea over its testing activities in defiance of U.N. bans. Last week, North Korea test-launched an intercontinental ballistic missile designed to attack the U.S. mainland for the first time in almost a year. North Korea has also pushed to sever relations and abandon its long-standing goal of reconciliation with South Korea. In a background briefing with local media Monday, South Korea’s military said North Korea has built anti-tank, trench-like structures at two sites near the Koreas’ heavily armed border, where it blew up northern parts of unused cross-border road and rail routes last month in a display of anger toward South Korea. In a war situation, the North could easily fill up the trenches with piles of dirt nearby to create routes to invade the South, according to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Details of the briefing were shared with The Associated Press.	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-russia-ukraine-south-eu-f8f1a52ee5d59794534a2be12b66fa3b	2024-11-04T00:14:36-08:00	
Middle East latest: Israel ends agreement with UN agency providing aid in Gaza	Israel said on Monday it has terminated the agreement facilitating the work of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, the main aid provider in Gaza, in what appeared to be a step to implement legislation passed last month that would sever ties with the agency and prevent it from operating in Israel. Israel says the agency, known as UNRWA, has been infiltrated by Hamas. UNRWA denies the allegations and says it takes measures to ensure its neutrality. On Sunday, Israel said its troops had carried out a ground raid into Syria to seize a Syrian it accuses of working with Iran. It was the first time in the current war that Israel announced its troops operated in Syrian territory. Despite growing pressure from the United States and others in the international community for a cease-fire in Gaza and Lebanon, intensified Israeli strikes against the Hezbollah militant group are expanding beyond Lebanon’s border areas. Israel is also fighting a seemingly endless war against Hamas in northern Gaza. Since the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah erupted last year, at least 2,900 people have been killed and 13,150 wounded in Lebanon, the Health Ministry reports, not including Friday’s toll. Health authorities say that a quarter of those killed were women and children. More than a year of Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 people, Palestinian health officials say. They do not distinguish between civilians and combatants, but say more than half of those killed were women and children. The war began after Palestinian militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. ___ Here’s the latest: Ambulances can't operate in northern Gaza Strip, health ministry says DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Gaza Health Ministry says ambulances are no longer operating in the north of the enclave, where Israel has been waging a renewed offensive for nearly a month. Eyad Zaqout, a senior ministry official, told reporters Monday that 'a large number of injured people are bleeding on the roads.' The ministry also said in a statement that Israeli forces continue to bombard Kamal Adwan Hospital with strikes on Monday, injuring some staff and patients. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. The Civil Defense, first responders operating under the Hamas-run government, said last week that they were no longer able to operate in the north because crews had been fired upon by Israeli forces. Israel launched its latest offensive in northern Gaza in early October, focusing on Jabaliya, a densely populated, decades-old urban refugee camp where it says Hamas had regrouped. It has also carried out strikes in nearby Beit Lahiya. Israel has ordered the entire population in northern Gaza to evacuate, and tens of thousands have fled to Gaza City in recent weeks. The three hospitals serving the northern areas are barely functioning and have been largely cut off by the fighting. Israeli forces raided one of them, saying militants were sheltering there, allegations denied by Palestinian officials. Israel has also sharply reduced the amount of aid allowed into Gaza, even after a warning from the United States that it could jeopardize American military support. Palestinian officials say Israeli settlers torched cars in Ramallah RAMALLAH, West Bank — Palestinian officials said Israeli settlers were behind an attack in which several cars were torched overnight just a few kilometers (miles) away from the Palestinian Authority’s headquarters in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. No one was wounded in the attack overnight into Monday in Al-Bireh, a city adjacent to Ramallah, where the Western-backed Palestinian Authority is headquartered. An Associated Press reporter counted 18 burned-out cars. Settler attacks on Palestinians and their property have surged since the outbreak of the war in Gaza, which was triggered by Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack into Israel. But attacks in and around Ramallah, home to senior Palestinian officials and international missions, are rare. The Palestinian Authority, which administers population centers in the territory, condemned the attack. Israeli police, who handle law enforcement matters involving settlers in the West Bank, said they were investigating. Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war, and the Palestinians want it to form the main part of their future state. The territory’s 3 million Palestinians live under seemingly open-ended Israeli military rule, with the Palestinian Authority exercising limited autonomy over less than half of the territory. Over 500,000 Jewish settlers with Israeli citizenship live in scores of settlements across the West Bank, which most of the international community considers illegal. Israel ends agreement with UN agency for Palestinian refugees TEL AVIV, Israel — Israel said Monday it had terminated the agreement facilitating the work of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, the main aid provider in Gaza. It appeared to be the first step in implementing legislation passed last month that would sever ties with the agency, which Israel says has been infiltrated by Hamas, and prevent it from operating in Israel. The agency, known as UNRWA, denies the allegations and says it takes measures to ensure its neutrality. The Israeli Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it had notified the U.N. of the cancellation of an agreement dating back to 1967 that facilitates UNRWA’s work. It said UNRWA 'is part of the problem in the Gaza Strip and not part of the solution.' Aid groups have warned that the legislation could severely hamper UNRWA’s work, creating further obstacles to addressing a severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Israel has said other U.N. agencies and aid groups can fill the gap, but those organizations say UNRWA is essential. The agency provides education, health and other basic services to Palestinian refugees from the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation and their descendants, who now number nearly 6 million. Refugee families make up the majority of Gaza’s population.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-hezbollah-mideast-latest-4-november-2024-faf4d814fe58b18f1e6176b4f274c3fd	2024-11-03T22:46:23-08:00	
Japan successfully launches a defense satellite carried by a new flagship H3 rocket	TOKYO (AP) — Japan launched a defense satellite Monday aimed at speedier military operations and communication on a new flagship H3 rocket and successfully placed it into orbit, as the country seeks to build up its military capability amid growing tension in the region. The East Asian country is accelerating its military buildup under a 2022 security strategy that calls for Japanese troops to play a greater role in regional defense amid rising tension from China, North Korea and Russia. The H3 No. 4 rocket lifted off from the Tanegashima Space Center on a southwestern Japanese island. Everything went as planned and the satellite was successfully put into a targeted orbit, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, or JAXA, announced. The rocket was carrying Kirameki No. 3, a Defense Ministry satellite that uses X-band communication for information and data sharing, as well as military operations and command. X-band satellites are less affected by weather conditions and can support stable communication. Kirameki No. 3 follows two earlier X-band satellites already in operation to meet Japan's growing military communication demands and enhance its satellite operations. Maj. Gen. Yasuhiro Kato, the Joint Staff Systems Department chief, told an online joint news conference from Tanegashima that the triple X-band communication satellite system would enable high-speed, large-capacity data transmission and communication across Japan's Ground, Maritime and Air Self-Defense Forces, as well as with units deployed overseas on peacekeeping missions or exercises. 'It will further contribute to Japan's national security and the operational capacity of the Self-Defense Forces,' Kato said. Ippei Kikuta, a defense ministry acquisition agency official, said Kirameki No. 3 will start operations by the end of March after being shifted to a designated geostationary orbit above Japan and tested, joining forces with the two other X-band satellites, Kirameki No. 1 and No. 2, which are in undisclosed locations. Monday’s launch was initially planned for Oct. 20 and came after four postponements due to a technical glitch and bad weather. Kato said the delay had no impact on Japan's security and defense activity. JAXA President Hiroshi Yamakawa said he felt 'relieved' that the H3 rocket succeeded in delivering the satellite to its planned location after the two-week delay. The launch was the third consecutive successful flight of the H3 system after a shocking failed debut attempt last year when the rocket had to be destroyed with its payload. Japan sees a stable, commercially competitive space transport capability as key to its space program and national security. JAXA and its main contractor, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, have been developing the H3 launch system as a successor to its current mainstay, H-2A, which is set to retire after one more flight. MHI will eventually take over H3 production and launches from JAXA and hopes to make it commercially viable by cutting the launch cost to about half of the H-2A. JAXA and MHI have set a goal of six launches per year. MHI's space segment chief, Iwao Igarashi, told reporters that the strength of the Japanese rocket launch is its reliability and on-time record and that Monday's success was 'another big progress.' The company has so far signed multiple H3 launch deals with U.K. and French satellite operators and the U.A.E space agency.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-space-rocket-h3-defense-satellite-8df4225b80264fde36b1c976eec897bd	2024-11-03T22:33:53-08:00	
At least 36 dead after an overcrowded bus falls into a gorge in northern India	LUCKNOW, India (AP) — A poorly maintained and overcrowded bus veered off the road and plunged into a deep gorge in northern India on Monday, killing at least 36 people and injuring several others, officials said. The accident occurred in Almora district in the mountainous state of Uttarakhand. The bus was carrying around 60 people, and more than 20 have been injured, said Deepak Rawat, a senior state government official. Authorities said earlier they believed there were 42 passengers, which was how many people the bus could accommodate. Teams of rescue and relief workers were deployed to the site and officials feared the death toll may rise further, especially as seven passengers in hospital were in critical condition. Television footage showed parts of the bus mangled and destroyed as it lay overturned on a rocky slope, close to a stream. Rescuers were seen working to pull out passengers and carrying bodies on stretchers. The state’s chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami earlier said rescue teams were working to quickly evacuate the injured passengers to nearby hospitals and that authorities have been instructed to airlift those seriously hurt. The state government has opened an investigation into the accident, said Vineet Pal, another official in the state. He added that preliminary information suggested that the dilapidated bus skidded before tumbling down a 60 meter- (200-foot-) -deep gorge. A number of passengers managed to escape or were thrown out by the impact, and then alerted authorities about the accident. Two transport officials have been suspended for approving a bus that was in poor condition, Pal said. India has some of the highest road death rates in the world, with hundreds of thousands of people killed and injured annually. Most crashes are blamed on reckless driving, poorly maintained roads and aging vehicles. In July, at least 18 people died after a double-decker passenger bus collided with a milk truck in Uttar Pradesh state. In May, a bus carrying Hindu pilgrims skidded and rolled into a deep gorge on a mountainous highway in Indian-controlled Kashmir, killing at least 21 people.	https://apnews.com/article/india-bus-accident-almora-uttarakhand-94ce6d90557fc78bb59f002d37b87b7a	2024-11-03T20:56:47-08:00	
China space station crew returns to Earth after 6 months in space	BEIJING (AP) — Three Chinese astronauts returned to Earth on Monday after a six-month stay on China's Tiangong space station. A parachute slowed their capsule's nighttime descent to a remote landing area in China's Inner Mongolia region. The crew emerged after touching down at 1:24 a.m. A Chinese national flag stuck in the ground near the capsule flapped in the wind. The Tiangong space station, which was completed two years ago, is part of China's efforts to be a global leader in space exploration. In recent years, the country's space program has brought back rocks from the moon and landed a rover on Mars. It aims to put a person on the moon by 2030, which would make it the second nation after the United States to do so. The space station astronauts returned after welcoming a replacement three-person crew last week for the latest six-month mission. The new crew will conduct experiments, carry out spacewalks and install equipment to protect the station from space debris. A space agency official said in April that Tiangong has maneuvered several times to avoid debris and had partially lost power when the solar wing's power cables were hit by debris, according to a report from the official Xinhua News Agency. China is among the countries that have created space debris, including the reported break-up of a rocket stage in August during the launch of the first 18 satellites for a planned communications network similar to Starlink. Tiangong, which means Heavenly Palace, is in orbit around the earth. Only Chinese astronauts have gone to the space station so far, but a space agency spokesperson said last week that China is in discussions to select and train astronauts from other nations to join the missions, Xinhua reported. Astronauts from several nations have traveled to the International Space Station, but China is blocked from that program mainly because of U.S. concerns over the military's involvement in China's space program.	https://apnews.com/article/china-tiangong-space-station-crew-return-b23703fcdff5b61bc0eab69ef6b581c8	2024-11-03T20:47:48-08:00	
France is holding a trial over the beheading of a teacher who showed prophet cartoons to his class	LYON, France (AP) — Eight people are going on trial in Paris on terrorism charges Monday over the beheading of teacher Samuel Paty, who was killed by an Islamic extremist after showing caricatures of Islam's prophet to his middle school students for a lesson on freedom of expression. Paty's shocking death left an imprint on France, and several schools are now named after him. Paty was killed outside his school near Paris on Oct. 16, 2020, by an 18-year-old Russian of Chechen origin, who was shot to death by police. Those on trial include friends of assailant Abdoullakh Anzorov who allegedly helped purchase weapons for the attack, as well as people who are accused of spreading false information online about the teacher and his class. The attack occurred against a backdrop of protests in many Muslim countries and calls online for violence targeting France and the satirical French newspaper Charlie Hebdo. The newspaper had republished its caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad a few weeks before Paty's death to mark the opening of the trial over deadly 2015 attacks on its newsroom by Islamic extremists. The cartoon images deeply offended many Muslims, who saw them as sacrilegious. But the fallout from Paty’s killing reinforced the French state’s commitment to freedom of expression and its firm attachment to secularism in public life. Much attention at the trial will focus on Brahim Chnina, the Muslim father of a 13-year-old girl who claimed that she had been excluded from Paty’s class when he showed the caricatures on Oct. 5, 2020. Chnina sent a series of messages to his contacts denouncing Paty, saying that 'this sick man' needed to be fired, along with the address of the school in the Paris suburb of Conflans Saint-Honorine. In reality, Chnina’s daughter had lied to him and had never attended the lesson in question. Paty was giving a Moral and Civic Education lesson mandated by the National Education Ministry on freedom of expression. He discussed the caricatures in this context, saying students who did not wish to see them could temporarily leave the classroom. An online campaign against Paty snowballed, and 11 days after the lesson, Anzorov attacked the teacher with a knife as he walked home, and displayed the teacher’s head on social media. Police later shot Anzorov as he advanced towards them armed. Chnina will be tried for alleged association with a terrorist enterprise for targeting the 47-year-old teacher through false information. His daughter was tried last year in a juvenile court and given an 18-month suspended sentence. Four other students at Paty's school were found guilty of involvement and given suspended sentences; a fifth, who pointed out Paty to Anzorov in exchange for money, was given a 6-month term with an electronic bracelet. Abdelhakim Sefrioui is another key figure in the trial opening Monday for the adult suspects. He presented himself as a spokesperson for Imams of France, although he had been dismissed from that role. He filmed a video in front of the school with the father of the student. He referred to the teacher as a 'thug' multiple times and sought to pressure the school administration via social media. Sefrioui founded the pro-Hamas Cheikh Yassine Collective in 2004, which was dissolved a few days after Paty's killing. Sefrioui had long criticized and threatened Muslims who advocate friendship with Jews, including the rector of the Grand Mosque of Paris. Sefrioui and Chnina face 30 years in prison if convicted. Chnina denied any incitement to 'kill' in his messages and video, claiming he did not intend to incite hatred and violence, according to judicial documents. Sefrioui’s lawyers have said they would seek his acquittal, and that the video filmed by Sefrioui in front of the school was not seen by the terrorist. Anzorov, who had wanted to go to Syria to fight with Islamic extremists there, discovered Paty’s name on jihadist social media channels, according to investigators. Anzorov lived 100 kilometers (60 miles) from Paty's school and did not know the teacher. Two of Anzorov’s friends face life imprisonment if convicted on charges of complicity in murder in connection with a terrorist enterprise. Naim Boudaoud and Azim Epsirkhanov are accused of helping Anzorov buy a knife and a pellet gun. Boudaoud also drove Anzorov to Paty’s school. They turned themselves in at the police station, and deny being aware of the attacker’s intentions. The other four individuals are charged with criminal terrorist conspiracy for communicating with the killer on pro-jihad Snapchat groups. They all deny being aware of the intent to kill Samuel Paty. One of them sent smiling emojis after the decapitated teacher’s head was shared. On Oct. 13, 2023, another teacher in France was killed by a radical Islamist from Russia, originally from Ingushetia, a region bordering Chechnya.	https://apnews.com/article/france-teacher-beheaded-trial-caricatures-d8311e6092e99b5fae3418e5b864f306	2024-11-03T20:10:47-08:00	
Prince William begins a visit to South Africa that focuses on climate and the environment	CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — Britain's Prince William will speak with young environmentalists and local fishermen during a visit to South Africa starting Monday that will see his annual Earthshot Prize award $1.2 million in grants to five organizations for innovative environmental ideas. The 42-year-old heir to the throne will also attend a global wildlife summit and spend time at a sea rescue institute during his four days in Cape Town, with the centerpiece of his trip the Earthshot awards ceremony on Wednesday night. He'll use the visit to highlight other issues close to his heart, like the work of rangers on the frontline of conservation efforts, officials said. William, the Prince of Wales, last visited Africa in 2018, but he has a strong connection to the continent. William traveled to Africa as a boy after the death of his mother, Princess Diana, in a Paris car crash in 1997. He and his wife, Kate, got engaged at a wildlife conservancy in Kenya in 2010. And he said he came up with the idea for the Earthshot awards while in Namibia in 2018. 'Africa has always held a special place in my heart as somewhere I found comfort as a teenager, where I proposed to my wife, and most recently as the founding inspiration behind the Earthshot Prize,' William said in a statement ahead of his visit. Kate, Princess of Wales, and their children Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis are not traveling to South Africa. Kate, 42, only recently returned to some public duties after completing treatment for an undisclosed type of cancer. William's trip follows soon after his brother Harry, the Duke of Sussex, visited South Africa and neighboring Lesotho last month for a youth charity he set up with a member of Lesotho's royal family. William formed the Earthshot Prize through his Royal Foundation in 2020 to encourage new ideas to solve environmental problems and it launched in 2021. The first three awards ceremonies were held in Britain, the U.S. and Singapore. William said he wanted this year's awards to inspire young people involved in climate action across Africa, a continent of some 1.5 billion people that contributes the least to global warming but is especially vulnerable to climatic shocks. The wider southern African region is currently experiencing its worst drought and hunger crisis in decades, with 27 million people severely affected, according to the United Nations. The Earthshot prizes are awarded in five categories: protecting and restoring nature, clean air, reviving oceans, building a waste-free world and fixing the climate. This year's finalists include a company in Kenya that develops solar-powered systems for homes, a group in Ecuador that brings Indigenous communities together to protect forests, and a conservation project in Kazakhstan that is saving the critically endangered Saiga antelope from extinction. The awards ceremony will be held in a temporary, reusable dome that has been erected on a field next to a sports stadium in Cape Town. The 470-foot-long dome has hosted other events in South Africa and will be packed to be used again after the Earthshot prizes, organizers said. While climate change and threats to the environment are at the center of William's visit, he will briefly break away from those topics to go to a high school in an underprivileged Cape Town neighborhood, where he's expected to join kids at a rugby practice. Rugby is one of South Africa's most popular sports and the country's national team, the Springboks, are the reigning world champions. William is also a rugby follower. 'I can promise that you will see the Prince of Wales playing some rugby,' a Kensington Palace spokesperson said of the planned school visit. ___ AP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa	https://apnews.com/article/prince-william-royal-south-africa-britain-earthshot-f00ab59a0a70f87c9a042ffca32f0c79	2024-11-03T19:57:46-08:00	
Volcanic eruption burns houses in Indonesia, killing at least 6 people	MAUMERE, Indonesia (AP) — Indonesia’s National Disaster Management Agency said Monday that at least six people have died as a series of volcanic eruptions widens on the remote island of Flores. The eruption at Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki just after midnight on Monday spewed thick brownish ash as high as 2,000 meters (6,500 feet) into the air and hot ashes hit a nearby village, burning down several houses including a convent of Catholic nuns, said Firman Yosef, an official at the Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki monitoring post. The Disaster Management Agency lowered the known death toll from an earlier report of nine, saying it had received updated information from local authorities. It said that information was still being collected about the extent of casualties and damage, as local media reports said more people were buried in collapsed houses. Authorities also raised the danger level and widened the danger zone for Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki on Monday, following a series of eruptions that began last week. The country’s volcano monitoring agency increased the volcano’s alert status to the highest level and more than doubled the exclusion zone to a 7-kilometer (4.3-mile) radius after midnight on Monday as eruptions became more frequent. The agency said at least 10,000 people have been affected by the eruption in Wulanggitang District, in the six nearby villages of Pululera, Nawokote, Hokeng Jaya, Klatanlo, Boru and Boru Kedang. In Ile Bura District, 4 villages were affected, namely Dulipali Village, Nobo, Nurabelen and Riang Rita, while in Titehena District it affected four villages, namely Konga Village, Kobasoma, Bokang Wolomatang and Watowara. He said volcanic material was thrown up to 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) from its crater, blanketeing nearby villages and towns with tons of volcanic debris and forcing residents to flee. A nun in Hokeng village died and another was missing, said Agusta Palma, the head of the Saint Gabriel Foundation that oversees convents on the majority-Catholic island. 'Our nuns ran out in panic under a rain of volcanic ash in the darkness,' Palma said. Photos and videos circulated on social media showed tons of volcanic debris covering houses up to their rooftops in villages like Hokeng, where hot volcanic material set fire to houses. It’s Indonesia’s second volcanic eruption in as many weeks. West Sumatra province’s Mount Marapi, one of the country’s most active volcanos, erupted on Oct. 27, spewing thick columns of ash at least three times and blanketing nearby villages with debris, but no casualties were reported. ___ Associated Press writers Niniek Karmini and Edna Tarigan contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/indonesia-mount-lewotobi-laki-laki-volcano-eruption-73f898102d514b9bd093be65b8188002	2024-11-03T18:18:38-08:00	
Stock market today: Asian shares are mostly higher as China begins major economic meeting	Shares were mostly higher in Asia on Monday as China’s leaders began a major meeting expected to bring fresh pledges of help for the world’s second-largest economy. Oil prices gained more than $1 a barrel after the OPEC+ oil producing nations said they would extend production cuts until the end of the year. No reason was given for the move, which came ahead of the U.S. presidential election on Tuesday. U.S. benchmark crude oil gained $1.27 to $70.76 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard, picked up $1.30 to $74.70 a barrel. The Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress is meeting this week and analysts were predicting the government may endorse major spending initiatives to boost the economy. 'Markets are alive with whispers of a fresh stimulus package, setting expectations sky-high and creating a buzz that’s hard to ignore,' Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary. Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 0.1% to 20,540.44, while the Shanghai Composite index was up 0.3% at 3,281,76. Markets in Tokyo were closed for a holiday. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 edged 0.2% higher to 8,134.60 and the Kospi in Seoul jumped 1% to 2,568.85. Taiwan's Taiex was up 0.3%. On Friday, Amazon led U.S. stock indexes higher, while a surprisingly weak jobs report marred by some unusual occurrences cemented bets on Wall Street for another cut to interest rates next week. The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.4% to 5,728.80, recovering some of its loss from the day before, its worst in eight weeks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.7% to 42,052.19, while the Nasdaq composite gained 0.8% to 18,239.92. Amazon climbed 6.2% after delivering a bigger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected and was the strongest force pushing the S&amp;P 500 higher. Intel, meanwhile, rallied 7.8% despite reporting a worse loss than expected. Its revenue topped analysts’ estimates, and it gave a forecast for results in the current quarter that likewise topped expectations. Cardinal Health was another one of the market’s bigger gainers and jumped 7% after topping analysts’ forecasts for profit and revenue in the latest quarter. It also raised its profit forecast for its fiscal year, which is only in its second quarter. They helped offset a 1.2% slide for Apple, which said it expects revenue growth in the important holiday quarter to be in the low to mid-single digit percentages. That was below several analysts’ forecasts. Treasury yields pushed higher after a highly anticipated report said U.S. employers added only 12,000 workers to their payrolls last month, far short of the 115,000 in hiring that economists were expecting or the 223,00 jobs that employers created in September. A separate report said U.S. manufacturing contracted by more last month than economists expected. It’s been one of the areas of the economy hurt most by the Federal Reserve’s keeping interest rates at a two-decade high until September. The nearly unanimous expectation on Wall Street remains for the Fed to cut its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point next week. The two-year Treasury yield, which closely tracks expectations for the Fed’s actions, initially fell following the jobs report but then climbed to 4.20% from 4.18% late Thursday. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which also takes future economic growth and other factors into account, likewise rose after a knee-jerk drop. It climbed to 4.37%, up from 4.29% late Thursday. The hope on Wall Street is that the economy will still avoid a recession, even with the slowdown in the job market, thanks in part to coming cuts to interest rates by the Fed. The overall economy has so far remained more resilient than feared. In currency dealings early Monday, the dollar slipped to 152.05 Japanese yen from 152.42 yen late Friday. The euro fell to $1.0879 from $1.0881.	https://apnews.com/article/stock-markets-rates-opec-china-c9e140c9ad29f8450613ce0a19550b18	2024-11-03T17:42:17-08:00

OPEC extends its oil output cuts by one month until the end of December	Saudi Arabia and allied oil producing countries said on Sunday they would postpone a plan to gradually increase oil output until the end of the year, extending their output cuts by one month. No reason was given for the move, which comes ahead of the U.S. presidential election on Tuesday. In June, OPEC said 2.2 million barrels a day in voluntary cuts were extended until September but would then be gradually reduced month by month until they are eliminated by September 2025. OPEC later extended the cuts until November. On Sunday, the group, which includes Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria and Oman, extended the cuts again by one month until the end of December. The announcement was made on the website for the OPEC+ alliance.

Bolivia's Evo Morales tells AP he'll press on with a hunger strike until his rival accepts dialogue	LAUCA Ñ, Bolivia (AP) — Bolivia's transformative and divisive former President Evo Morales said Sunday that he would press on with a hunger strike until the government of his protégé-turned-rival agreed to a political dialogue. The act, exposing the depth of the Andean country's divisions, aims to defuse the protests over Morales' claims of political persecution that have paralyzed the nation in recent weeks. Morales, a larger-than-life figure still towering over Bolivian politics, spoke from the misty tropics of Chapare, Bolivia’s rural coca-growing region that serves as his stronghold. 'My fight is to improve the situation in the country and to start a dialogue without conditions on two fronts, one economic and one political,' Morales told The Associated Press from the office of the coca growers’ federation that he has long led. He said he began his hunger strike on Friday in hopes of 'international organizations or friendly governments' facilitating his outreach to his political nemesis, President Luis Arce. Tensions have surged over the past three weeks since pro-Morales supporters erected crippling roadblocks aimed at rebuking Arce — the ex-president’s former economy minister with whom he’s vying to lead Bolivia’s governing socialist party into next year’s elections. Calling for Arce's resignation, the protesters have also sought to challenge his government’s attempt to revive a 2016 statutory rape case against Morales, an ethnic Aymara who was the first member of an Indigenous community to become the president of Latin America’s only Indigenous-majority nation. Morales has denied any wrongdoing. 'My crime is being Indigenous,' he said on Sunday. The AP reached Morales after an arduous 11-hour journey by car, motorcycle and foot over hills and through the highlands, circumventing road blockades, crisscrossing routes littered with debris and squeaking through over a dozen security checkpoints, in some cases manned by profiteers. Roadblocks are a common protest tactic in Bolivia, where the mountainous terrain means a few strategically positioned checkpoints can can isolate major cities and bring the country to a halt. Morales' supporters have used it over past decades to great effect and did so again this month, escalating pressure on Arce to take action against protesters who have marooned hundreds of thousands of residents in the highlands, raising fears of food and gasoline shortages and hiking up already inflated prices in major cities, even the capital of La Paz. 'I see people rising up even more,' said Eusebio Urbano, a farmer protesting in support of Morales at one of the road blockades Sunday. 'I don’t know what this government thinks. ... They don’t try to solve anything. We'll have to exert pressure until it leaves.' Last Friday, Arce's government sent some 3,000 police officers armed with tear gas and backed by helicopters to break up the blockades by force. Senior Minister Eduardo Del Castillo said security forces had arrested dozens of protesters in a crackdown that succeeded in clearing the road linking Cochabamba, Bolivia’s third-biggest city, and La Paz. He said security forces transferred over 50 of them to pre-trial detention in the capital. 'What happened was very inhumane,' Morales said, adding that his refusal to eat was also aimed at pressuring authorities to release the 66 detainees. 'These are humble people who were presented as terrorists.' It was the latest turn in Bolivia’s long-running political crisis, which escalated last week when gunmen ambushed Morales’ convoy in what the former president claimed was a government-led assassination attempt. Officials in Arce’s government denied this, alleging that police opened fire because Morales’ van had barreled through a security checkpoint. 'They’ve been using any tactic they can, politically, legally, morally and now, to end my life physically,' Morales said. From there, protests in Morales' defense only intensified. On Friday, Arce’s government accused his demonstrators of occupying military barracks in Chapare, a flashpoint for conflict since the U.S.-backed war on drugs in the 1990s. Authorities said that protesters seized weapons and held some 200 soldiers hostage Friday. Morales and his supporters rejected reports of a violent hostage situation, with the leader's Kausachun Coca radio station airing footage that showed protesting union members and soldiers negotiating calmly while munching on coca leaves. 'Please, it’s not a take-over of military barracks,' Morales said. 'They are vigils until their economic and political demands are met.' Del Castillo, the minister, said Sunday that the government is, in principle, open to negotiation with Morales. But he said authorities didn’t trust his motives. 'Morales doesn’t care about the country, he cares about himself. He is looking for new confrontations,' said Del Castillo. 'Morales has a whole script to destabilize the government.' The surge in tensions comes against the backdrop of a bitter rift at the highest rungs of Bolivia’s long-dominant Movement Toward Socialism party, which deepened last month when authorities announced their intention to arrest Morales on charges that he fathered a daughter with a 15-year-old girl in 2016 when he was 56 years old and president. Morales and his supporters have decried the case as a political witch hunt aimed at blocking his candidacy in the 2025 election. Arce insists that the current constitution — which permits just two consecutive terms — forbids Morales, who held power from 2006-2019, from running next year, anyway. 'It is a betrayal of the people, of the party activists, of the revolution,' Morales said of Arce's efforts to undercut him. In neighboring Argentina, the government of far-right President Javier Milei on Saturday announced it had lodged a complaint accusing Morales of child abuse committed during the former president’s monthslong political exile in Argentina, from 2019 to 2020. At that time, allegations of election fraud sparked mass protests that led Morales to resign under pressure from the military and flee to Mexico before seeking asylum in Argentina — an ouster that Morales and his supporters view as a coup. Now, years later, Morales — who continues to evince intense support from the Indigenous population — has seized upon growing discontent with his chosen successor. 'It’s not that I, Evo, want to be president, the people have asked me to return,' Morales said. 'During my administration there was stability. When there is economic and political stability, there is happiness.' Many in the country have soured on Arce over the collapse of Bolivia’s once-growing economy built on cheap dollars and fuel. They look back fondly on the tenure of Morales, credited with lifting millions out of poverty and drastically narrowing Bolivia's wealth divide during the nation's natural gas boom. 'Now with more experience, we are ready to save Bolivia,' Morales said, promising he would revive the flailing economy by having Bolivia join BRICS, a group of emerging economies seeking to counter Western dominance of the world order, and collaborating more closely with China. The former president, now 65, isn't sure how long his hunger strike will last. But he said he's prepared for the deprivation. 'I do a lot of sports,' Morales said. 'Today I woke up at 4 a.m. and did 1,015 sit-ups.' ___ DeBre reported from Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Weather system in southwestern Caribbean expected to strengthen and head northward this week	MIAMI (AP) — A weather system in the southwestern Caribbean is expected to develop and strengthen this week, prompting a tropical storm warning for Jamaica and a hurricane watch for the Cayman Islands to be issued Sunday, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said. The system also could bring heavy rainfall to Cuba and Florida as well as the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico later this week, the center said. At 4 p.m. EST Sunday, the system was located about 345 miles (555 kilometers) south of Kingston, Jamaica, with maximum sustained winds of 35 mph (55kph), the center said. It was moving to the northeast at 7 mph (11 kph), with a turn to the north and then northwest expected. It was expected to become a tropical storm Monday with steady strengthening forecast. A tropical storm is defined as having maximum sustained winds of 39 mph (62.8 kph) up to 73 mph (117.5 kph). Hurricane-force winds are 74 miles (119.1 kph) and greater. The disturbance was expected to be near Jamaica by late Monday and the Cayman Islands on Tuesday and Wednesday, according to the hurricane center, which urged residents in Cuba and the Florida Keys to monitor the storm's progress. Heavy rainfall will affect the western Caribbean with totals of 3 to 6 inches (76 to 152 mm), and up to 9 inches (229 mm) expected locally in Jamaica and southern Cuba. Flooding and mudslides are possible in those nations. Heavy rains will reach Florida and adjacent areas of the southeast U.S. by mid- to late-week, the center said.	https://apnews.com/article/tropical-weather-caribbean-jamaica-cuba-florida-069e5fe8d494135771a752345704705f	2024-11-03T12:59:20-08:00	
Dani Olmo leads Barcelona to city derby win over Espanyol	MADRID (AP) — Dani Olmo made the most out of his return as a starter with Barcelona, scoring twice to lead the Catalan club to a 3-1 win over Espanyol in the city derby on Sunday in the Spanish league. Raphinha also scored for Barcelona, which a week ago had routed Real Madrid 4-0 in the clasico at the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium. Barcelona is now nine points ahead of Madrid, whose game at Valencia on Saturday was postponed because of the deadly floods that killed more than 200 people in southern Spain last week. The game between Villarreal and Rayo Vallecano also was postponed, as were three second-division games scheduled to be played in the region this weekend. The victory extended Barcelona's 27-match unbeaten streak against Espanyol in the league. Espanyol, sitting in 17th place, has lost six of its last seven league matches. Olmo scored his double in his return as a starter after hurting his right hamstring on Sept. 15 against Girona. He had come off the bench in the team's wins against Bayern Munich in the Champions League and Madrid in the Spanish league. 'I was excited about coming back,' Olmo said. 'I'm feeling well. It was important to keep winning.' He put Barcelona ahead in the 12th minute from close range after a neat cross by Lamine Yamal with the outside of his left foot. Olmo's second goal came with a strike from outside the area in the 31st. In his first season with Barcelona, Olmo now has five goals in five matches. Raphinha added to the lead in the 23rd by redirecting the ball into the net with one touch after Marc Casadó's long cross into the area. Barcelona has outscored its league opponents 40-11 in 12 matches. Madrid has the second-best attack with 21 goals scored. 'We are a team that can score a lot, not only with our strikers but also with the players in the second line,' Olmo said. 'We play very direct and create many opportunities.' Espanyol thought it had moved closer in the 27th but Jofre Carrera's goal was called off after video review because of offside. It also had a goal by Álvaro Tejero disallowed for offside in the 58th, then Javi Puado finally scored a goal that counted in the 63rd. Barcelona also had a goal called off in stoppage time. Before the match, Barcelona honored those who received awards at the Ballon d'Or ceremony last week, including Yamal, who earned the Kopa Trophy award for best Under-21 player, and Aitana Bonmatí, who won the award for the world’s best woman soccer player. Barcelona also won the best women’s team prize. There was also a moment of silence in honor of the flood victims, as has taken place in all league matches this weekend. Simeone's son scores Giuliano Simeone, son of Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone, scored his first goal with the club in the team's 2-0 win against Las Palmas. The goal came more than 20 years after Simeone's last league goal with the club as a player. Alexander Sorloth netted Atletico's second goal on Sunday, helping move the club back to third place, 10 points behind Barcelona. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer	https://apnews.com/article/barcelona-olmo-spanish-league-scores-simeone-atletico-61dc9876689a5231ad152572c3712e11	2024-11-03T09:37:19-08:00	
Iran’s help has transformed Yemen's Houthi rebels into a potent military force, UN experts say	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Yemen’s Houthi rebels have been transformed from a local armed group with limited capabilities to a powerful military organization with support from Iran, Iraqi armed groups, Lebanon’s Hezbollah militants and others, U.N. experts said in a new report. The Iranian-backed Houthis have exploited the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and worked to enhance their status in Iran’s self-described 'Axis of Resistance' to gain popularity in the region and beyond, the experts monitoring sanctions against the Houthis said in the 537-page report to the U.N. Security Council. To support Iranian-backed Hamas militants, whose surprise attacks in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, sparked the war in Gaza, the Houthis have been attacking vessels in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, disrupting global shipping in a key geopolitical area. Despite Houthi claims that they would target ships linked to Israel, the panel said its investigations revealed the rebels have been targeting vessels indiscriminately. Its analysis of data from the International Maritime Organization, the U.S. and the United Kingdom revealed that at least 134 attacks were carried out from Houthi-controlled areas against merchant and commercial vessels and U.S. and U.K. warships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden between Nov. 15, 2023, and July 31, 2024. 'The group’s shift to actions at sea increased their influence in the region,' the U.N. experts said. 'Such a scale of attacks, using weapon systems on civilian vessels, had never occurred since the Second World War.' In their attacks, the experts said, the Houthis used a new and previously undisclosed ballistic missile, the Hatem-2. The five-member U.N. panel includes experts on arms, finance, regional affairs, international humanitarian law and armed groups. The experts hail from India, Egypt, Switzerland, Belgium and Cabo Verde. Confidential sources told the panel that the Houthis are coordinating operations with al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula and strengthening ties to the al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab militant group in Somalia. The Houthis have been engaged in a civil war with Yemen’s internationally recognized government, backed by a Saudi-led coalition, since 2014, when they took control of the capital Sanaa and most of the north. Hopes for peace talks to end the war vanished after the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks. The U.N. experts said the Yemen conflict, which started as an internal fight and expanded into a regional confrontation, 'has now escalated into a major international crisis.' According to the experts, the number of Houthi fighters is estimated at 350,000 now, compared with 220,000 in 2022 and 30,000 in 2015. 'The panel observes the transformation of the Houthis from a localized armed group with limited capabilities to a powerful military organization, extending their operational capabilities well beyond the territories under their control,' the report said. The experts said the transformation has been possible due to the transfer of military materiel and training provided by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard’s elite Quds Force, Hezbollah and Iraqi specialists and technicians. Military experts, Yemeni officials and even officials close to the Houthis indicated that the rebel group couldn’t produce complex weapons systems such as ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, surveillance and attack drones, portable air defense systems, and thermal sights, which they have used without foreign support, the U.N. experts said. 'The scale, nature and extent of transfers of diverse military materiel and technology provided to the Houthis from external sources, including financial support and training of its combatants, is unprecedented,' the experts said. The panel said it observed similarities between multiple military items used by the Houthis and those produced and operated by Iran or its allies in the Axis of Resistance, which includes Hezbollah and Hamas and armed groups in Iraq and Syria. It said joint operations centers have been set up in Iraq and Lebanon with Houthi representatives 'aimed at coordinating joint military actions of the Axis of Resistance.' Inside Yemen, the panel said the Houthis have been intensifying military operations against the government. 'The internal military situation is fragile, and any internal or external trigger could lead to the resumption of military confrontations,' it said. The Houthis also have been recruiting large numbers of Yemeni youths and children as well as exploiting Ethiopian migrants, forcing them to join the fight against the government and engage in trafficking narcotics, it said. 'Exploiting high illiteracy rates, particularly in tribal areas, they have reportedly mobilized boys as young as 10 or 11, often despite parental opposition,' they said. 'Recruitment sermons and weekly classes on jihad are reportedly delivered in schools.' Child recruitment reportedly increased after the war in Gaza started and the U.S. and U.K. airstrikes in Yemen, the experts said. Yemen’s government said it received 3,298 reports of child recruitment in the first half of 2024, with youngsters reportedly used as human shields, spies and in combat — and for planting landmines and explosives, reconnaissance and as cooks.	https://apnews.com/article/houthis-yemen-united-nations-sanctions-2368b285b8872d08008998cbb8453a2a	2024-11-03T06:36:40-08:00	
Russia sends nearly 100 drones into Ukraine, as Zelenskyy urges tougher sanctions against Moscow	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Moscow sent 96 drones and a guided air missile into Ukraine overnight into Sunday, Ukrainian officials said. According to Ukraine’s Air Force, 66 drones were destroyed during the overnight barrage, along with the missile. A further 27 drones were 'lost' over various areas, it said, likely having been electronically jammed, while one drone flew into Belarusian airspace. No casualties were reported. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Sunday that Russia had launched around 900 guided aerial bombs, 500 drones and 30 missiles against Ukraine over the past week. Zelenskyy appealed Sunday on X to Ukraine’s allies to provide 'long-range capabilities for our security', saying that these 'attacks would have been impossible if we had sufficient support from the world.' Kyiv is still awaiting word from its Western partners on its repeated requests to use the long-range weapons they provide to hit targets on Russian soil, including for preemptive Ukrainian strikes on camps where North Korean troops are being trained. The Ukrainian President also urged partners to enact 'truly effective sanctions to prevent Russia from importing critical components for drone and missile production'. This appeal followed an address on Saturday, in which he said over 2,000 drones and missiles 'still using Western components' were launched against Ukraine in October, and underlined the need for more stringent export controls to prevent sanctions evasion. In Russia, the Defense Ministry said that 19 Ukrainian drones were shot down overnight into Sunday in three regions of Russia: 16 in the Rostov region, two in the Belgorod region and one in the Volgograd region. A man died Sunday in a Ukrainian drone attack in the Belgorod region, according to regional Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-drones-zelenskyy-missiles-3bc28b0e3dcc9c9379957399a7e81d68	2024-11-03T06:13:21-08:00	
Israel investigates leaks that appear to have bolstered Netanyahu as Gaza truce talks stalled	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — An Israeli court on Sunday loosened a gag order on a case investigating leaks of classified information suspected to involve one of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s media advisers. Critics say the leaks were aimed at giving Netanyahu political cover as Gaza cease-fire talks ground to a halt. Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing, downplaying the affair and publicly calling for the gag order to be lifted. Netanyahu has said the person in question 'never participated in security discussions, was not exposed to or received classified information, and did not take part in secret visits.' On Sunday, an Israeli court allowed the publication of the name of the central suspect in the case, Eli Feldstein, whom Israeli media said was one of Netanyahu’s media advisers. Israeli media reports say the case concerns the leak of classified information to two European media outlets, allegedly by Feldstein, who may not have been formally employed and did not have security clearance. The media reported Feldstein joined Netanyahu as an adviser weeks after the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks and previously worked as an adviser to far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir. The court did not release the names of three other suspects who are also being investigated in connection with the leak. The leaked documents are said to have formed the basis of a widely discredited article in the London-based Jewish Chronicle — which was later withdrawn — suggesting Hamas planned to spirit hostages out of Gaza through Egypt, and an article in Germany's Bild newspaper that said Hamas was drawing out the talks as a form of psychological warfare on Israel. Israeli media and other observers expressed skepticism about the articles, which appeared to support Netanyahu's demands in the talks and absolve him of blame for their failure. Netanyahu made no mention of the case in a visit to Israel’s northern border with Israel Sunday, according to a video released by his office. The articles came out as Netanyahu was calling for lasting Israeli control over the Philadelphi corridor along the Gaza-Egypt border, a demand that was first made public over the summer. Hamas rejected the demand and accused Netanyahu of deliberately sabotaging the talks, which have been mediated by the United States, Qatar and Egypt. The articles also seemed to provide political cover as Netanyahu faced intense criticism from the families of the hostages and much of the Israeli public, who blame him for the failure to reach a deal. The criticism reached a fever pitch in early September, with mass protests and calls for a general strike, after Hamas killed six hostages as Israeli troops closed in on them. A court document confirmed that an investigation by police, the military and the Shin Bet internal security agency is underway and that a number of suspects have been arrested for questioning. It said the affair poses 'a risk to sensitive information and sources' and 'harms the achievement of the goals of the war in the Gaza Strip.' The leak led to a scandal at the Jewish Chronicle, where prominent columnists resigned in protest over the discredited articles. The London-based newspaper removed the article in question and others by a freelance journalist, saying it was 'not satisfied with some of his claims.' The Bild article suggested Hamas was not serious about the negotiations and was using psychological warfare to stoke Israeli divisions. Netanyahu cited it in a meeting with his Cabinet after it was published. He again defended the article in a statement released over the weekend, saying it had 'exposed the Hamas methods of exerting psychological pressure from home and abroad on the Israeli government and public by blaming Israel for the failure of the talks to release the hostages.' Netanyahu has sought to blame Hamas, whose Oct. 7, 2023, attack into Israel ignited the war, for the failure of the talks. Hamas, which is still holding scores of hostages, has said it will only release them in exchange for a lasting cease-fire, a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the release of a large number of Palestinian prisoners. Hamas says those demands have not changed following last month's killing of its top leader Yahya Sinwar, as the United States, Egypt and Qatar seek to restart the negotiations. Netanyahu, often described by critics as image-obsessed, is on trial for corruption in three separate cases, two of which involve accusations that he gave favors to media moguls in exchange for positive coverage. His office has downplayed the latest affair and accused the judiciary of bias, citing the many other leaks over the course of the war. It has also denied the leak in question had any impact on the cease-fire talks. 'The document only helped the effort to return the hostages, and certainly did not harm it,' Netanyahu's office said in a statement Saturday, adding that he only learned about the document when it was publicized. His critics say the allegations are far more serious. Yoav Limor, writing in the pro-Netanyahu daily Israel Hayom, called it 'one of the gravest affairs Israel has ever known.' 'The damage it caused extends beyond the realm of national security and gives rise to suspicion that the prime minister’s bureau acted to scuttle a hostage deal, contrary to the war’s objectives.' ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-netanyahu-leaks-6075c848c8b32c8fd69835434c67046a	2024-11-03T06:01:32-08:00	
Cyprus is committed to expanding defense ties with the US, says its president	NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — The president of Cyprus said Sunday his administration is committed to expanding defense and security cooperation with the U.S., as his meeting with American President Joe Biden last week charted a course for the 'next ambitious steps' in bilateral relations that are currently at a 'historic high.' President Nikos Christodoulides says his government's 'clear foreign policy orientation' has resulted in deepening the Cyprus-U.S. strategic partnership over the first 18 months of his five-year term in fields including law enforcement cooperation on countering money laundering and sanctions evasion, as well as energy. A centerpiece of that security cooperation is the U.S.-funded center for port and maritime security known by its acronym CYCLOPS where officials from neighboring countries including Libya, Yemen and Lebanon, receive key training ranging from cybersecurity to ship inspections. Christodoulides said his Oct. 30 visit to the White House 'is proof and recognition of the geostrategic role of Cyprus and the country’s potential and capabilities.' 'Cyprus can be a reliable ‘port of stability’ and at the same time a country that has a vision to transform its immediate region, alongside its partners, into a region of promise, stability, cooperation and prosperity,' Christodoulides said in an email response to an Associated Press questionnaire. The Cypriot president said his administration is 'certainly considering' procuring U.S.-made weapons following the 2020 lifting of a decades-long arms embargo. But what must precede such purchases is for the U.S. Congress to lift its embargo for an extended period. Currently, that is renewed annually. Christodoulides said Cyprus’ geostrategic role is highlighted by the fact that since Sept. 27, some 3,635 third-country nationals from 29 countries have been repatriated through the island nation following their evacuation from Lebanon. He said several countries consider Cyprus an 'assisted departure hub and a Temporary Safe Location (TSL)' where the island’s ports, airports and designated temporary accommodations are used for civilian or military-led departures. He did not specify those countries. He said Cyprus is ready to respond if and when a mass evacuation from Lebanon is set in motion. Another key initiative for which Cyprus has gained international plaudits and was singled out by Biden is the so-called Amalthea plan that saw the establishment of the Cyprus-Gaza maritime corridor through which some 20,000 metric tons of aid flowed into the Palestinian territory earlier this year. Most of that aid reached Gaza through a U.S.-built, $230 million temporary pier project that lasted about four months after being beset by turbulent weather, security threats and sweeping personnel restrictions. Christodoulides said work is underway in cooperation with the U.S. the U.K. the United Arab Emirates and the European Union, to re-activate the maritime route to Gaza through the Israeli port of Ashdod. Collected aid will be security-screened in Cyprus and shipped to Ashdod 'for swift onward delivery to Gaza.' 'We maintain excellent, longstanding relations with our neighboring countries, underpinned by trust, and we have consistently acted as the region’s voice in the European Union, and as a reliable interlocutor and partner with all the states of the region,' Christodoulides said. On his decision to invite FBI and U.S. Department of Justice officials to help Cypriot law enforcement to halt Russian sanctions evasion through Cypriot lawyers and accountants, Christodoulides said, 'we are strongly determined to clear our country’s name internationally and prove that Cyprus is a state fully aligned with the principles and values of the West.' He said 'several cases' of possible sanctions evasion are under investigation' and the aim is to bring them to justice as quickly as possible.' Regarding energy cooperation, Christodoulides said the fact that both U.S. energy giants ExxonMobil and Chevron are active in the search for hydrocarbons in Cyprus’ offshore economic zone is 'a vote of confidence' in the island nation. He said next year will be a 'milestone' for both energy companies. ExxonMobil and partner QatarEnergy, which discovered a sizeable natural gas deposit in one of two areas, or blocks, they hold exploration licenses for, are scheduled to drill two additional wells in January of next year. Chevron is expected to complete fine-tuning a revised development plan for its Aphrodite gas field, estimated to hold around 4.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. 'As the first gas from the Aphrodite is directed to the market, this automatically makes Cyprus a gas seller, which is extremely important not only in monetary terms but also for geopolitical reasons,' said Christodoulides.	https://apnews.com/article/cyprus-us-president-biden-security-defense-cooperation-bdc23ad4b351fcc25def1e43cb26bc69	2024-11-03T05:25:44-08:00	
Flood survivors pelt Spain's royals with mud and premier is evacuated during a visit	VALENCIA, Spain (AP) — Spain's King Felipe VI and top government officials were pelted with mud by a crowd of enraged flood survivors during the first visit by the country's leaders Sunday to the epicenter of the nation's deadliest natural disaster in living memory. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez was evacuated from the scene, according to Spanish broadcaster RTVE, when the official contingent started to walk the mud-covered streets of Paiporta, one of the hardest hit areas where over 60 people perished and thousands of lives were shattered. Police had to step in, with some officers on horseback, to keep back the crowd of several dozens who hurled mud and wielded shovels and poles threateningly. 'Get out! Get out!' and 'Killers!' the crowd shouted among other insults. Bodyguards opened umbrellas to protect the royals and officials from the barrage of muck. After being forced to seek protection, the king, with flecks of mud on his face, remained calm and made several efforts to speak to individual residents. One person appeared to have wept on his shoulder. He shook the hand of a man. 'They knew it, they knew it, and yet they did nothing,' one young man shouted at the king while waving a finger in his face. One young woman swatted a bodyguard with a long pole. It was an unprecedented incident for a royal house that takes great care to craft an image of a monarch who is liked by the nation. But the public rage over the haphazard management of the crisis came to a boil on Sunday. Queen Letizia and regional Valencia President Carlo Mazón were also in the contingent. The queen had small glops of mud on her hands and arms as she spoke to women. 'We don´t have any water,' one woman told the queen. Many people still don’t have drinking water five days after the floods struck. Internet and mobile phone coverage remains patchy. Most people only got power back on Saturday. The neighborhood's stores and supermarkets are in ruins. Paiporta, population 30,000, still has many city blocks completely clogged with piles of detritus, countless totaled cars and a ubiquitous layer of mud. Over 200 people have died from Tuesday’s floods and thousands have had their homes destroyed by the tsunami-like wave. Indignation at the management the disaster started after the initial shock wore off. The floods had already hit Paiporta when the regional officials issued an alert to mobile phones. It sounded two hours too late. And more anger has been fueled by the inability of officials to respond quickly to the aftermath. Most of the cleanup of the layers and layers of mud and debris that has invaded countless homes has been done by residents and thousands of volunteers. 'We have lost everything!' someone shouted. Shouts included demands for Mazón, whose administration is in charge of civil protection, and 'Where is Pedro Sánchez?' Felipe insisted on trying to speak with people as he tried to continue his visit. He spoke to several people, patting two young men on their backs and sharing a quick embrace, with mud stains on his black raincoat. According to a journalist for Spanish broadcaster RTVE who was near Felipe, one woman wept and told him she didn’t have food or diapers while another person said 'don’t abandon us.' But after approximately half an hour of tension, the monarchs got in officials cars and left with a mounted police escort. One woman smacked an official car with an umbrella and another kicked it before it sped off.	https://apnews.com/article/spain-floods-king-protest-mud-a8525bd82cf4cc3fc6273d535cbb9d66	2024-11-03T03:37:57-08:00	
Crashing waves in a hilltop village, a night of terror from Spain's floods	CHIVA, Spain (AP) — Irene Cuevas will never forget the sound of the waves crashing below her apartment’s balcony.

'It was a constant fear because we didn’t have light to see by,' Cuevas told The Associated Press. 'We could hear the roar of the waves, which was unbelievable. The street was completely flooded and we were hoping for some lightning so that we could at least see what situation we were in. It was all waves, currents everywhere. 'We have that sound of the waves burned in our memory.' The devastating flash floods in eastern Spain this week that claimed over 200 lives and destroyed countless homes and livelihoods also seared a scar of terror in many survivors Cuevas, a 48-year-old embryologist, is a resident of Chiva, a village perched on a hill about 30 kilometers (18 miles) from Valencia city, whose southern outskirts were likewise ravaged by the floods on Tuesday and Wednesday. Chiva got more rain in eight hours than the town had experienced in the preceding 20 months. Cuevas was at home and saw how the gorge dividing her village suddenly overflowed with rushing water. The tsunami-like wall of water claimed at least seven lives in Chiva, home to some 16,000 people, and the search goes on for more missing, either in collapsed houses or in the gorge. 'It was terrifying because that night it began to rain and the water began to overflow the gorge and started carrying away cars and trees,' Cuevas said. 'The underpasses of the bridges started to clog with debris, and the water started to flow through the entire village.' The gorge, called the 'Barranco de Chiva,' is normally dry, but it is fed into by several other runoff gorges and channels water to vineyards below. The huge storm sent a blast of water that knocked down two of the four bridges crossing the gorge, while a third was left unsafe to cross. The sides of the gorge were eaten out, bringing down a sidewalk and several houses and tearing holes in others. Cuevas, who moved to Chiva when she got married 18 years ago, lives one street over from the buildings bordering the gorge. She and other people living in her apartment building helped several neighbors from the building in front when they feared it would come down. The neighbors said their building trembled from the force of the water. Cuevas and her fellow residents helped tie ropes or cords across the street so that the people on the other side could hang on as they waded through the rushing water. They then made it up the stairs and some 20 people spent a sleepless night in her second-floor apartment and the apartment above. Amparo Cerda, Cuevas' upstairs neighbor, described herself as traumatized by her memories of the fury of the waves and the sound of 'doors exploding' from the water’s force. It was as if their building had become a ship lost in a storm at sea in the pitch black night. 'There were waves in the gorge, waves in the street below where the water came in the other direction and ran into the water coming from the gorge,' Cuevas said. 'So right here, at this corner, just where the houses fell down, the two currents hit and produced terrifying waves.' 'When the daylight came we could see the damage,' Cuevas said. 'We saw all the houses that had disappeared and there was a feeling of impotence because you didn’t know where to start looking for people.' Five days have passed since that night of terror, and in Chiva and other localities, such as Paiporta, Barrio de la Torre, and Massanassa, citizens and volunteers are pitching in to clean up the mountains of debris and the thick brown layers of mud left by the water. Five thousand more soldiers are arriving in the area this weekend to help the 2,500 already deployed. Thousands of police officers have also been sent in. But for now it is the people themselves still leading the way. 'Now we need to clean up and try to get back to normal because there are more rains forecast for the weekend, and that won’t help,' Cuevas said. 'We are trying to get everything ready for when the rains comes back. Because they will.'	https://apnews.com/article/spain-floods-valencia-chiva-edcef9ff9430d0d35e2f464b068cec7d	2024-11-03T02:33:32-08:00	
A grenade explosion in a busy market in Indian-controlled Kashmir wounds 9	SRINAGAR, India (AP) — An assailant threw a grenade at a marketplace bustling with shoppers in the main city of Indian-controlled Kashmir on Sunday, wounding at least nine people, police said. The attack comes a day after a suspected militant was killed in a daylong gunbattle in Srinagar, a rare occurrence in the city where security is tight. Police said an unidentified attacker hurled a grenade from a flyover bridge, apparently targeting a stationed paramilitary vehicle, in the main business center of Srinagar, where Sunday's flea market is visited by thousands of people. The grenade exploded in the midst of shoppers and vendors, wounding at least nine, police said. All were taken to a hospital and reinforcements of police and paramilitary soldiers launched a search for the attacker. In the past, Indian authorities have blamed rebels fighting against Indian rule in the disputed region for similar grenade attacks. Rebels have in turn accused government agents of carrying out the attacks to defame their movement. 'There can be no justification for targeting innocent civilians,' Kashmir’s Chief Minister Omar Abdullah wrote on the social media platform X. 'The security apparatus must do everything possible to end this spurt of attacks at the earliest so that people can go about their lives without any fear.' India and Pakistan each administer a part of Kashmir, but both claim the territory in its entirety. The nuclear-armed rivals have fought two of their three wars over the territory since they gained independence from British colonial rule in 1947. Militants in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir have been fighting New Delhi’s rule since 1989. Many Muslim Kashmiris support the rebels’ goal of uniting the territory, either under Pakistani rule or as an independent country. India insists the Kashmir militancy is Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. Pakistan denies the charge, and many Kashmiris consider it a legitimate freedom struggle. Tens of thousands of civilians, rebels and government forces have been killed in the conflict.	https://apnews.com/article/kashmir-india-pakistan-grenade-attack-ffb56c11bde0b124a02440d88cd535bf	2024-11-03T02:01:22-08:00	
Palestinians say Israel struck a Gaza clinic during a polio campaign. The army denies it	CAIRO (AP) — Palestinian officials say an Israeli drone strike on a clinic in northern Gaza where children were being vaccinated for polio wounded six people, including four children. The Israeli military denied responsibility. The alleged strike occurred Saturday in northern Gaza, which has been encircled by Israeli forces and largely isolated for the past year. Israel has been carrying out another offensive there in recent weeks that has killed hundreds of people and displaced tens of thousands. It was not possible to resolve the conflicting accounts. Israeli forces have repeatedly raided hospitals in Gaza over the course of the war, saying Hamas uses them for militant purposes, allegations denied by Palestinian health officials. Dr. Munir al-Boursh, director general of the Gaza Health Ministry, told The Associated Press that a quadcopter struck the Sheikh Radwan clinic in Gaza City early Saturday afternoon, just a few minutes after a United Nations delegation left the facility. The World Health Organization and the U.N. children's agency, known as UNICEF, which are jointly carrying out the polio vaccination campaign, expressed concern over the reported strike. 'The reports of this attack are even more disturbing as the Sheikh Radwan Clinic is one of the health points where parents can get their children vaccinated,' said Rosalia Bollen, a spokesperson for UNICEF. 'Today’s attack occurred while the humanitarian pause was still in effect, despite assurances given that the pause would be respected from 6 a.m. to 4 p.m.' Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, an Israeli military spokesman, said that 'contrary to the claims, an initial review determined that the (Israeli military) did not strike in the area at the specified time.' A scaled-down campaign to administer a second dose of the polio vaccine began Saturday in parts of northern Gaza. It had been postponed from Oct. 23 due to lack of access, Israeli bombings and mass evacuation orders, and the lack of assurances for humanitarian pauses, a U.N. statement said. The administration of the first dose was carried out in September across the Gaza Strip, including areas of northern Gaza that are now completely sealed off. Health officials said the campaign's first round, and the administration of the second dose across central and southern Gaza, were successful. At least 100,000 people have been forced to evacuate from areas of north Gaza toward Gaza City in the past few weeks, but around 15,000 children under the age of 10 remain in northern towns, including Jabaliya, Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun, which are inaccessible, according to the U.N. The final phase of the polio vaccination campaign had aimed to reach an estimated 119,000 children in the north with a second dose of oral polio vaccine, the agencies said, but 'achieving this target is now unlikely due to access constraints.' They say 90% of children in every community must be vaccinated to prevent the spread of the disease. The campaign was launched after the first polio case was reported in Gaza in 25 years — a 10-month-old boy, now paralyzed in the leg. The World Health Organization said the presence of a paralysis case indicates there could be hundreds more who have been infected but aren’t showing symptoms. The war began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Israel’s offensive has killed over 43,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health authorities, who do not say how many were combatants but say more than half were women and children. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-lebanon-hezbollah-iran-news-11-03-2024-9806fad6404f68737c5192c6fa1c7b9f	2024-11-03T00:07:35-07:00	
Lawmakers are vetting the EU chief's new team. It might be tough but she has the right on her side	BRUSSELS (AP) — Five months after the European Union lurched to the political right, the influence of nationalist and populist parties will go on public display in Brussels on Monday when lawmakers vet the proposed new members of the EU’s increasingly powerful executive branch. Over five days of hearings, the EU parliamentarians will grill 26 top officials — nominated by their national governments — to establish whether they are suitable to lead the next European Commission on policies like agriculture, trade, economic affairs, health or migration. The commission is the only EU body with the power to draft laws which, once passed by the Parliament and the council of member states, apply in all 27 countries of the bloc. They cover everything from water quality to data protection to competition policy. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen assembled her new-look executive in September, seeking to balance sensitive political, geographical and gender concerns within a team that will lead the European project for the next five years. The vast majority of the would-be commissioners come from the right of the political spectrum, mostly the European People’s Party (EPP), a conservative EU-wide political family that counts von der Leyen as a member and is the biggest in the parliament. That should makes things easier for her. Despite that advantage, the EPP has already worked with hard-right groups — including Italian Premier Georgia Meloni’s Brothers of Italy, which has neo-fascist roots, and stridently nationalist lawmakers from Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán's ruling Fidesz — to secure majorities in the European Parliament. Other pro-European parties were weakened in the June 6-9 EU elections and von der Leyen can operate without them. The second-biggest group — the center-left Socialists and Democrats — seems ready to rubber-stamp her team. Its leaders say it does not have a 'kill list' of nominees that it intends to remove. A commission that's hard to ignore The commission is akin to a government cabinet, with commissioners instead of ministers. But it proposes laws that influence all aspects of the lives of around 450 million people in the 27 countries that make up the world’s biggest trading bloc. Von der Leyen is the boss of more than 33,000 employees. The commission handles trade talks, sealing agreements with EU partners in the outside world and managing disputes at the World Trade Organization. It’s also a powerful competition watchdog, whose influence has been felt by tech giants like Apple, Google and Meta. Von der Leyen's power is growing. Her team led the European drive to secure COVID-19 vaccines, and whipped up a massive rescue package to help Europe's economies cope with the cost of trying to stop the pandemic spreading. It also helped the EU weather the energy crisis sparked by Russia’s war on Ukraine. New faces to represent Europe on the world stage This is von der Leyen’s second term. More than half the nominees — 14 of them, compared to 10 last time — are from EPP parties, like her. Ten of them are women. Von der Leyen, a German, is keeping Europe's other major powers France, Italy and Spain close by her side. To the disappointment of mainstream parties, she has penciled in Meloni ally Raffaele Fitto as a new executive vice president — one of five — to oversee 'cohesion policy,' which helps finance infrastructure projects with a big slice of the EU’s massive budget. Former French Foreign Minister Stéphane Séjourné was made a VP and secured the industry portfolio. Spanish Socialist Teresa Ribera, another VP, has a powerful post combining the transition toward a green economy and competition policies. Former Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas will be von der Leyen's foreign policy chief. Ultimately, though, they will all answer to the president. The first hurdle: confirmation hearings Nominees are questioned for three hours by the leaders of committees and senior lawmakers most closely linked to their portfolios. The nominees must demonstrate general competence, a commitment to Europe, independence, and good communications skills. Immediately after, an evaluation is made behind closed doors. Candidates must win a two-thirds majority vote. If they fall short, lawmakers can ask additional questions in writing or request a further 90-minute grilling. Some candidates are deemed not good enough. Lawmakers might reject others as a show of strength. Three were vetoed in 2019. Sometimes portfolios are switched among the commissioners, or their responsibilities redefined, to satisfy the parliament’s demands. The vote results should remain secret until the entire hearing process ends on Nov. 12. But given the high political stakes, lawmakers will probably leak the news. Any group that vetoes a candidate risks seeing their own knocked out in revenge. Some appear more at risk than others Von der Leyen's EPP and the hard right ganged up to set the hearing agenda. As a result, the most controversial candidate — Italy's Fitto — is the first of the six VPs to be questioned on the final day of hearings. Any mainstream lawmakers who target him risk seeing their favorite ousted in return. One of the first candidates to make his case will be Glenn Micallef — the socialist nominee for youth, culture and sport — who hails from Malta, the EU's smallest country. He's been branded as a political lightweight, compared to the former ministers and premiers being questioned. His fate could set the tone. Marta Kos, a liberal from Slovenia foreseen as the next enlargement commissioner, is inexperienced too. She's also been criticized for being pro-Russian. Oliver Varhelyi is Orbán's man in Brussels. He's been given the health and animal welfare portfolio. Lawmakers still seethe about a hot mic incident in which he referred to them as 'idiots.' Some doubt the wisdom of putting him in charge of health after Orbán opted for Russian and Chinese-made vaccines rather than join the EU's joint purchasing effort. But voting him down poses risks. Orbán has been at war with the commission and he could simply refuse to name a replacement, blocking the entire process.	https://apnews.com/article/eu-commission-parliament-hearings-leyen-right-fitto-561e8c0abfb4f87c8740c4969984952a	2024-11-02T23:10:28-07:00	
US says Iranian-American held in Iran as tensions high following Israeli attack on country	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — An Iranian-American journalist who once worked for a U.S. government-funded broadcaster is believed to have been detained by Iran for months now, authorities said Sunday, further raising the stakes as Tehran threatens to retaliate over an Israeli attack on the country. The imprisonment of Reza Valizadeh, acknowledged to The Associated Press by the U.S. State Department, came as Iran marked the 45th anniversary of the American Embassy takeover and hostage crisis on Sunday. It also followed Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei threatening both Israel and the U.S. the day before with 'a crushing response' as long-range B-52 bombers reached the Middle East in an attempt to deter Tehran. Valizadeh had worked for Radio Farda, an outlet under Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty that's overseen by the U.S. Agency for Global Media. In February, he wrote on the social platform X that his family members had been detained in an effort to see him return to Iran. In August, Valizadeh apparently posted two messages suggesting he had returned to Iran despite Radio Farda being viewed by Iran's theocracy as a hostile outlet. 'I arrived in Tehran on March 6, 2024. Before that, I had unfinished negotiations with the (Revolutionary Guard's) intelligence department,' the message read in part. 'Eventually I came back to my country after 13 years without any security guarantee, even a verbal one.' Valizadeh added the name of a man who he claimed belonged to Iran's Intelligence Ministry. The AP could not verify if the person worked for the ministry. Rumors have been circulating for weeks that Valizadeh had been detained. The Human Rights Activists News Agency, which monitors cases in Iran, said that he had been detained on arrival to the country earlier this year, but later released. He was then rearrested and sent to Evin prison, where he now faces a case in Iran's Revolutionary Court, which routinely holds closed-door hearings in which defendants face secret evidence, the agency reported. Valizadeh had faced arrest in 2007 as well, it said. The State Department told the AP that it was 'aware of reports that this dual U.S.-Iranian citizen has been arrested in Iran' when asked about Valizadeh. 'We are working with our Swiss partners who serve as the protecting power for the United States in Iran to gather more information about this case,' the State Department said. 'Iran routinely imprisons U.S. citizens and other countries’ citizens unjustly for political purposes. This practice is cruel and contrary to international law.' Iran has not acknowledged detaining Valizadeh. Iran's mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Voice of America, another U.S. government-funded media outlet overseen by the Agency for Global Media, first reported the State Department was acknowledging Valizadeh's detention in Iran. Since the 1979 U.S. Embassy crisis, which saw dozens of hostages released after 444 days in captivity, Iran has used prisoners with Western ties as bargaining chips in negotiations with the world. In September 2023, five Americans detained for years in Iran were freed in exchange for five Iranians in U.S. custody and for $6 billion in frozen Iranian assets to be released by South Korea. Valizadeh is the first American known to be detained by Iran in the time since. Meanwhile, Iranian state television aired footage Sunday of different cities across the country marking the anniversary of the embassy takeover. Gen. Hossein Salami, the head of the Guard, also spoke in Tehran, where he repeated a pledge made the day before by Khamenei. 'The resistance front and Iran will equip itself with whatever necessary to confront and defeat the enemy,' he said, referring to the militant groups like Hamas and Lebanon’s Hezbollah backed by Tehran. In Tehran, thousands at the gate of the former U.S. Embassy chanted 'Death to America' and 'Death to Israel.' Some burned flags of the countries and effigies of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. They also carried images of killed top figures of Iran’s allied militant groups including Lebanese Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and Palestinian Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. The crowd in the state-organized rallies chanted they were ready to defend the Palestinians. — Associated Press writer Nasser Karimi in Tehran, Iran, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-us-prisoner-israel-hamas-war-lebanon-fe47ab33a4ac29a19ac0177ee06786ef	2024-11-02T22:41:52-07:00	
Moldovans to choose president in decisive runoff overshadowed by fraud and intimidation claims	CHISINAU, Moldova (AP) — Moldovans are casting votes in a decisive presidential runoff Sunday that pits pro-Western incumbent Maia Sandu against a Russia-friendly opponent, as ongoing claims of voter fraud and intimidation threaten democracy in the European Union candidate country. In the first round held Oct. 20, Sandu obtained 42% of the ballot but failed to win an outright majority. She will face Alexandr Stoianoglo, a former prosecutor general, who outperformed polls in the first round with almost 26% of the vote. Polling stations opened Sunday at 7 a.m. local time (0500 GMT) and will close at 9 p.m. (1900 GMT). A poll released by research company iData indicates a tight race that leans toward a narrow Sandu victory, an outcome that might rely on Moldova’s large diaspora. The presidential role carries significant powers in areas such as foreign policy and national security and has a four-year term. Moldova's diaspora played a key role in a nationwide referendum also held on Oct. 20, when a narrow majority of 50.35% voted to secure Moldova's path toward EU membership. But the results of the ballots including Sunday's vote have been overshadowed by allegations of a major vote-buying scheme and voter intimidation. Instead of winning the overwhelming support that Sandu had hoped, the results in both races exposed Moldova’s judiciary as unable to adequately protect the democratic process. On Friday, Moldova’s Prime Minister Dorin Recean said that people throughout the country were receiving 'anonymous death threats via phone calls' in what he called 'an extreme attack' to scare voters in the former Soviet republic, which has a population of about 2.5 million people. 'These acts of intimidation have only one purpose: to create panic and fear,' Recean said in a statement posted on social media. 'I assure you that state institutions will ensure order and protect citizens.' Outside a polling station on Sunday in Romania’s capital, Bucharest, 20-year-old medical student Silviana Zestrea said the runoff would be a 'definitive step' toward Moldova’s future. 'People need to understand that we have to choose a true candidate that will fulfill our expectations,' she said. 'Because I think even if we are a diaspora now, none of us actually wanted to leave.' In the wake of the two October votes, Moldovan law enforcement said that a vote-buying scheme was orchestrated by Ilan Shor, an exiled oligarch who lives in Russia and was convicted in absentia last year of fraud and money laundering. Shor denies any wrongdoing. Prosecutors say $39 million was paid to more than 130,000 recipients through an internationally sanctioned Russian bank to voters between September and October. Anticorruption authorities have conducted hundreds of searches and seized over $2.7 million (2.5 million euros) in cash as they attempt to crack down. In one case in Gagauzia, an autonomous part of Moldova where only 5% voted in favor of the EU, a physician was detained after allegedly coercing 25 residents of a home for older adults to vote for a candidate they did not choose. Police said they obtained 'conclusive evidence,' including financial transfers from the same Russian bank. On Saturday at a church in Comrat, the capital of Gagauzia, Father Vasilii told the Associated Press that he's urged people to go and vote because it's a 'civic obligation' and that they do not name any candidates. 'We use the goods the country offers us — light, gas,' he said. 'Whether we like what the government does or not, we must go and vote. ... The church always prays for peace.' On Thursday, prosecutors also raided a political party headquarters and said 12 people were suspected of paying voters to select a candidate in the presidential race. A criminal case was also opened in which 40 state agency employees were suspected of taking electoral bribes. Cristian Cantir, a Moldovan associate professor of international relations at Oakland University, told the AP that whatever the outcome of the second round, it 'will not deflate' geopolitical tensions. 'On the contrary, I expect geopolitical polarization to be amplified by the campaign for the 2025 legislative elections,' he said. Moldovan law enforcement needs more resources and better-trained staff working at a faster pace to tackle voter fraud, he added, to 'create an environment in which anyone tempted to either buy or sell votes knows there will be clear and fast consequences.' Savlina Adasan, a 21-year-old economics student in Bucharest, says she voted for Sandu and cited concerns about corruption and voters uninformed about the two candidates. 'We want a European future for our country,' she said, adding that it offers 'many opportunities, development for our country … and I feel like if the other candidate wins, then it means that we are going ten steps back as a country.' A pro-Western government has been in power in Moldova since 2021, and a parliamentary election will be held in 2025. Moldova watchers warn that next year’s vote could be Moscow’s main target. In the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Moldova applied to join the EU. It was granted candidate status in June of that year, and in summer 2024, Brussels agreed to start membership negotiations. The sharp Westward shift irked Moscow and significantly soured relations with Chisinau. Since then, Moldovan authorities have repeatedly accused Russia of waging a vast 'hybrid war,' from sprawling disinformation campaigns to protests by pro-Russia parties to vote-buying schemes that undermine countrywide elections. Russia has denied it is meddling. —— Stephen McGrath reported from Bucharest, Romania; Nicolae Dumitrache from Comrat, Moldova.	https://apnews.com/article/moldova-presidential-election-russia-corruption-fraud-5886447779a4a818e9f30fdadcb8bbe5	2024-11-02T21:07:28-07:00	
Nevada lithium mine will crush rare plant habitat US said is critical to its survival, lawsuit says	RENO, Nev. (AP) — Conservationists and a Native American tribe are suing the U.S. to try to block a Nevada lithium mine they say will drive an endangered desert wildflower to extinction, disrupt groundwater flows and threaten cultural resources. The Center for Biological Diversity promised the court battle a week ago when the U.S. Interior Department approved Ioneer Ltd.’s Rhyolite Ridge lithium-boron mine at the only place Tiehm's buckwheat is known to exist in the world, near the California line halfway between Reno and Las Vegas. It is the latest in a series of legal fights over projects President Joe Biden’s administration is pushing under his clean energy agenda intended to cut reliance on fossil fuels, in part by increasing the production of lithium to make electric vehicle batteries and solar panels. The new lawsuit says the Interior Department’s approval of the mine marks a dramatic about-face by U.S wildlife experts who warned nearly two years ago that Tiehm’s buckwheat was 'in danger of extinction now' when they listed it as an endangered species in December 2022. 'One cannot save the planet from climate change while simultaneously destroying biodiversity,' said Fermina Stevens, director of the Western Shoshone Defense Project, which joined the center in the lawsuit filed Thursday in federal court in Reno. 'The use of minerals, whether for EVs or solar panels, does not justify this disregard for Indigenous cultural areas and keystone environmental laws,' said John Hadder, director of the Great Basin Resource Watch, another co-plaintiff. Rita Henderson, spokeswoman for Interior's Bureau of Land Management in Reno, said Friday the agency had no immediate comment. Ioneer Vice President Chad Yeftich said the Australia-based mining company intends to intervene on behalf of the U.S. and 'vigorously defend' approval of the project, 'which was based on its careful and thorough permitting process.' 'We are confident that the BLM will prevail,' Yeftich said. He added that he doesn't expect the lawsuit will postpone plans to begin construction next year. The lawsuit says the mine will harm sites sacred to the Western Shoshone people. That includes Cave Spring, a natural spring less than a mile (1.6 kilometers) away described as 'a site of intergenerational transmission of cultural and spiritual knowledge.' But it centers on alleged violations of the Endangered Species Act. It details the Fish and Wildlife Service's departure from the dire picture it painted earlier of threats to the 6-inch-tall (15-centimeter-tall) wildflower with cream or yellow blooms bordering the open-pit mine Ioneer plans to dig three times as deep as the length of a football field. The mine's permit anticipates up to one-fifth of the nearly 1.5 square miles (3.6 square kilometers) the agency designated as critical habitat surrounding the plants — home to various pollinators important to their survival — would be lost for decades, some permanently. When proposing protection of the 910 acres (368 hectares) of critical habitat, the service said 'this unit is essential to the conservation and recovery of Tiehm’s buckwheat.' The agency formalized the designation when it listed the plant in December 2022, dismissing the alternative of less-stringent threatened status. 'We find that a threatened species status is not appropriate because the threats are severe and imminent, and Tiehm’s buckwheat is in danger of extinction now, as opposed to likely to become endangered in the future,' the agency concluded. The lawsuit also discloses for the first time that the plant's population, numbering fewer than 30,000 in the government's latest estimates, has suffered additional losses since August that were not considered in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's biological opinion. The damage is similar to what the bureau concluded was caused by rodents eating the plants in a 2020 incident that reduced the population as much as 60%, the lawsuit says. The Fish and Wildlife Service said in its August biological opinion that while the project 'will result in the long-term disturbance (approximately 23 years) of 146 acres (59 hectares) of the plant community ... and the permanent loss of 45 acres (18 hectares), we do not expect the adverse effects to appreciably diminish the value of critical habitat as a whole.'	https://apnews.com/article/climate-lithium-mine-endangered-species-energy-nevada-2b61e65f6d06ec1e1517a03364c34d4f	2024-11-02T20:58:04-07:00	
US flies long-range bomber in drill with South Korea, Japan in reaction to the North's missile test	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — The United States flew a long-range bomber in a trilateral drill with South Korea and Japan on Sunday in response to North Korea’s recent test-firing of a new intercontinental ballistic missile designed to strike the U.S. mainland, South Korea’s military said. North Korea on Thursday tested the newly developed Hwasong-19 ICBM, which flew higher and stayed in the air longer than any other missile it has fired. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called it 'an appropriate military action' to cope with external security threats posed by its rivals. On Sunday, the U.S. flew the B-1B bomber to train with South Korean and Japanese fighter jets near the Korean Peninsula, demonstrating the three countries’ firm resolve and readiness to respond to North Korea’s advancing nuclear and missile programs, South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement. The trilateral aerial training was the second by South Korea, the U.S. and Japan this year, the statement said. The U.S. often responds to major North Korean missile tests with temporary deployments of some of its powerful military assets such as long-range bombers, aircraft carriers and nuclear-powered submarines to and near the Korean Peninsula. North Korea typically responds angrily to such U.S. actions, calling them part of a U.S.-led plot to invade the North and performing additional weapons tests. The U.S. has flown the B-1B bomber over or near the Korean Peninsula four times this year, according to South Korea’s military. A B-1B is capable of carrying a large conventional weapons payload. Thursday's Hwasong-19 test, North Korea's first ICBM test-firing in almost a year, showed progress in North Korea’s missile program. But many experts say North Korea still has some technological issues to master to acquire functioning ICBMs that can deliver nuclear strikes on the U.S. mainland. The experts say the Hwasong-19 shown in North Korea’s state media photos and videos looked too big to be useful in a war. The ICBM test was seen as an effort to grab American attention ahead of the U.S. presidential election this week and respond to international condemnation of North Korea's reported dispatch of thousands of troops to Russia to support its war against Ukraine, observers say.	https://apnews.com/article/us-bomber-north-korea-missile-test-43b568921a7521468167fe30915cd943	2024-11-02T20:41:30-07:00	
Still wrecked from past Israeli raids, hospitals in northern Gaza come under attack again	JERUSALEM (AP) — They were built to be places of healing. But once again, three hospitals in northern Gaza are encircled by Israeli troops and under fire. Bombardment is pounding around them as Israel wages a new offensive against Hamas fighters that it says have regrouped nearby. As staff scramble to treat waves of wounded, they remain haunted by a war that has seen hospitals targeted with an intensity and overtness rarely seen in modern warfare. All three were besieged and raided by Israeli troops some 10 months ago. The Kamal Adwan, al-Awda and Indonesian hospitals still have not recovered from the damage, yet are the only hospitals even partially operational in the area. Medical facilities often come under fire in wars, but combatants usually depict such incidents as accidental or exceptional, since hospitals enjoy special protection under international law. In its yearlong campaign in Gaza, Israel has stood out by carrying out an open campaign on hospitals, besieging and raiding at least 10 of them across the Gaza Strip, some several times, as well as hitting multiple others in strikes. It has said this is a military necessity in its aim to destroy Hamas after the militants’ Oct. 7, 2023 attacks. It claims Hamas uses hospitals as 'command and control bases' to plan attacks, to shelter fighters and to hide hostages. It argues that nullifies the protections for hospitals. 'If we intend to take down the military infrastructure in the north, we have to take down the philosophy of (using) the hospitals,' Israeli military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said of Hamas during an interview with The Associated Press in January after the first round of hospital raids. Most prominently, Israel twice raided Gaza City’s Shifa Hospital, the biggest medical facility in the strip, producing a video animation depicting it as a major Hamas base, though the evidence it presented remains disputed. But the focus on Shifa has overshadowed raids on other facilities. The AP spent months gathering accounts of the raids on al-Awda, Indonesian and Kamal Adwan Hospitals, interviewing more than three dozen patients, witnesses and medical and humanitarian workers as well as Israeli officials. It found that Israel has presented little or even no evidence of a significant Hamas presence in those cases. The AP presented a dossier listing the incidents reported by those it interviewed to the Israeli military spokesman’s office. The office said it could not comment on specific events. Al-Awda Hospital: ‘A death sentence’ The Israeli military has never made any claims of a Hamas presence at al-Awda. When asked what intelligence led troops to besiege and raid the hospital last year, the military spokesman’s office did not reply. In recent weeks, the hospital has been paralyzed once again, with Israeli troops fighting in nearby Jabalia refugee camp and no food, water or medical supplies entering areas of northern Gaza. Its director Mohammed Salha said last month that the facility was surrounded by troops and was unable to evacuate six critical patients. Staff were down to eating one meal a day, usually just a flat bread or a bit of rice, he said. As war-wounded poured in, exhausted surgeons were struggling to treat them. No vascular surgeons or neurosurgeons remain north of Gaza City, so the doctors often resort to amputating shrapnel-shattered limbs to save lives. 'We are reliving the nightmares of November and December of last year, but worse,' Salha said. 'We have fewer supplies, fewer doctors and less hope that anything will be done to stop this.' The military, which did not respond to a specific request for comment on al-Awda hospital, says it takes all possible precautions to prevent civilian casualties. Last year, fighting was raging around al-Awda when, on Nov. 21, a shell exploded in the facility's operating room. Dr. Mahmoud Abu Nujaila, two other doctors and a patient’s uncle died almost instantly, according to international charity Doctors Without Borders, which said it had informed the Israeli military of its coordinates. Dr. Mohammed Obeid, Abu Nujaila’s colleague, recalled dodging shellfire inside the hospital complex. Israeli sniper fire killed a nurse and two janitors and wounded a surgeon, hospital officials said. By Dec. 5, al-Awda was surrounded. For 18 days, coming or going became 'a death sentence,' Obeid said. Survivors and hospital administrators recounted at least four occasions when Israeli drones or snipers killed or badly wounded Palestinians trying to enter. Two women about to give birth were shot and bled to death in the street, staff said. Salha, the administrator, watched gunfire kill his cousin, Souma, and her 6-year-old son as she brought the boy for treatment of wounds. Shaza al-Shuraim said labor pains left her no choice but to walk an hour to al-Awda to give birth. She, her mother-in-law and 16-year-old brother-in-law raised flags made of white blouses. 'Civilians!' her mother-in-law, Khatam Sharir, kept shouting. Just outside the gate, a burst of gunfire answered, killing Sharir. On Dec. 23, troops stormed the hospital, ordering men ages 15 to 65 to strip and undergo interrogation in the yard. Mazen Khalidi, whose infected right leg had been amputated, said nurses pleaded with soldiers to let him rest rather than join the blindfolded and handcuffed men outside. They refused, and he hobbled downstairs, his stump bleeding. 'The humiliation scared me more than death,' Khalidi said. The hospital’s director, Ahmed Muhanna, was seized by Israeli troops; his whereabouts remain unknown. One of Gaza’s leading doctors, orthopedist Adnan al-Bursh, was also detained during the raid and died in Israeli custody in May. In the wreckage from the November shelling, staff found a message that Abu Nujaila had written on a whiteboard in the previous weeks. 'Whoever stays until the end will tell the story,' it read in English. 'We did what we could. Remember us.' Indonesian Hospital: ‘Patients dying before your eyes’ Several blocks away, on Oct. 18, artillery hit the upper floors of Indonesian Hospital, staff said. People fled for their lives. They'd already been surrounded by Israeli troops, leaving doctors and patients inside without enough food, water and supplies. 'The bombing around us has increased. They’ve paralyzed us,' said Edi Wahyudi, an Indonesian volunteer. Two patients died because of a power outage and lack of supplies, said Muhannad Hadi, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Palestinian territories. Tamer al-Kurd, a nurse at the hospital, said around 44 patients and only two doctors remain. He said he was so dehydrated he was starting to hallucinate. 'People come to me to save them. … I can’t do that by myself, with two doctors,' he said in a voice message, his voice weak. 'I’m tired.' On Saturday, the Israeli military said it had facilitated the evacuation of 29 patients from Indonesian and al-Awda hospitals. The Indonesian is Northern Gaza’s largest hospital. Today its top floors are charred, its walls pockmarked by shrapnel, its gates strewn with piled-up rubble — all the legacy of Israel's siege in the autumn of 2023. Before the assault, the Israeli army claimed an underground command-and-control center lay beneath the hospital. It released blurry satellite images of what it said was a tunnel entrance in the yard and a rocket launchpad nearby, outside the hospital compound. The Indonesia-based group that funds the hospital denied any Hamas presence. 'If there’s a tunnel, we would know. We know this building because we built it brick by brick, layer by layer. It’s ridiculous,' Arief Rachman, a hospital manager from the Indonesia-based Medical Emergency Rescue Committee, told the AP last month. After besieging and raiding the hospital, the military did not mention or show evidence of the underground facility or tunnels it had earlier claimed. When asked if any tunnels were found, the military spokesman's office did not reply. It released images of two vehicles found in the compound — a pickup truck with military vests and a bloodstained car belonging to an abducted Israeli, suggesting he had been brought to the hospital on Oct. 7. Hamas has said it brought wounded hostages to hospitals for treatment. During the siege, Israeli shelling crept closer and closer until, on Nov. 20, it hit the Indonesian’s second floor, killing 12 people and wounding dozens, according to staff. Israel said troops responded to 'enemy fire' from the hospital but denied using shells. Gunfire over the next days hit walls and whizzed through intensive care. Explosions sparked fires outside the hospital courtyard where some 1,000 displaced Palestinians sheltered, according to staff. The Israeli military denied targeting the hospital, although it acknowledged nearby bombardment may have damaged it. For three weeks, wounded poured in — up to 500 a day to a facility with capacity for 200. Supplies hadn’t entered in weeks. Bloodstained linens piled up. Doctors, some working 24-hour shifts, ate a few dates a day. The discovery of moldy flour on Nov. 23 was almost thrilling. Without medicines or ventilators, there was little doctors could do. Wounds became infected. Doctors said they performed dozens of amputations on infected limbs. Medics estimated a fifth of incoming patients died. At least 60 corpses lay in the courtyard. Others were buried beneath a nearby playground. 'To see patients dying before your eyes because you don’t have the ability to help them, you have to ask yourself: ‘Where is humanity?’' asked Dergham Abu Ibrahim, a volunteer. Kamal Adwan: ‘This makes no sense’ Kamal Adwan Hospital, once a linchpin of northern Gaza’s health system, was burning on Thursday of last week. Israeli shells crashed into the third floor, igniting a fire that destroyed medical supplies, according to the World Health Organization, which had delivered the equipment just days before. The artillery hit water tanks and damaged the dialysis unit, badly burning four medics who tried to extinguish the blaze, said the hospital’s director, Hossam Abu Safiya. In videos pleading for help over the past weeks, Abu Safiya had fought to maintain his composure as Israeli forces surrounded the hospital. But last weekend, there were tears in his eyes. 'Everything we have built, they have burned,' he said, his voice cracking. 'They burned our hearts. They killed my son.' On Oct. 25, Israeli troops stormed the hospital after what an Israeli military official described as an intense fight with militants nearby. During the battle, Israeli fire targeted the hospital’s oxygen tanks because they 'can be booby traps,' the official said. Israeli forces withdrew after three days, during which Palestinian health officials said nearly all of Kamal Adwan's medical workers were detained, an Israeli drone killed at least one doctor and two children in intensive care died when generators stopped working. Days later, a drone struck Abu Safiya’s son in nearby Jabalia. The 21-year-old had been wounded by Israeli snipers during the first military raid on Kamal Adwan last December. Now he is buried in the yard of the hospital, where just Abu Safiya and one other doctor remain to treat the dozens of wounded pouring in each day from new strikes in Jabalia. The Israeli military said troops detained 100 people, some who were 'posing as medical staff.' Soldiers stripped the men to check for weapons, the military said, before those deemed militants were sent to detention camps. The military claimed that the hospital was 'fully operational, with all departments continuing to treat patients.' It released footage of several guns and an RPG launcher with several rounds it said it found inside the hospital. Kamal Adwan staff say more than 30 medical personnel remain detained, including the head of nursing, who is employed by MedGlobal, an American organization that sends medical teams to disaster regions, and Dr. Mohammed Obeid, the surgeon employed by Doctors without Borders who previously worked at al-Awda Hospital and had moved to Kamal Adwan. The turmoil echoed Israel’s nine-day siege of Kamal Adwan last December. On Dec. 12, soldiers entered and allowed police dogs to attack staff, patients and others, multiple witnesses said. Ahmed Atbail, a 36-year-old who had sought refuge at the hospital, said he saw a dog bite off one man’s finger. Witnesses said the troops ordered boys and men, ranging from their mid-teens to 60, to line up outside crouched in the cold, blindfolded and nearly naked for hours of interrogation. 'Every time someone lifted their heads, they were beaten,' said Mohammed al-Masri, a lawyer who was detained. The military later published footage of men exiting the hospital. Al-Masri identified himself in the footage. He said soldiers staged the images, ordering men to lay down rifles belonging to the hospital guards as if they were militants surrendering. Israel said all photos released are authentic and that it apprehended dozens of suspected militants. As they released some of the men after interrogation, soldiers fired on them as they tried to reenter the hospital, wounding five, three detainees said. Ahmed Abu Hajjaj recalled hearing bursts of gunfire as he made his way back in the dark. 'I thought, this makes no sense — who would they be shooting at?' Witnesses also said a bulldozer lumbered into the hospital compound, plowing into buildings. Abu Safiya, Abu Hajjaj and al-Masri described being held by soldiers inside the hospital as they heard people screaming outside. After the soldiers withdrew, the men saw the bulldozer had crushed tents that previously sheltered some 2,500 people. Most of the displaced had evacuated, but Abu Safiya said he found bodies of four people crushed, with splints from recent treatment in the hospital still on their limbs. Asked about the incident, the Israeli military spokesman’s office said: 'Lies were spread on social media' about troops’ activities at the hospital. It said bodies were discovered that had been buried previously, unrelated to the military’s activities. Later, the military said Hamas used the hospital as a command center but produced no evidence. It said soldiers uncovered weapons, but it showed footage only of a single pistol. The hospital’s director, Dr. Ahmed al-Kahlout, remains in Israeli custody. The military released footage of him under interrogation saying he was a Hamas agent and that militants were based in the hospital. His colleagues said he spoke under duress. The fallout Hagari, the military spokesperson, said hospitals 'provide a life of their own ... to the (Hamas) war system.' He said hospitals were linked to tunnels allowing fighters movement. 'And when you take it, they have no way to move. Not from the south to the north.' Despite often suggesting hospitals are linked to Hamas' underground networks, the military has shown only one tunnel shaft from all the hospitals it raided — one leading to Shifa's grounds. In a report last month, a U.N. investigation commission determined that 'Israel has implemented a concerted policy to destroy the health-care system of Gaza.' It described Israeli actions at hospitals as 'collective punishment against the Palestinians in Gaza.' Some patients now fear hospitals, refusing to go to them or leaving before treatment is complete. 'They are places of death,' Ahmed al-Qamar, a 35-year-old economist in Jabalia refugee camp, said of his fear of taking his children to the hospital. 'You can feel it.' Zaher Sahloul, the president of MedGlobal who has also worked in Gaza during the war, said the sense of safety that should surround hospitals has been destroyed. 'This war has become a scar in the minds of every doctor and nurse.'	https://apnews.com/article/gaza-hospitals-israel-civilians-7f3d7db74304cbe1b12d2b2e950dec82	2024-11-02T20:21:55-07:00	
Japan has grounded its V-22 Osprey fleet again after flight incident	WASHINGTON (AP) — Japan has grounded its fleet of V-22 Osprey aircraft again after an incident last Sunday where one of the hybrid helicopter-aircraft tilted unexpectedly and hit the ground while trying to take off. The V-22 was taking part in the joint U.S. military exercise Keen Sword and carrying 16 passengers, including three U.S. service members. During takeoff it 'became unstable as it swayed from side to side, and the left wing, the lower part of the aircraft came into contact with the ground and part of the aircraft was damaged, so the flight was aborted,' Japan's Ground Self Defense Forces said in a statement. It was the first major incident for Japan's V-22 fleet since an Osprey crash last November killed eight Air Force Special Operations Command service members and led to a months long grounding of the entire fleet in both Japan and the U.S. The aircraft resumed flight operations earlier this year, but the Osprey’s use remains controversial particularly in Okinawa, where residents have questioned its safety record. The Osprey in last Sunday's incident was able to land and no one was injured, however Japan will keep its fleet of more than a dozen V-22s grounded while it investigates the incident, Defense Minister Gen Nakatani told reporters last week. 'We believe there is no safety problem with Ospreys, although ensuring flight safety is a prerequisite for aircraft operations,' Nakatani said. The Pentagon's V-22 joint program office is supporting Japan's investigation into the incident, spokesman Neil Lobeda said Saturday. The V-22 was operating on the Japanese island of Yonaguni during the joint exercise Keen Sword. Yonaguni is only 100 kilometers (62 miles) east of Taiwan. ___ Yamaguchi reported from Tokyo	https://apnews.com/article/pentagon-osprey-crash-5a86751c8dcb33cef91cab1edc34e7ef	2024-11-02T18:45:37-07:00

Nearly 200 families separated by US-Mexico border reunite briefly in annual event	CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico (AP) — Nearly 200 families gathered Saturday along a stretch of the U.S.-Mexico border for heartfelt but brief reunions with loved ones they had not seen for years because they live in opposite countries. Tears flowed and people embraced as Mexican families were allowed to reunite for a few minutes at the border with relatives who migrated to the U.S. Adults and children passed over the Rio Grande to meet with their loved ones. This year, the annual event organized by an immigrant rights advocacy group happened three days before the U.S. presidential election, whose monthslong campaigns have focused heavily on immigration and border security. It also took place under increased security, according to the Network in Defense of the Rights of Migrants. 'We did not have barbed wire, we did not have so many soldiers deployed in our community,' said Fernando García, the organization’s director, highlighting the border security changes that the border has seen since the reunions began last decade. 'The barbed wire had to be opened so that the families could have this event.' García said he expects migration into the U.S. to continue regardless of who wins Tuesday’s election. Family reunions, he said, will continue, too. 'Deportation policy, border policy, immigration policy, is separating families in an extraordinary way and is deeply impacting these families,' he told reporters ahead of the event.	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-us-border-family-reunion-immigration-33c6141bee2d0455d433eea785490110	2024-11-02T15:27:43-07:00

Osasuna dedicates soccer win to its coach and to victims of deadly floods in Valencia region	MADRID (AP) — After scoring Osasuna's winning goal, Ante Budimir showed fans a jersey with the words 'Be strong Valencia.' He and his teammates dedicated Osasuna's 1-0 win over Valladolid in the Spanish league on Saturday to the victims of the deadly floods that hit the Valencia region this week, and especially to Osasuna coach Vicente Moreno, who is from the area and a day earlier gave an emotional interview during his news conference. Moreno is from Massanassa, one of the cities affected the most by the floods that killed more than 200 people in southern Spain. He cried while talking about this week's tragedy and those affected by it. The coach was not on the bench during Saturday's match because of a suspension. 'We dedicate the victory to Vicente because he is suffering a lot,' Osasuna assistant coach Daniel Pendín said. 'He deserves it and we dedicate the victory to him.' Two first-division games were postponed on Saturday because of the floods — Real Madrid at Valencia and Villarreal against Rayo Vallecano. Three second-division games scheduled to be played in the region this weekend also had to be moved to a new date. Budimir scored the winner by converting a 19th-minute penalty kick, helping Osasuna move into fourth place with 21 points from 12 matches. Valladolid, which has lost five of its last six league games, stayed second-to-last with eight points. Also Saturday, Girona ended a two-game losing streak in the league with a 4-3 win over Leganes. Miguel Gutiérrez, who scored Girona's first goal, also marked the occasion by displaying a 'Be Strong Valencia' shirt. On Sunday, leader Barcelona hosts Espanyol in the city derby. Fifth-place Atletico Madrid hosts 18th-place Las Palmas and is looking to get back into the top three with a victory. Diego Simeone's team is coming off three straight losses across all competitions. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer	https://apnews.com/article/osasuna-floods-moreno-girona-spanish-league-42f0b65f8e4a48dbca248cbb26dd1411	2024-11-02T13:31:36-07:00	
Bolivia's government accuses supporters of ex-President Evo Morales of taking 200 soldiers hostage	LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) — Supporters of former President Evo Morales in Bolivia have taken more than 200 soldiers hostage, the country’s government reported Saturday, as unrest prompted by an abuse investigation of the ex-leader continued for a third week. Bolivia's Foreign Ministry in a statement identified those involved in the hostage taking as members of 'irregular groups' and accused them of also stealing weapons and ammunition. It did not identify the groups, nor did it explain how the soldiers were taken hostage. But a day earlier, President Luis Arce said those protesting and attacking military units were supporters of Morales. Arce characterized the seizing of three military barracks in a coca-growing area in central Bolivia as 'an absolutely reprehensible criminal act that is far from any legitimate social claim of the Indigenous peasant movement.' The conflict broke out three weeks ago when Bolivian prosecutors launched an investigation into accusations that Morales fathered a child with a 15-year-old girl in 2016, classifying their relationship as statutory rape. Morales has refused to testify in court. Morales has been holed up in the rural area of Chapare, in central Bolivia, since reports of a possible warrant for his arrest emerged. Loyalist coca growers have kept watch to prevent his arrest, and supporters have threatened to take over police and military barracks, demanding the closure of the judicial cases against the former president. The Foreign Ministry in its statement Saturday said it is open to dialogue with 'all social sectors of the country' but warned that the process 'cannot be established while the Bolivian people continue to be victims of abuse by these groups who are not interested in the national and popular economy, and who only seek to materialize the personal and electoral interests of a former president.' Last week, 30 police officers were injured and more than 50 protesters were arrested after a standoff between security forces and supporters of Morales. Arce and Morales are in a fierce battle for control of the ruling party, which remains divided between their supporters ahead of the 2025 elections.	https://apnews.com/article/bolivia-protests-evo-morales-luis-arce-investigation-2087c408a202b591f5e0f806cf57c18f	2024-11-02T13:11:26-07:00	
A leader of Mexican folk saint cult 'La Santa Muerte' is killed at an altar to the skeletal figure	MEXICO CITY (AP) — A local leader of the Mexican folk saint cult 'La Santa Muerte' was gunned down at an altar to the skeletal figure late Friday, authorities said. Two other people were killed and eight injured in the attack in the city of Leon, in Guanajuato state, the authorities added. The saint — whose name means roughly 'Holy Death' — is often worshipped by convicts, drug addicts and criminals, along with other people who feel excluded or are experiencing difficulties in life. The saint, who is not recognized by the Roman Catholic church, is usually depicted as a female skeleton, and is supposed to protect her followers from death. But that didn’t work for 'La Madrina Chayo,' a woman considered a leader of the cult in the north-central state of Guanajuato. Prosecutors did not give her real name, in keeping with Mexican law, but the nickname 'La Madrina Chayo' was used by a faith healer also known as 'Chayito.' She, another woman and a boy were shot dead Friday as they prepared the annual Santa Muerte celebration. There was no immediate information on the condition of the eight people, including two children wounded in the shooting attack on the street corner altar. Like Mexico's Day of the Dead holiday, the Santa Muerte is honored on Nov. 1 and 2. Roman Catholic leaders in Mexico have condemned the deity’s connection to violence and the illicit drug trade. Clad in a black nun’s robe and holding a scythe in one hand, Santa Muerte appeals to people seeking all manner of otherworldly help: from fending off wrongdoing and carrying out vengeance to stopping lovers from cheating and landing better jobs. Others seek her protection for their drug shipments and to ward off law enforcement. While the cult may sound ominous, the annual celebrations honoring the Santa Muerte are friendly affairs, with people warmly greeting fellow worshippers and offering them small gifts. For years, Guanajuato has had the highest number of homicides of any state in Mexico because of ongoing turf battles between rival drug cartels.	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-cult-santa-muerte-leader-killed-criminals-violence-64cf13cfba32c7321ebe7303413011a3	2024-11-02T11:41:05-07:00	
With Ohtani and Yamamoto playing, the World Series averaged a record 12.9 million viewers in Japan	LOS ANGELES (AP) — With Shohei Ohtani and Yoshinobu Yamamoto making their first appearance, the World Series averaged 12.9 million viewers in Japan, making it the most-watched Fall Classic in the nation's history. Along with the United States ratings, the five-game series between the Los Angeles Dodgers and New York Yankees had a combined 28.7 million average in the two countries. The Dodgers’ 4-2 victory in Game 2 averaged 15.9 million in Japan, making it the most-watched postseason game in the nation’s history, according to Major League Baseball. Yamamoto was the Dodgers' starting pitcher and allowed only one run and one hit in 6 1/3 innings. Tokyo is 19 hours ahead of New York and 16 hours ahead of Los Angeles, meaning the games started around 9 a.m. on Saturday and Sunday morning in Japan. The games were carried through Fuji TV, NHK BS and J Sports. The Series also delivered record viewership in Canada, Mexico, the Dominican Republic and Taiwan, according to MLB. The World Series averaged 15.8 million viewers in the U.S. on Fox, Fox Deportes and streaming, its best performance since 2017. That is a 67% increase over last year, when the Texas Rangers' victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks in five games averaged only 9.11 million, which was the lowest-recorded Series average. Los Angeles was the top market with a 18.9 rating and 53 share while New York was third with a 12.4 rating and 41 share. San Diego was second at 12.4 and 41. The rating is the percentage of television households tuned in. The share refers to a percentage of the audience viewing it at the time. Fox and FS1 averaged 7.49 million for the postseason, a 42% jump over last year, and its best average in seven years. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb	https://apnews.com/article/world-series-dodgers-yankees-japan-fox-c8051f1171dbcf29be7d4bc8e3aabc18	2024-11-02T08:27:11-07:00	
TGI Fridays files for bankruptcy protection as sit-down restaurant struggles continue	Restaurant chain TGI Fridays filed for bankruptcy protection Saturday, saying it is looking for ways to 'ensure the long-term viability' of the casual dining brand after closing many of its branches this year. The Dallas-based company's Chapter 11 filing in a Texas federal court accelerates a gradual decline for an iconic chain that was once near the center of American pop culture but has seen its customer base dwindle as tastes changed. The company has boasted that its bartenders trained Tom Cruise for his role in the 1988 film 'Cocktail.' Its serving staff's button-filled uniforms, meant to evoke a fun atmosphere, were later parodied in the 1999 satire 'Office Space,' starring Jennifer Aniston. Rohit Manocha, executive chairman of TGI Fridays, said in a statement that the 'primary driver of our financial challenges resulted from COVID-19 and our capital structure.' Sit-down chain restaurants more broadly have faced challenges in recent years as diners choose to get food delivered or visit upscale fast-food chains like Chipotle and Shake Shack. In September a U.S. bankruptcy judge approved a reorganization plan for the seafood chain Red Lobster after years of mounting losses and dwindling customers. Founded in 1965 as a bar on Manhattan's Upper East Side, TGI Fridays expanded over the following decades to become a ubiquitous suburban gathering spot known for its ribs, potato skins topped with cheese and bacon, and a decor bedecked with red stripes and Tiffany-style lamps. Its empire peaked in 2008 with 601 restaurants in the U.S. and a $2 billion business, according to Kevin Schimpf, director of industry research at Technomic. Its sales in the U.S. were $728 million in 2023, down 15% from the prior year, according to Technomic. It now counts 163 restaurants in the U.S., down from 269 last year. It closed 36 in January and dozens more in the past week. TGI Fridays Inc. said it only owns and operates 39 restaurants in the U.S., which is just a small fraction of the 461 TGI Fridays-branded restaurants around the world. A separate entity, TGI Fridays Franchisor, owns the intellectual property and has franchised the brand to 56 independent owners in 41 countries. Those remain open. During the pandemic TGI Fridays made an effort to expand into the delivery market by making itself a hub for so-called ghost kitchens, which have no storefront and only prepare food for delivery. Among the major creditors owed money by TGI Fridays is the delivery service DoorDash, according to Saturday's bankruptcy court filings.	https://apnews.com/article/tgi-fridays-bankruptcy-5979e002f72f5595a80d12beee5eeef1	2024-11-02T08:11:32-07:00	
Nvidia replaces Intel on the Dow index in AI-driven shift for semiconductor industry	NEW YORK (AP) — Nvidia is replacing Intel on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, ending a 25-year-run for a pioneering semiconductor company that has fallen behind as Nvidia cornered the market for chips that run artificial intelligence systems. Paint-maker Sherwin-Williams will also replace chemical company Dow Inc. among the companies that make up the 30-stock average. S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices said Friday that the changes that take effect Nov. 7 'were initiated to ensure a more representative exposure to the semiconductors industry and the materials sector respectively.' It added that because the Dow is price-weighted, 'persistently lower priced stocks have a minimal impact.' Dow Inc., a major producer of chemicals and plastics and unrelated to the similarly named company behind the index, has also been the smallest company on the Dow in terms of market capitalization. In another index, the Dow Jones Utility Average, Texas-based energy company Vistra will replace Virginia-based AES Corp.	https://apnews.com/article/dow-intel-nvidia-sherwinwilliams-dji-edc5430cad4696c650b5cb2e4fd2d0bf	2024-11-02T06:21:53-07:00	
Who is Kemi Badenoch, the first Black woman to lead Britain's Conservative Party?	LONDON (AP) — The first Black woman to lead a major U.K. political party, Kemi Badenoch is an upbeat and outspoken libertarian who thinks the British state is broken — and that she's the one to fix it with smaller government and radical new ideas. The new leader of Britain’s right-of-center Conservative Party was born Olukemi Adegoke in London in 1980 to well-off Nigerian parents — a doctor and an academic — and spent much of her childhood in the West African country. She has said that the experience of Nigeria’s economic and social upheavals shaped her political outlook. 'I grew up somewhere where the lights didn’t come on, where we ran out of fuel frequently despite being an oil-producing country,' Badenoch told the BBC last week. 'I don’t take what we have in this country for granted,' she said. 'I meet a lot of people who assume that things are good here because things are good here and they always will be. They don’t realize just how much work and sacrifice was required in order to get that.' Returning to the U.K. aged 16 during a period of turmoil in Nigeria, she worked part-time at McDonalds while completing school, then studied computer systems engineering at the University of Sussex. She later got a law degree and worked in financial services. In 2012, she married banker Hamish Badenoch, with whom she has three children. She was elected to the London Assembly in 2015 and to Parliament in 2017. She held a series of government posts in the 2019-22 government of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, before becoming part of a mass ministerial exodus in July 2022 over a series of ethics scandals that triggered Johnson’s downfall. Badenoch ran unsuccessfully to succeed Johnson, boosting her profile in the process. She was appointed trade secretary in the 49-day government of Prime Minister Liz Truss, and business secretary under Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. She held onto her seat in Parliament in July's national election, which saw the Labour Party win a huge majority and the Conservatives reduced to 121 lawmakers in the 650-seat House of Commons. Like many Conservatives, Badenoch idolizes Margaret Thatcher, the party’s first female leader, who transformed Britain with her free-market policies in the 1980s. Citing her engineering background as evidence she’s a problem-solver, she depicts herself as a disruptor, arguing for a low-tax, free-market economy and pledging to 'rewire, reboot and reprogram' the British state. A critic of multiculturalism and self-proclaimed enemy of wokeness, Badenoch is an opponent of 'identity politics,' gender-neutral bathrooms and government plans to reduce U.K. carbon emissions. Supporters think her charismatic, outspoken style is just what the Conservative Party needs to come back from its worst-ever election defeat. During her leadership campaign, her backers wore T-shirts urging: 'Be more Kemi.' Critics say Badenoch has clashed with colleagues and civil servants and has a tendency to make rash statements and provoke unnecessary fights. During the leadership campaign she drew criticism for saying that 'not all cultures are equally valid,' and for suggesting that maternity pay was excessive — though she later backtracked on that claim. 'I do speak my mind,' she told the BBC. 'And I tell the truth.'	https://apnews.com/article/uk-conservative-leader-kemi-badenoch-profile-bd73343d5508fc7aa936471629f5730b	2024-11-02T06:07:06-07:00	
Patty to bring heavy rain to the Azores; Tropical Storm Lane to dissipate without threatening land	MIAMI (AP) — A storm system will likely bring heavy rain to the Azores islands over the weekend, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said Saturday. Subtropical Storm Patty is expected to produce rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches (about 2.5 to 5 centimeters) across the archipelago through Sunday. The Hurricane Center says swells generated by Patty are likely to cause dangerous surf and rip current conditions. Patty is clocking maximum sustained winds of nearly 50 mph (about 80 kph) with higher gusts. The Azores are an island chain are located about 800 miles (about 1,287 kilometers) off Portugal. Separately, a tropical storm formed over the Pacific Ocean early Saturday but remained far off the coast of Mexico. Tropical Storm Lane was located about 1,525 miles (2,455 kilometers) west-southwest off the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula, the National Hurricane Center in Miami reported in an advisory early Saturday. There were no immediate coastal watches or warnings in effect. The storm is expected to begin weakening on Sunday.	https://apnews.com/article/tropical-storm-lane-pacific-834013c82700494c9414138b160f56ea	2024-11-02T03:46:00-07:00	
Ukraine's Zelenskyy urges allies to act before North Korean troops reach the front	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged its allies to stop 'watching' and take steps before North Koreans troops deployed in Russia reach the battlefield. Zelenskyy raised the prospect of a preemptive Ukrainian strike on camps where the North Korean troops are being trained, and said Kyiv knows their location. But he said Ukraine can’t do it without permission from allies to use Western-made long-range weapons to hit targets deep inside Russia. 'But instead … America is watching, Britain is watching, Germany is watching. Everyone is just waiting for the North Korean military to start attacking Ukrainians as well,' Zelenskyy said in a post late Friday on the Telegram messaging app. The Biden administration said Thursday that some 8,000 North Korean soldiers are now in Russia’s Kursk region near Ukraine’s border and are preparing to help the Kremlin fight against Ukrainian troops in the coming days. On Saturday, Ukraine's military intelligence said that more than 7,000 North Koreans equipped with Russian gear and weapons had been transported to areas near Ukraine. The agency, known by its acronym GUR, said that North Korean troops were being trained at five locations in Russia's Far East. It did not specify its source of information. Western leaders have described the North Korean troop deployment as a significant escalation that could also jolt relations in the Indo-Pacific region, and open the door to technology transfers from Moscow to Pyongyang that could advance the threat posed by North Korea’s nuclear weapons and missile program. North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui met with her Russian counterpart in Moscow in Friday. Ukrainian leaders have repeatedly said they need permission to use Western weapons to strike arms depots, airfields and military bases far from the border to motivate Russia to seek peace. In response, U.S. defense officials have argued that the missiles are limited in number, and that Ukraine is already using its own long-range drones to hit targets farther into Russia. Moscow has also consistently signaled that it would view any such strikes as a major escalation. President Vladimir Putin warned on Sept. 12 that Russia would be 'at war' with the U.S. and NATO states if they approve them. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-north-korea-troops-912e5e54ad3170bd77580405c6f97018	2024-11-02T03:40:44-07:00	
UK Conservatives pick Kemi Badenoch as new leader, first Black woman to head a big British party	LONDON (AP) — Britain’s Conservative Party on Saturday elected outspoken lawmaker Kemi Badenoch as its new leader as it tries to rebound from a crushing election defeat that ended 14 years in power. The first Black woman to lead a major British political party, Badenoch (pronounced BADE-enock) defeated rival candidate Robert Jenrick in a vote of almost 100,000 members of the right-of-center Conservatives. She got 53,806 votes in the online and postal ballot of party members, to Jenrick's 41,388. Badenoch replaces former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who in July led the Conservatives to their worst election result since 1832. The new leader’s daunting task is to try to restore the party’s reputation after years of division, scandal and economic tumult, hammer Labour Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s policies on key issues including the economy and immigration, and return the Conservatives to power at the next election, due by 2029. 'The task that stands before us is tough but simple,' Badenoch said in a victory speech to a roomful of Conservative lawmakers, staff and journalists in London. She said the party's job was to hold the Labour government to account, and to craft pledges and a plan for government. Addressing the party's election drubbing, she said 'we have to be honest — honest about the fact that we made mistakes, honest about the fact that we let standards slip.' 'The time has come to tell the truth, to stand up for our principles, to plan for our future, to reset our politics and our thinking, and to give our party, and our country, the new start that they deserve,' Badenoch said. A business secretary in Sunak's government, Badenoch was born in London to Nigerian parents and spent much of her childhood in the West African country. The 44-year-old former software engineer depicts herself as a disruptor, arguing for a low-tax, free-market economy and pledging to 'rewire, reboot and reprogram' the British state. Like her rival Jenrick, she has criticized multiculturalism and called for lower immigration, though unlike him she has not demanded that Britain leave the European Convention on Human Rights. A self-proclaimed enemy of wokeness Badenoch opposes identity politics, gender-neutral bathrooms and government plans to reduce U.K. carbon emissions. During the leadership campaign she drew criticism for saying that 'not all cultures are equally valid,' and for suggesting that maternity pay was excessive. Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London, said the Conservative Party was likely to 'swing towards the right both in terms of its economic policies and its social policies' under Badenoch. He predicted Badenoch would pursue 'what you might call the boats, boilers and bathrooms strategy .... focusing very much on the trans issue, the immigration issue and skepticism about progress towards net zero.' While the Conservative Party is unrepresentative of the country as a whole — its 132,000 members are largely affluent, older white men – its upper echelons have become markedly more diverse. Badenoch is the Tories’ fourth female leader, after Margaret Thatcher, Theresa May and Liz Truss, all of whom became prime minister. She’s the second Conservative leader of color, after Sunak, and the first with African roots. The center-left Labour Party, in contrast, has only ever been led by white men. In a leadership contest that lasted more than three months, Conservative lawmakers reduced the field from six candidates in a series of votes before putting the final two to the wider party membership. Both finalists came from the right of the party, and argued they could win voters back from Reform U.K., the hard-right, anti-immigrant party led by populist politician Nigel Farage that has eaten away at Conservative support. But the party also lost many voters to the winning party, Labour, and to the centrist Liberal Democrats, and some Conservatives worry that tacking right will lead the party away from public opinion. Starmer's government has had a rocky first few months in office, beset by negative headlines, fiscal gloom and a plummeting approval rating. But Bale said that the historical record suggests the odds are against Badenoch leading the Conservatives back to power in 2029. 'It’s quite unusual for someone to take over when a party gets very badly beaten and manage to lead it to election victory,' he said. 'However, Keir Starmer did exactly that after 2019. So records are there to be broken.' ___ This story has been corrected to say Badenoch is the fourth female Conservative leader, not the third.	https://apnews.com/article/uk-conservative-party-new-leader-elected-b2300368b66deb930dce1d9068ba0770	2024-11-02T03:14:35-07:00	
Attack on central Israel injures 11 as Iran's leader promises a punishing response	JERUSALEM (AP) — An attack on a central Israeli town early Saturday injured 11 people as Iran's supreme leader vowed a punishing response to Israel's attack last week. The predawn strike on Tira, which followed air raid sirens across central Israel, was one of several barrages fired from Lebanon early in the day. Many of the projectiles were intercepted by Israeli air defenses, while others landed in unpopulated areas. The Magen David Adom emergency service said 11 people were hurt by shrapnel and glass shards in a direct strike on a building in Tira, a predominantly Israeli Arab town. Three were in moderate condition, while the others suffered milder injuries. Footage showed significant damage to the roof and top floor of the three-story building and cars below. Lebanon’s Iran-backed Hezbollah group said on Saturday that it had used missiles and explosive drones to target military and intelligence facilities in northern and central Israel. It claimed responsibility for firing missiles toward the Israeli military’s Unit 8200 base in Glilot, on the edge of Tel Aviv, and for firing rockets toward military facilities in Zvulun. Hezbollah also said it had targeted central Israel's Palmachim Air Base with explosive drones, saying they 'scored precise hits on targets.' Israel's military did not confirm whether any of the three Hezbollah targets had been hit and said it had no comment on the group's claims. Hezbollah said the Saturday dawn missile attack directed at Glilot was in retaliation for the 'massacres' that are being committed by Israel. Tira, is about 20 kilometers (12.5 miles) from Glilot. Tamar Abdel Hai, a resident of Tira, said that the attack was frightening. 'I call upon all the leaders in the Arab world and the leaders in Israel and to everyone who can help to end this war. It’s enough,' he said. Hezbollah also said that its fighters fired salvos of rockets into northern Israeli towns including Dalton, Yesud HaMa’ala and Bar Yohai. Israeli media showed images of damage reportedly caused by a drone that hit a factory north of Nahariya. The army said several drones crossed from Lebanon into Israel, one was intercepted but 'fallen targets were identified in the area.' Meanwhile, an Israeli airstrike on a southern suburb of Beirut on Saturday afternoon wounded 11 people, the Lebanese Health Ministry said. Israeli planes resumed strikes on on the southern suburb of Dahiyeh overnight Friday, following four day lull in the capital. In a separate incident, a Lebanese ship captain was taken away by a group of armed men who landed on a coast north of Beirut, Lebanese authorities said Saturday. Officials said the incident occurred Friday at dawn and authorities are investigating whether Israel was involved. There has been no immediate Israeli comment on the matter. In the past, Israel has carried out commando operations deep inside Lebanon to kidnap or kill Hezbollah and Palestinian officials. Iran threatens more attacks The early Saturday attacks may be only a precursor to a more severe strike against Israel. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, on Saturday threatened Israel and the U.S. with a punishing response over attacks on Iran and its allies following Israel's Oct. 26 airstrikes that targeted Iran's military bases and other locations. 'The enemies, whether the Zionist regime or the United States of America, will definitely receive a crushing response to what they are doing to Iran and the Iranian nation and to the resistance front,' Khamenei said in video released by Iranian state media. A further attack by Iran, which has already launched two direct attacks against Israel this year, could push the wider Middle East closer to a broader conflict. Israel is already battling the Iran-backed militant group Hamas in the Gaza Strip and Hezbollah in Lebanon. The fight against Hezbollah has weakened the group but has also taken a heavy toll on southern Lebanon and other parts of the country. On Friday, Israel launched dozens of intense airstrikes across Lebanon’s northeastern farming villages, killing at least 52 people and wounding scores more, the Lebanese Health Ministry reported. Since the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah erupted in 2023, more than 2,897 people have been killed and 13,150 wounded in Lebanon, according to a Health Ministry update early Friday. United Nations agencies estimate that Israel’s ground invasion and bombardment of Lebanon has displaced 1.4 million people. Residents of Israel’s northern communities near Lebanon, roughly 60,000 people, have also been displaced for more than a year. Israeli strikes in Gaza kill at least 42 people in 24 hours Israel has also stepped up its offensive against Hamas’ remaining fighters in Gaza, raising concerns about humanitarian conditions for civilians still there. A series of Israeli strikes on Nuseirat, a refugee camp in central Gaza, killed at least 42 people, more than a half of them women and children, in 24 hours, Dr. Marwan Abu Naser, director of Al-Awda Hospital that received the casualties, told The Associated Press. A further 150 were wounded, he said. The World Health Organization began a scaled-down polio vaccination campaign on Saturday, giving second doses to at-risk children only in Gaza City after providing first doses in multiple parts of northern Gaza, which has seen intense Israeli bombardment. The second round was initially set to start Oct. 23 but was postponed due to lack of access amid intense Israeli bombing, mass evacuation orders and a lack of assurance about humanitarian pauses. Israel’s war in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 Palestinians since Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas militants killed roughly 1,200 people in Israel and took some 250 hostages back to Gaza. Health officials inside Hamas-run Gaza do not distinguish between civilians and combatants, but say more than half of the dead in the enclave are women and children. ___ Associated Press journalists Bassem Mroue in Beirut, Natalie Melzer in Tel Aviv, Israel, and Shlomo Mor in Tira, Israel, contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-lebanon-iran-news-11-02-2024-f7a3c3f1d6b6ea2c54615a367ffb6ac1	2024-11-02T02:55:38-07:00	
Spain's government to send 10,000 soldiers and police to Valencia after deadly floods	MADRID (AP) — Spain is sending 5,000 more soldiers and 5,000 more police to the eastern region of Valencia after deadly floods this week that killed at least 211 people, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez announced Saturday. Most of the victims of Spain’s deadliest natural disaster in living memory are in Valencia, in the east of the country. Rescuers were still searching for bodies in stranded cars and sodden buildings on Saturday, four days after the monstrous flash floods that swept away everything in their path in the east of Spain. An unknown number of people remain missing. Thousands of volunteers are helping to clean up the thick mud that is covering everything in streets, houses and businesses in the hardest-hit towns. At present there are some 2,000 soldiers involved in the emergency work, as well as almost 2,500 Civil Guard gendarmes — who have carried out 4,500 rescues during the floods — and 1,800 national police officers.	https://apnews.com/article/flash-floods-spain-valencia-f52e40c9fdf2af44814617948afdb920	2024-11-02T02:50:37-07:00	
Rescuers end search for survivors after 14 die in canopy collapse in northern Serbia	NOVI SAD, Serbia (AP) — Serbian rescuers stopped searching for survivors on Saturday after pulling out 14 bodies from underneath tons of concrete from a fallen canopy at the entrance of a railway station in the northern city of Novi Sad. Serbia’s government declared Saturday a day of mourning as officials promised a thorough investigation into Friday's collapse of the roof that fell on people sitting below it. The dead included a 6-year-old girl and a citizen of North Macedonia while three people were seriously injured, Interior Minister Ivica Dacic said. Doctors said the injured ranged from 18 to 24 years old and remained in life-threatening condition on Saturday. The train station has been renovated twice in recent years, and critics of Serbia’s populist government attributed the disaster to corruption and sloppy renovations. Members of the opposition planned to protest in front of the station later on Saturday. Officials have insisted that the canopy had not been part of the renovation work. Goran Vesic, the government minister for construction and infrastructure, told the state RTS television the tragedy would not have happened had the canopy been renovated as well. Dacic said some 20 people will be questioned on Saturday as part of the investigation, including Vesic. Authorities deployed heavy machinery and some 80 rescuers who struggled for hours to remove large parts of concrete that crashed just before noon Friday. The rescue effort lasted until late Friday evening. Residents of Novi Sad lit candles and held a vigil for the victims at the site. Many responded to a call to donate blood. 'This morning I drank my coffee in tears. It is hard this has happened in our city,' said Dragica Camber, a resident of Novi Sad, Surveillance camera footage on Friday showed people moving in and out of the building and sitting on benches on a bright, sunny day before the concrete canopy suddenly collapsed. Windows shook on nearby buildings. The railway station, including the canopy, was built in 1964. The renovation work was carried out by Chinese companies. The renovated station was inaugurated by President Aleksandar Vucic and his populist ally, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, over two years ago as a major stopover for a planned fast train line between Belgrade and Budapest.	https://apnews.com/article/serbia-roof-collapse-rescue-mourning-66adec34537a93b2c9b73285a0017511	2024-11-02T01:43:31-07:00	
Iran's supreme leader threatens Israel and US with 'a crushing response' over Israeli attack	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran's supreme leader on Saturday threatened Israel and the U.S. with 'a crushing response' over attacks on Iran and its allies. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei spoke as Iranian officials are increasingly threatening to launch yet another strike against Israel after its Oct. 26 attack on the Islamic Republic that targeted military bases and other locations and killed at least five people. Any further attacks from either side could engulf the wider Middle East, already teetering over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip and Israel’s ground invasion of Lebanon, into a wider regional conflict just ahead of the U.S. presidential election this Tuesday. 'The enemies, whether the Zionist regime or the United States of America, will definitely receive a crushing response to what they are doing to Iran and the Iranian nation and to the resistance front,' Khamenei said in video released by Iranian state media. The supreme leader did not elaborate on the timing of the threatened attack, nor the scope. The U.S. military operates on bases throughout the Middle East, with some troops now manning a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, battery in Israel. The USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier likely is in the Arabian Sea, while Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said Friday that more destroyers, fighter squadrons, tankers and B-52 long-range bombers would be coming to the region to deter Iran and its militant allies. The 85-year-old Khamenei had struck a more cautious approach in earlier remarks, saying officials would weigh Iran’s response and that Israel’s attack 'should not be exaggerated nor downplayed.' Iran has launched two major direct attacks on Israel, in April and October. But efforts by Iran to downplay the Israeli attack faltered as satellite photos analyzed by The Associated Press showed damage to military bases near Tehran linked to the country's ballistic missile program, as well as at a Revolutionary Guard base used in satellite launches. Iran's allies, called the 'Axis of Resistance' by Tehran, also have been severely hurt by ongoing Israeli attacks, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Iran long has used those groups as both an asymmetrical way to attack Israel and as a shield against a direct assault. Some analysts believe those groups want Iran to do more to back them militarily. Iran, however, has been dealing with its own problems at home, as its economy struggles under the weight of international sanctions and it has faced years of widespread, multiple protests. After Khamenei's speech, the Iranian rial fell to 691,500 against the dollar, near an all-time low. It had been 32,000 rials to the dollar when Tehran reached its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Gen. Mohammad Ali Naini, a spokesman for Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard which controls the ballistic missiles needed to target Israel, gave an interview published by the semiofficial Fars news agency just before Khamenei's remarks were released. In it, he warned Iran's response 'will be wise, powerful and beyond the enemy’s comprehension.' 'The leaders of the Zionist regime should look out from the windows of their bedrooms and protect their criminal pilots within their small territory,' he warned. Israeli air force pilots appear to have used air-launched ballistic missiles in the Oct. 26 attack. Khamenei on Saturday met with university students to mark Students Day, which commemorates a Nov. 4, 1978, incident in which Iranian soldiers opened fire on students protesting the rule of the shah at Tehran University. The shooting killed and wounded several students and further escalated the tensions consuming Iran at the time that eventually led to the shah fleeing the country and the 1979 Islamic Revolution. The crowd offered a raucous welcome to Khamenei, chanting: 'The blood in our veins is a gift to our leader!' Some also made a hand gesture — similar to a 'timeout' signal — given by the slain Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in 2020 in a speech in which he threatened that American troops who arrived in the Mideast standing up would 'return in coffins' horizontally. Iran will mark the 45th anniversary of the U.S. Embassy hostage crisis this Sunday, following the Persian calendar. The Nov. 4, 1979, storming of the embassy by Islamist students led to the 444-day crisis, which cemented the decades-long enmity between Tehran and Washington that persists today.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-khamenei-israel-hamas-lebanon-war-30385c3a17d1fca9415eb37db86dc9c5	2024-11-02T00:48:28-07:00	
Israel's path of destruction in southern Lebanon raises fears of an attempt to create a buffer zone	BEIRUT (AP) — Perched on a hilltop a short walk from the Israeli border, the tiny southern Lebanese village of Ramyah has almost been wiped off the map. In a neighboring village, satellite photos show a similar scene: a hill once covered with houses, now reduced to a gray smear of rubble. Israeli warplanes and ground forces have blasted a trail of destruction through southern Lebanon the past month. The aim, Israel says, is to debilitate the Hezbollah militant group, push it away from the border and end more than a year of Hezbollah fire into northern Israel. Even United Nations peacekeepers and Lebanese troops in the south have come under fire from Israeli forces, raising questions over whether they can remain in place. More than 1 million people have fled bombardment, emptying much of the south. Some experts say Israel may be aiming to create a depopulated buffer zone, a strategy it has already deployed along its border with Gaza. Some conditions for such a zone appear already in place, according to an Associated Press analysis of satellite imagery and data collected by mapping experts that show the breadth of destruction across 11 villages next to the border. The Israeli military has said the bombardment is necessary to destroy Hezbollah tunnels and other infrastructure it says the group embedded within towns. The blasts have also destroyed homes, neighborhoods and sometimes entire villages, where families have lived for generations. Israel says it aims to push Hezbollah far enough back that its citizens can return safely to homes in the north, but Israeli officials acknowledge they don’t have a concrete plan for ensuring Hezbollah stays away from the border long term. That is a key focus in attempts by the United States to broker a cease-fire. Orna Mizrahi, a senior researcher at Israel’s Institute for National Security Studies, said Israel's immediate aim is not to create a buffer zone — but that might change. 'Maybe we’ll have no other choice than staying there until we have an arrangement that promises us that Hezbollah will not come back to the zone,' she said. A path of destruction Troops pushed into southern Lebanon on Oct. 1, backed by heavy bombardment that has intensified since. Using satellite images provided by Planet Labs PBC, AP identified a line of 11 villages — all within 4 miles (6.5 kilometers) of Lebanon's border with Israel — that have been severely damaged in the past month, either by strikes or detonations of explosives laid by Israeli soldiers. Analysis found the most intense damage in the south came in villages closest to the border, with between 100 and 500 buildings likely destroyed or damaged in each, according to Corey Scher of CUNY Graduate Center and Jamon Van Der Hoek of Oregon State University, experts in damage assessments. In Ramyah, barely a single structure still stands on the village’s central hilltop, after a controlled detonation that Israeli soldiers showed themselves carrying out in videos posted on social media. In the next town over, Aita al-Shaab — a village with strong Hezbollah influence — bombardment turned the hilltop with the highest concentration of buildings into a gray wasteland of rubble. In other villages, the damage is more selective. In some, bombardment tore scars through blocks of houses; in others, certain homes were crushed while their neighbors remained intact. Another controlled detonation leveled much of the village of Odeissah, with an explosion so strong it set off earthquake alerts in Israel. In videos of the blast, Lubnan Baalbaki, conductor of the Lebanese Philharmonic Orchestra, watched in disbelief as his parents’ house — containing the art collection and a library his father had built up for years — was destroyed. 'This house was a project and a dream for both of my parents,' he told the AP. His parents’ graves in the garden are now lost. When asked whether its intention was to create a buffer zone, Israel’s military said it was 'conducting localized, limited, targeted raids based on precise intelligence' against Hezbollah targets. It said Hezbollah had 'deliberately embedded' weapons in homes and villages. Israeli journalist Danny Kushmaro even helped blow up a home that the military said was being used to store Hezbollah ammunition. In a television segment, Kushmaro and soldiers counted down before they pressed a button, setting off a massive explosion. Videos posted online by Israel’s military and individual soldiers show Israeli troops planting flags on Lebanese soil. Still, Israel has not built any bases or managed to hold a permanent presence in southern Lebanon. Troops appear to move back and forth across the border, sometimes under heavy fire from Hezbollah. October has been the deadliest month of 2024 for the Israeli military, with around 60 soldiers killed. Attacks on UN peacekeeping troops and the Lebanese Army The bombardment has been punctuated by Israeli attacks on U.N. troops and the Lebanese Army — forces which, under international law, are supposed to keep the peace in the area. Israel has long complained that their presence has not prevented Hezbollah from building up its infrastructure across the south. Israel denies targeting either force. The Lebanese military has said at least 11 of its soldiers were killed in eight Israeli strikes, either at their positions or while assisting evacuations. The peacekeeping force, known as UNIFIL, said its forces and infrastructure have been harmed at least 30 times since late September, blaming Israeli military fire or actions for about 20 of them, 'with seven being clearly deliberate.' A rocket likely fired by Hezbollah or an allied group hit UNIFIL’s headquarters in Naqoura on Tuesday, causing some minor injuries, said UNIFIL spokesperson Andrea Tenenti. UNIFIL has refused to leave southern Lebanon, despite calls by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for them to go. Experts warn that could change if peacekeepers come under greater fire. 'If you went from the U.N. taking casualties to the U.N. actually taking fatalities,' some nations contributing troops may 'say ‘enough is enough,’ and you might see the mission start to crumble,' said Richard Gowan of the International Crisis Group. The future of the territory is uncertain International cease-fire efforts appear to be centered on implementing U.N. Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war. It specified that Israeli forces would fully withdraw from Lebanon while the Lebanese army and UNIFIL — not Hezbollah — would be the exclusive armed presence in a zone about 25 kilometers (15 miles) from the border. But the resolution was not fully implemented. Hezbollah never left the border zone, and Lebanon accuses Israel of continuing to occupy small areas of its land and carrying out frequent military overflights above its territory. During a recent visit to Beirut, U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein said a new agreement was needed to enforce Resolution 1701. Israel could be trying to pressure an agreement into existence through the destruction wreaked in southern Lebanon. Yossi Yehoshua, military correspondent for the Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth, wrote that the military needs to 'entrench further its operational achievements' to push Hezbollah, the Lebanese government and mediating countries 'to accept an end (of the war) under conditions that are convenient for Israel.' Some Lebanese fear that means an occupation of parts of the south, 25 years after Israel ended its occupation there. Lebanese parliamentarian Mark Daou, a critic of both Hezbollah and of Israel’s military operations in Lebanon, said he believed Israel was trying to degrade Hezbollah’s capabilities and turn the Lebanese public 'against the will to resist Israeli incursions.' Gowan, of the International Crisis Group, said one aim of Resolution 1701 was to give the Lebanese army enough credibility that it, not Hezbollah, would be seen 'as the legitimate defender' in the south. 'That evaporates if they become (Israel’s) gendarmerie of southern Lebanon,' he said. ___ Frankel reported from Jerusalem.

Moldovans are voting in a pivotal presidential runoff. But voter fraud threatens its democracy	CHISINAU, Moldova (AP) — Moldovan historian and politician Octavian Ticu remembers when the Soviet Union collapsed in the early 1990s, a seismic event that enabled him to become one of the first amateur boxers to fight for his country at the pinnacle of his sport: the Olympic Games. 'It was a happy moment for me,' the 52-year-old recalls, as he wraps his fists at a boxing gym in the capital, Chisinau. 'In 1996, I participated in the Olympics in Atlanta. … If I were in the Soviet Union, I would never have accomplished this.' But today, more than three decades after proclaiming independence, Moldova is being targeted by Russia in a hybrid war of propaganda and disinformation that 'wreaks havoc,' Ticu, who competed in the lightweight division, told The Associated Press. Like Ukraine and Georgia, the former Soviet republic aspires to join the European Union but is caught in a constant geopolitical tug between Moscow and the West. 'Russian propaganda is a reality of 30 years of independence,' added Ticu, who has written several books on his country’s history. ____ This story, supported by the Pulitzer Center for Crisis Reporting, is part of an ongoing Associated Press series covering threats to democracy in Europe. ____ In a national referendum on Oct. 20, Moldovans voted by a razor-thin majority of 50.35% in favor of securing a path toward EU membership. But the result was overshadowed by allegations of a Moscow-backed vote-buying scheme. In a presidential election held the same day, incumbent pro-Western President Maia Sandu obtained 42% of the vote, but failed to win an outright majority. On Sunday, she will face Alexandr Stoianoglo, a Russia-friendly former prosecutor general, in a runoff viewed as a choice between geopolitical opposites — again. As in the EU referendum, a poll released this week by research company iData indicates a tight race on Sunday that leans toward a narrow Sandu victory, an outcome that might rely on Moldova's large diaspora. The presidential role carries significant powers in areas such as foreign policy and national security. In the wake of the two October votes, Moldovan law enforcement said that a vote-buying scheme was orchestrated by Ilan Shor, an exiled oligarch who currently lives in Russia and was convicted in absentia in 2023 of fraud and money laundering. Prosecutors say $39 million was paid to more than 130,000 recipients through an internationally sanctioned Russian bank to voters between September and October. Shor denies any wrongdoing. 'These people who go to Moscow, the so-called government-in-exile of Ilan Shor, who come with very large sums of money, are left to roam free,' said Ticu, who ran as a long-shot candidate in the presidential race. It was 'obvious,' Ticu added, that the votes would 'not be fair or democratic.' Of the 11 first-round candidates, he was the only one to endorse Sandu in the runoff. Voters from Moldova’s Kremlin-friendly breakaway region of Transnistria, which declared independence after a short war in the early 1990s, can cast ballots in Moldova proper. Transnistria has been a source of tension during the war in neighboring Ukraine, especially since it is home to a military base with 1,500 Russian troops. Ticu warned that if Russian troops in Ukraine reach the port city of Odesa, they could 'join the Transnistrian region, and then the Republic of Moldova will be occupied.' In Gagauzia, an autonomous part of Moldova where only 5% voted in favor of the EU, a doctor was detained after allegedly coercing 25 residents of a home for older adults to vote for a candidate they did not choose. Police said they obtained 'conclusive evidence,' including financial transfers from the same sanctioned Russian bank. Anticorruption authorities have conducted hundreds of searches and seized over $2.7 million (2.5 million euros) in cash as they attempt to crack down. On Thursday, prosecutors raided a political party headquarters and said 12 people were suspected of paying voters to select a candidate in the presidential race. A criminal case was also opened in which 40 state agency employees were suspected of taking electoral bribes. Instead of winning the overwhelming support that Sandu had hoped, the results in both races exposed Moldova’s judiciary as unable to adequately protect the democratic process. It also allowed some pro-Moscow opposition to question the validity of the votes. Igor Dodon, the Party of Socialists leader and former president who has close ties to Russia, stated this week that 'we don’t recognize' the referendum result, and labeled Sandu 'a dictator in a skirt' who will 'do whatever it takes to stay in power.' Sandu admitted the ballots suffered from unprecedented fraud and foreign meddling, which undermined the results, calling the interference a 'vile attack' on Moldova’s sovereignty. 'If the judiciary does not wake up … if it closes its eyes to selling the country, the future of Moldova will be in danger for decades,' she warned. Moldova is one of Europe’s poorest countries and has been hit hard by inflation since the war started. Tatiana Cojocari, a Russia foreign policy expert at Chisinau-based think-tank WatchDog, says this means many citizens could 'fall prey to electoral corruption' for relatively small amounts of money. 'For Russia, it’s very important to have as many resources as possible to work with. It creates chaos, both informationally and politically,' Cojocari said, adding that Russia 'has turned a bit to the tactics of the Cold War and uses them skillfully, only now adapted to social media.' In the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Moldova applied to join the EU. It was granted candidate status in June of that year, and in summer 2024, Brussels agreed to start membership negotiations. The sharp Westward shift irked Moscow and significantly soured relations with Chisinau. Since then, Moldovan authorities have repeatedly accused Russia of waging a vast 'hybrid war,' from sprawling disinformation campaigns to protests by pro-Russia parties to vote-buying schemes that undermine countrywide elections. Russia has denied it is meddling. Social media platforms have played a crucial role in disseminating Russian propaganda in Moldova, says Andrei Rusu, a media monitoring expert at WatchDog. 'One of the biggest lies is that if Moldovans join the EU, they will go to war with Russia, they will lose their faith and traditional values, or they will be forced to follow LGBT propaganda,' he said. Moldovans who lived through the Soviet Union, he added, can struggle to spot Russian propaganda about the EU and the West, and differentiate between real videos and ones generated by artificial intelligence, such as those that have frequently appeared online depicting Sandu. In recent weeks, Meta and Telegram removed multiple fake accounts that railed against the EU and Sandu, and that expressed support for pro-Russian parties. However, Moldova watchers warn that Moscow’s main target could be the 2025 parliamentary elections. Waning support for the governing pro-Western Party of Action and Solidarity suggests it could lose its majority in the 101-seat legislature. 'We are already waiting for the parliamentary elections to see other tactics and strategies,' added Cojocari, the Russia analyst. 'This government will no longer be able … to secure a parliamentary majority.' Back at the boxing gym, Ticu warned more must be done to counter foreign interference, or face a 'danger of hybrid governance' with pro-Russian forces. 'Very good laws have been adopted, but are not implemented,' he said. Russian President Vladimir 'Putin does not want a war in Moldova, he wants to show the world and Europe a case in which European integration policies have failed.'	https://apnews.com/article/moldova-democracy-election-russia-disinformation-corruption-0a23e330da7121dbc34b085fc5d0d8ad	2024-11-01T21:24:40-07:00	
Delegates agree to establish Indigenous subsidiary body at COP16 biodiversity summit in Colombia	CALI, Colombia (AP) — Delegates came to an agreement late Friday at the United Nations conference on biodiversity to establish a subsidiary body that will include Indigenous peoples in future talks and decisions on nature conservation. The COP16 summit hosted in Cali, Colombia, was a follow-up to the historic 2022 accord in Montreal, which includes 23 measures to save Earth’s plant and animal life, including putting 30% of the planet and 30% of degraded ecosystems under protection by 2030. A measure to recognize the importance of the role of people of African descent in the protection of nature was also adopted Friday. Negotiators struggled to find common ground on some key issues in the final week, but were able to come to a consensus after negotiating late into Friday. Global Indigenous delegations erupted into cheers and tears over the historic decision. The decision recognizes and protects the traditional knowledge systems of Indigenous peoples and local communities for the benefit of global and national biodiversity management, said Sushil Raj, Executive Director of the Rights and Communities Global Program at the Wildlife Conservation Society. 'It strengthens representation, coordination, inclusive decision making, and creates a space for dialogue with parties to the COP,' Raj told The Associated Press. 'It promotes support for Indigenous and traditional territorial biodiversity management and furthers international human rights standards referenced in the Global Biodiversity Framework.' The body will be formed by two co-chairs elected by COP: one nominated by U.N. parties of the regional group, and the other nominated by representatives of Indigenous peoples and local communities, the AP saw in the document. At least one of the co-chairs will be selected from a developing country, taking into account gender balance, the document said. 'With this decision, the value of the traditional knowledge of indigenous peoples, Afro-descendants and local communities is recognized, and a 26-year-old historical debt in the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) is settled,' Susana Muhamad, Colombia’s environment minister and COP16 president, posted on social media platform X shortly after the announcement. Also adopted was an agreement to protect human health from Earth’s increasing biodiversity issues. Ecosystem degradation and loss of ecological integrity directly threaten human and animal health, environmental groups say. Pledges made by countries during the two weeks were far short of the billions needed to tackle plummeting global biodiversity, with only around $400 million in the fund. In Montreal's summit, wealthy nations pledged to raise $20 billion in annual conservation financing for developing nations by 2025, with that number rising to $30 billion annually by 2030. Global wildlife populations have plunged on average by 73% in 50 years, according to the World Wildlife Fund and the Zoological Society of London biennial Living Planet report in October.	https://apnews.com/article/biodiversity-cop16-colombia-decisions-indigenous-53a8b16befaf621d75a2fc9b9828c2a8	2024-11-01T21:04:53-07:00

Negotiations stall over some crucial issues on final day of UN biodiversity summit in Colombia	CALI, Colombia (AP) — At the United Nations biodiversity summit in Colombia, negotiators have struggled to find common ground on key issues. These include how to finance protections for 30% of the world's plants and animals by 2030, how to establish a permanent body for Indigenous peoples and how to make payments for nature’s genetic data that's used to create commercial products. The two-week conference, known as COP16, was due to wrap up Friday, although observers say negotiations could go into the weekend. In 2022, the biodiversity summit in Montreal, COP15, established a framework for countries to go about saving plummeting global ecosystems. This year’s follow-up summit was to put plans into motion. 'COP15 was all about the ‘what’; this was supposed to be about the ‘how,’' Georgina Chandler, head of policy and campaigns at The Zoological Society of London, told The Associated Press. Wealthy nations pledged in Montreal’s summit to raise $20 billion in annual conservation financing for developing nations by 2025 — with that rising to $30 billion annually by 2030. 'I don’t think we’ve seen governments come here with increased commitments towards the $20 billion significant enough that we’re going to achieve that,' Chandler said. 'That’s fallen a bit short.' The lack of financial pledges from wealthy countries prompted 20 ministers from the Global South to release a joint statement calling for the need to build trust among nations and for the Global North to meet its finance targets. In the run-up to negotiations, over 230 businesses and financial institutions demanded stronger policy ambitions to address the growing risks of nature loss, said Eva Zabey, CEO of Business for Nature. 'In the final stretch at COP16, negotiations are stalling on crucial issues — including the mobilization of meaningful financial resources and a way for companies to ensure the benefits of nature are valued and shared fairly,' Zabey said. 'We need governments to put aside their differences and demonstrate real and urgent leadership to deliver a strong COP16 outcome that incentivizes and drives necessary business action, further and faster, to halt and reverse nature loss by 2030,' she said. Who owns nature's DNA was a major topic at the summit. There was tension between poorer and developed countries over digital sequence information on genetic resources (DSI). This would oblige the sharing of benefits when genetic resources from animals, plants or microorganisms are used in biotechnologies. In Montreal, countries agreed to set up a global fund. 'The DSI fund was scheduled to be adopted here two years ago. There is no clarity on how money will be gathered from companies,' said Oscar Soria, director of The Common Initiative. 'As the text reads it is purely voluntary.' Sources told AP that there has been significant back and forth over wording in the draft agreement by nations. ’It’s clear that a number of points are going down to the wire in the COP16 negotiations,' Catherine Weller, Director of Global Policy at charity Fauna &amp; Flora said. One of the biggest controversies during talks was the blocking by a few countries of a Permanent Subsidiary Body for Indigenous Peoples and local communities, who Weller says bring valuable insights to many discussions. 'We urge the negotiators to step up and ensure this is finalized,' she said. ____ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Brazilian state law overturns soy moratorium that helped curb Amazon deforestation	AGUA CLARA, Brazil (AP) — A historic agreement that's helped curb deforestation in Brazil’s Amazon for nearly two decades suffered a major blow after Mato Grosso, the country´s largest soybean-producing state, passed a law ending incentives for participating processing and trade companies. The law passed last week was designed to void the Soy Moratorium — a 2006 deal in reaction to a Greenpeace investigation that linked soy produced in illegally deforested areas to U.S. commodities giants Cargill, Bunge and ADM. Under pressure, the companies agreed at the time not to buy soy produced in areas cleared after 2006. The date was later revised to July 2008. Several studies in recent years have shown the moratorium contributed to the Amazon’s preservation. A 2020 study in the journal Nature Food found that the agreement, in combination with public policies, contributed to the steepest reduction of deforestation recorded in Brazil’s Amazon, between 2003 and 2016. Backed by soybean producers and most of Mato Grosso´s lawmakers and mayors, the new legislation cuts tax benefits to companies that participate in any agreement that imposes restrictions on expanding agricultural activities into areas that can be legally deforested. Governor Mauro Mendes signed the law Oct. 24. It goes into effect on Jan. 1, 2025, but regulations are pending. It states that only the illegally deforested area of a farm will be prevented from selling soy. In other words, if a 4,000-acre (1,618-hectare) property clears 200 acres (81 hectares) unlawfully, just the output from that specific area is blocked. Specialists warn that such refined monitoring is technically challenging, if not unfeasible. Under the moratorium, property with any post-2008 deforestation is forbidden altogether to sell its crops, regardless of whether the deforestation is legal. Supporters of the new state law have long claimed the moratorium´s 2008 limit is stricter than Brazilian legislation that allows the deforestation of up to 20% of a large rural property in the Amazon. 'We will not rest as long as the moratorium harms even one producer,' the Mato Grosso soy producers president Lucas Costa Beber said in a celebratory statement. 'And until this agreement is extinct, the trading companies will not have a peaceful sleep.' Environmental nonprofits and the entity representing leading soybean trade and processing companies have criticized Mato Grosso´s initiative. 'The law is a setback,' said Bernardo Pires, sustainability director of the Brazilian Association of Vegetable Oil Industries (Abiove), which supports the moratorium. 'Companies committed to sustainability should receive twice as many benefits instead of losing them.' Abiove members, which include Cargill, Bunge and ADM, buy over 90% of Mato Grosso´s soy production. The state tax benefits amount to $308 million a year. Pires said the moratorium´s zero deforestation policy is a market demand. 'Our European customers demand not to consume any products associated with deforestation,' he said. Cristiane Mazzetti, coordinator of the forests campaign at Greenpeace Brazil, said the law reveals a double standard among politicians connected to agribusiness, who oppose the moratorium as unnecessary yet seek to weaken these same environmental protection. The new law sparked mixed reactions within President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s government, which has promised zero deforestation by 2030. André Lima, secretary of deforestation control at the Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change, said that although state governments have the right to choose which economic activities they want to support, it is unconstitutional to withdraw tax incentives from companies that have adopted sustainability and climate criteria aligned with Brazil’s deforestation reduction goals. 'It also goes against the national tax reform guidelines, which have incorporated sustainable development as an important criterion for promoting more and new tax incentives for the green economy,' he told The Associated Press. Agriculture Minister Carlos Fávaro, however, praised the law. 'The project (moratorium) is stricter than the law, and this creates legitimate dissatisfaction among producers,' he told reporters in an event last week. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Brazil criticizes Venezuela for escalating tensions and personal attacks	SAO PAULO (AP) — Brazil's government broke its silence Friday over growing tensions with neighboring Venezuela, with the Foreign Ministry saying it was surprised by 'the offensive tone' adopted by Venezuelan authorities toward Brazil. In recent days, Venezuela’s government has escalated its criticism of Brazilian foreign relations officials and even President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a long-time ally. 'The choice of personal attacks and rhetorical escalations, instead of political and diplomatic channels, does not align with the respectful manner in which the Brazilian government treats Venezuela and its people,' the Brazilian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. President Nicolás Maduro’s government intensified its criticism of Brazil after a top adviser to Brazil’s president said the country had not supported Venezuela’s bid to join the BRICS bloc of developing economies at the recent summit in Russia. That decision added to tensions between the two nations over disputed results in Venezuela’s July presidential election and calls for transparency from Brazil and other countries. Venezuela’s Foreign Ministry said Wednesday it summoned Brazil’s chargé d’affaires in Venezuela, Breno Hermann, to 'express its strongest rejection of the recurrent interventionist and rude statements of spokespersons authorized by the Brazilian government.' The ministry also accused Celso Amorim, Brazil’s former foreign minister and special adviser to Lula, of acting 'like a messenger of American imperialism' by 'issuing value judgments on processes that only correspond to Venezuelans and their democratic institutions.' It added that his actions threaten the 'ties that unite both countries.' Initially, Brazil’s diplomatic approach was to avoid commenting to prevent escalating tensions, a Foreign Ministry source told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the issue publicly. However, this stance shifted after Venezuela’s Bolivarian National Police shared an image Thursday on social media depicting what appeared to be Lula’s silhouette over Brazil’s national flag with the text: 'If you mess with Venezuela, you wilt.' 'Our homeland is independent, free, and sovereign. We do not accept blackmail from anyone; we are not anyone’s colony,' the publication added. In the Friday statement, Brazil’s Foreign Ministry said it values non-intervention and fully respects the sovereignty of each neighboring country. The statement explained that Brazil’s interest in Venezuela’s electoral process stems from its role as a witness to the 2023 Barbados Agreements, in which Venezuela’s government and opposition settled on electoral conditions. 'The Brazilian government remains convinced that partnerships should be based on open dialogue, respect for differences, and mutual understanding,' the statement said. Amorim, the former foreign minister, in a Tuesday hearing before Brazilian lawmakers, acknowledged 'discomfort' between the two countries, attributing it to the Maduro administration’s refusal to publish detailed election results. He said that improving diplomatic relations 'will depend on actions' taken by Venezuela, without providing specifics. Venezuela’s electoral authorities claimed they could not publish the detailed results because their website was hacked. At the same time, the main opposition coalition secured vote tally sheets from more than 80% of the electronic voting machines used across the country, published them online and declared that its candidate, former diplomat Edmundo González, had defeated Maduro by a landslide. After the July 28 election, Lula, Colombian President Gustavo Petro and then-Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador — all leftists and friendly with Maduro — inserted themselves into Venezuela’s election standoff to attempt a peacemaking effort. But it went nowhere, and Maduro has since consolidated his rule, reshuffled his Cabinet and jailed more than 2,000 opponents. The BRICS bloc, which initially included Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, has expanded to embrace Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. Brazil opposed including Venezuela at the group’s summit earlier this month. 'Brazil does not want an indefinite expansion,' Amorim, Lula's special adviser, told lawmakers. 'Brazil believes its members should be countries with influence that can help represent the region. And Venezuela today does not meet these conditions, in our opinion.' Venezuela’s Foreign Affairs Ministry characterized the move as 'irrational behavior' and likened it to the economic sanctions that the U.S. imposed against the South American country.	https://apnews.com/article/brazil-venezuela-diplomacy-maduro-lula-celso-amorim-9c6f7d837c6d15307d2562f6cdfe683a	2024-11-01T12:52:11-07:00	
29 Nigerian children may be sentenced to death for protesting against cost-of-living crisis	ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — Twenty-nine children could be facing the death penalty in Nigeria after they were arraigned Friday for participating in a protest against the country’s record cost-of-living crisis. Four of them collapsed in court due to exhaustion before they could enter a plea. A total of 76 protesters were charged with 10 felony counts, including treason, destruction of property, public disturbance and mutiny, according to the charge sheet seen by The Associated Press. According to the charge sheet, the minors ranged in age from 14 to 17 years old. Frustration over the cost-of-living crisis has led to several mass protests in recent months. In August, at least 20 people were shot dead and hundreds more were arrested at a protest demanding better opportunities and jobs for young people. The death sentence was introduced in the 1970s in Nigeria, but there have been no executions in the country since 2016. Akintayo Balogun, a private lawyer based in Abuja, said the Child Rights Act does not allow any child to be subject to criminal proceedings and sentenced to death. 'So taking minors before a federal high court is wrong, ab initio, except if the government is able to prove that the boys are all above 19 years,' Balogun said. The court eventually granted 10 million naira ($5,900) bail to each the defendants and imposed stringent conditions they are yet to meet, Marshal Abubakar, counsel to some of the boys, said. 'A country that has a duty to educate its children will decide to punish those children. These children have been in detention for 90 days without food,' Abubakar said. Yemi Adamolekun, executive director of Enough is Enough, a civil society organization promoting good governance in Nigeria, said authorities have no business prosecuting children. 'The chief justice of Nigeria should be ashamed, she is a woman and a mother,' Adamolekun said. Despite being one of the top crude oil producers in Africa, Nigeria remains one of the world’s poorest countries. Chronic corruption means the lifestyle of its public officials rarely mirrors that of the general population. Medical professionals often strike to protest meager wages. The country's politicians and lawmakers, often accused of corruption, are some of the best-paid in Africa. Even the president’s wife — her office nowhere in the constitution — is entitled to SUVs and other luxuries funded by taxpayers. Nigeria’s population of over 210 million people — the continent’s largest — is also among the hungriest in the world and its government has struggled to create jobs. The inflation rate is also at 28-year high and the local naira currency at record lows against the dollar. On Thursday, Nigeria was classified as a 'hotspot of very high concern,' in a report from United Nations’ food agencies, as large numbers of people are facing or are projected to face critical levels of acute food insecurity in the West African country.	https://apnews.com/article/nigeria-minors-death-sentence-costofliving-crisis-5ee0c4023575f31bbf569c3e49045d54	2024-11-01T12:47:45-07:00	
US is sending $425 million in military assistance to Ukraine	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Pentagon announced Friday it was sending an additional $425 million in military assistance to Ukraine as Kyiv prepares to face Russian forces augmented by more than 10,000 North Korean troops. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin had said more aid was coming, and soon, during his visit to Kyiv last week. This aid package includes weapons that will be pulled from existing U.S. stockpiles, including air defense interceptors for National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems, munitions for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems and 155 mm artillery, and armored vehicles and anti-tank weapons. Ukraine's eastern cities continue to face an onslaught of Russian missile strikes, including one on Kharkiv by a 500-kilogram (1,100-pound) glide bomb. The attack Thursday hit an apartment complex, killing three and injuring scores. In addition, Ukraine is facing new uncertainty as waves of North Korean soldiers deployed to Russia have arrived near Ukraine’s border and are preparing to join the fight against Ukrainian troops in coming days. Russia has increasingly used powerful glide bombs to pummel Ukrainian positions along the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) line of contact and strike cities dozens of kilometers (miles) from the front line. Kharkiv, a city of 1.1 million, is about 30 kilometers (less than 20 miles) from the border. The aid package announced Friday by the Pentagon brings the total amount of military assistance the U.S. has provided Ukraine since Russia invaded in February 2022 to $60.4 billion.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-military-aid-f188add84ba11349dcbbf2d5de719124	2024-11-01T10:06:59-07:00	
FBI links video falsely depicting voter fraud in Georgia to 'Russian influence actors'	WASHINGTON (AP) — A video purporting to depict voter fraud in Georgia is fake and the work of 'Russian influence actors,' U.S. intelligence officials said Friday as they warned that foreign efforts to undermine faith in the integrity of next week's elections may persist long after votes have been cast. The announcement that the video was fake represented an effort by the FBI and other federal agencies, four days before Tuesday's elections, to combat foreign disinformation by calling it out rather than letting it spread for days unchecked. It follows a similar statement last week that also attributed to Russian actors a widely circulated video falsely depicting mail-in ballots for Donald Trump being destroyed in Pennsylvania. The 20-second video, which began circulating on the social media platform X on Thursday afternoon, shows someone who describes himself as a Haitian immigrant talking about how he’s intending to vote multiple times in two Georgia counties for Vice President Kamala Harris. He flashes several purported Georgia IDs with different names and addresses. An Associated Press analysis of the information on two of the IDs confirms it does not match any registered voters in Gwinnett or Fulton counties, the two counties he mentioned. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said Thursday night that the video is 'obviously fake' and likely the product of Russian trolls 'attempting to sow discord and chaos on the eve of the election.' Intelligence officials echoed that finding Friday, saying the video was manufactured by 'Russian influence actors' and was part of 'Moscow’s broader effort to raise unfounded questions about the integrity of the U.S. election and stoke divisions among Americans.' The intelligence community expects Russia, in the days before the election and weeks and months after, 'to create and release additional media content that seeks to undermine trust in the integrity of the election and divide Americans,' said the joint statement from the FBI, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. The post that originally popularized the video was no longer available on Friday morning, but copycat versions of the video were still being shared widely with false claims it showed election fraud. The video in its style and method of dissemination is similar to other videos created by Storm-1516, also known as CopyCop, a known Russian disinformation network that has created several fake videos this election, according to Darren Linvill, co-director of the Media Forensics Hub at Clemson University, who has researched the group. Also Friday, the agencies attributed to Russia a separate manufactured video falsely accusing 'an individual associated with the Democratic presidential ticket of taking a bribe from a U.S. entertainer.' They did not elaborate.	https://apnews.com/article/fbi-russia-georgia-fraud-disinformation-eebea4ab200682ccd3e97fb9f164e6ca	2024-11-01T09:41:30-07:00	
Head of UN-backed team of experts cites paramilitary force in Sudan for sexual violence as war rages	GENEVA (AP) — The head of a U.N.-backed fact-finding team looking into human rights violations and abuses in Sudan said Friday it found the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces responsible for large-scale sexual violence in areas that it controls. Mohamed Chande Othman has denounced 'staggering violence' in Sudan since war broke out more than 18 months ago between the Sudanese military and the RSF, starting with open fighting in the capital, Khartoum, that later spread across the country. 'We said in our report that we attribute sexual gender-based violence to RSF in West Darfur, in Darfur, in greater Khartoum, and in al-Gezira (state),' the Tanzanian lawyer said Friday by phone from Zimbabwe, where he was attending a conference. However, Othman said a renewed mandate from the U.N. Human Rights Council would allow his team of independent experts to investigate 'credible' allegations of sexual exploitation by the Sudanese armed forces as well. The fact-finding mission on Tuesday released a more comprehensive version of its report presented in September to the rights council, which has 47 member countries. The broader report cited gang rapes, sexual slavery and the abduction of victims in areas the RSF controls. 'It’s important to highlight the horrendous nature and the widespread nature — the patterns of violence — that were committed,' Othman said. His team found the sexual violence and allegations of enforced marriages and human trafficking across borders for sexual purposes took place mostly during invasions of towns and cities. 'Victims and witnesses consistently reported that perpetrators threatened them with weapons, including firearms, knives and whips to intimidate and coerce them,' the latest report said, citing violence like punching, beatings with sticks, and lashing before and during rape. 'Men and boys were also reportedly targeted while in detention with sexual violence, including rape, threats of rape, forced nudity and beating on the genitals, requiring further investigation,' it added. The violence in Sudan has been unrelenting. On Sunday, a doctors group and the United Nations reported that RSF fighters riot in east central Sudan carried out? took part in? a multi-day attack that killed more than 120 people in one town. On Tuesday, the U.N. migration agency said 14 million people — or over 30% of the country's population — have been displaced either within Sudan or abroad because of the conflict, making it the world's largest displacement crisis.	https://apnews.com/article/othman-human-rights-sudan-war-rsf-b659ad643af6e3b4852f2046349a83e2	2024-11-01T07:37:34-07:00	
Israel is falling far short of a US ultimatum to surge aid to Gaza	WASHINGTON (AP) — Halfway through the Biden administration's 30-day ultimatum for Israel to surge the level of humanitarian assistance allowed into Gaza or risk possible restrictions on U.S. military funding, Israel is falling far short, an Associated Press review of U.N. and Israeli data shows. Israel also has missed some other deadlines and demands outlined in a Oct. 13 letter from Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. The mid-November deadline — following the U.S. election — may serve as a final test of President Joe Biden 's willingness to check a close ally that has shrugged off repeated U.S. appeals to protect Palestinian civilians during the war against Hamas. In their letter, Blinken and Austin demanded improvements to the deteriorating humanitarian condition in Gaza, saying that Israel must allow in a minimum of 350 trucks a day carrying desperately needed food and other supplies. By the end of October, an average of just 71 trucks a day were entering Gaza, according to the latest U.N. figures. Blinken said the State Department and Pentagon were closely following Israel’s response to the letter. 'There’s been progress, but it’s insufficient, and we’re working on a daily basis to make sure Israel does what it must do to ensure that this assistance gets to people who need it inside of Gaza,' Blinken told reporters. 'It’s not enough to get trucks to Gaza. It’s vital that what they bring with them can get distributed effectively inside of Gaza,' he added. Blinken and Austin’s letter marked one of the toughest stands that the Biden administration has taken in a year of appeals and warnings to Israel to lessen the harm to Palestinian civilians. Support for Israel is a bedrock issue for many Republican voters and some Democrats. That makes any Biden administration decision on restricting military funding to the U.S. ally a fraught one for the tight presidential race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. In hard-hit north Gaza in particular, an escalated Israeli military campaign and restrictions on aid has kept all food and other care from reaching populated areas since mid-October, aid organizations say. It could set the stage for famine in coming weeks or months, international monitors say. And despite U.S. objections, Israeli lawmakers this week voted to effectively ban the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA. Governments worldwide, the U.N. and aid organizations say cutting off UNRWA would shatter the aid networks struggling to get food and other supplies to people in Gaza. 'Catastrophic,' Amber Alayyan, a medical program manager for Gaza at Doctors Without Borders, said of the move. Humanitarian officials are deeply skeptical Israel will significantly improve assistance to Gaza’s civilians even with the U.S. warning — or that the Biden administration will do anything if it doesn’t. At this point in the war, 'neither of those has happened,' said Scott Paul, an associate director of the Oxfam humanitarian organization. 'Over and over and again, we’ve been told' by Biden administration officials 'that there are processes to evaluate the situation on the ground' in Gaza 'and some movement’s been made to implement U.S. law, and time and again that has not happened,' Paul said. Before the war, an average of 500 trucks daily brought aid into the territory. Relief groups have said that's the minimum needed for Gaza’s 2.3 million people, most of whom have since been uprooted from their homes, often multiple times. There has never been a month where Israel came close to meeting that figure since the conflict began, peaking in April at 225 trucks a day, according to Israeli government figures. By the time Blinken and Austin sent their letter this month, concerns were rising that aid restrictions were starving civilians. The number of aid trucks that Israel has allowed into Gaza has plunged since last spring and summer, falling to a daily average of just 13 a day by the beginning of October, according to U.N. figures. By the end of the month, it rose to an average of 71 trucks a day, the U.N. figures show. Once supplies get to Gaza, groups still face obstacles distributing the aid to warehouses and then to people in need, organizations and the State Department said this week. That includes slow Israeli processing, Israeli restrictions on shipments, lawlessness and other obstacles, aid groups said. Data from COGAT, the Israeli military body in charge of humanitarian aid to Gaza, shows aid has fallen to under a third of its levels in September and August. In September, 87,446 tons of aid entered the Gaza Strip. In October, 26,399 tons got in. Elad Goren, a senior COGAT official, said last week that aid delivery and distribution in the north has been mainly confined to Gaza City. When asked why aid was not being delivered to other parts of the north — like Jabaliya, a crowded urban refugee camp where Israel is staging an offensive — he said the population there was being evacuated and those who remained had 'enough assistance' from previous months. In other areas like Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya, Goren claimed falsely that there was 'no population' left there. COGAT declined to comment on the standard in the U.S. letter. It said it was complying with government directives on aid to Gaza. Israel’s U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon blamed Hamas for plundering aid. Paul of Oxfam said no aid at all was reaching populated areas in northern Gaza and only small amounts getting to Gaza City. 'No way' has Israel made progress in getting humanitarian support to the hundreds of thousands of people in north Gaza in particular since the U.S. ultimatum, said Alayyan of Doctors Without Borders. Israel’s government appeared to blow past another deadline set in Austin and Blinken's letter. It called for Israel to set up a senior-level channel for U.S. officials to raise concerns about reported harm to Palestinian civilians and hold a first meeting by the end of October. No such channel — requested repeatedly by the U.S. during the war — had been created by the final day of the month. The U.S. is by far the biggest provider of arms and other military aid to Israel, including nearly $18 billion during the war in Gaza, according to a study for Brown University's Costs of War project. The Biden administration paused a planned shipment of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel last spring, citing concerns for civilians in an Israeli offensive. In a formal review in May, the administration concluded that Israel’s use of U.S.-provided weapons in Gaza likely violated international humanitarian law but said wartime conditions prevented officials from determining that for certain in specific strikes. ___ AP writers Matthew Lee in Washington, Julia Frankel in Jerusalem and Edith M.

Hindus in Muslim-majority Bangladesh rally to demand protection from attacks	DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — Tens of thousands of minority Hindus rallied Friday to demand that the interim government in Muslim-majority Bangladesh protect them from a wave of attacks and harassment and drop sedition cases against Hindu community leaders. About 30,000 Hindus demonstrated at a major intersection in the southeastern city of Chattogram chanting slogans demanding their rights while police and soldiers guarded the area. Other protests were reported elsewhere in the country. Hindu groups say thousands of attacks against Hindus have happened since early August when the secular government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was overthrown and Hasina fled the country following a student-led uprising. Muhammad Yunus, the Nobel peace laureate named to lead an interim government after Hasina's downfall, says those figures have been exaggerated. Hindus make up about 8% of the country's nearly 170 million people, while Muslims are about 91%. The country’s influential minority group Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council has said that there have been more than 2,000 attacks on Hindus since Aug. 4, as the interim government has struggled to restore order. U.N. human rights officials and other rights groups have expressed concern over human rights in the country under Yunus. Hindus and other minority communities say the interim government hasn't adequately protected them and that hardline Islamists are becoming increasingly influential since Hasina's ouster. The issue has reached beyond Bangladesh, with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi voicing concern over reports of attacks. While the administration of U.S. Presdent Joe Biden has said it is monitoring Bangladesh’s human rights issues since Hasina’s ouster, U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump has condemned what he described as 'barbaric' violence against Hindus, Christians, and other minorities in Bangladesh. In a post on X, he said: 'I strongly condemn the barbaric violence against Hindus, Christians, and other minorities who are getting attacked and looted by mobs in Bangladesh, which remains in a total state of chaos.' Hindu activists have been staging protest rallies in the capital, Dhaka, and elsewhere since August to press a set of eight demands including a law to protect minorities, a ministry for minorities and a tribunal to prosecute acts of oppression against minorities. They also seek a five-day holiday for their largest festival, the Durga Puja. Friday's protest in Chattogram was hastily organized after sedition charges were filed Wednesday against 19 Hindu leaders, including prominent priest Chandan Kumar Dhar, over an Oct. 25 rally in that city. Police arrested two of the leaders, angering Hindus. The charges stem from an incident when a group of rally-goers allegedly placed a saffron flag above the Bangladesh flag on a pillar, which was considered disrespecting the national flag. Hindu community leaders say the cases are politically motivated and on Thursday demanded that they be withdrawn within 72 hours. Another Hindu rally has been planned for Saturday in Dhaka. Separately, supporters of Hasina's Awami League party and its allied Jatiya Party have said they also have been targeted since Hasina's ouster. Jatiya's headquarters was vandalized and set on fire late Thursday. On Friday, Jatiya Party Chairman G.M. Quader said his supporters would continue to hold rallies to demand their rights despite risking their lives. He said they would hold a rally Saturday at the party headquarters in Dhaka to protest price hikes of commodities, and what they call false charges against their leaders and activists. Later Friday, the Dhaka Metropolitan Police announced it was banning any rallies near the Jatiya headquarters. There was no immediate response from the party about whether it press ahead with its attempts to hold the rally, or change the venue. The police decision came after a student group strongly criticized the police administration for initially granting permission for the rally, and threatened to block it.	https://apnews.com/article/bangladesh-hindu-minority-attacks-hasina-yunus-beaddefd93f1b9dcf14d287543b023f5	2024-11-01T06:17:03-07:00

Deaths of 10 newborns shake millions' trust in Turkey's health care system	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — The mother thought her baby looked healthy when he was born 1.5 months early, but staff swiftly whisked him to the neonatal intensive care unit. It was the last time Burcu Gokdeniz would see her baby alive. The doctor in charge told her that Umut Ali's heart stopped after his health deteriorated unexpectedly. Seeing her son wrapped in a shroud 10 days after he was born was the 'worst moment' of her life, the 32-year-old e-commerce specialist told The Associated Press. Gokdeniz is among hundreds of parents who have come forward seeking an investigation into the deaths of their children or other loved ones since Turkish prosecutors accused 47 doctors, nurses and ambulance drivers and other medical workers of neglect or malpractice in the deaths of 10 newborns since last year. The medical workers say they made the best possible judgment calls while caring for the most delicate patients imaginable, and face criminal penalties for unwanted outcomes. Shattered parents say they have lost trust in the system and the cases have prompted so much outrage that demonstrators staged protests in October outside hospitals where some of the deaths occurred, hurling stones at the buildings. Prosecutors haven’t said how much the defendants allegedly earned. After the scandal emerged, at least 350 families petitioned prosecutors, the Health Ministry or the president’s office seeking an investigation into the deaths of their loved ones, the state-run Anadolu Agency reported. The prosecution's case Prosecutors are demanding up to 583 years in prison for the main defendant, Dr. Firat Sari, who operated the neonatal intensive care units of several hospitals in Istanbul. Sari is charged with 'establishing an organization with the aim of committing a crime,' 'defrauding public institutions,' 'forgery of official documents' and 'homicide by negligence.' Prosecutors say that the evidence clearly shows medical fraud for profit. An indictment issued this month accused the defendants of falsifying records, and placing patients in the neonatal care units of some private hospitals for prolonged and sometimes unnecessary treatments in facilities unprepared to treat them. Turkey guarantees all citizens health care, and its public health system reimburses private hospitals that treat eligible patients. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s ruling party, in power since 2002, has promoted the expansion of private health care facilities to improve access in the country of 85 million people. Years without a family, then a death After years of fertility treatment, Ozan Eskici and his wife welcomed twins — a boy and a girl — to one of Sari's hospitals in 2019. Although the babies initially appeared to be healthy, both were admitted to intensive care. The girl was discharged after 11 days, but the boy died 24 days later. During questioning by prosecutors, Sari denied accusations that the babies were not given the proper care, that the neonatal units were understaffed or that his employees were not appropriately qualified, according to a 1,400-page indictment. He told prosecutors: 'Everything is in accordance with procedures.' This week, a court in Istanbul approved the indictment — which includes hundreds of pages of transcripts of secretly taped recordings of telephone conversations between suspects — and scheduled the trial date for Nov. 18. The way that the case has horrified the nation has left the defendants increasingly isolated. Lawyer Ali Karaoglan said he and two other attorneys who represented Sari during the investigation have recently withdrawn from the case. And authorities have since revoked the licenses and closed nine of the 19 hospitals implicated in the scandal, including one owned by a former health minister. The scandal has led main opposition party leader Ozgur Ozel to call for all hospitals involved to be seized by the state and nationalized. Erdogan said those responsible for the deaths would be severely punished but warned against placing all blame on the country’s health care system. 'We will not allow our health care community to be battered because of a few rotten apples,' Erdogan said, calling the alleged culprits 'a gang of people devoid of humanity.' 'This gang ... committed such despicable atrocities by exploiting the facilities provided by our state to ensure citizens with higher quality and more accessible, affordable healthcare,' Erdogan said. He added: 'Those who commit such barbarism will be held accountable before the law in the most severe way for their crimes. As the president, I will continue to follow this issue personally to ensure that these killers, who played with the lives of innocent babies for financial gain, never see the light of day again.' No more trust in the system Gokdeniz, who gave birth in 2020, said she trusted Sari and accepted her son’s death as natural until she watched the scandal unfold in TV news and on social media. 'It all started to fall into place like dominoes,' she said. Eskici, too, had placed complete trust in Sari, whose assurances he now views as cruel deceptions. 'The sentences he told me are in front of my eyes like it was yesterday,' he said. Sibel Kosal, who lost her baby daughter Zeynep at a private hospital in 2017, is also seeking answers. She says the scandal has shattered her trust in the health care system and left her in constant fear for her surviving children. 'They have ruined a dad and a mom,' she said. Kosal pleaded to the authorities to take immediate action. 'Don’t let babies die, don’t let mothers cry,' she said. 'We want a livable world, one where our children are safe.' —— Badendieck reported from Hamburg, Germany.	https://apnews.com/article/turkey-premature-babies-medical-worker-killings-fraud-d99b0e3bb58295b4dc31e9b44fd49201	2024-11-01T04:45:09-07:00	
Israel pummels Gaza and Lebanon, killing dozens in latest waves of deadly airstrikes	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — The Israeli military launched waves of deadly airstrikes across Lebanon and Gaza, killing at least 24 people in Lebanon's northeast on Friday, the country's state-run National News Agency reported. Palestinians, meanwhile, recovered the bodies of 25 people killed in a barrage of Israeli attacks on central Gaza that began Thursday, hospital officials said. It was another day of bloodshed both in Lebanon, where Israel stepped up airstrikes against Hezbollah in the northeast this week, and in Gaza, where Israel said it had targeted Hamas infrastructure near the Nuseirat refugee camp. Despite growing pressure from the United States and others in the international community for a cease-fire in the fighting in Gaza and Lebanon, Israeli strikes against the militant Hezbollah group are increasingly expanding beyond Lebanon's periphery. Israeli attacks that initially targeted smaller border villages in southern Lebanon, where the Iran-backed Hezbollah holds sway, have broadened to bigger urban hubs in recent weeks where the group — which is also a major political party and provider of social services — counts many supporters. The intensified strikes on and around the northeastern city of Baalbek this week have prompted roughly 60,000 people to flee their homes, according to Hussein Haj Hassan, a Lebanese lawmaker representing the region. Lebanon’s state National News Agency reported four airstrikes in different villages across the northeast that had largely been spared the worst of Israeli bombardment until last month. The agency reported that rescuers were still searching for survivors in Younine, a town in the Bekaa Valley, from the rubble of a targeted building that was believed to have housed 20 people. Further attacks in the northeastern Baalbek-Hermel region killed eight people in the village of Amhaz and another two in the village of Taraya. Israel’s military has said that its operation in Lebanon is targeting Hezbollah’s military infrastructure as the group continues firing rockets, drones and missiles into Israel. Rockets fired from Lebanon killed seven people in northern Israel on Thursday, including four Thai workers. Israeli planes also pounded Beirut’s southern suburb of Dahiyeh overnight and early Friday, destroying dozens of buildings in several neighborhoods, according to the country's news agency. The Israeli military said those attacks hit Hezbollah weapons manufacturing sites and command centers. There was no word from the Lebanese officials on any casualty figures from the Dahiyeh strikes, Lebanon’s Heath Ministry said more than 2,800 people have been killed and 13,000 wounded since Oct. 8, 2023, when Hezbollah began firing rockets almost daily into Israel, drawing retaliation. The latest violence comes against the backdrop of the Biden administration's renewed diplomatic push days before the U.S. election to reach temporary cease-fire deals between Israel, Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza. In Gaza, officials from the al-Aqsa Hospital in central Gaza said they continued to receive bodies from a barrage of Israeli airstrikes on Nuseirat camp that left 21 dead, including an 18-month-old and his 10-year-old sister. Israeli strikes also hit a motorcycle in Zuwaida and a house in Deir al-Balah, killing four more people, the hospital officials said, bringing the overall death toll in Gaza to 25 on Friday. Within the last 24 hours, Gaza-based Health Ministry reported that 55 people had been killed and another 196 had been wounded in the battered enclave. The Israeli military did not comment on the strikes outside Nuseirat camp. It said it was aware of reports of civilian casualties and was investigating. Israel’s blistering offensive on the Gaza Strip has killed more than 43,000 Palestinians since October 7, 2023, say health officials inside Gaza who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants. They say more than half of the dead are women and children. Israel began bombarding Gaza after the Hamas attack on Israel on Oct. 7 last year, when the militants killed roughly 1,200 people and took some 250 hostages back to Gaza. ___ Frankel reported from Jerusalem.

North Korea's top diplomat is in Moscow as Pyongyang sent troops to help the war on Ukraine	Russia's top diplomat on Friday hosted his North Korean counterpart for talks amid reports that Pyongyang has sent thousands of troops to Russia to support its military in the war in Ukraine. Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui's visit to Moscow and her meeting with Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov came on the heels of the Pentagon's statement that North Korea has deployed about 10,000 troops to Russia to fight against Ukraine within 'the next several weeks.' Western leaders have described the North Korean troop deployment as a significant escalation that could also jolt relations in the Indo-Pacific region. Neither Moscow nor Pyongyang have specified the agenda for Choe's talks in Moscow, but in a closed-door hearing at South Korea’s parliament, the South’s spy agency said Choe may be involved in high-level discussions on sending additional troops to Russia and negotiating what the North would get in return. South Korean and Western officials have voiced concern that Russia may offer technology that could advance the threat posed by North Korea’s nuclear weapons and missile program. Meeting Choe in Moscow on Friday, Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov hailed ties between Moscow and Pyongyang, saying that they 'have reached an unprecedented high level over the past few years,' and proposed discussing the implementation of the strategic partnership agreement the two nations signed earlier this year. 'We will have discussions on a series of issues regarding politics and foreign policy as well as matters that require a joint response between the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the Russian Federation,' Choe said, invoking the North’s formal name. She reiterated Pyongyang's support 'for the just fight of Russia’s military and people to defend their country’s sovereign rights and security interests' in Ukraine. Moscow and Pyongyang have responded vaguely to South Korean and Western claims of the North Korean troop deployment to Russia, emphasizing that their military cooperation conforms with international law, without directly admitting the presence of the North’s forces in Russia. The United States and its allies also have accused North Korea of providing millions of artillery shells and other equipment to Russia to fuel its military action in Ukraine. Russia, along with China, has blocked U.S.-led efforts at the Security Council to tighten sanctions on North Korea over its recent missile testing, which intensified after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Russia also vetoed a U.N. resolution to extend the mandate of monitors in March, in a move that effectively abolished oversight by U.N. experts of Security Council sanctions against North Korea. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol last month raised the possibility of supplying Ukraine with weapons while saying Seoul is preparing countermeasures that could be rolled out in stages depending on the degree of military cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow. South Korea, a growing arms exporter, has provided humanitarian aid and other non-lethal support to Ukraine and joined U.S.-led economic sanctions against Moscow. It has so far resisted calls by Kyiv and NATO to directly supply Ukraine with weapons, citing a longstanding policy of not providing arms to countries engaged in active conflict. In other developments: — Russia launched three aviation missiles and 48 drones of various types, including Shaheds, at Ukraine overnight, Ukrainian air force said. One missile and 31 drones were intercepted, 14 drones were jammed, three drones flew to the territory of Belarus, the air force said in a report on Friday morning said. Several civilian facilities, as well as apartment buildings and private houses in Poltava, Cherkasy, Kyiv and Odesa regions were damaged by drone debris. — The Russian military on Friday said it intercepted and destroyed a total of 83 Ukrainian drones over four Russian regions near the border with Ukraine and the annexed Crimean Peninsula. In the Bryansk region, a drone hit a residential block, local authorities said. No casualties were reported. In the Stavropol region, a drone hit an oil depot, according to local officials. Unconfirmed media reports said the oil depot caught fire.	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-russia-troops-ukraine-5cb448f2f7b51a2bf60169f6c6bc3376	2024-11-01T02:04:39-07:00	
Spiritual, not spooky. After Halloween, Christians observe All Saints' Day	WARSAW, Poland (AP) — It's the time of year — tradition says — when the veil between the worlds of the living and the dead is lifted. That traditional belief has morphed over the centuries into the spooky and secular celebration of Halloween. But one day later, Christians in many countries around the world are celebrating All Saints' Day on Friday, a somber and spiritual day in the church's liturgical calendar that shares pagan roots with Halloween. The word 'Halloween' derives from 'All Hallows Eve,' which means the eve of All Saints’ Day, a holiday that has also been known as All Hallows. It honors martyrs and saints — those who were hallowed, or deemed holy — a tradition begun by the Roman Catholic church in the early medieval period. Scholars believe that the spectral aspects of Halloween emerged primarily from Samhain, an ancient Celtic festival that occurred during the harvest season, said Morgan Shipley, a professor of religious studies at Michigan State University in East Lansing. It was a time when people were 'transitioning from harvest and bounty and the fullness of summer to the desolation of winter,' he said. 'And it was said that in this time the veil between the physical, material human world and the spiritual world essentially dissipates away.' Some of the spirits or spectral beings were viewed as demonic in nature, and bonfires became a way to ward them away, or were used in divination by druid priests and priestesses when the veil between the material and spiritual world broke down, he said. As Christianity spread, many pagan rituals were adapted to the new faith to be more attractive to converts. The period of reflecting on the dead continues though Nov. 2, which is All Souls’ Day. In Central Europe, the Slavic and Baltic populations had their own rituals in which the living communed with the dead between Oct. 31 and Nov. 1. Believers and non-believers alike in many traditionally Roman Catholic societies observe the day. Finka Heynemann, 34, visited Warsaw's Brodno cemetery on Friday morning with her mother. The two had plans to visit six cemeteries in Warsaw where generations of ancestors are buried over three days — even though they are not religious. 'It's just important to keep the tradition and visit the graves and to respect and honor ancestors,' Heynemann said. 'This day is more important than Christmas or Easter,' added her mother, Maja Gąssowska, who paused to drop money in a collection box for a Polish cemetery in the Ukrainian city of Lviv, which was once part of Poland. In Poland, many travel back to their family homes to gather with those still living and reflect on those who have left them. So many people observe the holiday that cemeteries are transformed into flickering carpets of light so impressive that even the most secular cannot help but feel moved. Cities, including Warsaw and Krakow, run many additional tram and bus lines to ferry the huge numbers to — and between — cemeteries. While the reflections are mostly personal, people also leave candles at the graves of national heroes. So many people visit cemeteries at the same time that the celebration takes on a communal quality. It has become so much part of the wider culture in Poland that people place candles in the Jewish and Muslim cemeteries as well. In the Philippines, millions trooped to cemeteries across the country Friday to observe the annual tradition, visiting tombs of their loved ones. 'Even if I’m old, I still visit the tombs of my relatives, especially my husband’s, during All Saints’ Day,' said Manila resident Dory Oliquino, who was among thousands offering flowers and candles at the Manila North Cemetery in the country's capital. 'As long as I can walk, I will visit him.' All Saints’ Day has been a family reunion for many Filipinos, where they keep vigil at the tombs. Italians traditionally visit cemeteries to pay tribute to deceased family members on All Souls' Day, lighting candles or laying flowers. Pope Francis will visit Rome’s third-largest cemetery, the Laurentino Cemetery, to celebrate Mass and lead prayers for the dead. The pope visited the same cemetery in 2018, stopping to pray in an area dedicated to fetuses. In recent years as the holiday approaches, there are discussions about Halloween and its compatibility with Christian beliefs in the afterlife. Poles began to celebrate Halloween after the fall of communism in 1989, but some worry that the foreign cultural import could eventual dilute the tradition of All Saints' Day. Some Catholics worry that it also might be sinful due to allusions to devils and ghosts. Pushing back, some church groups have begun holding alternative events for All Saints’ Day. This week, a church group organized the 3rd All Saints’ Ball in the Polish town of Plock, according to a Catholic news site, Niedziela — meaning Sunday — which reported that 'the children came dressed as saints and blessed of the Catholic Church and as angels.' ___ Associated Press writers Colleen Barry in Milan and Basilio Sepe in Manila, Philippines, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/all-saints-day-2024-world-christian-catholic-36f7b8599b2336d7c700c532db2e26dc	2024-11-01T01:34:43-07:00	
Spanish residents appeal for help, 3 days after historic floods left at least 158 dead	MADRID (AP) — Three days after historic flash floods swept through several towns in southern Valencia, in eastern Spain, the initial shock was giving way to anger, frustration and a wave of solidarity on Friday. Many streets are still blocked by piled-up vehicles and debris, in some cases trapping residents in their homes. Some places still don't have electricity, running water, or stable telephone connections. Residents turned to media to appeal for help. 'This is a disaster. There are a lot of elderly people who don’t have medicine. There are children who don’t have food. We don’t have milk, we don’t have water. We have no access to anything,' a resident of Alfafar, one of the most affected towns in south Valencia, told state television station TVE. 'No one even came to warn us on the first day.' So far 158 bodies have been recovered — 155 in Valencia, two in the Castilla La Mancha region and one more in Andalusia — after Spain's deadliest natural disaster in living memory. Members of the security forces and soldiers are busy searching for an unknown number of missing people, many feared to still be trapped in wrecked vehicles or flooded garages. And as authorities repeat over and over, more storms are expected. The Spanish weather agency issued alerts for strong rains in Tarragona, Catalonia, as well as part of the Balearic Islands. Meanwhile, flood survivors and volunteers are engaged in the titanic task of clearing an omnipresent layer of dense mud. Residents in communities like Paiporta, where at least 62 people died, and Catarroja, have been walking kilometers (miles) to Valencia to get provisions, passing neighbors from unaffected areas who are bringing carry water, essential products or shovels to help remove the mud. Juan Ramón Adsuara, the mayor of Alfafar, one of the hardest hit towns, said the aid isn't nearly enough for residents trapped in an 'extreme situation.' 'There are people living with corpses at home. It’s very sad. We are organizing ourselves, but we are running out of everything,' he told reporters. 'We go with vans to Valencia, we buy and we come back, but here we are totally forgotten.' Rushing water turned narrow streets into death traps and spawned rivers that tore through homes and businesses, leaving many uninhabitable. Social networks have channeled the needs of those affected. Some posted images of missing people in the hope of getting information about their whereabouts, while others launched initiatives such as Suport Mutu — or Mutual Support — which connects requests for help with people who are offering it; and others organized collections of basic goods throughout all the country or launched fundraisers. Spain’s Mediterranean coast is used to autumn storms that can cause flooding, but this was the most powerful flash flooding in recent memory. Scientists link it to climate change, which is also behind increasingly high temperatures and droughts in Spain and the heating up of the Mediterranean Sea. Human-caused climate change has doubled the likelihood of a storm like this week’s deluge in Valencia, according to a partial analysis issued Thursday by World Weather Attribution, a group made up of dozens of international scientists who study global warming’s role in extreme weather. Spain has suffered through an almost two-year drought, making the flooding worse because the dry ground was so hard that it could not absorb the rain.

Greek police say fatal Athens apartment blast was likely caused by improvised bomb	ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Greek police said Friday that an explosion in an Athens apartment that killed a man and severely wounded a woman appeared to have been caused by an improvised bomb. Police searching the wrecked apartment seized two handguns and ammunition, authorities said in a statement, as well as mobile phones and other 'digital evidence.' The statement added that the blast is being investigated by the police’s special violent crimes unit. Firefighters who responded to the explosion Thursday afternoon freed the wounded woman from the wreckage, and later found the man’s body while using sniffer dogs to search the apartment for other survivors, the fire service said. The injured woman is Greek, police said, while the dead man has not been identified. No further details on her identity were released. The explosion in the capital’s central residential neighborhood of Ambelokipi demolished internal and external walls in a third-floor apartment, blowing away its balcony railings and damaging neighboring apartments. Greece has a decades-long history of far-left extremism involving small urban groups, while organized crime and racketeering groups have also carried out small-scale bombings and targeted killings. The major extremist groups that carried out a string of assassinations from the mid 1970s to the early 2000s have been eradicated and their members jailed. They were succeeded by smaller and less efficient groups which mostly staged bomb attacks on symbols of state authority and wealth but have been largely dormant in recent years.	https://apnews.com/article/greece-apartment-blast-investigation-bomb-d5e33088eb3fa578b3eeea64a67cf9b3	2024-11-01T01:04:56-07:00	
Colm McLoughlin, Irishman who led Dubai Duty Free to become an airport retail giant, dies at age 81	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Colm McLoughlin, an Irishman who landed in the deserts of the United Arab Emirates and helped lead Dubai Duty Free into becoming an airport retail behemoth generating billions of dollars, has died. He was 81. McLoughlin ran Dubai Duty Free from 1983 until he retired earlier this year, a span of over 40 years that saw Dubai grow from a creekside trading port into a modern metropolis, home to the world's tallest building and other attractions. And all the millions of passengers coming into Dubai International Airport, now the world's busiest for international travel, saw the rows of electronics, cigarettes, cigars, alcohol and other goods available duty-free at his stores, hawked by a salesforce in green suit jackets, yellow ties and conversing in multiple languages. 'It’s a very Middle Eastern kind of thing,' McLoughlin told the Los Angeles Times in 1987 as he showed off its gold market. 'We have to cater to a lot of tastes.' Dubai Duty Free said in a statement that McLoughlin died Wednesday after a short illness, without elaborating. The operation's new managing director, Ramesh Cidambi, praised McLoughlin for steering its 'growth to a $2 billion dollar business with over 6,000 employees at the time of his retirement.' Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, the CEO of long-haul carrier Emirates and chairman of Dubai Duty Free, offered his condolences. 'His passion, commitment and pioneering spirit have left a lasting legacy,' Sheikh Ahmed said in a post on the social platform X. Born in Ballinasloe, Ireland, in 1943, McLoughlin joined Shannon Airport's first-in-the-world duty-free operation in 1969. In July 1983, he came with a 10-man team to Dubai to set up the sandy airport's duty-free operation. His six-month contract ended up stretching into 40 years. Like the rest of the aviation industry, Dubai Duty Free took a hit during the years of the coronavirus pandemic and airline groundings. But sales have since bounced back. In 2023 alone, under McLoughlin, Dubai Duty Free sold 6 million cans of beer, 2.3 million bottles of whiskey, 2.3 million cartons of cigarettes, 10.2 million cigars and 3.3 million bottles of perfume. One big segment has been Chinese travelers, after Dubai Duty Free worked to accept their credit cards, had staff speaking Mandarin and put in goods they wanted. 'We would be silly if we didn’t take advantage of it and try to serve them,' McLoughlin told The Associated Press in 2012. And many a bleary-eyed traveler in Dubai's cavernous airport tried their luck at the constant raffles being offered, whether for $1 million, a luxury automobile or a racing motorcycle. McLoughlin also was known for Dubai Duty Free's sponsorship of tennis and golf tournaments, as well as his work supporting Dubai's Irish community. He received the Irish Presidential Distinguished Service Award in 2014. 'Colm McLoughlin has been an integral part of the Irish community in the UAE,' his award citation read. 'Both in his highly successful professional career with Dubai Duty Free and in his leadership roles across almost every Irish organization, Colm McLouglin has played a hugely positive role in the promotion of Irish interests in the UAE.' McLoughlin is survived by his wife Breeda, son Niall, daughters Tyna and Mandy, and their families.	https://apnews.com/article/colm-mcloughlin-obituary-dubai-duty-free-emirates-uae-82a1855bcc19735262f8645cc6a86b93	2024-11-01T00:34:15-07:00	
Algeria pardons and releases journalist Ihsane El Kadi	ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) — Algeria has pardoned a journalist who emerged as a key voice during the country’s 2019 pro-democracy protests and was later imprisoned for taking foreign funding for his media outlets and threatening state security. Ihsane El Kadi was released from prison on Thursday evening, along with eight others who were imprisoned after criticizing the state. Their release coincided with the 70th anniversary of the start of Algeria's revolution, a date that authorities have in the past used as an occasion to offer pardons. Fetta Saddat, one of El Kadi's lawyers, told The Associated Press that he was released from El Harrah prison after receiving a presidential pardon. He had been serving a sentence for receiving foreign financing for Radio M and Maghreb Emergent, two media projects that were key outlets during the Hirak protests that led to the resignation of octogenarian president Abdelaziz Bouteflika in 2019. He was among 4,000 released on Thursday based on clemency decrees signed by President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, according to a statement from his office. Those released included people imprisoned for low level crimes and for 'undermining public order,' a charge that Algerian authorities have used to target dissidents in the past.	https://apnews.com/article/algeria-journalist-pardon-el-kadi-cdbc754b51e40f09777cd944bf4bc1ab	2024-11-01T00:13:33-07:00	
Seismic change in Botswana as party that ruled for 58 years loses power	GABORONE, Botswana (AP) — Botswana's President Mokgweetsi Masisi conceded defeat in the general election Friday, in a seismic moment of change for the country that ended the ruling party's 58 years in power since independence from Britain in the 1960s. Masisi's concession came before final results were announced, with his Botswana Democratic Party trailing in fourth place in the parliamentary elections in what appeared to be a humbling rejection by voters and a landslide victory for the main opposition party. The opposition Umbrella for Democratic Change held an overwhelming lead in the partial results, making its candidate, Duma Boko, the favorite to become president of a southern African country that is one of the world's biggest producers of mined diamonds. Masisi said he had called Boko to inform him he was conceding defeat and said that Boko was now effectively the president-elect. Final results were expected to be announced later Friday, but the BDP had no path to a majority. 'I concede the election,' Masisi said in an early-morning press conference two days after the vote. 'I am proud of our democratic processes. Although I wanted a second term, I will respectfully step aside and participate in a smooth transition process.' 'I look forward to attending the coming inauguration and cheering on my successor. He will enjoy my support.' Masisi's BDP dominated politics in Botswana for nearly six decades, since independence in 1966. The nation of just 2.5 million people will now be governed by another party for the first time in its democratic history. So far, the Umbrella for Democratic Change has won 25 out of the 61 parliamentary seats decided by voters, according to the official partial count. It needs 31 to clinch a majority. The Botswana Congress Party has seven seats, the Botswana Patriotic Front five seats, and the ruling BDP just three. 'We lost this election massively,' Masisi said. Botswana has been held up as one of Africa's most stable democracies and is regarded as a post-colonial success story having built one of the highest standards of living in the region through an economy that largely relies on diamonds. Botswana is the world's second biggest natural diamond producer behind Russia and has been responsible for all the biggest diamonds found in the last decade. But Botswana faces new challenges and the mood for change became evident as a downturn in the global demand for diamonds badly impacted the economy, becoming the central issue for the campaign. Unemployment rose to more than 27% this year, and significantly higher for young people, as the government saw a sharp decrease in revenue from diamonds. Masisi and his party had faced criticism for not having done enough to diversify the economy and the nation has been forced to adopt recent austerity measures. Even the BDP conceded throughout its campaign that policy change was needed and tried to convince voters it was capable of leading the country out of its economic troubles. Diamonds account for more than 80% of Botswana's exports and a quarter of its GDP, according to the World Bank. Masisi said the country had hardly sold any diamonds since April through its Debswana company, which the government jointly owns with diamond miner De Beers. Botswana's general elections decide the makeup of its Parliament, and lawmakers then choose the president. The party that gains a majority is in position to choose its candidate as president. All five of Botswana's post-independence presidents have been from the BDP. Boko is a 54-year-old lawyer and Harvard Law School graduate who also ran in 2014 and 2019. He posted on his official page on X: 'Botswana First' with a picture of a UDC campaign poster with the words 'Change is Here.' The BDP was one of the longest-serving parties in Africa still in power and its sharp defeat came as a surprise after what was expected to be a tight race. It followed an equally momentous change in neighboring South Africa, where the long-ruling African National Congress lost its 30-year majority in an election in May and was forced to share power for the first time in a coalition government. Masisi, a 63-year-old former high school teacher and UNICEF employee, said he had not expected the results and had 'not packed a shoe.' ___ This story has been updated to correct the spelling of President Mokgweetsi Masisi's first name. ___ AP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa	https://apnews.com/article/botswana-election-masisi-concedes-80951b62fdb7169f073c2b13acaff1b6	2024-10-31T22:31:07-07:00	
Middle East latest: Israel pounds Beirut suburb Dahiyeh with airstrikes overnight	Israel’s air force pounded Beirut’s southern suburb of Dahiyeh overnight, destroying dozens of buildings in several neighborhoods, Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency said Friday. There was no immediate word on casualties. Recently, Israel has intensified its airstrikes on the northeastern city of Baalbek and nearby villages, as well as different parts of southern Lebanon. International mediators are ramping up efforts to halt the wars in Lebanon and the Gaza Strip, circulating new proposals to wind down the regional conflict. Lebanon’s Heath Ministry said more than 2,800 people have been killed and 13,000 wounded since Oct. 8, 2023, when Hezbollah began firing rockets almost daily into Israel, drawing retaliation. The death toll from more than a year of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza has passed 43,000, Palestinian officials reported this week, without distinguishing between civilians and combatants. The war began after Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. ___ Here’s the latest: An Israeli airstrike on the edge of Qamatiyeh in Lebanon kills 3 and wounds 5 BERIUT — Lebanon’s Health Ministry says an Israeli airstrike on a mountain town overlooking Beirut has killed three people and wounded five. The ministry gave no further details about the early Friday airstrike on the edge of Qamatiyeh, southeast of Beirut. An Associated Press journalist who visited the scene said the strike was closer to the nearby village of Ein al-Rummaneh, adding that it caused minor damage to an apartment on the first floor of a building. On Oct. 6, an Israeli strike in Qamatiyeh killed six people, including three children, Lebanon’s Health Ministry said. Thailand tells Israel not to allow workers to enter closed military zones after 4 are killed in northern Israel BANGKOK — The employer of the Thai workers killed and injured in northern Israel had received permission from the Israeli military to bring the workers to the area for about 1-2 hours, said Nikorndej Balankura, spokesperson of Thailand’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, adding Friday that the employer was also killed. The worker who was injured was in serious condition and was being treated at a hospital in Haifa, he said, and the Thai embassy was already in touch with the families of the deceased. Projectiles fired Thursday from Lebanon into northern Israel killed seven people, including four Thai workers, in the deadliest such attack since Israeli troops invaded Lebanon in early October. Israel’s northernmost town, Metula is surrounded by Lebanon on three sides and has sustained heavy damage from rockets. The town’s residents evacuated in October 2023, and only security officials and agricultural workers remain there. Nikorndej said Thailand has called on Israel to refrain from granting permissions for Thai workers to enter closed military zones from now on, to prevent such losses from happening again. 'Thailand reiterates its call on all conflicting parties to immediately cease any retaliatory actions to prevent the situation from prolonging and aggravating, and to restore regional peace and stability in the Middle East region,' he said. Israel pounds Beirut suburb overnight with airstrikes BEIRUT — Israel’s air force resumed airstrikes on Beirut’s southern suburb, destroying buildings in several neighborhoods, Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency said Friday. There was no immediate word on casualties. The early Friday airstrikes on Dahiyeh — after a four-day lull during which no airstrikes were reported in the suburb — destroyed dozens of buildings and caused fires in the area, the agency said. In recent days, Israel has intensified its airstrikes on the northeastern city of Baalbek and nearby villages, as well as different parts of southern Lebanon.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-hezbollah-mideast-latest-1-november-2024-6ea222bd6dbe87123934833e92626aeb	2024-10-31T22:17:14-07:00	
Australian judge rules senator broke race law by telling rival legislator to return to Pakistan	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — An Australian judge ruled Friday that anti-immigration party leader Sen. Pauline Hanson breached a racial anti-discrimination law by crudely telling Pakistan-born Sen. Mehreen Faruqi to return to her homeland. Faruqi sued Hanson in Federal Court over a 2022 exchange on the social media platform X, then called Twitter, under a provision of the Racial Discrimination Act that bans public actions and statements that offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate people because of their race, color or national or ethnic origin. After the death of Queen Elizabeth II, Faruqi, deputy leader of the Australian Greens party, posted, 'I cannot mourn the leader of a racist empire built on stolen lives, land and wealth of colonized peoples.' Hanson, the leader of the One Nation party, replied that Faruqi had immigrated to take 'advantage' of Australia, and told the Lahore-born Muslim to return to Pakistan, using an expletive. Hanson has been known for her views on race since her first speech to Parliament in 1996, in which she said Australia was 'in danger of being swamped by Asians' because of its non-discriminatory immigration policy. She once wore a burqa in the Senate as part of a campaign to have Islamic face coverings banned. Faruqi, a trained engineer, moved to Australia with her husband in 1992 as skilled economic migrants. Justice Angus Stewart found that Hanson had engaged in 'seriously offensive' and intimidating behavior. The post was racist, nativist and anti-Muslim, Stewart said. 'It is a strong form of racism,' he said. Stewart ordered Hanson to delete the offensive post and pay Faruqi’s legal costs, saying they would 'amount to a fairly substantial sum.' Faruqi welcomed the ruling as a vindication for 'every single person who has been told to go back to where they came from. And believe me, there are too many of us who have been subjected to this ultimate racist slur, far too many times in this country.' 'Today’s ruling tells us that telling someone to go back to where they came from is a strong form of racism,' Faruqi told reporters. 'Today is a good day for people of color, for Muslims and all of us who have been working so hard to build an anti-racist society,' she said. The Australian Muslim Advocacy Network, a human and civil rights organization representing the 3.2% of Australians who identified as Muslim in the latest census, said the ruling 'serves as a strong warning to those who perpetrate racism in politics and the media.' Hanson said she was 'deeply disappointed' by the ruling and would appeal. The verdict demonstrated an 'inappropriately broad application' of the section of the Racial Discrimination Act that she was found to have breached, particularly in how that section impinged upon freedom of political expression, Hanson said in a statement. Hanson’s lawyers argued that that her post was exempt from the law because of constitutionally implied freedom of political communication. Hanson said she considered the queen’s death a matter of public interest and that Faruqi’s views on the death were also a matter of public interest. Stewart found that Hanson’s tweet did not respond to any point made in Faruqi’s tweet. 'Sen. Hanson’s tweet was merely an angry ad hominem attack devoid of discernible content (or comment) in response to what Sen. Faruqi had said,' Stewart wrote in his decision. Stewart described Hanson’s testimony as 'generally unreliable,' rejecting her claim that she did not know Faruqi’s religion when she posted her response. Hanson told the court she had called for a ban on Muslim immigration in the past, but described that as her personal opinion rather than her minor party’s policy. She conceded she had once said in a media interview she would not sell her house to a Muslim, but would not say whether she had meant what she had said. Australia is an increasingly multicultural society. Australians born overseas or who have at least one overseas-born parent became a majority in the latest census in 2021.	https://apnews.com/article/australia-racial-discrimination-pakistan-pauline-hanson-mehreen-faruqi-3a4bfbf4f3c3051bd55da6f89f59419a	2024-10-31T21:21:08-07:00	
Stock market today: Global stocks are mixed after a sharp decline on Wall St driven by Big Tech	HONG KONG (AP) — European markets opened higher while Asian stocks were mostly lower on Friday, with Japan's benchmark Nikkei losing over 2% after a sharp decline on Wall Street. France’s CAC 40 added 0.4% in early trading to 7,377.79, and Germany’s DAX gained 0.2% to 19,116.71. Britain’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.4% to 8,143.82. Dow futures edged up 0.1% to 42,004.00, and S&amp;P 500 futures were up 0.3% at 5,753.00. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 sank 2.6% to 38,053.67. On Thursday, the Bank of Japan announced it would keep its benchmark rate unchanged at 0.25%, ​​which was in line with market expectations. The Japanese yen traded lower Friday. The dollar rose to 152.61 Japanese yen from 152.00 yen. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was the exception to Friday's downturn vibe. It added 0.9% to 20,506.43, while the Shanghai Composite index was up in morning trading but slipped 0.2% later in the day to close at 3,272.01. Factory activity in China went back into growth in October, with the official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index released Thursday reaching 50.1, ending five straight months of contraction. Another private survey Friday showed a reading of 50.3, above the expansion line of 50. Australia’s S&amp;P/ASX 200 dropped 0.5% to 8,118.80 after its producer price index in the third quarter rose 3.9% year-on-year — a return to below 4.0% annual growth for the first time since September 2023, according to data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Elsewhere, South Korea’s Kospi lost 0.5% to 2,543.36. Taiwan’s Taiex fell 0.2%, weighed down by a 0.5% decline in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp., Apple's chip supplier. Apple’s quarterly earnings report Thursday revealed a drop in sales revenue from China. On Thursday, the S&amp;P 500 sank 1.9% to 5,705.45 for its worst day in eight weeks, falling further from its record set earlier in October. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.9% to 41,763.46, while the Nasdaq composite tumbled 2.8% to 18,095.15 for a second-straight loss after setting its latest all-time high. The tumble for Big Tech on the last day of October wiped out the S&amp;P 500’s gain for the month. The index fell 1% for its first down month in the past six, even though it set an all-time high during that period. In the bond market, Treasury yields edged lower following a mixed set of reports on the U.S. economy. One report said a measure of inflation that the Federal Reserve likes to use slowed to 2.1% in September from 2.3%. That’s almost all the way back to the Fed’s 2% target, though underlying trends — after ignoring food and energy costs — were a touch hotter than economists expected. A separate report said growth in workers’ wages and benefits slowed during the summer. That could put less pressure on upcoming inflation. A third report, meanwhile, said fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits the previous week. That’s an indication that the number of layoffs remains relatively low across the country. Treasury yields bobbed up and down several times after the reports, before moving lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.27% from 4.30% late Wednesday. That’s still up sharply from the roughly 3.60% level it was at in the middle of September. In other dealings, U.S. benchmark crude oil gained $2.03 to $71.29 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard, surged $1.82 to $74.63 per barrel.

Israel fights a seemingly endless war in Gaza's most devastated region	JERUSALEM (AP) — More than a year into a war that has ricocheted across the Middle East, Israeli troops are still battling Hamas in the most heavily destroyed and isolated part of the Gaza Strip. In northern Gaza, Hamas militants carry out hit-and-run attacks from bombed-out buildings. Residents say Israeli forces have raided shelters for the displaced, forcing people out at gunpoint. First responders say they can barely operate because of the Israeli bombardment. Since its Oct. 7 attack into Israel that sparked the war in Gaza, Hamas has taken heavy losses. The recent killing of its top leader, Yahya Sinwar, was viewed as a possible turning point, yet the two sides do not appear any closer to a cease-fire, and Hamas, which still holds scores of hostages, remains the dominant power in Gaza. The conflict has drawn in militants from Lebanon to Yemen, and their key sponsor, Iran, has inched closer to all-out war with Israel. But in northern Gaza, the war seems stuck in a loop of devastating Israeli offensives, followed by Hamas fighters regrouping. Israel is once again ordering mass evacuations, severely restricting aid despite global outrage and raiding hospitals it says are used by militants. In the northern border town of Beit Lahiya — one of the first targets of last year’s ground invasion — two Israeli strikes this week killed at least 88 Palestinians, including dozens of women and children. The military said its target was a spotter on the roof. As the war grinds on, Israel is resorting to ever more draconian measures. There is even talk of adopting a surrender-or-starve strategy proposed by former generals. On Monday, Israel passed legislation that could severely restrict the U.N. agency that is the largest aid provider in Gaza despite protests by the United States and other close allies. It accuses the agency of allowing itself to be infiltrated by Hamas, allegations denied by the U.N. Another offensive, as Hamas keeps filling the void Israel launched its latest offensive in northern Gaza in early October, focusing on Jabaliya, a crowded, decades-old urban refugee camp where it says Hamas had regrouped. Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted another 250 that day. Israel’s offensive has killed over 43,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health authorities, who do not say how many were combatants but say more than half were women and children. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence, and the United States says Hamas is no longer capable of mounting an Oct. 7-style attack. But Israeli forces have repeatedly returned to areas where they had battled before — only to face renewed attacks. At least 16 Israeli soldiers have been killed in northern Gaza since the latest operation began, including a 41-year-old colonel. Israel has yet to lay out a plan for postwar Gaza and has rejected a U.S. push for the Western-backed Palestinian Authority to return and govern with Arab support. Plainclothes Hamas security men still patrol most areas. 'It’s endless war,' said Michael Milshtein, a former Israeli military intelligence officer who now leads a Palestinian studies program at Tel Aviv University. He says Israel has only two options to break the cycle: Either completely reoccupy Gaza, which would require several thousand troops to be stationed there indefinitely. Or secure a cease-fire with Hamas that involves the release of its hostages in exchange for Palestinians in Israeli jails, and a full Israeli withdrawal — the kind of deal that has long eluded U.S. and Arab mediators. 'We are in Jabaliya for the fourth time, and maybe in the next month we will find ourselves there for the fifth and the sixth.' he said. ‘Leave now’ if you care about the lives of your children Around a million people fled the north, including Gaza City, when Israel ordered its wholesale evacuation at the start of the war. They have not been allowed to return. Some 400,000 have remained, even as Israel has encircled the area and obliterated entire neighborhoods and critical infrastructure. The U.N. says at least 60,000 people have fled to Gaza City in recent weeks from Jabaliya and the northern border towns of Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya. Residents who remain describe being stuck in their homes for days at a time because of the fighting, with bodies rotting in the streets and rescue teams unable to venture out. Amna Mustafa and her children were asleep before dawn in a crowded school-turned-shelter in Beit Lahiya last week when an Israeli drone hovering overhead ordered everyone to evacuate. 'If you care about your life and the lives of your children, leave now,' it said. She said men were ordered to strip down and taken away in trucks. The military says it makes every effort to avoid harming civilians, and that such procedures are used to search and detain militants who it says hide among civilians. Women and children were ordered to walk to a nearby hospital, where Israeli soldiers searched them before allowing most to walk onward to Gaza City, several miles (kilometers) to the south. Mustafa said she spent two nights in the open before moving into a new tent camp in a soccer field. 'There is no food, no water, no blankets, no diapers and no milk for the children,' she said. 'We are here waiting for God’s mercy.' The Israeli military shared drone footage of a similar exodus, showing thousands of people walking down a plowed up road past tanks. It said Hamas had prevented them from leaving before its forces arrived, without providing evidence. The U.N. human rights office warned earlier this month that Israel 'may be causing the destruction of the Palestinian population in Gaza’s northernmost governate through death and displacement.' Israel restricts aid despite U.S. warnings Israel has severely restricted aid to Gaza in October, allowing in only about a third of the humanitarian assistance that entered the previous month. Alia Zaki, a spokesperson for the World Food Program, said Israel has not allowed U.N. agencies to deliver aid to the north outside of Gaza City since the latest offensive began. Col. Elad Goren, a spokesperson for COGAT, the Israeli military body in charge of civilian affairs in Gaza, attributed the lack of aid in the first half of the month to Jewish holiday closures and troop movements. At a briefing last week, he said there was no need for aid deliveries in Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya because there was 'no population' left in either town. That was before this week’s strikes on Beit Lahiya killed scores of people. The Biden administration has told Israel to increase the supply of aid entering Gaza, warning it of U.S. laws that could require it to reduce its crucial military support. Does Israel plan to empty the north? Palestinians fear Israel is carrying out a strategy proposed by former generals in which aid to the north would be cut off, civilians would be ordered to leave and anyone remaining would be branded a militant. Rights groups say the plan would violate international law. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who visited the region last week for the 11th time since the start of the war, said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told him that Israel had not adopted the plan. The military has denied receiving such orders. But the Israeli government has not publicly repudiated the plan, even after Blinken’s visit. Milshtein says the fact that Israel is even considering it is 'a post-traumatic phenomenon' born of desperation. 'Many people in the (Israeli military) know it’s a bad idea... But they say: ’OK, we don’t have any other plan, so let’s try it.' ___ Magdy reported from Cairo and Krauss from Dubai, United Arab Emirates. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-northern-gaza-displacement-aid-20628253b26a2bdcf3c844850f20da38	2024-10-31T21:01:18-07:00	
Taiwanese driver recounts his narrow escape during Typhoon Kong-rey	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — A ride-hailing driver recounted Friday how he had narrow escape when a huge tree smashed onto his vehicle as Typhoon Kong-rey swept over Taiwan, also sweeping away metal roofs and sending landslides onto roads and railway tracks and into houses. Song Zi-jie had just dropped off riders in Taipei, the capital city, and was stopped at a red light on Thursday night when a tree was uprooted and fell squarely onto the passenger compartment of his car. He felt the roof hit his head and reclined his seat but couldn’t open the rear door. He lay there until police found him. 'I was so frightened that I didn’t know what to do,' said Song, who wasn’t injured despite the extensive damage to his vehicle. 'It took me a while to return to normal.' Two people died, four people are missing and 580 others were injured by Kong-rey in Taiwan. It weakened to a tropical storm after leaving the island but was still bringing heavy rain and windy conditions to Shanghai and nearby parts of China’s east coast on Friday. Kong-rey, which is a Cambodian name, was heading northeast along the coast with winds of 83 kilometers (52 miles) per hour and could make landfall in Zhejiang province before veering back out to sea, the National Meteorological Center said. Zhejiang authorities evacuated about 280,000 people and opened more than 10,000 emergency shelters ahead of the storm, the official Xinhua News Agency said. Both Zhejiang and neighboring Fujian province also suspended multiple ferry routes. In Taiwan, a Czech couple who had gone missing while hiking in the mountains were found and airlifted out of Taroko National Park by helicopter on Friday. They told Taiwanese TV network EBC that they hadn't been aware of the approaching typhoon but were able to call for help with their mobile phones and mostly stayed in their tent until rescuers arrived. The two fatalities in Taiwan were a man hit by a utility pole that fell over when a tree dragged down nearby power lines in Taipei and a Thai woman who was in a small truck that was hit by a tree. Workers cut and cleared up fallen trees in Taipei on Friday, while schools and offices largely reopened and public services were gradually restored across Taiwan. The typhoon passed north of the Philippines earlier in the week, prompting fresh evacuations just days after devastating Tropical Storm Trami killed at least 145 people. Intense rainfall and flooding caused in part by Trami also killed seven people in China and eight people in Vietnam this week, Xinhua reported. The deaths in China were in Hainan province, a southern island known for its beach resorts. ___ Moritsugu reported from Beijing.

Pets join Mexico's Day of the Dead celebrations, as Fido and Tiger get their own altars	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Pets are not forgotten during Mexico's famed Day of the Dead celebrations, when even Fido and Tiger get a place at the altars Mexican families set up to honor their deceased loved ones, complete with flowers, candles and photographs. Though the human dead usually get their favorite food or drink placed on altars, the nature of pet food can make things a little different. The holiday has roots in Mexican pre-Hispanic customs, as does the reverence for animals. The small, hairless dogs that Mexicans kept before the Spanish conquest were believed to help guide their owners to the afterlife, and were sometimes given special burials. But the inclusion of pets on family altars has grown in recent years. Day of the Dead begins Oct. 31, to remember those humans who died in accidents; it continues Nov. 1 to mark those who died in childhood and then Nov. 2 to those who died as adults. Observances include entire families cleaning and decorating graves, which are covered with orange marigolds. At both cemeteries and at home altars, relatives light candles, put out offerings of the favorite foods and beverages of their deceased relatives. The presence of pets has gained such momentum that now Oct. 27 is considered Day of the Dead for pets and the National Anthropology and History Institute includes tips on its social platforms for how to include them in altars. Mexico City graphic designer Meztli Lizaola makes sure every year that her beloved tawny-coated Chihuahua, Taco — who died two years ago — has a place at the altar on a table in the corner of her living room. Taco's ashes are there in an urn, and so is his lively-eyed photo, next to a photo of Lizaola's deceased father. The orange-flowered cempasúchil — a type of marigold — is placed around the photos, as well as candles and figurines of skulls. Taco was an omnivorous eater and — as his name suggests — enjoyed tacos (especially roast pork) and other traditional Mexican human foods like quesadillas and concha pastries. But because she has four other dogs, she can't leave Taco's favorite foods on the altar; some sneaky pup is likely to snatch it. For years now, elements of Halloween have been mixing into the seasonal festivities, and for pets it's no different. For those who still have living dogs and cats, it is not uncommon to find a wide variety of pet Halloween costumes at pet shops, including inmate-style 'bad dog' costumes. Ethnohistorian Juan Pablo García Urióstegui says the inclusion of pets and Halloween influences are part of changes in the traditional holiday that have accelerated, particularly in the last three years, 'We are experiencing changes in the traditions. It is happening very fast,' said García Urióstegui, of Mexico's National Anthropology Museum. Now it's not unusual to find pets on airplanes, in bars and restaurants or even at their owners' medical appointments. For one thing, especially in big cities, the large family of numerous children is often a thing of the past, and couples having only pets — dubbed 'perrihijos' or 'dog kids' — are now not uncommon. 'That's where you see these practices concerning death starting to take hold,' he said. 'They are no longer just another companion ... they are living beings who hold memories, and whose memory must be commemorated.' But the admiration for dogs goes way back in Mexico, where hairless dogs known as xoloitzcuintles were common before the Spanish brought their larger, furrier hounds to Mexico during the 1519-1521 conquest. The pre-Hispanic dogs were often sacrificed or buried near their owners — or represented as carefully crafted ceramic figurines — because the owner would need the dogs' keen senses to find the path to the underworld after death. Lizaola still feels Taco's absence. His face is tattooed on her right arm. The dog changed her life and that of her partner. 'There's like a before and after in my life,' she said, noting that Taco inspired them to get more involved in supporting abandoned animals and rescuing dogs from the street. Initially, there was some resistance within her family to including Taco on the altar, a place long reserved for departed family members. But as relatives' pets died they came around and 'now it's more dogs than humans,' she said.	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-day-of-dead-pets-dogs-cats-altars-57c8f08990fc12f454ce14bb995fd160	2024-10-31T20:52:44-07:00	
North Korea boasts of its new long-range missile targeting the US	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea on Friday bragged of its recently tested new intercontinental ballistic missile, calling it 'the world’s strongest,' a claim viewed by outside experts as propaganda though the test showed an advancement in the North's quest to build a more reliable weapons arsenal. A missile launched by North Korea on Thursday flew higher and stayed in the air for a longer duration than any other weapon the country had so far fired. It signaled that the North has achieved progress in acquiring a nuclear-armed ICBM that can hit the U.S. mainland. But foreign experts assess that the country has still a few remaining technological issues to master before acquiring such a functioning ICBM. On Friday, the North’s Korean Central News Agency identified the missile as 'Hwasong-19' ICBM and called it 'the world’s strongest strategic missile' and 'the perfected weapon system.' KCNA said leader Kim Jong Un observed the launch, describing it as 'an appropriate military action' to express North Korea’s resolve to respond to its enemies’ moves that escalated tensions and threats to North Korea’s national security. It said Kim thanked weapons scientists for demonstrating North Korea’s 'matchless strategic nuclear attack capability.' South Korea’s military earlier said that North Korea could have tested a solid-fueled missile but Friday’s KCNA dispatch didn’t say what propellant the Hwasong-19 ICBM uses. Observers say the color of exhaust flames seen in North Korean media photos on the launch still suggest the new ICBM uses solid fuels. Before Thursday’s test, North Korea’s most advanced ICBM was known as the 'Hwasong-18' missile which uses solid fuels. Pre-loaded solid propellants make it easier to move missiles and require much less launch preparation times than liquid propellants that must be fueled before liftoffs. So it’s more difficult for opponents to detect launches by solid-fuel missiles. In recent years, North Korea has reported steady advancement in its efforts to obtain nuclear-tipped missiles. Many foreign experts believe North Korea likely has missiles that can deliver nuclear strikes on all of South Korea, but it has yet to possess nuclear missiles that can travel to the mainland U.S. There are questions on whether North Korea has acquired the technology to shield warheads from the high-temperature, high-stress environment of atmospheric reentry. Many foreign analysts say North Korea also must have improved altitude control and guidance systems for missiles. They say North Korea needs an ability to place multiple warheads on a single missile to defeat its rivals’ missile defenses. All of North Korea’s known ICBM tests, including Thursday’s, have been performed on steep angles to avoid neighboring countries. South Korean military spokesperson Lee Sung Joon said Thursday that a high-angel trajectory launch cannot verify a missile’s re-entry vehicle technology, though North Korea has previously claimed to have acquired that technology. Observers say that Thursday's launch, the North's first ICBM test in almost a year, was largely meant to grab American attention days before the U.S. presidential election and respond to international condemnation over North Korea's reported dispatch of troops to Russia to support its war against Ukraine. North Korea's reported troop dispatch highlights the expanding military cooperation between North Korea and Russia. South Korea. the U.S. and others worry North Korea might seek high-tech, sensitive Russian technology to perfect its nuclear and missile programs in return for joining the Russian-Ukraine war. __ Associated Press writer Kim Tong-hyung contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-missile-launch-united-states-4173ce128b8336b2cb315a3bf62c6980	2024-10-31T16:26:35-07:00	
US calls on a silent China to use its sway over Russia and North Korea	WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. and South Korea have called on China to use its influence over Russia and North Korea to prevent escalation after Pyongyang sent thousands of troops to Russia to aid Moscow's war against Ukraine. Beijing has so far stayed quiet. In a rare meeting earlier this week, three top U.S. diplomats met with China’s ambassador to the United States to emphasize U.S. concerns and urge China to use its sway with North Korea to try to curtail the cooperation, according to a State Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Thursday that the sides had 'a robust conversation just this week' and that China knows U.S. expectations are that 'they’ll use the influence that they have to work to curb these activities.' 'But I think this is a demand signal that’s coming not just from us, but from countries around the world,' he said at a news conference in Washington with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and their South Korean counterparts. Liu Pengyu, spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, said in a statement that China's position on the Ukraine crisis is 'consistent and clear.' China strives 'for peace talks and political settlement of the Ukraine crisis. This position remains unchanged. China will continue to play a constructive role to this end,' Liu said. The U.S. says 8,000 North Korean soldiers are in Russia near Ukraine’s border and are preparing to help the Kremlin fight against Ukrainian troops in the coming days. China has yet to publicly comment on the move. Beijing has forged a 'no limits' partnership with Moscow, and while it has also been a major ally for Pyongyang, experts say Beijing might not approve of the closer military partnership between Russia and North Korea because it sees it as destabilizing in the region. The Russia-North Korea partnership runs contrary to Beijing’s goal for a peaceful Korean Peninsula, said Shi Yinhong, an international relations expert at China’s Renmin University. Beijing is 'aware of the complexity and danger of the situation,' Shi said, noting that the 'fact that China hasn’t said anything yet on the military alliance agreement between North Korea and Russia indicates that China strongly disagrees with it.' Dennis Wilder, senior fellow for the Initiative for U.S.-China Dialogue on global issues at Georgetown University, called Beijing’s 'radio silence' on North Korea’s move 'staggering.' He said Beijing must find a balance between supporting Moscow and not angering the West, and that Chinese President Xi Jinping might 'for his own sake ignore the whole thing.' Xi has built a personal relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and 'he cannot see Putin fail,' Wilder said this week at a panel discussion hosted by the Washington-based think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies. At the same time, Xi cannot anger the Europeans and Americans when his country's economy is struggling, Wilder said. 'So he’s not going to say anything publicly about this,' Wilder said. Victor Cha, Korean chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said at the same panel discussion that for China, 'there’s probably a combination of a little bit of exasperation, a little bit of panic and a little bit of they don’t know what to do with regard to the current situation.' It’s unclear if Beijing was informed of Pyongyang's move in advance, Cha said. Beijing also could fret over Russia gaining more influence than China over North Korea, Cha said. Austin said Thursday that China 'should be asking Russia some hard questions at this point and whether it intends to broaden this conflict by this kind of behavior.' Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Dan Kritenbrink and Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs James O’Brien met with Chinese envoy Xie Feng in Washington on Tuesday, according to the State Department official, who would not detail the Chinese response. Lu Chao, director of the Institute of American and East Asian Studies at Liaoning University in China's northeastern province of Liaoning, said the U.S. should not expect China to manage North Korea. 'It is not the case that China is responsible to manage North Korea and the U.S. is responsible for managing South Korea,' Lu said. 'I hope the U.S. government could understand China’s stance.' Lu also said the troop deployment is 'a matter between Russia and North Korea,' while China’s attitude remains unchanged that the conflict should not be escalated. — AP researcher Yu Bing in Beijing contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/china-north-korea-russia-ukraine-united-states-0d28afb21d3afbdbb3cb9c29a945c3f5	2024-10-31T13:53:53-07:00	
Brazil judge gives 2 former cops long sentences for the 2018 murder of leftist icon Marielle Franco	RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — A judge on Thursday handed down long sentences to two former police officers for the 2018 murder of Rio de Janeiro city councilwoman Marielle Franco, an icon of Brazil’ s political left whose killing sparked outrage. Ronnie Lessa and Élcio de Queiroz were sentenced to almost 79 years and almost 60 years, respectively, for the March 14, 2018 drive-by shooting that killed Franco and her driver, Anderson Gomes. Jurors found that Lessa fired the gun and de Queiroz was the wheelman on the night of the crime. Lessa and de Queiroz, arrested in 2019, previously signed plea bargains confessing their roles, but the jury had final word on their guilt on homicide and other charges. The verdict, although expected, comes as a measure of solace to the many who saw the martyrdom of the Black, bisexual woman as an attack on democracy, and worried that the crime would go unpunished. The prosecutors had argued each man should be sentenced to the maximum possible 84 years for the three counts — double homicide, attempted homicide and driving a cloned vehicle. As Judge Lucia Glioche finished reading the sentence, applause erupted in the room as victims’ families began to cry. Marielle’s sister, Anielle Franco, Brazil’s minister for racial equality, held a long, tearful embrace with her parents and Marielle’s daughter, Luyara Franco. Her father rested his head on the chest of former congressman Marcelo Freixo, who was her political mentor. Brazilian law does not allow for life imprisonment, and each man will serve no more than 30 years of their sentences. Due to their sealed plea bargains, local media has reported that Queiroz and Lessa may serve 12 and 18 years in prison, respectively, including time already served. Prosecutors have denied their sentenced would be reduced. Either way, Thursday’s sentencing is seen as only a step toward justice being done, with another trial yet to come for the men accused of ordering her killing. They will also have to pay 706,000 reais ($122,000) in moral damages to several of the victims’ family members and provide an allowance to the young son of Gomes until he turns 24, according to a statement on the court's website. Known universally by her first name, Marielle, she was raised in one of Rio’s poor communities known as favelas. She became known for her efforts to improve the lives of ordinary residents. Following her election in 2016, she fought against violence targeting women while defending human rights and social programs. Testimony Wednesday during the first day of the trial offered details about the moments preceding and following the shooting. Franco’s assistant and friend who was also in the car, Fernanda Chaves, was among those giving testimony, as was Franco’s mother and her partner Mônica Benício. Choked up and often unable to talk, Benício said the last thing Marielle ever said to her was 'I love you.' 'We had plans to get married with a wedding party. When Marielle died, what I felt was that they had taken away our promise of the future,' she said, later adding that the right to a just city was one of Marielle’s causes. 'Marielle also defended the right to decent housing from the perspective of the favela, the periphery, this was the theme of the city’s rights agenda.' Both defendants participated in the trial by videoconference from prison. Lessa is in Sao Paulo while de Queiroz is in Brazil’s capital, Brasilia. Federal authorities started investigating the case in earnest once leftist President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva took office in 2023. With Lessa and de Queiroz sentenced, attention will now turn to the men accused of ordering the hit: two brothers with purported ties to criminal groups known as militias, which illegally charge residents for various services, including protection. Guilhermo Catramby, a Federal Police detective, told the court Wednesday that the assassination was 'undoubtedly' motivated by Marielle’s work regarding land rights, especially in the west side of Rio de Janeiro. Her work there was 'a thorn in the side of militia interests,' Catramby said. In March, Federal Police detained the two brothers, federal lawmaker Chiquinho Brazão and his brother Domingos Brazão, a member of Rio state’s accounts watchdog. They have denied any involvement in the killing or with militias and have yet to go on trial. In his plea bargain, Lessa told police that the politician brothers hired him and informed him that the then-chief of the state’s civil police, Rivaldo Barbosa, had signed off beforehand. Barbosa, who also denies any involvement, was arrested in March. Marielle’s family and Ágatha Arnaus, widow of Gomes, spoke to journalists after the trial. Holding hands, they said that while the conviction offered some reparation after years of struggle and pain, it was just the first step in a long journey toward justice. 'I wanted my mother here, but today will certainly go down in this country’s democratic history,' said Luyara, the councilwoman’s daughter, holding back tears. 'If the justice system had not convicted these two cruel murderers, we wouldn’t have a moment of peace. But this doesn’t end here,' said Antonio Francisco da Silva, Marielle’s father. 'There are those who ordered the crime. Now the question is: when will those who ordered it be convicted?' ___ Sá Pessoa reported from Sao Paulo.	https://apnews.com/article/brazil-marielle-franco-police-sentence-aa9871158cdbed497ce11c8e7e004513	2024-10-31T13:43:19-07:00

Greek anti-terror squad investigates big blast that killed a man in an Athens apartment	ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Greece's anti-terrorist squad is investigating a strong explosion on Thursday that wrecked an Athens apartment, killing a man and severely injuring a woman, police said. Police spokeswoman Constantina Dimoglidou said the identity of the victim was unknown, while the injured woman was not in a position to help authorities due to the gravity of her condition. She said explosives experts were investigating the scene of the explosion in an apartment block in the Greek capital's central district of Ambelokipi. A team of 23 firefighters who responded to the incident freed the injured woman from the wreckage. They used sniffer dogs to search the apartment for other survivors, later locating the man's body, the fire service said. Initial suspicions that the blast was caused by a gas leak were not confirmed. Authorities are now examining the possibility that an explosive device was inadvertently detonated in the flat. State-run ERT television reported that at least one handgun was found in the apartment. The explosion demolished internal and external walls in the third-floor apartment, blew away its balcony railings and damaged neighboring properties. Greece has a decades-old history of far-left extremism involving small urban groups. The major groups that carried out a string of assassinations from the mid 1970s to the early 2000s have been eradicated and their members jailed. They were succeeded by smaller and less efficient groups which mostly staged bomb attacks on symbols of state authority and wealth but had been largely dormant in recent years.	https://apnews.com/article/greece-athens-explosion-apartment-death-terrorism-police-71cb55f41c62aaeac0b854f61e546159	2024-10-31T11:22:31-07:00

Iraq's Parliament elects a new speaker to end a nearly yearlong vacuum	BAGHDAD (AP) — After a nearly yearlong vacuum, Iraq’s Parliament elected a new speaker Thursday, selecting a prominent Sunni lawmaker who has a close relationship with Iran. Mahmoud al-Mashhadani, who served a previous stint as speaker from 2006 to 2009, was elected by a vote of 182 of the 269 legislators who attended the session, a surprise move after months of deadlock between political factions. Former Speaker Mohammed al-Halbousi was dismissed by a Federal Supreme Court last November against the backdrop of a lawsuit filed by then-lawmaker Laith al-Dulaimi. Dulaimi claimed that the speaker had forged Dulaimi’s signature on a resignation letter, an allegation that Halbousi denied. The court ruled to terminate both Halbousi and al-Dulaimi from their parliamentary posts. It did not elaborate on why it was issuing the decision. The position of speaker of Parliament is assigned to a Sunni according to convention in Iraq’s power-sharing system, while the prime minister is always Shiite and the president is a Kurd. The speaker plays an important role in serving as an intermediary between the various political blocs and will be key to the government’s efforts to achieve economic reforms and reduce internal tensions. The election of a new parliament speaker comes at a time when Iraq is facing major challenges - chief among them, attempting to navigate the repercussions of the wars in the Middle East and to balance its relationship with Iran and the United States, which are backing opposing parties in the regional conflict. Iran-aligned political blocs and militias have significant power in Iraq. The militias have regularly launched drone attacks on bases housing U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria in retaliation for Washington’s support for Israel in its wars against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. In recent months they have also targeted sites in Israel directly. At the same time, Iraq’s government has sought to avoid alienating the U.S., upon which it has relied for economic and military support, including in the fight against the Islamic State militant group. The country also faces rampant corruption and internal divisions. Legislators from the pro-Iranian Shiite political bloc and from the Sunni bloc close to former Speaker Halbousi reached a compromise on al-Mashhadani, apparently in hopes that he will be able to build a consensus across political blocs. The new speaker will have to deal with some controversial legislation, notable a proposed amendment to Iraq’s personal status law governing family matters, which critics say would effectively legalize child marriage.	https://apnews.com/article/iraq-parliament-speaker-mashhadani-halbousi-d2f914397971c244a8421914c85fcedd	2024-10-31T11:18:42-07:00	
Climate change is making extreme downpours in Spain heavier and more likely, scientists say	Human-caused climate change made Spain’s rainfall about 12% heavier and doubled the likelihood of a storm as intense as this week’s deluge of Valencia, according to a rapid but partial analysis Thursday by World Weather Attribution, a group of international scientists who study global warming’s role in extreme weather. Monstrous flash floods in Spain claimed at least 158 lives, with 155 deaths confirmed in the eastern Valencia region alone. An unknown number of people are still missing and more victims could be found. Crews searched for bodies in stranded cars and sodden buildings Thursday. World Weather Attribution said climate change is the most likely explanation for extreme downpours in southern Spain, as a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture, leading to heavier downpours. The group noted its analysis is not a full, detailed attribution study, as the scientists did not use climate models to simulate the event in a world without human-caused warming. Scientists looked at historical observations of rainfall, which they say indicate that one-day bursts of rain in this region are increasing as emissions from the burning of fossil fuels warms the planet. 'We haven’t had time yet to do a full attribution study about the flooding that’s just taken place in Spain. But what we have been able to do is to look at observations of rainfall in the area,' said WWA expert Clair Barnes. 'And based on the recorded rainfall, we’ve estimated that similar events have become about 12% more intense, and probably about twice as likely as they would have been in a pre-industrial climate, about 1.3 degrees (Celsius) cooler, without human-caused climate change.' 'I’ve heard people saying that this is the new normal,' added Barnes, a statistician who researches extreme weather events and climate change at the Imperial College London. 'Given that we are currently on track for 2.6 degrees of warming, or thereabouts, within this century, we are only halfway to the new normal.' Since the mid-1800s, the world has already heated up by 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit), up from previous estimates of 1.1 or 1.2 degrees because it includes the record heat last year, according to the United Nations Environment Programme’s annual Emissions Gap Report released last week. The world is on pace to hit 3.1 degrees Celsius (5.6 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times. But if nations somehow do all of what they promised in targets they submitted to the U.N., that warming could be limited to 2.6 degrees Celsius (4.7 degrees Fahrenheit), the report said. Ben Clarke, a researcher at the Centre for Environmental Policy, Imperial College London, pointed out that a powerful typhoon made landfall in Taiwan on Thursday, just after the flooding in Spain. 'These back-to-back events show how dangerous climate change already is with just 1.3 degrees Celsius of warming,' Clarke said in a statement. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Flood survivors say regional Spanish officials waited too long to warn them of the danger	BARRIO DE LA TORRE, Spain (AP) — Moments after rushing waters burst through the door to her home, Mari Carmen Pérez received a text message alert from regional Spanish authorities warning her of the possibility of flash floods. By the time Pérez's phone buzzed, the water has already gushed into her kitchen, living room and bathroom, forcing her and her family to flee upstairs. 'They didn’t have any idea of what was going on,' Pérez, a 56-year-old cleaner, said Thursday by phone from Barrio de la Torre in Valencia. 'Everything is ruined. The people here, we have never seen anything like this.' She was one of the lucky ones. More than 150 people died, many trapped in cars or the ground floor of their homes, when storm-fed riverbeds burst their banks and swept through dozens of localities on the southern outskirts of Valencia city. The massive number of dead — easily making the floods the worst natural disaster in Spain in living memory — has raised questions about how this could happen in a European Union country that excels in public safety. As rescuers continued to pull bodies from the mud and debris Thursday, anger also began to grow among the families and friends mourning lost loved ones and many more thousands whose livelihoods have been shattered by the deluge. The streets were full of people walking to procure basic supplies with their cars ruined and the streets undrivable because of the mud and debris. The Valencian regional government is being criticized for not sending out flood warnings to mobile phones until 8 p.m. on Tuesday, when the flooding had already started in some places and well after the national weather agency issued a red alert indicating heavy rains. Valencia regional President Carlos Mazón, of the conservative Popular Party, defended his administration’s management of the crisis, saying 'all our supervisors followed the standard protocol' that was coordinated by Spain’s central government. Spain’s Interior Ministry said in a statement that regional administrations are responsible for sending alerts to warn the population of possible flooding and other natural disasters. Mazón is also under fire for his announcement at 1:00 p.m. on Tuesday that the storm front would 'lose strength' by 6:00 p.m. The opposite occurred. The size and violence of the extreme weather event was shocking and extremely difficult for any administration to prepare for and predict. But Valencia, on Spain’s Mediterranean coast, has a history of autumn storms that produce floods, albeit at a smaller magnitude than this monster of a storm. Spain’s national weather agency had alerted officials and the public via its website and social media on Sunday, two days before the tragedy struck, that there was a 70% chance of torrential rain ahead. The agency then issued a red alert, the highest level of warning, for bad weather as early as 7:30 a.m. on Tuesday morning as the disaster loomed. Andreu Salom, mayor of the Valencian village of L’Alcudia, told national broadcaster RTVE that his town lost at least two residents, a daughter and her elderly mother who lived together, and that police were still searching for a missing truck driver. He complained that he and his townsfolk had no warning of the disaster that struck when the Magro River overflowed. 'I myself was on my way to check the river level because I had no information,' Salom said. 'I went with the local police but we had to turn back because a tsunami of water, mud, reeds and dirt was already entering the town.' ___ Wilson reported from Barcelona, Spain.	https://apnews.com/article/spain-floods-what-went-wrong-33e385a9328f4040cb550441ffc85902	2024-10-31T09:59:02-07:00	
What to know about the unprecedented floods that killed at least 158 in Spain	MADRID (AP) — In a matter of minutes, flash floods caused by heavy downpours in eastern Spain on Tuesday swept away everything in their path. With no time to react, people were trapped in vehicles, homes and businesses. Many died and thousands saw livelihoods shattered. Two days later, authorities have recovered 158 bodies — 155 in the eastern Valencia region alone, two in Castilla La Mancha and one in Andalusia — and continue to search for an unknown number of missing people. People have begun to clean up the thick layers of mud that covered houses and streets full of debris, all while facing power and water cuts and shortages of some basic goods. Inside some of the vehicles that the water washed into piles or crashed into buildings, there were still bodies waiting to be identified. Here are a few things to know about Spain’s deadliest storm in living memory: What happened? The storms concentrated over the Magro and Turia river basins and, in the Poyo riverbed, produced walls of water that overflowed riverbanks, catching people unaware as they went on with their daily lives, with many coming home from work on Tuesday evening. In the blink of an eye, the muddy water covered roads, railways and entered houses and businesses in villages on the southern outskirts of Valencia city. Drivers, with their vehicles converted into boats, had to take shelter on car roofs, while residents tried to take refuge on higher ground. The downpour was stunning. Spain’s national weather service said that in the hard-hit locality of Chiva it rained more in eight hours than it had in the preceding 20 months, calling the deluge 'extraordinary.' When the authorities sent the alert to mobile phones warning of the seriousness of the phenomenon and asked them to stay at home, many were on the road, working or covered in water in low-lying areas or garages, which became death traps. Why did these massive flash floods happen? Scientists trying to explain what happened see two likely connections to human-caused climate change. One is that warmer air holds and then dumps more rain. The other is possible changes in the jet stream — the river of air above land that moves weather systems across the globe — that spawn extreme weather. Climate scientists and meteorologists said the immediate cause of the flooding is called a cut-off lower pressure storm system that migrated from an unusually wavy and stalled jet stream. That system simply parked over the region and poured rain. This happens often enough that in Spain they call them DANAs, the Spanish acronym for the system, meteorologists said. And then there is the unusually high temperature of the Mediterranean Sea. It had its warmest surface temperature on record in mid-August, at 28.47 degrees Celsius (83.25 degrees Fahrenheit), said Carola Koenig of the Centre for Flood Risk and Resilience at Brunel University of London. The extreme weather event came after Spain battled with prolonged droughts in 2022 and 2023. Experts say that drought and flood cycles are increasing with climate change. Has this happened before? Spain’s Mediterranean coast is used to autumn storms that can cause flooding, but this episode was the most powerful flash flood event in recent memory. Older people in Paiporta, ground zero of the tragedy, claim that Tuesday’s floods were three times as bad as those of 1957, which caused at least 81 deaths and were the worst in the history of the tourist eastern region. That episode led to the diversion of the Turia watercourse, which meant that a large part of the city was spared of these floods. Valencia suffered two other major DANAs in the 1980s, one in 1982, with around 30 deaths, and another one five years later, which broke rainfall records. This week's flash floods are also Spain's deadliest natural tragedy in living memory, surpassing the flood that swept away a campsite along the Gallego river in Biescas, in the northwest, killing 87 people in August 1996. ___ Seth Borenstein in Washington, D.C., contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/flash-floods-spain-valencia-climate-change-what-to-know-f942142b82de24f5b4a18867bc32ae00	2024-10-31T09:30:17-07:00	
Lebanon's detained former central bank governor faces new corruption charge	BEIRUT (AP) — Lebanon charged the country’s former central bank governor with illicit enrichment and issued an arrest warrant against the detained banker, the second in less than two months, judicial officials said Thursday. Riad Salameh, 74, was charged by the first examining magistrate of Mount Lebanon Nicola Mansour over an apartment that was rented in France to be a substitute office for the central bank if needed, the four official said on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media. The officials said Salameh had rented the apartment from his 'former partner' Anna Kosakova for about $500,000 annually. They added that the apartment was small and almost empty apartment except for a few computers. After questioning Salameh, Nicola issued an arrest warrant for him. Salameh had been held by Lebanese authorities since early September. Salameh has for years denied allegations of corruption, embezzlement and illicit enrichment. He insists that his wealth comes from inherited properties, investments and his previous job as an investment banker at Merrill Lynch. In early September, Lebanon charged Salameh with the embezzlement of $42 million a day after he was detained. Salameh ended his 30-year term as central bank governor a year ago under a cloud, with several European countries probing allegations of financial crimes. Many in Lebanon blame him for the crippling financial crisis that has gripped the country since late 2019. He was appointed in 1993 and initially celebrated for his role in steering Lebanon’s economic recovery after a 15-year civil war, and for keeping the economy on an even keel during long spells of political gridlock and turmoil. The embattled Salameh is also in the midst of several other cases against him, both locally and internationally. France, Germany, and Luxembourg are also investigating Salameh and close associates over alleged illicit enrichment and the laundering of $330 million. Salameh has criticized the European investigation and said it was part of a media and political campaign make him a scapegoat. Meanwhile, the U.S., the U.K, and Canada have sanctioned Salameh and his close associates, and France issued an international arrest warrant for him, though Lebanon does not hand over its own citizens for extradition.	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-corruption-riad-salameh-charged-paris-apartment-anna-kosakova-5454165e33bc9cfac0500d898765f018	2024-10-31T07:36:05-07:00	
Rocket fire from Lebanon kills 7 in Israel as US officials try to push for cease-fires	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Rocket barrages from Lebanon into northern Israel killed four foreign workers and three Israelis on Thursday, Israeli medics said, the deadliest cross-border strikes in Israel since it invaded Lebanon. Israel kept up airstrikes it says targeted Hezbollah militants across Lebanon, where health authorities on Thursday reported 24 people killed. U.S. diplomats were in the region pushing for cease-fires in both Lebanon and Gaza, hoping to wind down the wars in the Middle East as the Biden administration enters its final months. Pressure has been building ahead of the U.S. election next week. In northern Gaza, Israeli forces struck one of the last functioning hospitals, according to the World Heath Organization said, destroying much-needed supplies that the U.N. agency had delivered to the facility. The strikes set off a fire that affected the dialysis unit, destroyed water tanks, damaged the surgery building and injured four medics trying to extinguish the blaze, said the hospital's director, Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya. The Israeli military did not respond to a request for comment about a strike on the hospital, which it stormed last week after alleging it was harboring Hamas militants. Gaza's Health Ministry on Thursday condemned Israeli attacks on the hospital and called on the international community to safeguard medical facilities in Gaza. Back-to-back deadly rocket attacks hit Israel Projectiles from Lebanon crashed into an agricultural area in Metula, Israel’s northernmost town, killing four foreign workers and an Israeli farmer, local officials said Thursday. Hours later, the Israeli military reported another volley of some 25 rockets from Lebanon, striking an olive grove in a suburb of the northern Israeli port city of Haifa. That strike killed a 30-year-old man and 60-year-old woman while wounding two others, said Magen David Adom, Israel’s main emergency medical organization. Both Hezbollah and Hamas are backed by Iran, Israel’s regional adversary. Hezbollah did not immediately claim responsibility for Thursday’s rocket fire. Israel’s military said 90 projectiles were fired from Lebanon on Thursday. Hezbollah has been firing thousands of rockets, drones and missiles into Israel —and drawing fierce Israeli retaliatory strikes — over the past year since Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack out of the Gaza Strip triggered Israel’s devastating war in the Palestinian enclave. The residents of Metula evacuated in October 2023, and only security officials and agricultural workers remain. The Hotline for Refugees and Migrants, an Israeli organization that advocates for foreign workers, said authorities had put them in danger by allowing them to work along the border without proper protection. Agricultural areas near Israel’s border are closed military zones that can only be entered with official permission. For the few remaining residents, the thump of interceptions by Israel’s Iron Dome missile defense system and wailing air raid sirens punctuate daily life. Nonetheless, local officials largely support continuing a ground operation in southern Lebanon. 'If the Israeli government accedes to an agreement brought by (the Biden administration) ... we will not have it because for us this is rehabilitating Hezbollah again on our borders,' said Eitan Davidi, the mayor of the northern town of Margaliot. Israeli bombs across Lebanon after evacuation warnings Israeli strikes killed 24 people in Lebanon on Thursday, among them 13 people in the country’s eastern Bekaa Valley, according to Lebanon’s state-run National News agency, a day after the Israel’s military warned residents there to evacuate. The warnings sent thousands of people fleeing and spread panic across the city, known for its colossal Roman ruins. The Lebanese Health Ministry reported that over the last 24 hours, Israeli bombardments killed 45 people and wounded 110 in various parts of the country. Jean Fakhry, a local official in the Deir al-Ahmar region in the Bekaa Valley, said Israeli airstrikes pummeling the area turned the main highway 'a parking lot' of fleeing cars stuck in traffic. Around 12,000 displaced people are staying in the area, he said, with most taking refuge in private homes. At one of the shelters in Deir al-Ahmar, families with luggage were still arriving Thursday. 'Our homes were destroyed,' said Zahraa Younis, from the village near Baalbek. 'We came with nothing — no clothes or anything else.' US officials are in the region seeking a cease-fire Senior White House aides Brett McGurk and Amos Hochstein were in Israel Thursday for talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and senior officials about the conflicts with Hamas and Hezbollah. The meetings focused on efforts to secure a cease-fire deal in Lebanon and to assess new proposals floated by mediators to free Israeli hostages being held in Gaza, according to a U.S. official familiar with planning for the talks who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly. The meetings were attended by Netanyahu as well as Yoav Gallant, the Israeli defense minister; David Barnea, the director of the Mossad, Israel’s foreign intelligence agency; and other officials. But with the U.S. election on Tuesday, hopes for immediate progress appeared remote — particularly in Gaza where Israel has come under criticism for not letting more humanitarian aid into the besieged north. The death toll from more than a year of war in Gaza passed 43,000 earlier this week, Palestinian health officials reported. The Awda Hospital in central Gaza said late Thursday it had received 16 bodies of people killed by Israeli bombardment of two houses in Nuseirat refugee camp. The hospital said more than 30 others, including a medic and two journalists, were wounded. Over the past year, the broadening Israeli campaign in Lebanon against Hezbollah has killed 2,865 people there, wounded over 13,000 and devastated Lebanese towns near the border. Some 1.2 million people in Lebanon have been displaced since Israel escalated the conflict into a full-blown war last month, when it launched a wave of heavy airstrikes that killed Hezbollah’s top leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and most of his deputies. A year of Hezbollah rocket attacks have also forced 60,000 Israelis to evacuate from near the border. ___ Frankel reported from Jerusalem and Tawil from Deir al-Ahmar, Lebanon.

UN report warns of famine, aggravated by conflicts and climate shocks	ROME (AP) — Severe food crises threaten hundreds of thousands of people in vulnerable areas, including the Palestinian territories, Sudan, South Sudan, Haiti, and Mali, where populations face or near famine, says a report by the United Nations' food agencies released on Thursday. Conflicts, economic instability, and climate shocks -- combined with reduced funding for emergency food and agriculture assistance -- are driving alarming levels of acute food insecurity, the report warned. 'Immediate, scaled-up intervention is needed to prevent further deterioration in these already vulnerable regions,' it added. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Food Programme said acute food insecurity is projected to worsen across 16 'hunger hotspots' during the next six months in 14 countries and two regions. Sudan, South Sudan, Haiti, Mali and the Palestinian territories remain at the 'highest concern level,' the report said. Chad, Lebanon, Myanmar, Mozambique, Nigeria, the Syrian Arab Republic and Yemen are classified as 'hotspots of very high concern,' where large numbers of people are facing or are projected to face critical levels of acute food insecurity. 'Conflict and armed violence continue to be the primary drivers of hunger in numerous hotspots, disrupting food systems, displacing populations, and obstructing humanitarian access,' the report warned. FAO and WFP experts believe that the conflict in Sudan is likely to expand, 'driving mass displacement, resulting in famine levels likely to persist and the number of people in catastrophic conditions to increase.' That will further aggravate the regional humanitarian crisis, resulting in increased cross-border movements to neighbouring countries, primarily Chad, South Sudan, Egypt, Libya, Ethiopia and the Central African Republic. The UN agencies also stressed that the ongoing conflict in the Palestinian territories has driven 'unprecedented needs, with near-total displacement of the population and an increased risk of regional spillover.' The Israeli parliament has recently passed two laws that could prevent the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), a key provider of aid to Gaza, from being able to continue its work. According to Maxwell Sibhensana, deputy director at FAO office for emergencies and resilience, in Gaza 'the restriction in terms of movement for humanitarian actors into the areas where the affected population is, makes it difficult to get the assistance that is required. And without this assistance the risk of famine remains very high.' In Lebanon, the ongoing escalation of conflict is significantly increasing the number of people requiring humanitarian assistance and is severely impacting levels of acute food insecurity, the report added. Since the last report in May 2024, Kenya, Lesotho, Namibia and the Niger have been added to the hunger hotspots list, partly due to the impact of climate extremes. Beyond conflict, weather extremes and increased climate variability are exacerbating acute food insecurity in many regions, the report said. La Niña -- a natural climate pattern that influences global weather marked by cooler ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific – is expected to persist through March 2025, with a significant impact on rainfall patterns and temperatures. 'While La Niña may enhance agricultural prospects in some areas, it also increases the risk of flooding in parts of Nigeria, Malawi, Mozambique, South Sudan, Zambia and Zimbabwe,' the report said. The UN agencies warned that without 'immediate humanitarian efforts and concerted international action' to address severe constraints and advocate for the de-escalation of conflicts, further starvation and loss of life are likely in the Palestinian territories, the Sudan, South Sudan, Haiti and Mali. 'Addressing and preventing famine in these regions will require greater investment in integrated solutions that cut across traditional mandates, targeting the root causes of food insecurity and reducing dependency on emergency aid,' they said. — Associated Press producer Paolo Santalucia contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/un-fao-wfp-food-crises-conflicts-weather-sudan-palestine-haiti-mali-5f41d3cb7500dd0eb151de52ebe287a7	2024-10-31T03:17:34-07:00	
Britain has banned protests outside abortion clinics, but silent prayer is a gray area	LONDON (AP) — A British ban on protesting outside abortion clinics went into effect on Thursday, though it left a question mark over whether anti-abortion demonstrators who pray silently will be breaking the law. The law, which applies to England and Wales, bars protests within 150 meters (164 yards) of clinics. Scotland and Northern Ireland, which make their own health policies, recently enacted similar bans. The new rules make it an offense to obstruct someone using abortion services, 'intentionally or recklessly' influence their decision, or cause 'harassment, alarm or distress.' Offenders face a fine, with no upper limit. The buffer zone rule was passed 18 months ago as part of the previous Conservative government’s Public Order Act, but wrangling over whether it would apply to silent prayer protests, and a change in government in July, have delayed it taking effect. The Crown Prosecution Service says silent prayer near an abortion clinic 'will not necessarily commit a criminal offense,' and police say they will assess each case individually. Anti-abortion campaigners and religious groups argue that banning silent-prayer protests would be an affront to freedom of religion. But pro-choice campaigners say silent anti-abortion demonstrators are often intimidating to women entering clinics. 'It’s difficult to see how anyone choosing to perform their prayers right outside an abortion clinic could argue they aren’t attempting to influence people — and there are countless testimonies from women who say this makes them feel distressed,' said Louise McCudden, U.K. head of external affairs at MSI Reproductive Choices, one of Britain’s biggest abortion providers. In March 2023, lawmakers rejected a change to the legislation proposed by some conservative legislators that would have explicitly allowed silent prayer within the buffer zones. The final rules are a potentially messy compromise that is likely to be tested in court. Crime and Policing Minister Diana Johnson said she was 'confident that the safeguards we have put in place today will have a genuine impact in helping women feel safer and empowered to access the vital services they need.' But Bishop John Sherrington of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of England and Wales, said the government had 'taken an unnecessary and disproportionate step backwards' on religious freedom. 'Religious freedom includes the right to manifest one’s private beliefs in public through witness, prayer and charitable outreach, including outside abortion facilities,' he said. Abortion is not as divisive an issue in the U.K. as in the U.S., where women’s access to terminations has been rolled back, and banned in some states, since the Supreme Court overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling in 2022. Abortion was partly legalized in Britain by the 1967 Abortion Act, which allows abortions up to 24 weeks of pregnancy if two doctors approve. Later abortions are allowed in some circumstances, including danger to the mother’s life. But women who have abortions after 24 weeks in England and Wales can be prosecuted under the 1861 Offenses Against the Person Act. Last year a 45-year-old woman in England was sentenced to 28 months in prison for ordering abortion pills online to induce a miscarriage when she was 32 to 34 weeks pregnant. After an outcry, her sentence was reduced.	https://apnews.com/article/uk-abortion-clinic-protest-ban-5909e44c8305aefaad1569896b61f51b	2024-10-31T03:01:03-07:00	
A judge will decide if the owners of a New Zealand volcano where 22 died were unjustly convicted	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — A New Zealand judge will decide whether the owners of an island volcano suffered a miscarriage of justice when their company was convicted of failing to keep visitors safe following an eruption that killed 22 tourists and local guides in 2019. A three-day appeal by the owners' company ended Thursday. Justice Simon Moore told the High Court in the city of Auckland that he would reach a decision before the end of the year. The company, Whakaari Management — run by three brothers who own the active volcano Whakaari, also known as White Island — was ordered in March to pay millions of dollars in fines and restitutions to the victims of the eruption, who were mostly U.S. and Australian cruise ship passengers on a walking tour. Lawyers for the company filed an appeal against the criminal conviction the same month. A battle over land owners’ responsibilities The case hinges on whether Whakaari Management — which granted access to the volcano to tourists and scientific groups, collecting fees for permits — should have been in charge of safety at the volcano site under New Zealand’s workplace health and safety laws. Anyone in charge of a workplace must ensure management of hazards and the safety of all there, including at entry and exit points. A lawyer for New Zealand’s workplace regulator, which brought the charges in a 2023 trial, told the court on Thursday that Whakaari Management’s entire business involved granting access to an uncontrollable natural hazard, and and that it should have commissioned its own risk assessments on whether tourists should be permitted there at all. Prosecutor Kirsty McDonald agreed with the trial judge, saying the company 'had a duty to ensure, as far as reasonably practicable, that the workplace it was granting access to was without risks to the health and safety of any person.' However, lawyers for the company told the court this week that it had acted as a landlord, not a manager of operations on the site. Rachael Reed said the company did not run, direct or supervise the tours, and the operators were responsible for safety on the site. A case with far-reaching consequences The case has far-reaching implications and has already changed the laws governing New Zealand’s adventure tourism industry, which is often based around outdoor thrills on or around the country’s many natural hazards. Operators must now take all reasonable steps to inform customers of any serious risks. The lawyers for the company said that if the conviction was allowed to stand, it would make other land owners reluctant to allow such activities to take place on their property — a suggestion rejected by the regulator. Horror at a popular tourist spot White Island, the tip of an undersea volcano also known by its Māori name Whakaari, was a popular tourist destination before the eruption and was reached by boat or helicopter from the North Island’s Bay of Plenty. There were 47 tourists and tour guides on the island in December 2019 when superheated steam blew, killing some instantly and leaving others with agonizing burns. Survivors told the trial in emotional testimony that they had not been told the active volcano was dangerous when they paid to visit it. They were not supplied with protective equipment, and many were wearing clothing that made their horrific burns more damaging. In his ruling, Judge Evangelos Thomas said Whakaari Management had failed to undertake a risk assessment despite knowing of an eruption three years earlier. He said the company should have sought expert advice about the dangers and either stopped the tours entirely or put controls in place. More than a dozen parties charged Charges were brought by New Zealand’s workplace safety regulator against 13 organizations and people, including Whakaari Management. Some pleaded guilty, including three companies that operated helicopter tours, one that operated boat tours, a scenic flight operator and the New Zealand scientific agency GNS Science. Charges against others were dropped. Moore, the high court judge, was not required to release his findings immediately following Thursday’s end of hearings and did not set a definite date for his decision.	https://apnews.com/article/zealand-whakaari-volcano-white-island-eruption-f11da4777cc25aaff0aa392ecc029f04	2024-10-31T03:00:43-07:00	
About 8,000 North Korean troops now at Ukraine's border are expected in combat soon, US says	WASHINGTON (AP) — Some 8,000 North Korean soldiers are now in Russia near Ukraine’s border and are preparing to help the Kremlin fight against Ukrainian troops in the coming days, the Biden administration said Thursday. The new figure is a dramatic increase from a day earlier, when Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin would only say 'some' of the troops had moved toward Ukraine’s border in the Kursk region, where Moscow's forces have struggled to push back a Ukrainian incursion. That also would mean most of the North Korean troops that the U.S. and its allies say have been sent to Russia are now on the Russia-Ukraine border. The U.S. has estimated a total of about 10,000 North Korean troops are in Russia. Seoul and its allies assessed that the number has increased to 11,000, while Ukraine has put the figure higher, at up to 12,000. Of the 8,000 in Kursk, 'we’ve not yet seen these troops deploy into combat against Ukrainian forces but we would expect that to happen in the coming days,' Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at a news conference with Austin and their South Korean counterparts. He said Russia has been training North Korean soldiers in artillery, drones and 'basic infantry operations, including trench clearing, indicating that they fully intend to use these forces in front line operations.' North Korea’s move to tighten its relationship with Russia has raised concerns around the world about how that may expand the war and what Russian military aid will be delivered in exchange. It’s become a key topic as U.S. and South Korean leaders met this week in Washington, fueling concerns that the presence of those soldiers will further destabilize the Asia-Pacific and broaden Moscow’s war on Ukraine. South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul condemned the deployment 'in the strongest possible terms' and called for an immediate withdrawal of the troops. North Korea’s belligerent actions not only places the European continent but also the Korean peninsula under threat and that Seoul agrees 'to take necessary measures accordingly,' he said. Austin reiterated that Moscow has provided the North Korean troops with Russian uniforms and equipment, another indication they are likely to be used on the front lines. 'Make no mistake, if these North Korean troops engage in combat or combat support operations against Ukraine they would make themselves legitimate military targets,' Austin said. However he said the injection of North Korean troops was unlikely to cause Ukraine to lose ground in Kursk. 'This 10,000 won’t come close to replacing the numbers that the Russians have lost' in their fighting to date, Austin said. The U.S. estimates that more than 500,000 Russian forces have been killed or wounded in the more than two-year long conflict. The U.S. has provided more than $59 billion in military aid to help Ukraine fend off Russia, and Austin pledged Thursday that another aid package would be announced soon. The U.S. and South Korean leaders called out China to engage, saying Beijing should be deeply concerned by the movements and the possibility it will further destabilize the region. 'If China is serious about its desire for de-escalation, it should be asking Russia some hard questions at this point and whether it intends to broaden this conflict by this kind of behavior,' Austin said. There are questions about what new military technologies North Korea might get from Russia in exchange for the deployment and whether it might lead other nations to send their own forces to fight in the war. North Korea test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile Thursday for the first time in almost a year, demonstrating a potential advancement in its ability to launch long-range nuclear attacks on the American mainland. Some experts speculated that Russia may have provided technological assistance to North Korea over the launch. As the meeting in Washington was underway, the U.S., South Korea and Japan released a joint statement condemning the missile launch as a 'flagrant violation' of numerous U.N. Security Council resolutions and criticizing the deepening military cooperation between North Korea and Russia, particularly the deployment of the North Korean troops. 'We strongly urge (North Korea) to immediately cease its series of provocative and destabilizing actions that threaten peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and beyond,' they said. In a dramatic moment during a U.N. Security Council meeting earlier Thursday, the deputy U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Robert Wood, first noted the number of North Korean troops near Ukraine. 'And I have a very respectful question for my Russian colleague: does Russia still maintain that there are no DPRK troops in Russia? That’s my only question and final point,' he said. Russia's deputy ambassador to the U.N., Anna Evstigneeva, did not respond to the comment at the meeting called by Moscow to discuss international peace and security. The session was then adjourned. Besides troops, North Korea also has provided munitions to Russia, and earlier this month, the White House released images it said were of North Korea shipping 1,000 containers of military equipment there by rail. ___ Lederer reported from the United Nations.

At least 10 people are killed by police in Mozambique post-election protests, medical groups say	MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) — At least 10 people were fatally shot by police and dozens of others were injured when authorities cracked down on unrest following Mozambique's presidential election, two medical groups said, as the country braced Thursday for more protests against a vote criticized as fraudulent by opposition parties and questioned by international observers. Daniel Chapo of the ruling Front for the Liberation of Mozambique was announced as the winner of the election on Oct. 24, extending the Frelimo party's 49 years in power since independence from Portugal in 1975. Chapo is to succeed President Filipe Nyusi, who is stepping down after serving the two terms allowed under the constitution. Frelimo has regularly been accused of rigging elections and Mozambique's security forces have previously been criticized for suppressing protests with deadly force. Opposition parties claimed fraud on the day of the election, while observers from the European Union said in a later report that there were irregularities in the vote counting and some results had been altered. Tensions were high in the southern African country in the buildup and immediate aftermath of the Oct. 9 vote, but more unrest was stoked when two senior officials of an opposition party were killed in their car in the capital, Maputo, on Oct. 18 after being ambushed by unidentified gunmen late at night. The opposition says the attackers fired 25 bullets at the car. The killings were widely seen in Mozambique as being politically motivated. One of the victims was the lawyer and adviser to Venancio Mondlane, the main opposition candidate for president who was second in the election. Ten people died of gunshot wounds and another 63 were wounded by gunfire in protests between Oct. 18 and Oct. 26, the Medical Association of Mozambique and the Mozambique Order of Doctors said in a joint statement Wednesday. 'In most of the shootings, especially those that resulted in death, the intention of the police was to shoot to kill,' Gilberto Manhiça, the head of the Order of Doctors, was quoted as saying by local media. In a separate statement, Human Rights Watch put the death toll at 11. It said more than 50 people sustained serious gunshot wounds in the protests and called for an investigation into the 'apparently excessive use of force.' Protesters burned tires and blocked roads in some cities and authorities characterized some of the unrest as violent that had to be quelled. Police spokesperson Orlando Mudumane told state-run Radio Mozambique that the situation was now 'relatively calm and controlled.' Opposition leader Mondlane has called for a week of new protests to begin on Thursday. ___ AP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa	https://apnews.com/article/mozambique-election-protests-deaths-154ac940bae942ea3dd992262348e50a	2024-10-31T01:50:40-07:00	
Russian bomb hits residential building in Ukraine's 2nd largest city, killing 12-year-old boy	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russian forces struck a residential building in Ukraine's second-largest city of Kharkiv early Thursday, killing a 12-year-old boy and injuring scores of others. Regional head Oleh Syniehubov said the boy was fatally injured when the building was hit by a Russian 500-kilogram (1,100-pound) glide bomb. 'He was freed from under the rubble with severe head injuries and fractures,' Syniehubov wrote on his messaging app channel. 'Doctors performed resuscitation measures for more than half an hour. Unfortunately, it was not possible to save the child.' Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said that at least 35 people suffered injuries in the attack and others could be still trapped under the rubble, including a missing 15-year-old boy. Russia has increasingly used powerful glide bombs to pummel Ukrainian positions along the 1,000-kilometer (600-miles) line of contact and strike cities dozens of kilometers (miles) from the frontline. Kharkiv, a city of 1.1 million, is about 30 kilometers (less than 20 miles) from border. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly urged the United States to allow Ukraine to use long-range American missiles to strike air bases deeper in Russia that are used by aicraft carrying glide bombs. Washington so far only has allowed some strikes close to the border. Zelenskyy repeated his demand Thursday, publishing a video showing the ravaged building, at least three of its floors destroyed and the rest of it seriously damaged. 'Partners see what is happening every day,' Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram. 'And under these conditions, each of their delayed decisions means at least dozens, if not hundreds of such Russian bombs against Ukraine. Their decisions are the lives of our people. Therefore, we must together stop Russia and do it with all possible force.' Early Thursday, Russia also fired 10 missiles of various types at the Dniester Estuary bridge that connects the northern and southern parts of Odesa region, Ukraine's air force said, adding that only two of them were intercepted. The air force didn't say whether the bridge was hit. Russian forces also fired 43 exploding drones over at least nine Ukrainian regions; 17 were shot down, 23 jammed and three flew back to Russian-controlled territories, the air force said. The head of the Kyiv city administration, Serhii Popko, said debris from some of the drones that were intercepted over the capital fell in the Podil district just north of the downtown, causing minor damage. According to Popko, there was only one day of October when Kyiv residents did not hear an air alert. So far in October, Kyiv heard two air alerts per day on average, repelling 20 actual aerial attacks targeting the city. Ukraine struck back Thursday with drone attacks. Authorities in the Russia-occupied city of Berdyansk on the Sea of Azov reported a drone attack on the port early Thursday, saying three people were injured.

Singapore's affluent veneer hides repression and corruption, says son of its modern-day founder	LONDON (AP) — Singapore has become much more repressive, and corruption in the Asian financial hub has worsened in the decade since the death of former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, according to his youngest son who fled to Britain to seek asylum from what he described as a campaign of persecution to silence him. Lee Hsien Yang, who has been granted political refugee status in the U.K., told The Associated Press that Singaporean authorities have 'weaponized' the country's laws against critics and that he is just the most prominent example of a growing number of Singaporeans fleeing abroad to seek protection from their own government. Lee cited a tightening of laws on security and rights of assembly and a sharp increase in the number of asylum-seekers from the city-state over the past decade under the rule of his estranged brother, Lee Hsien Loong, who was prime minister until he stepped down earlier this year. 'Singapore has this veneer that purports to be a sort of affluent, democratic, free country. The veneer is quite thin,' he said in an interview in London on Monday. 'Beneath that there is a repressive nature to that regime and there are people fleeing from it.' The Singapore government reacted strongly Thursday, accusing Lee of turning a 'personal vendetta into an international smear campaign against his father, his family and his country.' It said Lee had alleged in his asylum application that he and his family were being persecuted by the Singapore government to prevent his son, Li Shengwu, from becoming prime minister. 'That he would go so far as to allege this — though his son has repeatedly said he has no such ambition — shows his campaign against Singapore is not based on principles,' it said. Lee announced last week that he was forced to seek asylum from what he called unfounded criminal proceedings, defamation and surveillance against him and his wife by Singaporean authorities led by his brother. Human Rights Watch says Singapore silenced dissenting voices in its recent elections and voiced concern over aggressive enforcement of a sweeping 'online falsehoods' law that it said allows officials to censor online content. Accusations of state persecution The Lee brothers have been at odds since they fell out over the will of their late father. Lee Kuan Yew, who died in 2015, was both feared for his authoritarian tactics and admired worldwide for turning the city-state into one of the world’s richest nations. He stepped aside from power in 1990 but remained influential behind the scenes for many years afterward. Officials have accused Lee Hsien Yang and his wife of lying under oath and providing false evidence regarding his father's will. Lee said his son was prosecuted for criticizing the judiciary in a Facebook post. Lee himself lost a defamation suit last year and was ordered to pay damages to two government ministers whom he indicated were corrupt over their rental of state-owned properties. He said last month he has paid the amount, so that the family home under his name will not be seized. Lee called the actions against him 'bogus, abusive and unwarranted,' and said the campaign of persecution escalated after he joined Singapore’s opposition party in 2020. Lee said he and his wife left hurriedly in June 2022 and decided to apply for political asylum in the U.K. because they believed they needed protection. 'Many people claim this is a family feud. Well, the actions taken against me were taken by the organs of the state,' he said. 'In a tightly controlled country like Singapore, where my brother was the prime minister and holds the levers of power, there’s no way these things happen without his knowledge, his consent and his agreement,' he added. Financial scandals with international connections Lee further alleged that Singapore's banks and companies have been linked to growing numbers of international money laundering and corruption scandals in recent years. Last year Singaporean authorities seized $1.75 billion in assets including gold bars, bottles of alcohol, luxury cars and properties and arrested nine Chinese nationals in a massive money laundering case involving funds raised by illegal means abroad. Lee cited other examples including the involvement of Singaporean banks in the Malaysian state development fund 1MDB corruption scandal, and two Singapore government-linked companies operating in Brazil's oil and gas industry that were allegedly implicated in Brazil's sweeping 'Operation Car Wash' anti-corruption investigation. Lee said the cases and growing repression showed that his city has deteriorated — though he also acknowledged the lack of political freedoms was a holdover from his father's decadeslong leadership, during which the resource-poor former British colony transformed into a prosperous financial hub with low crime and almost zero corruption. 'Singapore has retained legislation and punishments which come from a different day and age,' he said. 'My father was a product of that day and age, but I think if he were alive today some of those things could well have changed.' Human Rights Watch said last year that Singapore carried out the highest number of executions for drug-related offenses in over a decade. The Singapore government said all of the examples of alleged corruption cited by Lee have been thoroughly addressed, either through the courts or in Parliament. It said Singapore hasn't wavered in its anti-corruption stance, pointing to the country’s high standing in international perceptions of corruption and its recent indictment of a former Cabinet minister on graft charges and robust controls to detect, deter and prosecute financial crimes. It called Lee 'a major beneficiary of the Singapore system' and noted he had freely participated in politics by joining an opposition party during the 2020 elections. Lee 'is not a victim of persecution. He and his wife remain citizens. They are and have always been free to return to Singapore,' the government said. Lee declined comment on whether he saw a role for himself as an opposition leader. But he said he intended to continue to 'speak his mind' on Singaporean politics despite his concerns over further attempts to silence him. 'I have no doubt that every time I do so, I risk further attacks from the Singaporean authorities,' he said. 'I think the day will come when things will change. I hope it will come in my lifetime and that one day I’ll be able to return to my home.' ___ Associated Press writer Eileen Ng in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/singapore-uk-lee-hsien-yang-asylum-d9ff237aa1aad60a0246a7dfb1a026b4	2024-10-31T00:44:55-07:00	
Spain searches for bodies after flood of the century claims at least 95 lives	BARRIO DE LA TORRE, Spain (AP) — Survivors of the worst natural disaster to hit Spain this century awoke to scenes of devastation on Thursday after villages were wiped out by monstrous flash floods that claimed at least 95 lives. The death toll could rise as search efforts continue with an unknown number of people still missing. The aftermath looked eerily similar to the damage left by a strong hurricane or tsunami. Wrecked vehicles, tree branches, downed power lines and household items all mired in a layer of mud covered the streets of Barrio de la Torre, a suburb of Valencia, just one of dozens of damaged localities in the hard-hit region of Valencia, where 92 people died between late Tuesday and Wednesday morning. Walls of rushing water turned narrow streets into death traps and spawned rivers that ripped into the ground floors of homes and swept away cars, people and anything else in its path. 'The neighborhood is destroyed, all the cars are on top of each other, it’s literally smashed up,' said Christian Viena, a bar owner in Barrio de la Torre. Regional authorities said late Wednesday it appeared there was no one left stranded on rooftops or in cars in need of rescue after helicopters had saved some 70 people. But ground crews and citizens continued to inspect vehicles and homes that were damaged by the onslaught of water. Over a thousand soldiers from Spain’s emergency rescue units joined regional and local emergency workers in the search for bodies and survivors. The defense minister said that soldiers alone had recovered 22 bodies and rescued 110 people by Wednesday night. 'We are searching house by house,' Ángel Martínez, official of a military emergency unit, told Spain’s national radio broadcaster RNE on Thursday from the town of Utiel, where at least six people died. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez is heading to the region to witness the destruction firsthand as the nation starts a three-day period of official mourning. Thousands of people were left without water and electricity and hundreds were stranded after their cars were wrecked or roads were blocked. The region remained partly isolated with several roads cut off and train lines interrupted, including the high-speed service to Madrid, which officials say won’t be repaired for several days. While Valencia took the brunt of the storm, another two casualties were reported in the neighboring Castilla La Mancha region. Southern Andalusia reported one death. The relative calm of the day after has also given time to reflect and question if authorities could have done more to save lives. The regional government is being criticized for not sending out flood warnings to people’s mobile phones until 8:00 p.m. on Tuesday, when the flooding had already started in some parts. Spain’s Mediterranean coast is used to autumn storms that can cause flooding. But this was the most powerful flash flood event in recent memory. Scientists link it to climate change, which is also behind increasingly high temperatures and droughts in Spain and the heating up of the Mediterranean Sea. ___ Wilson reported from Barcelona, Spain.	https://apnews.com/article/flash-floods-spain-valencia-climate-change-30c6ef59ddf27598c691c89d0ba41442	2024-10-31T00:18:41-07:00	
Middle East latest: Officials in West Bank say Israeli raid has killed 3	Palestinian officials said Thursday that an Israeli military raid in the occupied West Bank killed at least three people. The Palestinian Health Ministry said Thursday that two Palestinians were killed in an Israeli strike and third by Israeli gunfire. The Israeli military said its forces were targeting militants in the area of the Nur Shams refugee camp, which has seen repeated battles in recent months. The military said it eliminated a Hamas militant in the area who was involved in planning attacks on Israelis. Also Thursday, Israeli police said they have arrested a couple accused of spying on Israeli intelligence sites and collecting information on an Israeli academic on behalf of Iran. Meanwhile, mediators are ramping up efforts to halt the wars in Lebanon and the Gaza Strip, circulating new proposals to wind down the regional conflict. Hezbollah’s newly named leader, Naim Kassem, said the militant group will keep fighting in its war with Israel until it is offered cease-fire terms it deems acceptable. Some 1.2 million people have been displaced by the conflict in Lebanon, according to government estimates. Lebanon’s Heath Ministry said more than 2,800 people have been killed and 12,900 wounded since Oct. 8, 2023, when Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel, drawing retaliation. Israeli ground forces invaded southern Lebanon at the beginning of October. The death toll from more than a year of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza has passed 43,000, Palestinian officials reported Monday, without distinguishing between civilians and combatants. The war began after Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. ___ Here’s the latest: Israeli airstrikes kill 8 people in eastern and southern Lebanon BEIRUT — The Israeli military has warned people to evacuate from more areas of southern Lebanon, including a built-up Palestinian refugee camp. Israeli airstrikes, meanwhile, killed at least eight people in different parts of the country on Thursday. The Rashidiyeh refugee camp near the port city of Tyre is one of several dating back to the 1948 Mideast war, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were driven out of what is now Israel. Israel invaded Lebanon at the start of October, after nearly a year of trading fire with Hezbollah. The militant group began firing rockets, missiles and drones on northern Israel after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack triggered the war in Gaza. Iran backs both groups. Israel has warned people to evacuate from large areas of the country, including major cities in the south and east. Over a million people have already fled their homes. Israeli strikes killed seven people in eastern Lebanon, according to Lebanon’s state-run National News agency. Another strike killed a man on a motorcycle on the coastal highway between Tyre and Sidon. The news agency also reported a strike on a car on a main highway running through the mountains outside the capital, Beirut. It said the strike closed the highway, diverting traffic through nearby villages. There was no immediate word on casualties. Israeli police arrest a couple accused of spying for Iran JERUSALEM — Israeli police said Thursday they have arrested a couple accused of spying on Israeli intelligence sites and collecting information on an Israeli academic on behalf of Iran. Israeli security services say they have uncovered several Iranian spy networks in recent months. The two archenemies have waged a long-running shadow war that has burst into the open since the outbreak of the war in Gaza. They exchanged fire directly for the first time in April and then again this month. In a statement released Thursday, the police and the Shin Bet internal security agency said that the man arrested, Rafael Guliev, from the central city of Lod, had surveilled Israel’s Mossad spy headquarters for the Iranians and collected information on an academic working at the Institute for National Security Studies, a prominent Israeli think tank. It did not identify the scholar. The statement said Guliev was also entrusted with finding an assassin, though the statement did not make clear if he had actually done so. Guliev’s wife, Lala, assisted in the activities, the statement said. Officials in West Bank say 3 people were killed in Israeli raid RAMALLAH, West Bank — Palestinian officials said an Israeli military raid in the occupied West Bank killed at least three people. The military said its forces were targeting militants in the area of the Nur Shams refugee camp, which has seen repeated battles in recent months. The military said it eliminated a Hamas militant in the area who was involved in planning attacks on Israelis. The Palestinian Health Ministry said Thursday that two Palestinians were killed in an Israeli strike and third by Israeli gunfire. Israel said its forces were still in the area. At least 763 Palestinians, including over 165 children, have been killed by Israeli fire in the West Bank since Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack out of the Gaza Strip triggered the war there, according to the Health Ministry. Most appear to have been militants killed during army operations, but the dead also include civilian bystanders and people killed during violent protests. Palestinians have carried out dozens of stabbing, shooting and car-ramming attacks against Israelis since the start of the war. Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war and the Palestinians want it to form the main part of their future state. Israel has built scores of settlements there that are now home to over 500,000 Israeli settlers. The 3 million Palestinians in the territory live under seemingly open-ended Israeli military rule, with the Western-backed Palestinian Authority exercising limited self-rule in population centers.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-hezbollah-mideast-latest-31-october-2024-f5910a533abaf7e78e445d24169d73cf	2024-10-30T23:55:18-07:00	
AP PHOTOS: Ayodhya in northern India celebrates the night before Diwali with pomp and pageantry	AYODHYA, India (AP) — A priest stands with folded hands praying toward the rising sun on the banks of the Saryu River in Ayodhya in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. Nearby, a group of women takes a dip in the river dressed in their saris while a barber trims the mustache of a shirtless man on the bank. Similar scenes have played out at this spot for hundreds of years. Ayodhya is an ancient city that Hindus believe was the birthplace of their beloved deity Lord Rama. It’s early morning on Wednesday, Oct. 30, the day before Diwali, the biggest of the Hindu festivals. According to the Hindu epic Ramayana, when Rama retuned home to Ayodhya after 14 years in exile with his wife Sita and brother Laxmana, its citizens lit lamps to welcome them. Diwali, which means an array of lights, celebrates Rama’s homecoming. It also symbolizes the victory of good over evil. Millions of Hindus across the country light their homes with oil lamps or festive electric lights on the new-moon day. They distribute sweets, burst firecrackers and shop for gold and household appliances during the five-day festivities, with Diwali on the third day. What was once a private celebration with family and friends is increasingly public, and it is nowhere more evident than in Ayodhya. Since 2017, the Uttar Pradesh state government has organized Deepotsav, a celebration that includes drones and laser lights, on the eve of Diwali in Ayodhya. Last year, 2.2 million oil lamps were lit on the banks of the Saryu River, setting a Guinness World Record. This year, the state broke its own record by lighting 2.51 million lamps. Actors playing Rama, Sita and Laxmana were brought in by helicopter. They stood on a carpeted open area while the state’s Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and other senior officials offered prayers. During the ceremony, another helicopter showered flower petals on them. People watched a laser show as they stood among the rows of burning oil lamps, recording the experience on their phones.	https://apnews.com/article/ayodhya-diwali-festival-photo-gallery-india-201b3c2a33e2f7b5eedfc703eebabd9f	2024-10-30T22:27:21-07:00	
Locked in Mideast wars and battered by sanctions, Iran is wary over US presidential election	TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — America's presidential election next week comes just after Iran marks the 45th anniversary of the 1979 U.S. Embassy hostage crisis — and for many, tensions between Tehran and Washington feel just as high as they did then. Iran remains locked in the Mideast wars roiling the region, with its allies — militant groups and fighters of its self-described 'Axis of Resistance' — battered as Israel presses its war in the Gaza Strip targeting Hamas and its invasion of Lebanon amid devastating attacks against Hezbollah. At the same time, Iran still appears to be assessing damage from Israel's strikes on the Islamic Republic last Saturday in response to two Iranian ballistic missile attacks. Iran's currency, the rial, hovers near record lows against the dollar, battered by international sanctions over Tehran's nuclear program of enriching uranium closer than ever to weapons-grade levels. In public spaces, women still openly defy Iran's mandatory law on the headscarf, or hijab, a result of the mass demonstrations over the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini that still haunts the country. That has left a feel of fatalism among some on the streets of the capital, Tehran, as Americans cast ballots for either Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump. Many are split on which candidate would be better for their country — if at all. 'All U.S presidents elected after the (1979) revolution had the same views about Iran and I think that’s unlikely to change,' said Sadegh Rabbani, 65. Harris and Trump have offered hard-line views on Iran, making Iranians wary Both candidates have either undertaken or expressed tough stances on Iran. In 2018, Trump unilaterally pulled America out of Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers, setting off years of attacks across the Middle East even before Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Trump has been briefed on Iranian plots to retaliate against him, as well over his decision to launch a 2020 drone strike that killed Iran's top general, Qassem Soleimani, in Baghdad. Harris, meanwhile, vowed at the September presidential debate that she would always 'give Israel the ability to defend itself, in particular as it relates to Iran and any threat that Iran and its proxies pose to Israel.' For its part, the Biden administration did try indirect negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program that produced no tangible results, though it did reach one prisoner swap deal that saw five Americans detained for years in Iran walk free in September 2023. In an outdoor coffeeshop in downtown Tehran, popular among the youth, 22-year-old Zahra Rezaei said she preferred a Harris win. 'We saw Trump in the past and he just ran an anti-Iran policy,' Rezaei told The Associated Press. 'It is time for a woman ... I think she (Harris) will better since she is not after war.' Ebrahim Shiri, a 28-year-old postgraduate political sciences student, agreed. 'I think Harris knows the world better,' he said. 'She and (Joe) Biden convinced Israel not to attack Iran’s nuclear facilities. This mean moving toward peace.' Others believe Trump, with his promises of dealmaking, might be a better fit. 'I do not know what the American people think, but Trump is able to get a quick deal with Iran,' said Mohammad Ali Raoufi, 43, who runs a double-glazed window workshop. 'The Biden administration including Harris failed to reach any (deal) with Iran over the past years when they were in power.' Reza Ghaemi, a 31-year-old taxi driver, also suggested Trump may lessen tensions in the region since he pushed to withdraw U.S. troops from the Mideast during his term in office. Iran's government wants sanctions gone and hopes for another nuclear deal Many declined to speak to the AP on camera — Iran has only state-run television and radio stations, so people are suspicious of reporters with video cameras working openly on the street. A woman walking by immediately tightened her previously loose headscarf after seeing the camera. However, one woman spoke on camera as her hijab fell off and another didn't wear it all — a sign of how much Iran has changed since Amini's death. Those who did speak to the AP mostly expressed worries about a direct United States-Iran war — especially if Trump wins. While saying he wants Trump to win 'for my own reasons,' 53-year-old Ahmad Moradi claimed that would make a U.S.-Iran war '100%' sure to happen. A woman who only gave her name as Mahnaz, fearing repercussions for speaking openly, suggested that Harris, as a woman, couldn’t reach any deals with Iran because 'men can talk to men.' 'I think if Trump is elected, it will be much harder for our kids. Of course it doesn’t matter which one is elected, it’s already tough for us,' said Fariba Oodi. 'We the Iranian people are trapped in some political game. And our kids are paying a price for that,' she added. 'But I still think if it’s Trump, it will be more difficult, especially for my son who is a student and plans to apply' to study in America. Iran's reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian, elected after a helicopter crash killed hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi in May, came to power on a promise to reach a deal to ease Western sanctions. Iranian officials maintain that separating nuclear negotiations from Mideast wars is possible, even as the U.S. has accused Iran of meddling in the November election, which Tehran denies. Fatemeh Mohajerani, a spokeswoman for Pezeshkian's administration, said Tehran wants to see a change in U.S. policies and a respect for the 'national sovereignty of other countries.' It also wants Washington to 'avoid tension-making activities as we witnessed in recent years,' she said. Analysts, however, see a difficult road ahead for any possible U.S.-Iran talks, no matter who wins next Tuesday. 'The talks will be a war of attrition,' Ali Soufi told the pro-reform Shargh newspaper. Saeed Nourmohammadi, another analyst, suggested such talks 'are unlikely to be fruitful.' But ultimately, any decision rests with Iran's 85-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. 'You know, Khamenei has seen eight U.S. presidents' come and go, said Abbas Ghasemi, a 67-year-old retired teacher 'He knows how to deal with the next one.' ___ Associated Press writer Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-us-election-mideast-wars-israel-nuclear-deal-2d749543470a5cd7df6c6ece863b4732	2024-10-30T21:03:48-07:00	
America's European allies face challenging times, whoever wins the presidential election	BERLIN (AP) — The United States' European allies are bracing for an America that's less interested in them no matter who wins the presidential election — and for old traumas and new problems if Donald Trump returns to the White House. The election comes more than 2 1/2 years into Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, in which Washington has made the single biggest contribution to Kyiv's defense. There are question marks over whether that would continue under Trump, and how committed he would be to NATO allies in general. A win by Vice President Kamala Harris could be expected to bring a continuation of current policy, though with Republican opposition and growing war fatigue among the U.S. public there are concerns in Europe that support would wane. Trump's appetite for imposing tariffs on U.S. partners also is causing worry in a Europe already struggling with sluggish economic growth. But it's not just the possibility of a second Trump presidency that has the continent anxious about tougher times ahead. European officials believe U.S. priorities lie elsewhere, no matter who wins. The Middle East is top of President Joe Biden’s list right now, but the long-term priority is China. 'The centrality of Europe to U.S. foreign policy is different than it was in Biden’s formative years,' said Rachel Tausendfreund, a senior research fellow at the German Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin. 'And in that way, it is true that Biden is the last trans-Atlantic president.' The U.S. will continue to pivot toward Asia, she said. 'That means Europe has to step up. Europe has to become a more capable partner and also become more capable of managing its own security area.' Germany’s defense minister, Boris Pistorius, remarked when he signed a new defense pact with NATO ally Britain that the U.S. will focus more on the Indo-Pacific region, 'so it is only a question of, will they do much less in Europe because of that or only a little bit less.' Ian Lesser, a distinguished fellow at the German Marshall Fund in Brussels, said that 'above all, Europe is looking for predictability from Washington,' and that's in short supply in a turbulent world in which any administration will face other demands on its attention. 'But the potential for disruption is clearly greater in the case of a potential Trump administration.' 'There is an assumption of essential continuity' under Harris that's probably well-founded, he said, with many people who have shaped policy under Biden likely to remain. 'It's very much the known world, even if the strategic environment produces uncertainties of its own.' While both the U.S. and Europe have been increasingly focused on competition with Asia, the ongoing war in Europe means 'the potential costs of a shift away from European security on the American side are very much higher today than they might have been a few years ago,' Lesser said. Europe's ability to deal with that depends on how quickly it happens, he said. Europe's lagging defense spending irked U.S. administrations of both parties for years, though NATO members including Germany raised their game after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. NATO forecasts that 23 of the 32 allies will meet its target of spending 2% or more of gross domestic product on defense this year, compared to only three a decade ago. During his 2017-2021 term, Trump threatened to abandon ' delinquent ' countries if they weren’t paying their 'bills.' In campaigning this time, he suggested that Russia could do what it wants with them. His bluster has undermined trust and worried countries nearest to an increasingly unpredictable Russia, like Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. Europeans see the war in Ukraine as an existential challenge in a way the United States eventually may not, even with some signs of war fatigue emerging in Europe itself. If Trump wins, 'there's every indication that he has no interest in continuing to support Ukraine in this war' and will push quickly for some kind of cease-fire or peace agreement deal that Kyiv may not like and Europe may not be ready for, Tausendfreund said. 'And there is also just no way that Europe can fill the military gap left if the U.S. were to withdraw support.' 'Even with a Harris administration there is a growing, changing debate — frankly, on both sides of the Atlantic — about what comes next in the war in Ukraine, what is the end game,' Lesser said. Biden emphasized the need to stay the course in Ukraine during a brief recent visit to Berlin when he conferred with German, French and British leaders. 'We cannot let up. We must sustain our support,' Biden said. 'In my view, we must keep going until Ukraine wins a just and durable peace.' The times he has lived through have taught him that 'we should never underestimate the power of democracy, never underestimate the value of alliances,' the 81-year-old Biden added. German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who bestowed Germany's highest honor on Biden for his service to trans-Atlantic relations, hopes Biden's compatriots are listening. 'In the months to come, I hope that Europeans remember: America is indispensable for us,' he said. 'And I also hope that Americans remember: Your allies are indispensable for you. We are more than just ‘other countries’ in the world —we are partners, we are friends.' Whoever wins the White House, the coming years could be bumpy. 'Whatever the outcome next week, half of the country will go away angry,' Lesser said, noting there's 'every prospect' of divided government in Washington. 'Europe is going to face a very chaotic and sometimes dysfunctional America.' ___ Associated Press writer Lorne Cook in Brussels contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/europe-transatlantic-relations-election-trump-harris-ukraine-2e98d6bf7982e44faa53590b858c6746	2024-10-30T20:48:21-07:00	
At least 14 killed in long-running land dispute between rebel clans in southern Philippines	COTABATO, Philippines (AP) — At least 14 people were killed in a long-seething land dispute involving two Muslim guerrilla commanders and their followers in a southern Philippine town, military and civilian officials said Thursday. The fighting erupted Wednesday between the two commanders of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front in a village in Pagalungan town in Maguindanao del Sur province but a truce has since been forged by the military, police and leaders of the rebel front. The fighting was set off by a long-running land dispute between the clans of the two rebel commanders and was not directly related to the Muslim insurgency. The Moro Islamic Liberation Front was the largest Muslim separatist armed group in the southern Philippines, homeland of minority Muslims in the largely Roman Catholic nation, until it signed a peace deal with the government in 2014 when it dropped its separatist goal and agreed to a better-funded Muslim autonomous region called Bangsamoro in the volatile south. The six-province Muslim region is now governed by former rebel leaders in a transition arrangement prior to regular elections in May next year. Thousands of guerrillas belonging to the rebel front, however, were still holding on to their firearms while awaiting amnesty and livelihood packages from the government under the peace deal. Pagalungan town Vice Mayor Abdillah Mamasabulod said a long-running feud over a vast farmland involving two clans led by commanders of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front erupted anew into fierce fighting Wednesday afternoon in the village of Kilangan. 'They have been fighting over ownership of about 290 hectares (716 acres) of agricultural land,' Mamasabulod told reporters and renewed a call for the warring clans to settle their dispute peacefully through government and rebel mediators. Mamasabulod cited witnesses as saying that up to 19 people were killed in the sporadic fighting and scores were wounded before a cease-fire was forged. Army Lt. Col. Roden Orbon, spokesperson of the 6th Infantry Division, however, said at least 14 people were killed in the intermittent clashes in the village, where government forces were deployed to secure civilian villagers. Troops recovered five assault rifles at the scene of the fighting. 'The military and police are continuously conducting monitoring in all nearby hospitals and coordinating with the leadership of both warring groups to identify the still unidentified bodies,' Orbon said. Dozens of villagers who fled at the height of the fighting were returning to their communities, he said. The fighting is the latest reminder of the complex security problems that have long hounded the southern Philippines, which has bountiful resources and potential but has long been hamstrung by stark poverty, weak law enforcement, a large number of unlicensed firearms and an array of insurgents and outlaws.	https://apnews.com/article/southern-philippines-land-dispute-moro-islamic-liberation-front-a9d2d4e185409279a21f19c2deaae368	2024-10-30T20:29:41-07:00	
8 of 11 members of Mexico's Supreme Court to resign in protest of controversial judicial overhaul	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Eight justices of Mexico’s Supreme Court have said they will leave the court rather than stand for election as required by a controversial judicial overhaul passed last month. Supreme Court President Norma Piña and seven others submitted letters Tuesday and Wednesday stating they would leave their posts rather than compete in judicial elections scheduled for next June. The court’s three other justices have indicated they will compete in the elections. Previously, the Supreme Court’s justices were selected by the Senate. Last month, Mexico’s Congress passed — and a majority of states ratified — then-President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s initiative to make all of the country’s judges subject to election. López Obrador and his allies, including his successor Claudia Sheinbaum, have said the radical change will help rid the judicial system of corruption. However, critics say the courts will become less independent and more subject to political forces. The resignations came before the Congress’ lower chamber later Wednesday passed yet another constitutional change that would protect constitutional amendments like the judicial overhaul from legal challenges. The Supreme Court is scheduled to take up such a challenge in the coming the days. The amendment passed with 343 votes in favor and 129 against. The Senate had previously passed the legislation. Business sectors in particular had voiced concerns that the change would weaken the rule of law. The Mexican Employers’ Association, Coparmex, had said in a statement before the vote that the initiative 'puts at risk the fundamental guarantees that have protected citizens for decades.' López Obrador clashed throughout his six-year term with the courts as they repeatedly knocked down some of his initiatives. He railed against judges in his daily morning press briefings and Sheinbaum, his protégé, has continued in a similar vein. Sheinbaum had quipped Tuesday that if the Supreme Court justices didn’t resign now before the close of judicial candidate registration in November they could lose their pensions. 'It’s a lot of money,' she said.	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-supreme-court-judges-resign-judicial-elections-9d7c8b8586c3729c0d23a0b90e2ea7bc	2024-10-30T20:29:34-07:00	
Here's why Argentina's public universities are paralyzed by protests	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — After 11 months in office, Argentina's right-wing President Javier Milei has fulfilled his flagship pledge to eliminate the country's monumental deficits by shrinking the public payroll, slashing subsidies and suppressing already low wages of state workers. The austerity has spawned misery. But with the country’s left-wing opposition in disarray after delivering the economic disaster that Milei inherited, Argentina hasn’t seen the kind of widespread social unrest that has characterized past economic crises. That could change. The country's teachers are fed up. Milei’s recent veto of a bill boosting spending on university budgets struck a collective nerve in a nation that long has considered free education a critical engine of social progress, drawing the broadest demonstrations since the libertarian leader took office. Last week's open-air classes held in Plaza de Mayo, the main square home to government headquarters, marked the latest in a new wave of protests supporting public universities that has gripped Argentina over the past month. Students are taking over college campuses in the coming days ahead of another mass protest. Here’s a look at what students are protesting and what it means for Milei's effort to transform crisis-prone Argentina into an economic success story. What do protesters want? Professors and non-teaching staff at public universities across Argentina are demanding a pay raise to compensate for sky-high inflation that they say has shrunk their purchasing power by 60% this year. After a student-led march mobilized a half-million protesters in April, Milei's government compensated universities for operational costs but not for teachers’ salaries. The average salary of an associate professor is now $320 per month. For teaching assistants, it’s just $120 a month. The university funding bill that Milei vetoed would have increased staff salaries to make up for 2024 annual inflation — which now tops 200% — and adjusted them for inflation going forward. Even if Milei’s drastic measures have recently dragged month-on-month inflation below 5%, the number of Argentines in poverty has swelled to more than 50%. The public university system hasn't seen this kind of budget shortfall since 2004, according to the Civil Association for Equality and Justice, an Argentine nonprofit. 'Our living conditions have visibly worsened,' said Nicolas Jose Lavagnino, a researcher in the philosophy of biology at Conicet, Argentina's leading research body that reported losing 250 scientists this year due to budget cuts. Unions reject the government's 6.8% pay raise offer as inadequate. The University of Buenos Aires — one of Latin America's biggest and most prestigious — has warned of mass resignations over depreciating salaries. At least 30 teachers have quit at UBA's Faculty of Agriculture alone. Milei has vowed to block any measure that jeopardizes the budget balance. In September, he vetoed a bill raising pensions — which would have cost his government over 1% of Argentina's gross domestic product — for the same reason. But the education bill would have cost only 0.14% of GDP, stirring doubts over the economic significance of Milei’s battle. 'We see this as a direct attack on the philosophy of public education in our country,' said Matias Busi, a 25-year-old student at Argentina's University of La Plata. What does Milei say? The irascible president has lambasted universities as leftist indoctrination camps. 'What productivity do scientists have?' he said in 2023 on the campaign trail, advocating for the defunding of research institute Conicet. While promising not to get rid of free public education, Milei demands that universities undergo a government audit and do more to clean up corruption. 'If they don’t want to be audited, it must be because they are dirty,' he said. Milei’s party in recent weeks has also revived an unpopular attempt to charge tuition for foreign non-residents, who make up nearly 4% of total enrollment. The public education system in Argentina is rare in that there are no bars to entry — foreigners who can’t afford a bachelor’s degree in their own countries can enroll free of charge at first-rate public universities like UBA, where all five of the country's Nobel Prize winners studied. Half of Milei's Cabinet even graduated from public universities. Some say Milei is justified in requesting more financial transparency, pointing to the alleged misuse of funds and creeping politicization of what was once a universally respected institution. 'There were contracts with public sector figures where absurd things were funded,' said Argentine political consultant Sergio Berensztein, referring to scandals that erupted during the tenure of former leftist President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner over big-budget research projects that audits later revealed had never existed. 'They were simply mechanisms to divert funds for political interests,' What is the political context? After Milei's government mustered just enough votes to prevent the opposition from overriding his veto of the university funding bill on Oct. 10, over 250,000 Argentines — spanning the far-left to center-right — flooded the streets. The student-led movement drew a range of Argentine protesters stung by austerity that has deepened the recession and pushed poverty to its highest level in 20 years — retirees desperate for better pensions, doctors furious over meager pay, artists against closure of the national film institute, scientists angry over gutted funds, pilots worried about Milei's plans to privatize Argentina's flagship airline. Santiago Gándara, a social sciences professor at both UBA and the University of La Pampa, said he believed Milei miscalculated in going after Argentina's proud symbol of publicly financed education for the masses. 'It is like someone coming and saying, ‘We are going to get rid of the Plaza de Mayo,’' he said, referring to the historic Buenos Aires square that filled with protesters last week. 'Milei understood this too late. … You can’t decide the fate of Plaza de Mayo. It belongs to all of us.' The question of whether the demonstrations morph into a real threat for Milei remains open. 'I think these protests are not at the point of being life-threatening to Milei, but it's obviously damaging,' said Ana Iparraguirre, an Argentine analyst and partner at Washington-based strategy firm GBAO. 'When students mobilize, you really never know where that movement is going to end.' ___ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/argentina-milei-protests-universities-farright-explained-e442fecf9f66da7508b8686b756847d3	2024-10-30T20:27:22-07:00	
Japan celebrates as Shohei Ohtani, Yoshinobu Yamamoto win World Series with Dodgers	TOKYO (AP) — The World Series trophy is headed to Los Angeles, but there's a hearty celebration going on across the Pacific Ocean in Japan, too. People milled around the edge of the Ginza shopping area in central Tokyo on Thursday afternoon as single-sheet, special newspaper editions rolled off the presses, proclaiming Japanese stars Shohei Ohtani and Yoshinobu Yamamoto as world champions along with their Dodgers teammates after a stirring Game 5 victory over the New York Yankees. The headline in Japanese in the Sports Nippon newspaper, set in yellow and blue type — with red highlights — read: 'No. 1 in The World. Ohtani beats the Yankees.' 'I want to thank my Japanese fans for coming all the way to cheer me this season,' Ohtani said on Japanese television. 'That cheering gave me some energy so I’m glad I could return the gratitude my winning.' The newspaper handouts are a Tokyo tradition when Japan celebrates a big event. And it was a scramble, as usual, with men and women — young and old —sprinting up and down the sidewalk to get their free collector's items. The Yomiuri Shimbun headline read: 'Dodgers No. 1; Ohtani, Yamamoto in first season.' Yasuko Shibata, an 80-year-old woman who said she faithfully watches Ohtani's games, said she admired 'Ohtani's personality.' Not to mention his great play. 'His presence is huge,' she said. 'He is a source of my energy. When he doesn’t do well, I also feel blue' Another fan echoed her thoughts, standing near the Ginza underground entrance. 'He is the pride of Japan,' said Hideki Shinohara, who called himself a hardcore fan. 'You cannot describe him with just ‘amazing.’ You need to invent a new word.' Shinohara added: 'He went through many things this year, and I didn’t expect him to come all this way. I am very pleased with what he has achieved. ' The Japanese pride in Ohtani is a huge one for a country whose players were once considered too small, or only good pitchers. Now, there is strong pride in the fact that their players are among the best in the game. Japan defeated the United States in the World Baseball Classic final last year in Miami, another sign of the country's prowess in the American pastime. It was also a victory for Ohtani's hometown in northern Japan — Oshu City — where fans have been gathering all week and anticipating their superstar hero would help deliver the title. About 38,000 special edition newspapers were also published in Iwate Prefecture, the northern area where Oshu City is located. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB	https://apnews.com/article/ohtani-japan-world-series-7d921035c88de41024a0a62fd89afa92	2024-10-30T20:23:12-07:00	
Ukrainian front-line school system goes underground to protect against bombs and radiation	ZAPORIZHZHIA, Ukraine (AP) — To be a parent in the Ukrainian front-line city of Zaporizhzhia means weighing your child’s life against the Russian weapons within striking distance. Most rain death in an instant: the drones, the ballistic missiles, the glide bombs, the artillery shells. But Russian soldiers control another weapon they have never deployed, with the potential to be just as deadly: The nearby Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The NPP, as it’s known, once produced more electricity than any other nuclear power plant in Europe. It fell to Russian forces in the first weeks of the full-scale invasion, and Russia has held its six reactors ever since. The plant has come under repeated attacks that both sides blame on the other. These twin dangers — bombs and radiation — shadow families in Zaporizhzhia. Most of the youngest residents of the city have never seen the inside of a classroom. Schools that had suspended in-person classes during the COVID-19 pandemic more than four years ago continued online classes after the war started in February 2022. So with missiles and bombs still striking daily, Zaporizhzhia is going on a building binge for its future, creating an underground school system. Construction has begun on a dozen subterranean schools designed to be radiation- and bomb-proof and capable of educating 12,000 students. Then, officials say, they will start on the hospital system. The daily bombs are a more tangible fear than radiation, said Kateryna Ryzhko, a mother whose children are the third generation in her family to attend School No. 88. The main building, dating to the Soviet era of the children’s grandmother, is immaculate but the classrooms are empty. The underground version is nearly complete, and Ryzhko said she wouldn’t hesitate to send her kids to class there. Nearly four years of online learning have taken their toll on kids and parents alike. 'Even classmates don’t recognize each other,' she said. 'It’s the only safe way to have an education and not be on screens.' Nuclear shadow Within days of Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, Zaporizhzhia’s 300,000 residents found themselves on the front lines. Unlike larger Ukrainian cities, like Kyiv or Kharkiv, there is no subway system that could do double-duty as a bomb shelter and few schools had basements where students could more safely attend classes. Many residents left — though some have returned. But the single-family homes and Soviet-style apartment blocks of Zaporizhzhia, the capital of the region that shares its name, filled nearly as quickly with Ukrainians fleeing areas seized by Russian forces, like the cities of Mariupol, Melitopol and Berdyansk. By the start of the school year in September 2022, which was supposed to mark the post-pandemic return to classrooms, schools were empty. Windows were boarded up to protect against bomb shockwaves, the lawns left unkempt. Fifty kilometers (31 miles) away, the nuclear reactor went into cold shutdown after intense negotiations between the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Russian government. The IAEA has rotated a handful of staff on site ever since. There are risks even in cold shutdown, when the reactor is operating but not generating power. The main danger is that its external electrical supply, which comes from Ukrainian-controlled territory under constant Russian bombardment, will be cut off for a longer period than generators can handle. The nuclear plant needs electricity to keep crucial backups functioning, including water pumps that prevent meltdowns, radiation monitors and other essential safety systems. During a recent Associated Press trip to the Ukrainian-controlled zone closest to the nuclear plant, two airborne bombs struck electrical infrastructure in a matter of minutes as night fell. Russia has repeatedly struck at Ukraine’s grid, attacks that have intensified this year. Highlighting the constant danger, electricity to the NPP was cut yet again for three days as emergency workers struggled to put out the fire. It was at least the seventh time this year that the plant was down to either a single electrical line or generator power, according to the global Nuclear Energy Agency. 'Nuclear power plants are not meant to be disconnected from the grid. It’s not designed for that. It’s also not designed to be operating in cold shutdown for that long,' said Darya Dolzikova, a researcher on nuclear policy at the Royal United Services Institute in London. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accuses Russia of targeting nuclear plants deliberately. The 1986 meltdown in Ukraine’s Chornobyl, on the northern border nearly 900 kilometers (550 miles) from Zaporizhzhia, increased the country’s rates of thyroid disease among Ukrainian children far from the accident site and radiation contaminated the immediate surroundings before drifting over much of the Northern Hemisphere. To this day, the area around the plant, known in Russian as Chernobyl, is an 'exclusion zone' off-limits except to the technical staff needed to keep the decommissioned site safe. Russian forces seized control of Chornobyl in the first days of the invasion, only to be driven back by Ukrainian forces. The Zaporizhzhia plant has a safer, more modern design than Chornobyl and there’s not the same danger of a large-scale meltdown, experts say. But that doesn’t reduce the risk to zero, and Russia will remain a threatening neighbor even after the war ends. An investment that might seem extreme elsewhere is more understandable in Ukraine, said Sam Lair, a researcher at the Center for Nonproliferation Studies. 'They are there under a conventional air and missile attack from the Russians, and they have experience with the fact that those attacks aren’t being targeted only at military targets,' Lair said. 'If I were in their position, I would be building them too.' In addition, the Zaporizhzhia region received a European Union donation of 5.5 million iodine pills, which help block the thyroid’s absorption of some radiation. Since the start of the war, Russia has repeatedly alluded to its nuclear weapons stockpile without leveling direct threats. In September, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Russia would consider any attack by a country supported by a nuclear-armed nation to be a joint attack and stressed that Russia could respond with nuclear weapons to any attack that posed a 'critical threat to our sovereignty.' Ukrainian officials fear that the Russian attacks on Chornobyl and the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plants may be just a start. During his speech in late September to the U.N. General Assembly, Zelenskyy warned that Russia was preparing strikes on more nuclear plants, which generate a large portion of Ukraine’s electricity. 'If, God forbid, Russia causes a nuclear disaster at one of our nuclear power plants, radiation won’t respect state borders,' Zelenskyy said. Underground for the future The cost to build a subterranean school system is enormous — the budget for the underground version of Gymnasium No. 71 alone stands at more than 112 million hryvnias ($2.7 million). International donors are covering most of it, and the national and local governments have made it a priority on par with funding the army. 'Everybody understands that fortification and aid for the army, it’s priority No. 1,' said Ivan Fedorov, head of the Zaporizhzhia region. 'But if we lose the new generation of our Ukrainians, for whom (do) we fight?' Daria Oncheva, a 15-year-old student at Gymnasium 71, looks forward to the underground classes, and not just because she’ll finally be in the same place as her schoolmates. 'It’s safer than sitting at home remotely,' she said. School No. 88, across town, is further along, with rooms carved out and fully lined with concrete thick enough to block an initial onslaught of radiation. The contractor leading the project is also digging trenches for Ukraine’s military. When done, it will also be the primary bomb shelter for the neighborhood, whose single-family homes tend to have small orchards and trellised gardens — but no basements. An optimistic timeline has the school ready for children by December. It has three layers of rebar totaling 400 tons of metal, plus 3,100 cubic meters of reinforced concrete. The building will be topped by nearly a meter (yard) of earth, concealed by a soccer field and playground. The school will have an air filtration system, two distinct electrical lines and the ability to operate autonomously for three days, including with extra food and water supplies. Michael Dillon, a scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory who studies how people can survive nuclear fallout, said being underground improves survival by a factor of 10. But Alicia Sanders-Zakre at the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons said ultimately people can do more — 'which is eliminating these weapons instead of … building, really not even a Band-Aid, for the actual problem.' Lyudmila Zlatova, who has been the principal at School No. 88 for 30 years, hopes it will be a structure designed for the dangers Zaporizhzhia will face in the future. But she and the parents who gathered on a recent day were most concerned with the present, speaking at the edge of the construction pit as air raid sirens sounded. It takes 10 seconds for a bomb to reach the neighborhood from the front line, far too short a time to evacuate, and they land with unnerving frequency. The subterranean school’s sunless rooms and concrete corridors will only make children more comfortable, given what they’re already enduring, she said. 'They will feel better studying without windows,' Zlatova said, peering across at the construction site. Zlatova believes it will bring back at least some of the families who’ve left Zaporizhzhia for other cities in Ukraine or elsewhere in Europe. The city remains fully functional, with public transit operating and grocery stores, markets and restaurants operating, and repairs ongoing for structures damaged by shelling — albeit in limited fashion. Around 150 of the school’s 650 prewar students have left the city, but she said she’s in touch with absent families and many promise to return home once there is a safe place to study. Gymnasium No. 6, which runs from first grade through high school, already has one. Its main building sits on the city’s easternmost edge, closer than any other school to the front 40 kilometers (25 miles) away. Little wonder that its principal, Kostyantyn Lypskyi, seems a little frayed at the beginning of the academic year. But at least his students can attend because parents chipped in money last year to renovate the basement shelter about 50 meters from the main school building into a series of classrooms. His underground school, whose concrete walls and relatively thin metal doors are not radiation proof but protect against explosions, hold around 500 people — the same number as the new designs. The school has double that number, so students will alternate weeks. The youngest children study full-time just upstairs from the shelter, and the older ones are in the main building. 'Of course it will work,' he said. 'We prepared everything for the start of the new school year.' In the earliest days of the school year, an air raid alarm meant he could test that confidence. It took five minutes from the moment the sirens sounded until the last children took their seats and spread out their books, awaiting instruction. It was morning, and they were ready for the day ahead. ___ Associated Press reporter Martha Mendoza contributed from Santa Cruz, California.

Fourth mass coral bleaching prompts UN emergency session at Colombia biodiversity summit	CALI, Colombia (AP) — The United Nations, scientists and governments made an urgent call Wednesday for increased funding to protect coral reefs under threat of extinction. Research this year shows that 77% of the world’s reefs are affected by bleaching, mainly due to warming ocean waters amid human-caused climate change. It's the largest and fourth mass global bleaching on record and is impacting both hemispheres, United Nations Capital Development Fund said. The findings prompted a U.N. special emergency session — typically called to address escalating conflicts or natural disasters — on corals to be convened on sidelines of the U.N. biodiversity summit, known as COP16, nearing its end after two weeks in Cali, Colombia. Coral reefs are vital ecosystems that support over 25% of marine life and nearly a billion people, many relying on reefs for food security, coastal protection and livelihoods, the U.N. development fund said. After the emergency session, the governments of New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Germany and France made new pledges totaling around $30 million to the U.N. fund for coral reefs established in 2020. By 2030, the fund seeks to leverage up to $3 billion in public and private finance to support coral reef conservation efforts. Around $225 million has been raised to date. 'Protecting our ocean and its precious habitats is fundamental to life on earth,' said U.K. Minister for Nature Mary Creagh. 'But without urgent action, the world’s coral reefs face extinction from global heating, acidification, disease, and pollution; a vital ecosystem lost within our lifetime.' Next year, a U.N. ocean conference will take place in Nice, France, and countries are being urged beforehand to pledge more to the U.N. global fund for coral reefs with the aim of mobilizing an additional $150 million in donations by the conference. 'In 2024, climate change and other human impacts triggered the fourth mass coral reef bleaching event, the most extensive and devastating on record,' said Peter Thomson, the U.N. Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for the Ocean. 'With the window to protect these ecosystems closing rapidly, world leaders must act now.' 'We must secure a sustainable future for coral reefs and the countless lives that rely on them —before it’s too late,' Thomson said. A change in water temperature can cause coral to drive out algae that provides nutrition, lose its color and become stressed. Coral may bleach for other reasons, such as extremely low tides, pollution or too much sunlight. In the world’s largest coral reef ecosystem, Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, bleaching affected 90% of the coral assessed in 2022. The Florida Coral Reef, the third-largest, experienced significant bleaching last year. The first mass bleaching happened in 1998, the second between 2011-2013, the third in 2016, said Kenyan marine ecologist David Obura, who heads Coastal Oceans Research and Development in the Indian Ocean East Africa. 'They're lasting more than one year at a time, which is worrying,' Obura said at the U.N. emergency session at COP16. —- Follow Steven Grattan on X: @sjgrattan —- The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Argentina's president fires his foreign minister after vote in favor of ending US embargo on Cuba	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — Argentina’s President Javier Milei on Wednesday dismissed his foreign affairs minister hours after the country voted in favor of lifting the U.S. economic embargo of Cuba at the U.N. General Assembly. Argentine Foreign Minister Diana Mondino was replaced by Argentina's ambassador to the U.S., Gerardo Werthein, Milei's spokesman Manuel Adorni said on his X account. Adorni didn't elaborate on the reasons behind the replacement, but the announcement came hours after Argentina voted Wednesday in favor of ending the embargo of Cuba. The President’s office later confirmed in a press release that the dismissal was because of the vote at the U.N. 'Our country is categorically opposed to the Cuban dictatorship, and it will remain firm in promoting a foreign policy that condemns all regimes that perpetuate the violation of human rights and individual freedoms,' Milei’s office said. On Wednesday, 187 nations, including Argentina, voted in favor of a U.N. resolution condemning the U.S. embargo of Cuba, with only the United States and Israel voting against it. Since taking power in December 2023, libertarian Milei has veered his country's foreign policy to be more aligned toward the U.S. and Israel interests. Milei has expressed his total support of right-wing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government over its bombardment and invasion of Gaza. His stand differs from most of Latin America — where Bolivia and Colombia have even severed ties with Israel and at least five countries in the region, including Brazil, have pulled ambassadors from Tel Aviv. Argentina’s vote at the U.N. is the latest episode of a troubled period of Mondino as Foreign Relations minister. Last week, Modino’s office removed a press release after writing 'Falklands' instead of 'Malvinas,' as the Argentina calls the British-controlled archipelago in the South Atlantic. And in May, she traveled to China trying to improve the bilateral relations after some criticism from Milei of the Asian giant. But during her visit she was criticized because in a media interview she said that 'all Chinese look like the same,' referring to their physical features. Milei’s office also said that his government will do an internal audit at the Foreign Relations Ministry 'with the aim of identifying promoters of agendas opposed to freedom.' ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/argentina-milei-foreign-minister-cuba-un-4ab32cf005981cf2664a0614bccb7f3e	2024-10-30T14:44:02-07:00	
North Korea launches a suspected new long-range missile designed to strike US	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea test-launched a suspected new long-range missile designed to strike the continental U.S. on Thursday, its neighbors said, as the United States warned that North Korean troops in Russian uniforms are heading toward Ukraine likely to augment Russian forces and join the war. The specific long-range missile capabilities North Korea was testing were not known, but the launch was likely meant to grab American attention ahead of the U.S. election Tuesday. South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said it detected a ballistic missile launch from North Korea’s capital region around 7:10 a.m. and that the weapon flew toward the waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan. It said the weapon was launched on a high angle and it was suspected of being a long-range ballistic missile. Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani told reporters that a preliminary examination shows the launch could involve a new missile, citing its flight duration of one hour and 26 minutes, which he said is the longest for a North Korean missile test. He said the missile landed in waters outside of the Japanese exclusive economic zone but condemned North Korea’s nuclear and missile development for threatening the safety of Japan and the international community. South Korea and Japan said they are closely coordinating with the U.S. about the North Korean launch. The United States described the weapon as an intercontinental ballistic missile and condemned North Korea for the launch, saying it violated U.N. Security Council resolutions and 'needlessly' risked raising tensions. 'It only demonstrates that the DPRK continues to prioritize its unlawful weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs over the well-being of its people,' U.S. national security council spokesperson Sean Savett said in a statement. He added that the United States would work to ensure the security of the American homeland and its South Korea and Japanese allies. North Korea last test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile in December 2023, when it launched the solid-fueled Hwasong-18. Missiles with built-in solid propellants are easier to move and hide and can be launched quicker than liquid-propellant weapons. South Korea’s military intelligence agency told lawmakers Wednesday that North Korea was close to test-firing a long-range missile capable of reaching the United States and has also likely completed preparations for its seventh nuclear test. North Korea has made strides in its missile technologies in recent years, but many foreign experts believe the country has yet to acquire functioning nuclear-armed missile that can strike the U.S. mainland. They say North Korea likely possesses short-range missiles that can deliver nuclear strikes across all of South Korea. One of the technological hurdles North Korea still faces is for its weapons to be capable of surviving the harsh conditions of atmospheric reentry. South Korean officials and experts earlier said North Korea may test-launch a ICBM on a normal angle to verify that capability. In September, North Korean state media published a photo of Kim inspecting what appeared to be a 12-axle missile launch vehicle, the largest mobile launch platform the country has disclosed so far. Observers cited the vehicle as evidence North Korea could be developing an ICBM that is bigger than its existing ones. In the past two years, Kim has used Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a window to ramp up weapons tests and threats while also expanding military cooperation with Moscow. South Korea, the U.S. and others have recently accused North Korea of dispatching thousands of troops to support Russia’s warfighting against Ukraine. They've said North Korea has already shipped artillery, missiles and other convectional arms to Russia. North Korea's possible participation in the Ukraine war would mark a serious escalation. South Korea, the U.S. and their partners also worry about what North Korea could get from Russia in return for joining Russia’s war against Ukraine. Aside from his soldiers’ wages, experts say Kim Jong Un likely hopes to get high-tech Russian technology that can perfect his nuclear-capable missiles. On Wednesday, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said North Korean troops wearing Russian uniforms and carrying Russian equipment are moving toward Ukraine, in what he called a dangerous and destabilizing development. Austin spoke at a news conference in Washington with South Korean Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun. South Korea said Wednesday that North Korea has sent more than 11,000 troops to Russia and that more than 3,000 of them have been moved close to battlefields in western Russia. ___ Associated Press journalists Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo and Aamer Madhani in Washington contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP's Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-missile-launch-377c07eac46ad41bda0d4445df6f51d5	2024-10-30T14:29:19-07:00	
UN urges protection as another journalist is shot to death in Mexico	MEXICO CITY (AP) — The U.N. human rights office in Mexico said Wednesday journalists in Mexico need more protection, after gunmen killed a man whose Facebook news page covered the violent western Mexico state of Michoacan. Journalist Mauricio Solís of the news page Minuto por Minuto was shot to death late Tuesday just moments after he conducted a sidewalk interview with the mayor of the city of Uruapan (ooh-roo-WAH-pan). State prosecutors said a second person was wounded in the shooting. Solís had just finished an interview on the street outside city hall with Mayor Carlos Manzo. Manzo told local media he had walked away and 'two minutes later, I think, and just a matter of meters away, we heard gunshots, four or five gunshots.' 'We sought cover because we thought the attack was aimed at us,' Manzo said. 'After a few minutes we found out that Mauricio was the one they attacked.' Manzo said he could not rule out a connection between the interview and the killing. The U.N. rights office said Solís was at least the fifth journalist killed in Mexico this year. It said he had previously reported security problems related to his work. His Facebook page reported on community events and the drug cartel violence that has wracked the city. 'His killing is a wake-up call to defend the right to information and freedom of expression in Mexico,' the office wrote. An increasing number of the journalists killed in Mexico have been self-employed and reported for local Facebook and online news sites. Uruapan is the nearest large city to Michoacan's avocado-growing region, and it has been the scene of drug cartel extortions and turf battles between gangs. The cartels demand protection money from local avocado and lime orchards, cattle ranches and almost any other business. Solís was reporting on a suspicious fire at a local market just before the shooting. Gangs have sometimes burned businesses that refuse to pay extortion demands. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-journalist-killed-cartels-michoacan-e631cb8ce572adc14a1d86e566df280f	2024-10-30T14:14:19-07:00	
UN General Assembly condemns the US economic embargo of Cuba for a 32nd year	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The U.N. General Assembly voted overwhelmingly Wednesday to condemn the American economic embargo of Cuba for a 32nd year after its foreign minister strongly criticized the Biden administration and expressed hope a new president would end it. The vote in the 193-member world body was 187-2, with only the United States and Israel against the resolution, and one abstention. It tied the record for support for the Caribbean nation first reached in 2019 and again last year. Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez blamed the U.S. government’s 'maximum pressure policy' aimed at depriving Cuba of the imported fuel it relies on for a widespread blackout this month, including when Hurricane Oscar lashed the island. 'President Joseph Biden’s administration usually claims that its policy is intended to 'help and support the Cuban people,’' he said. 'Who would believe such an assertion?' General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding, but they reflect world opinion, and the vote has given Cuba an annual stage to demonstrate that the U.S. stands apart in its decades-old efforts to isolate the Caribbean nation. Cuba has struggled with one of the worst economic and energy crises in its history. Besides waves of blackouts, citizens are frustrated over food shortages and inflation. Hundreds of thousands have migrated, many headed to the United States. The embargo was imposed in 1960 following the revolution led by Fidel Castro and the nationalization of properties belonging to U.S. citizens and corporations. Two years later, it was strengthened. In July 2016, then-Cuban President Raul Castro and then-President Barack Obama officially restored relations, and that year the U.S. abstained on the resolution calling for an end to the embargo for the first time. But Obama’s successor, Donald Trump, sharply criticized Cuba’s human rights record, and in 2017 the U.S. again voted against the resolution, and it has ever since. U.S. deputy ambassador, Paul Folmsbee, told the assembly that the United States strongly supports the Cuban people’s pursuit of a future that respects human rights and fundamental freedoms. 'Sanctions are one element of our broader effort to advance democracy and promote respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in Cuba,' he said. He noted that about 1,000 political prisoners have been unjustly detained in Cuba, more than at any point in Cuba’s recent history. Folmsbee said U.S. sanctions exempt food, medicine and other basic goods and that the U.S. exported nearly $336 million in agricultural products and authorized additional humanitarian exports last year. In May, the U.S. lifted some financial restrictions against Cuba in an effort to boost private businesses on the island. That included allowing independent entrepreneurs to open and access U.S. bank accounts online to support their businesses as well as steps to open up more internet-based services and expand private companies’ ability to make certain financial transactions. Rodriguez said that under Biden’s presidency, Cuba has lost more than $16 billion and that measures announced in the last year 'as alleged palliatives' to the embargo are not effective. Noting next week's U.S. presidential election, the Cuban minister said the winner will have the opportunity to decide whether to continue 'the inhumane siege measures of the last six decades' or heed an increasing number of Americans and an overwhelming majority of nations 'and allow our country to develop its true potential and capabilities.' Rodriguez said Cuba will defend its 'right to build an independent, socialist future.' But he also said Cuba is willing 'to hold a serious and responsible dialogue and move on towards a constructive and civilized relationship' with the new U.S. administration.	https://apnews.com/article/cuba-us-economic-embargo-united-nations-7eaaac3318080a7640c64fd424a8e668	2024-10-30T11:44:23-07:00	
8 miners are dead and 1 is missing after a mine collapse in Zambia	LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) — Eight miners died after being buried under mounds of earth that collapsed on them in an open-pit copper mine in Zambia on Wednesday, police said. One miner was missing and another two survived, provincial police commissioner Peacewell Mweemba said. State media reported that six of the miners who died at the mine in Chingola, a city in Copperbelt Province, were from the same family. The victims were not employees of the mining company but part of a group who had been searching for copper at the mine without permission, a common phenomenon in Zambia. It's the latest in a series of tragedies involving informal miners in copper-rich Zambia. This month, 10 informal miners died in a collapse in Mumbwa in central Zambia. Nine men died at a quarry near the capital, Lusaka, in August when a huge pile of earth collapsed on them. Last December, more than 30 informal miners died at another open-pit mine in Chingola when heavy rain caused landslides that buried them in tunnels they were working in. Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema recently said the number of miners who had died in accidents was 'unacceptable.' ___ AP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa	https://apnews.com/article/zambia-miners-mine-deaths-collapse-copper-120270d1ffc318e12ee8f13d1a2f4046	2024-10-30T11:41:23-07:00	
Biden, Cyprus president discuss administration push to win cease-fires in Gaza and Lebanon	WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden and Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides on Wednesday discussed a new effort by the U.S. administration and mediators in the Middle East to forge cease-fires to end fighting in Lebanon and Gaza. Christodoulides leads the European Union nation closest to Gaza. The small Mediterranean island nation has played a critical role in efforts to get humanitarian aid into Gaza since the war between Hamas and Israel began more than a year ago. He said that Biden and White House officials briefed him on the latest stepped-up efforts by the U.S. administration and other mediators but declined to offer further details about the discussion. 'The most important, the number one priority of the international community now is to have a cease-fire in the region,' Christodoulides told reporters after his Oval Office talks with Biden. He added that situation on the ground changes daily but that he was 'quite optimistic' that a Lebanon cease-fire deal could emerge in one to two weeks. Senior White House officials Brett McGurk and Amos Hochstein will visit Israel on Thursday for talks on possible cease-fires in both Lebanon and Gaza, and on the release of hostages held by Hamas, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. She said CIA Director Bill Burns will head to Egypt on Thursday to discuss those efforts. A proposal to end the war between Israel and Hezbollah calls for a two-month cease-fire during which Israeli forces would withdraw from Lebanon, and Hezbollah would end its armed presence along the country’s southern border, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the talks said. The officials were not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity. Biden, meanwhile, thanked Cyprus for helping move badly needed humanitarian aid into Gaza and for the Mediterranean nation's cooperation in response to Russia's war in Ukraine. The meeting, the first Oval visit by a Cypriot president since 1996, comes days after U.S. and Cypriot officials announced the countries are launching a strategic dialogue aimed at bolstering security and stability in a crisis-wracked region through initiatives including counterterrorism training of personnel from Middle Eastern countries and fighting sanctions evasion. The new coordination is just the latest example of Cyprus tightening relations with the U.S. after decades of walking a tightrope between Washington and Moscow. Cyprus has moved closer to the U.S. since Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. 'Today we stood against Russia’s vicious onslaught against Ukraine, we launched a strategic dialogue, we increased cooperation across a range of issues, from energy security to artificial intelligence, and we surged humanitarian aid, delivering 8000 metric tons to Gaza,' Biden said. The U.S. is also funding a center on the island nation under the acronym CYCLOPS that trains personnel from Cyprus and neighboring countries on maritime and cybersecurity as well as counterterrorism techniques. The Cyprus government has also stepped up coordination with local law enforcement, the U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI to help combat the evasion of sanctions against Russia and other countries. The FBI is helping train Cypriot police in identifying and prosecuting cases of illegal financing and attempts to evade U.S., European Union and U.N. sanctions imposed on any third country. Last month, Cyprus and the U.S. signed a defense cooperation framework agreement that outlines ways the two countries can enhance their response to regional humanitarian crises and security concerns. Christodoulides said Cyprus has proven to be a 'predictable and reliable partner of the United States in a region of great geopolitical importance.' Earlier this year, Cyprus helped the U.S. establish a Gaza maritime corridor for the shipborne delivery of humanitarian aid to the Palestinian territory. The $230 million temporary pier project was derided as a boondoggle by critics and was beset by turbulent weather, security threats and sweeping personnel restrictions. The Pentagon pulled the plug on the effort after about four months. The Biden administration had set a goal of the U.S. sea route and pier providing food to feed 1.5 million people for 90 days. It fell short, bringing in enough to feed about 450,000 people for a month before shutting down, according to a USAID inspector general’s report. ___ Hadjicostis reported from Nicosia, Cyprus.

Recent whale deaths highlight risks from Antarctica's booming krill fishery	MIAMI (AP) — Two humpback whales were found dead and another seriously injured this year in huge nets used to collect krill for fishmeal and omega-3 pills near Antarctica, The Associated Press has learned. The whale deaths, which have not been previously reported, were discussed during recent negotiations between the U.S., China, Russia and two dozen other countries in which officials failed to make progress on long-debated conservation goals and lifted some fishing limits in the Southern Ocean that have been in place since 2009. Taken together, the whale deaths and rollback of the catch limits represent a setback for the remote krill fishery, which has boomed in recent years and is set to expand even further following the acquisition of its biggest harvester, Norway’s Aker BioMarine, by a deep-pocketed American private equity firm. AP journalists last year spent more than two weeks in the frigid waters around Antarctica aboard a conservation vessel operated by Sea Shepherd Global to take a rare, up-close look at the world’s southernmost fishery. As part of that investigation, the AP followed the tiny crustacean on its journey from the fragile ecosystem, where it is the main nourishment for whales, to salmon farms in Europe, Canada and Australia, pet food manufacturers in China and a former ice cream factory in Houston that produces 80% of the world’s nutrient-rich krill oil. Delegates to the annual meeting in Australia of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, or CCAMLR, shared with the AP unpublished reports of the whale deaths on the condition of anonymity because the talks, which ended last week, are not open to the public. Officials at CCAMLR, which was established in 1982 to protect the international waters near Antarctica, didn’t comment. Under a conservation agreement developed almost two decades ago, the krill catch has soared: from 104,728 metric tons in 2007 to 424,203 metric tons in 2023 as larger, more sophisticated vessels have joined the chase. So far this year, the catch has jumped to 498,000 metric tons — the highest on record, according to the unpublished reports. Although fishing is still below a previously agreed limit and barely 1% of the estimated biomass of 63 million metric tons of krill found in the main Antarctic fishing grounds, direct competition between marine mammals has resulted in whale deaths before. But following the first ever recorded entanglements of four humpback whales in 2021 and 2022, Aker BioMarine redesigned its fishing nets, which regularly vacuum up to 500 metric tons of krill per day - the equivalent daily diet for about 150 humpback whales. First, it added a rope barrier to repel large mammals and then, last fall, it developed a second barrier to close a still sizable gap that can threaten whales swimming vertically. The new net had not yet been installed when a juvenile humpback was observed dead Jan. 27 on the Antarctic Endurance, the company’s most advanced supertrawler, according to a report presented by Norwegian negotiators at the CCAMLR meeting. The reasons behind the second death in May involving another Aker BioMarine ship remain unclear. But two days earlier the ship reported difficulty maneuvering its net and blubber was recovered on the ship's conveyor belt, suggesting the dead whale had been trapped by the net for some time, the report said. A third humpback was hauled alive in late January on a Chilean-flagged vessel, the Antarctic Endeavor, using traditional trawling gear. After the ship's crew struggled for 40 minutes to cut the net tightly wrapped around the 15-meter-long (15-yard-long) male, the whale, with blood on its tail, was dumped back into the ocean. 'Upon release it was lethargic and had some injuries from rubbing with the net,' according to a report by Chile's delegation to the CCAMLR talks that included graphic images of the capture. Although the whale was observed swimming, the capture was considered a mortality event by CCAMLR scientists because the released whale's injuries were likely to prove fatal. Attempts to contact the trawler's owner, Pesca Chile SA, were unsuccessful. A minke whale was also found dead after entangling itself in a buoy line belonging to a South Korean vessel targeting Patagonian toothfish, which is also managed by CCAMLR. It was the first ever whale death recorded in the fishery. Pressure on krill stocks is building as a result of surging demand for omega-3 pills taken as dietary supplements, advances in fishing and rising ocean temperatures due to climate change. This summer, New York-based American Industrial Partners acquired a majority stake in Aker BioMarine's feed business with the goal of positioning krill as a premium ingredient for the aquaculture industry, now the source for about half the world's seafood. Webjørn Barstad, CEO of the new company, Aker BioMarine Antarctic, said developing new technologies to mitigate risks of whale mortalities is a top priority. Starting next season, he said, its entire fleet will be equipped with special stretch sensors that will alert the crew when a whale has interacted with the mesh front of a trawler's net. Underwater cameras may also be used, he said. 'Our goal is always zero incidents,' Barstad said in an interview. 'Hopefully the net will do the job but we will try something else as well.' CCAMLR, whose mission is conservation, is tasked with refereeing the fishing industry. But in recent years, progress has stalled due to geopolitical wrangling, especially opposition from China and Russia. Coming into the latest meeting, hopes were high that delegates would approve a new management plan to further spread the krill catch and finally adopt a California-sized reserve along the Antarctic Peninsula, a highly sensitive ecosystem. Currently, less than 5% of the Southern Ocean is protected — well behind CCAMLR’s target and not nearly enough to meet a United Nations goal to preserve 30% of the world’s oceans by 2030. But a tentative deal fell apart over a last minute proposal by the UK and Australia for an even lower catch limit than the one agreed to during talks over the summer, according to one delegate who spoke to AP. China, objecting to the persistent Western demands, then withdrew its support for the marine reserve and refused to renew the existing management system. The result: a 620,000 metric ton catch limit that for 15 years has divvied fishing into four quota areas can now be concentrated into even smaller krill hotspots, some of them teeming with wildlife, including seals and penguins, some already showing signs of stress from competition with fishing, tourism and climate change. 'The meeting was a huge disappointment, even by the low standards that we've come to expect,' said Evan Bloom, who for 15 years, until his retirement from the State Department in 2020, led the U.S. delegation to the annual CCAMLR meeting. 'Krill is the base of the food chain in Antarctica and fishing for krill must be handled sustainably if the entire ecosystem is to thrive,' said Bloom, adding that in the absence of further action by CCAMLR and given the advances in fishing the 'prospects for harming the ecosystem have now increased.' Barstad said the krill industry will consider putting its own voluntary limits in place in the absence of an updated CCAMLR framework. 'Whether it’s a big setback, I’m not so sure,' he said. 'Once you go beyond the emotion and come to terms with the fact that a regulation that had been standing for quite some years now suddenly disappeared, a little bit out of the blue, I think it could create a better atmosphere for discussing how to progress sustainably based on science.' ___ This story was supported by funding from the Walton Family Foundation.

North Korean troops in Russian uniforms are heading toward Ukraine, US says	WASHINGTON (AP) — Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Wednesday that North Korean troops wearing Russian uniforms and carrying Russian equipment are moving to the Kursk region near Ukraine, in what he called a dangerous and destabilizing development. Austin was speaking at a press conference in Washington with South Korean Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun, as concerns grow about Pyongyang’s deployment of as many as 11,000 troops to Russia. The U.S. and South Korea say some of the North Korean troops are heading to Russia’s Kursk region on the border with Ukraine, where the Kremlin’s forces have struggled to push back a Ukrainian incursion. One senior Korean official said more than 3,000 of them are believed to have moved toward combat zones in western Russia, without specifying the locations. Some North Korean advance units have already arrived in the Kursk region. Austin said 'the likelihood is pretty high' that Russia will use the North Korean troops in combat. He said officials are discussing what to do about the deployment, which he said has the potential to broaden or lengthen the conflict in Ukraine. Asked if it could prompt other nations to get more directly involved in the conflict, he acknowledged that it could 'encourage others to take action' but he provided no details. Kim said he doesn't necessarily believe the deployment will trigger war on the Korean Peninsula, but could increase security threats between the two nations. There is a 'high possibly' that Pyongyang would ask for higher technologies in exchange for its troop deployment, such as receiving tactical nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities, he said, speaking through an interpreter. Both Kim and Austin called on North Korea to withdraw its troops. North Korea’s move to tighten its relationship with Russia have triggered alarms across the globe, as leaders worry about how it may expand the war in Ukraine and what Russian military aid will be delivered to Pyongyang in exchange. 'They're doing this because (Russian President Vladimir) Putin has lost a lot of troops,' Austin said, adding that Moscow has a choice between mobilizing more of its own forces or turning to others for help. Already, he noted, Russia has sought military weapons from other nations. Those include North Korea and Iran. The U.S. has estimated there are about 10,000 North Korean troops now in Russia. Seoul and its allies, however, assess that the number dispatched to Russia has increased to 11,000, according to a senior South Korean presidential official, who spoke on condition of anonymity during a background briefing. A Ukrainian official told The Associated Press that North Korean troops are currently stationed 50 kilometers (30 miles) away from the Ukrainian border with Russia. The official was not authorized to disclose the information publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The official did not provide any additional detail. Russia has had to shift some resources to the Kursk border region to respond to Ukraine's offensive there. U.S. leaders have suggested that the use of North Korean forces to augment Russia's defenses indicates that Moscow’s losses during the more than two-year war have significantly degraded its military strength. North Korea has also provided munitions to Russia and earlier this month the White House released images it said were of North Korea shipping 1,000 containers of military equipment there by rail. A key worrisome question is what North Korea will get in return for providing the troops. But officials have yet to say specifically what Pyongyang may have requested or Moscow has offered. In their meeting at the Pentagon Kim and Austin agreed to continue conducting large-scale military exercises, increase nuclear deterrence cooperation and upgrade both countries' abilities to deter and respond to North Korean missile launches by improving early launch warning systems, according to a fact sheet released by the Pentagon Wednesday. Austin and Kim are scheduled to meet with Secretary of State Antony Blinken and South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul at the State Department on Thursday. —- AP reporter Kim Tong-hyung contributed from Seoul, South Korea.	https://apnews.com/article/united-states-north-korea-russia-ukraine-war-faeabb0b2c2ea162bbc6c4691df4d6c8	2024-10-30T09:31:24-07:00	
Haiti sees a rise in killings and police executions with children targeted, UN says	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — More than 1,740 people were reported killed or injured in Haiti from July to September, a nearly 30% increase over the previous trimester, according to the latest numbers released Wednesday by U.N. officials. The surge in violence comes as gangs seize control of 85% of the capital of Port-au-Prince — up from 80% — while a U.N.-backed mission led by Kenyan police to quell gang violence struggles with a lack of funding and personnel, prompting calls for a U.N. peacekeeping mission. 'In the absence of state representatives, gangs increasingly claim roles typically assigned to the police and the judiciary while imposing their own rules,' warned the United Nations Integrated Office in Haiti, known as BINUH. The 1,223 killings reported in the third trimester are largely blamed on gang violence, although law enforcement officials carried out at least 106 extrajudicial killings, with victims including six children as young as 10 years old who were accused of passing information to gang members, BINUH said. Of the 106 extrajudicial killings, 96 were carried out by police officers and 10 others by Jean Ernest Muscadin, public prosecutor for the southern coastal city of Miragoâne. Overall, Muscadin is accused of killing at least 36 people since 2022 who were suspected of being gang members or of committing 'common crimes,' BINUH said. A spokesperson for Haiti’s National Police did not respond to requests for comment, while Muscadin declined comment and hung up when reached by phone. Extreme brutality Gangs now have an estimated 5,500 members after recruiting mainly children who work as scouts, carry weapons and ammunition and even participate in combat, according to a U.N. Security Council report released Monday. It noted that children may represent up to 50% of all gang members. 'The dire situation in Haiti makes children more vulnerable to recruitment by gangs,' the report stated. 'A lack of access to education, employment and basic necessities creates a situation where joining gangs is seen as the only viable means of survival.' Among those killed this trimester are at least 669 people during police operations against gangs, with three-fourths of the victims suspected gang members and one-fourth of them civilians, the BINUH report stated. 'Information gathered … points to a possible disproportionate use of lethal force and a lack of precautionary measures to protect the population during police operations,' BINUH said. The number of people killed or injured from July to September increased by 27% compared with the second trimester, although there was a 32% drop compared with the first trimester. The majority of killings and injuries – 234 – occurred in La Saline slum of Port-au-Prince, most of them inside residents’ makeshift homes as gangs vie for control of Haiti’s main port and its container terminal, according to the report. Gangs also recently occupied the communities of Carrefour and Gressier in the Port-au-Prince metropolitan area, using 'extreme brutality to bring residents under their control,' BINUH said. In one case, a plainclothes policeman was stopped by gang members in mid-August: 'He was mutilated, then forced to eat parts of his body, before being burned alive.' At least 122 killings were blamed on self-defense groups that formed last year and have targeted suspected gang members or people accused of crimes including stealing animals or cell phones. 'Victims were mutilated with machetes, stoned, decapitated, burned alive or buried alive,' the report said. 'Children were not spared.' Overall, at least 59 children were killed or injured in the third trimester. The U.N. noted that the number of self-defense groups doubled to around 60 from January to July. ‘I think it's the end of my life' Most of the violence remains centered in the capital of Port-au-Prince and the central region of Artibonite, where dozens of people were killed in a massacre earlier this month. In one bright spot, the number of kidnappings plummeted to 170 during the third trimester compared with earlier this year, with more than 60% of cases occurring in Artibonite, according to the report. In the second trimester, at least 428 people were kidnapped. Sexual violence remains pervasive, with at least 55 victims reporting gang rape, including girls and women ages 10 to 70, according to the report, which noted that such cases are largely under-reported. Women and girls are attacked inside their homes or while walking on streets or using public transportation, with some sexually exploited for months by gang members, BINUH said. Gang violence has left more than 700,000 people homeless in recent years, and it has surged this month, with gunmen trying to take over Solino, one of the last communities in Port-au-Prince that is not under their control. 'There’s a complete destruction of people’s lives,' said Jean Renel Volma, a 55-year-old unemployed security guard who recently fled Solino with his wife and two children after living there for more than two decades. 'It was dark, there was tremendous shooting, everybody was yelling. It’s the worst I’ve ever seen in Solino,' he said as he recalled how they were only able to flee with the clothes they had on. Originally from the southern coastal town of Les Cayes, Volma said he can't take refuge there because gangs control the main roads leading out of Port-au-Prince: 'I don’t know what I’m going to do. There is no exit.' Volma is one of hundreds of people who crowded into a church in nearby Nazon after being left homeless as gunfire echoed nearby on Wednesday. The U.N. report noted that gangs are targeting Solino and Delmas 24 to gain access to middle-class neighborhoods, including Nazon. 'The aim is to bring in more income from kidnappings and extortion of businesses in this wealthy area,' it stated. Among those temporarily living at the church is Alicia Joseph, a 60-year-old mother of three children. While her children live with a friend who took them in, there was no space for her. 'I think it’s the end of my life. I lost everything,' she said. Her losses include her 85-year-old mother, who wasn't able to flee with the rest of the family when the gang attacked. 'I thought they would spare her life,' Joseph said, adding that her mother died inside their home when gangs set it on fire. ___ Coto reported from San Juan, Puerto Rico	https://apnews.com/article/haiti-police-gang-violence-un-mission-63fbb5f85019668f793e80069b8f0558	2024-10-30T07:53:29-07:00	
US airstrikes target multiple sites in Syria, killing up to 35 Islamic State militants	WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. military has struck a number of Islamic State group camps in Syria this week, killing as many as 35 militants, U.S. Central Command said Wednesday. The airstrikes in the desert of central Syria were done Monday evening and targeted multiple locations and senior leaders of the group. The attacks came on the heels of a number of joint operations with Iraqi forces that targeted IS militants in Iraq. Pentagon officials have said that the Islamic State group remains a threat in the region, but it is no longer as powerful as it was 10 years ago when the militants swept across Iraq and Syria, taking control of large swaths of the two countries. U.S. Central Command said the latest strikes in Syria will disrupt the group's ability to plan, organize and conduct attacks against civilians and U.S. and allied forces in the region. It said there were no indications of civilian casualties in the strikes.	https://apnews.com/article/islamic-state-group-us-airstrikes-syria-pentagon-4a997c6b994185aec8d57660aef06a24	2024-10-30T07:03:32-07:00	
3 Pakistani soldiers and 8 militants killed during a raid on insurgents' hideout	PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) — Three soldiers and eight militants were killed after Pakistani security forces backed by military helicopters raided a hideout in a former stronghold of insurgents in a restive province bordering Afghanistan on Wednesday, police said. A local militant commander was believed to be among those killed in the operation in Bannu, a district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, local police official Zahid Ullah said. The military said a major was among the soldiers 'martyred' during the intelligence-based operation, adding that its forces were going after other militants in the area 'to wipe out the menace of terrorism.' Authorities often carry out such operations against the Pakistani Taliban, who are known as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP. The TTP — an ally of the Afghan Taliban despite being a separate group — has stepped up its assaults in the region since the Taliban seized power in Afghanistan in 2021. Government forces have also intensified their operations against separatist groups based in the restive southwestern Balochistan province.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-security-forces-raid-militant-hideout-859c0173e886dcbc321e72a82fc4443f	2024-10-30T06:47:10-07:00	
US sanctions 398 firms in more than a dozen countries, accusing them of helping Russia's war effort	WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. on Wednesday imposed sanctions on 398 firms across Russia, India, China and more than a dozen other nations, accusing them of providing products and services that enable Russia’s war effort and aid its ability to evade sanctions. The effort spearheaded by the Treasury and State departments is aimed at punishing 'third party countries' that are accused of providing material assistance to the Kremlin or assisting Russia in evading the thousands of sanctions that have been imposed on the country since its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Among those sanctioned by the Treasury Department are 274 companies accused of supplying Russia with advanced technology, as well as Russia-based defense and manufacturing firms that produce or finish military products that maintain the weaponry used against Ukraine. Additionally, the State Department imposed diplomatic sanctions on several senior Russian Ministry of Defense officials and defense companies, a group of China-based companies that export dual-use goods that fill critical gaps in Russia’s military-industrial base and entities and individuals in Belarus related to the Lukashenko regime’s support for Russia’s defense industry. Treasury's Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo said the U.S. and its allies 'are unyielding in our resolve to diminish and degrade Russia’s ability to equip its war machine and stop those seeking to aid their efforts through circumvention or evasion of our sanctions and export controls.' Wednesday’s action is the latest in a series of thousands of U.S. sanctions that have been imposed on Russian firms and their suppliers in other nations since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The effectiveness of the sanctions has been questioned, especially as Russia has continued to support its economy by selling oil and gas on international markets. The Biden administration acknowledges that sanctions alone cannot stop Russia’s war on Ukraine. And many policy experts say the sanctions are not strong enough — as evidenced by the growth of the Russian economy. A senior Treasury official told reporters on a call to preview the Wednesday sanctions that deepening ties between Russia and North Korea are a sign of Russia's desperation to find support during the war. North Korea said Tuesday its top diplomat is visiting Russia, as rival South Korea and Western nations say the North has sent thousands of troops to support Russia’s war effort. Earlier this year, the U.S. passed an aid package for Ukraine that allows the administration to seize Russian state assets located in the U.S. and use them for the benefit of Kyiv. Shortly thereafter, the leaders of the Group of Seven wealthy democracies agreed to engineer a $50 billion loan to help Ukraine in its fight for survival. Interest earned on profits from Russia’s $300 billion in frozen central bank assets mostly in Europe would be used as collateral.	https://apnews.com/article/treasury-sanctions-finance-russia-ukraine-92d32f9041d24d371d8afb89d4df603e	2024-10-30T06:35:40-07:00	
A new push to wind down the Middle East wars faces familiar challenges	BEIRUT (AP) — The United States and other mediators are ramping up efforts to halt the wars in Lebanon and the Gaza Strip, circulating new proposals to wind down the regional conflict during the Biden administration’s final months. Negotiations on both fronts have been stalled for months and none of the warring parties have shown any sign of backing down from their demands. Senior White House officials Brett McGurk and Amos Hochstein are scheduled to visit Israel on Thursday for talks on possible cease-fires in both Lebanon and Gaza, and the release of hostages held by Hamas. CIA Director Bill Burns will go to Egypt to discuss those efforts. A proposal to end the war between Israel and Hezbollah calls for a two-month cease-fire during which Israeli forces would withdraw from Lebanon, and Hezbollah would end its armed presence along the country's southern border, two other officials familiar with the talks said. But Israel is unlikely to trust U.N. peacekeepers and Lebanese troops to keep Hezbollah out of a reestablished buffer zone in Lebanon. It wants the freedom to strike the militants if needed. Lebanese officials want a complete withdrawal. Separately, the U.S., Egypt and Qatar have proposed a four-week cease-fire in Gaza during which Hamas would release up to 10 hostages, according to an Egyptian official and a Western diplomat. But Hamas still appears unwilling to release scores of hostages without securing a lasting cease-fire and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, even after the killing of its top leader, Yahya Sinwar. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted on lasting Israeli control over parts of the territory. In Lebanon, a push to revive the UN resolution that ended the last war During his visit to Beirut last week, Hochstein met with Lebanon’s Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri. They agreed on a roadmap on how to implement U.N. Security Council resolution 1701, which ended the 34-day Israel-Hezbollah war in 2006, according to a Lebanese official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door talks. The resolution stipulates a cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah, withdrawal of Israeli forces from all Lebanese territory, and withdrawal of all armed forces except for U.N. peacekeepers and the Lebanese army from the area south of the Litani River, some 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of the border. On Wednesday, Hezbollah's newly chosen leader, Naim Kassem, said the group will not 'beg' for a cease-fire. 'If the Israelis decide to stop the aggression, we say that we accept, but according to the conditions that we see as suitable,' he said during a televised address. Israel has not publicly commented on the proposal to end the fighting in Lebanon, which started more than a year ago and dramatically intensified in mid-September. U.S. officials say there are competing proposals being discussed for a cease-fire in Lebanon, including one idea calling for an immediate truce followed by two months to fully implement the resolution. The Lebanese official said that once a cease-fire is reached, a 60-day period will start in which the Lebanese army and the peacekeeping force known as UNIFIL would deploy in the border area as Israeli forces and Hezbollah fighters withdraw. The Lebanese official said the roadmap includes increasing the number of U.N. peacekeepers from 10,000 to 15,000 and boosting the number of Lebanese troops south of the Litani from 4,000 to 15,000. Resolution 1701 also called for 'the disarmament of all armed groups in Lebanon,' including Hezbollah, but that is not part of the initial implementation phase under the current proposal. Another official familiar with the talks said Israel has requested that any deal include measures to prevent Hezbollah from rearming and guarantees that Israel would be able to act in the buffer zone to combat threats from the militant group. It is unclear if Lebanon would agree to a deal that allows Israel to continue military operations on Lebanese territory. Lebanese officials have insisted there should be no alteration to Resolution 1701, which stipulates a full Israeli withdrawal. Hezbollah has said it will not halt its rocket fire on Israel unless there is a cease-fire in Gaza. It is not clear whether that stance has changed after the killing of Hezbollah's longtime leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and several other top commanders in Israeli airstrikes last month. The U.S. hopes the cease-fire initiatives can prevent the war in Lebanon from becoming as destructive as the war in Gaza, even as it supports Israel's efforts to clear out Hezbollah infrastructure along the country's southern border, said U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller. Mediators propose a limited cease-fire in Gaza The U.S., Egypt and Qatar have proposed a four-week cease-fire in Gaza in which eight to 10 hostages would be released, according to a senior Egyptian official. Under the plan, humanitarian aid to Gaza would be scaled up, but there would be no guarantees of future talks on a permanent cease-fire, the official said. Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people and abducted around 250 in the Oct. 7 attack that triggered the war. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed over 43,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not say how many were combatants but say more than half were women and children. Around 100 hostages are still being held in Gaza, about a third of whom are believed to be dead. The latest proposal is based on an initiative by Egypt's President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, who proposed a two-day cease-fire in exchange for the release of four hostages last week. Netanyahu, who has always said he is open to temporary truces for the release of hostages, said in a statement that he had not received a formal proposal based on the Egyptian initiative but 'would have accepted it immediately.' Hamas has said it is open to discussing alternative proposals but has stood by its demands for a lasting cease-fire, an Israeli withdrawal and the release of Palestinian prisoners. The Egyptian official said the mediators were not optimistic. A Western diplomat in Cairo confirmed that their government had been briefed on the proposal, saying it was being pursued in parallel to the efforts for a cease-fire in Lebanon. Both officials in Egypt spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the talks. ___ Frankel reported from Jerusalem and Magdy from Cairo.

Election 2024 Latest: Trump and Harris lean into the campaign’s last leg with less than a week left	Donald Trump and Kamala Harris will crisscross several swing states on Wednesday, passing each other in Wisconsin, where the former president is scheduled to appear in Green Bay with a one-time local icon, retired NFL quarterback Brett Favre. Mumford &amp; Sons, Gracie Abrams, Remi Wolf and members of the band The National are expected to appear at Harris' rally Wednesday night in Madison. Harris on Tuesday sought to remind Americans what life was like under Trump and then offered voters a different path forward if they send her to the White House, in a speech billed as her campaign’s closing argument. Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: Nikki Haley chides Trump and Biden On Tuesday, Republican Nikki Haley said she was critical of 'this masculine bromance stuff' that Trump and his allies are promoting. A day later, during an appearance on SiriusXM, she condemned Biden for calling Trump supporters 'garbage.' Haley said, 'At what point does everybody not get — people are smart, they just want to know what you’re going to do to make their life better. They don’t want to be called a name. This isn’t a schoolyard. Like, stop.' Biden will attend the presidential inauguration in January WASHINGTON — 'Yes, he will,' said White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, when asked if Biden will attend the inauguration regardless of whether Harris or Trump is elected. Jean-Pierre said the president believes in and is committed to the peaceful transfer of power and will be on hand for it. Then-President Donald Trump broke with historical precedent in January 2021 after he lost his bid for reelection to Biden and did not attend Biden’s swearing-in at the Capitol. Trump calls for ‘one-day voting’ ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. — 'We used to have one-day voting,' Trump told a packed hall in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, almost two weeks into the pivotal Southern state’s early voting period, and less than a week from election day. Standing in front of a blue banner emblazoned with 'Vote Early,' the Republican presidential nominee argued that a single day of balloting reduced the risk of mishandling ballots. Trump painted a scenario where election office workers might have to move boxes of early ballots, mockingly impersonating anonymous elections workers as saying, 'There were 14 boxes. Now there are six. What happened to the rest of them?' Trump’s campaign is promoting early voting, as the banner suggested, as the campaign has argued that Trump must compete within the current election structure to win. The suggestion that more than one day of voting could corrupt the results was in keeping with Trump’s continued and unfounded suggestion that the 2020 election, which he lost to Democratic President Joe Biden, was marred by widespread fraud. Pennsylvania’s top election official urges people to get their information from ‘trusted sources’ In just the past week, Pennsylvania has seen false and misleading videos surface online, including a video purporting to show an election worker in Bucks County destroying mail ballots cast for former President Donald Trump. County officials quickly debunked the video and federal officials have said Russian actors were behind it as part of an effort to undermine public confidence in the election. 'We know there is already a lot of mis- and disinformation about Pennsylvania’s elections, and it’s likely to continue in the coming days and weeks ahead,' Al Schmidt, Pennsylvania’s secretary of state, said Wednesday. 'It’s critical that, at this juncture in the election cycle, voters get their information from trusted sources. Spreading videos and other information that lack context, sharing social posts filled with half-truths or even outright lies is harmful to our representative democracy.' Officials in Northampton County say false claims around another video, in which a postal worker was filmed delivering ballots, were damaging lies that put routine election operations in a 'false light.' Pennsylvania postal worker filmed delivering ballots is targeted online with misinformation An interim postmaster filmed delivering ballots to a county courthouse in eastern Pennsylvania is being falsely accused of wrongdoing on social media, according to the county government. Northampton County Executive Lamont McClure told The Associated Press in a phone interview that online videos and screengrabs posted with accusations that the worker committed election fraud or was 'acting suspect' are damaging lies that put routine election operations in a 'false light.' 'This is a postal service servant doing his public duty,' McClure said. 'Folks should find out all the facts before they go sharing things online.' McClure said the courthouse is surrounded by security cameras and other safeguards to ensure the election runs smoothly. The video, which spread rapidly on the social platform X with users actively trying to identify the worker, is the latest example of groundless misinformation that has erupted this week in Pennsylvania, a key battleground in the presidential election. Trump responds to Biden’s comment by accusing him of treating Americans like ‘garbage’ 'Joe Biden finally said what he really thinks of our supporters. He called them ‘garbage.’ And they mean it. Even though, without question, my supporters are far higher-quality than crooked Joe’s,' Trump told an audience in Rocky Mount, North Carolina. 'My response is very simple: You can’t lead America if you don’t love Americans. You just can’t,' Trump said. He went on to suggest that the administration was mistreating Americans by returning to his familiar theme of immigrants who have entered the country illegally. 'We know what they believe,' he said. 'Because look at how they’ve treated you. They’ve treated you like garbage.' Harris is ‘trying to disassociate herself’ from Biden’s policies, Trump says ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. — But the GOP nominee added that his rival’s proposals to boost the U.S. economy 'are the plans of a simpleton. They’re not going to work.' After a man in the audience criticized Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump laughed. 'He screams, ‘she’s an idiot,’ but I didn’t say it,' Trump said, smiling. A new addition to Trump’s rally line-up is a video showing clips of all the times Harris in her Tuesday night speech in Washington mentioned his name, more than a dozen times. 'She suffers from a very serious disease known as Trump derangement syndrome,' he said after the video played. 'Many Democrats suffer from that disease, and it’s only because of one reason, because we’re winning.' Trump tells voters in North Carolina that ‘the fate of our nation is in your hands’ ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. — Donald Trump said Wednesday he has seen 'even more enthusiasm' in this White House run than in his presidential runs in the 2016 and 2020 cycles. Calling Vice President Kamala Harris 'a low IQ individual,' Trump said his Democratic rival is 'running a campaign of hate, anger and retribution.' He entered the arena in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, as the song 'God Bless the USA' played. His next stop is Green Bay, Wisconsin. Minnesota Rep. Tom Emmer refers to Walz as Harris’ ‘emotional support animal’ ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. — Emmer was one of the introductory speakers at Trump’s rally in Rocky Mount. The Republican congressman said the Harris’ campaign has been struggling ever since Walz faced off against Ohio Rep. JD Vance in the vice presidential debate at the beginning of the month. Polls have not indicated a significant change since then. But Emmer said of Walz, 'He was supposed to be Kamala’s emotional support animal. But guess what? JD Vance ended that.' Harris responds to a protester by slamming Trump RALEIGH, N.C. — When Vice President Kamala Harris’ speech in North Carolina on Wednesday was interrupted by a protester, the Democratic nominee used the moment to attack her opponent, former President Donald Trump. The man, who yelled that Harris was 'disrespecting the Palestinian community' and interrupted her speech, was drowned out by the crowd chanting Harris’ name. Harris has faced a series of pro-Palestinian protests in recent days. 'This is the thing, we know we’re actually fighting for a democracy,' Harris said. 'Unlike Donald Trump, I don’t believe that people who disagree with you are the enemy.' Trump has increasingly become fixated on Americans he believes have wronged or betrayed him, referring to them as 'the enemy from within.' Democrats have seized on the line, accusing Trump, should he win another term in office, of planning to use the power of a White House against Americans who disagree with him. Harris says Trump is angling to ‘ban abortion nationwide’ RALEIGH, N.C. — Harris, speaking at a rally in North Carolina on Wednesday, lamented that a third of women live in a state with 'a Trump abortion ban, including North Carolina and every state in the South except for Virginia.' Trump was central in remaking the Supreme Court, nominating three conservative justices who were key to overturning Roe v. Wade and federal abortion protections in 2022. Since that decision, abortion has invigorated the Democratic base and threatened Republicans. Trump has since said he wouldn’t sign a federal abortion ban. 'Understand, he’s not done,' Harris said. 'He would ban abortion nationwide.' ‘It is time for a new generation of leadership in America,’ Harris says RALEIGH, N.C. — Vice President Kamala Harris told an audience in North Carolina on Wednesday that this is a moment 'for a new generation of leadership in America,' offering herself as both a transition from former President Donald Trump, and, more subtly, President Joe Biden. Trump is 78 years old and this is his third run for the presidency. Biden, who stepped aside to allow Harris to be the Democratic nominee over the summer, is 81 years old. 'It is time for a new generation of leadership in America. I am ready to offer that leadership,' she said to an audience in Raleigh. 'Let us lock arms with each other knowing that we have so much more in common than what separates us.' 'We know we have an opportunity in this election to turn the page on a decade of Donald Trump who has been trying to keep us divided and afraid of each other,' Harris added. 'We know that is who he is, but North Carolina that is not who we are.' ‘I feel like I made an honest mistake when I voted for Trump in 2016’ RALEIGH, N.C. — Jennifer Bell, a North Carolina engineer who once voted for former President Donald Trump, introduced Vice President Kamala Harris at a rally in Raleigh on Wednesday, highlighting how flipping Trump voters and independents has become central to Harris’ closing message. Bell is the latest in a growing list of former Trump supporters who have introduced Harris or spoken at one of her rallies in the closing days of the campaign. 'I would invite them to, today, join me in putting country before party,' Bell said to one-time Trump voters. 'Let’s put our principles before partisanship and stand up to support a leader who has shown unwavering dedication to bring our country together.' 'As a fiscal conservative, I feel like I made an honest mistake when I voted for Trump in 2016,' Bell said to some boos from the audience. After saying that she thought a businessman would help streamline the government, she added, 'The flaw in the plan is he is a failed businessman.' She later said Trump’s 'extremism destroyed the Republican Party.' Nearly 850,000 people have already cast their ballots in Louisiana BATON ROUGE, La. — A new record has been set for early in-person voting in Louisiana, with 849,784 people casting their ballots ahead of the conclusion of the early voting window on Monday, Secretary of State Nancy Landry announced. The state saw a 3% increase from 2020 during the same time frame, when the former record was set. In total, between early voting and returned absentee ballots, nearly one-third of Louisiana’s registered voters have already cast their vote ahead of the Nov. 5 election. 'I’m pleased that so many Louisianans have already made their voices heard in this election,' Landry said. ‘I don’t consider Trump to be a real Republican’ RALEIGH, N.C. — Jennifer Phelan, 60, said ahead of Vice President Kamala Harris’ rally in Raleigh, North Carolina, that she feels nervous because the election seems so close. To her, it shouldn’t be. 'It just seems very much like a cartoon of good and evil,' Phelan said. She still feels fairly confident in North Carolina flipping blue from the conversations she’s had since she started volunteering in March, as well as the enthusiasm she sees among fellow volunteers. Phelan remembers discussing the race when Biden was atop the Democratic ticket, and she said more people seemed hesitant about supporting him. That hasn’t been the case as much with Harris leading the ticket, she said. She’s also had conversations with some conservatives who said they’d vote for Harris because they don’t like Trump — adding that those were 'real Republicans' in her eyes. 'I don’t consider Trump to be a real Republican,' she said. Sen. Rubio blasts Biden’s ‘garbage’ remark as reflective of every top Democrat U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, who first told Trump at a Tuesday rally in Pennsylvania that President Joe Biden had called the former president’s supporters 'garbage,' is blaming Democrats for these comments. 'Biden only said out loud what every top democrat actually believes about anyone who votes for Trump,' Rubio said on X. Biden was speaking on a campaign call organized by the Hispanic advocacy group Voto Latino about remarks made by comedian Tony Hinchcliffe during Trump’s rally in Madison Square Garden on Sunday where he referred to Puerto Rico as a 'floating island of garbage.' 'The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters. His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American,' Biden had said in the call. ‘We’re the closest we’ve been since Obama won in ’08’ RALEIGH, N.C. — Liz Kazal, a rallygoer at Vice President Kamala Harris’ rally in Raleigh, said she’s 'cautiously optimistic' about the election — a lesson she said she learned from 2016 when Hillary Clinton lost to Donald Trump. 'You hope for the best and plan for the worst,' she said on Wednesday. Kazal, 35, said she’s tried to do some form of volunteering every week — door-knocking with her 2-year-old daughter, phone banking and fundraising for Harris with friends and family. Over the next week, Kazal said she plans to go door-knocking more and hold a phone banking session at her home. 'We’re the closest we’ve been since Obama won in ’08,' Kazal said. Kazal has family members who are Trump supporters, but it’s been hard to talk to them about politics. To Kazal, it seems like Trump 'transcends politics for them.' 'I’m at a loss for how to talk to them,' Kazal said. 'But yeah, I’ve been able to talk about other issues.' Arnold Schwarzengger endorses Kamala Harris and Tim Walz LOS ANGELES — In a lengthy post on the social platform X, the former Republican governor of California said he 'hates' politics more than ever, is not happy with either political party and would prefer to 'tune out.' But, he said, he is endorsing Democrats Harris and Walz because 'I will always be an American before I am a Republican.' Schwarzenegger went on to harshly criticize Donald Trump for rejecting the results of the 2020 presidential vote. '(R)ejecting the results of an election is as un-American as it gets,' he said. 'To someone like me who talks to people all over the world and still knows America is the shining city on a hill, calling America ... a trash can for the world is so unpatriotic, it makes me furious. He ended by saying the country needs to 'close the door on this chapter of American history, and I know that former President Trump won’t do that. He will divide, he will insult, he will find new ways to be more un-American than he already has been, and we, the people, will get nothing but more anger.' Democrats are leaning on celebrity star power. Will it matter? WASHINGTON — Kamala Harris has Bruce Springsteen, Taylor Swift and Beyoncé. Donald Trump has Kid Rock, Waka Flocka Flame and Hulk Hogan. As the 2024 campaign whirls into its final week, Democrats are noticeably leaning on their star power advantage, calling on a diverse range of celebrities to endorse Harris, invigorate audiences and, they hope, spur people to the ballot box. Democrats have long enjoyed a celebrity advantage and used it to close out presidential campaigns when attention and energy are critical. That upper hand has grown during Trump’s rise, a period that saw scores of celebrities, even apolitical stars, break their silence and speak out against the Republican leader. The advantage often means raucous, fiery events in the closing days of a race, but history — namely Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign — highlights how the energy at those events can sometimes paper over broader issues with a candidate. ▶ Read more on the impact of celebrity involvement in campaigning ‘I will represent all Americans, including those who don’t vote for me’ WASHINGTON — Harris said she spoke with Biden Tuesday night after her speech, but his comments in the campaign call didn’t come up. She said: 'I will represent all Americans, including those who don’t vote for me.' The flap over the president’s comments allowed Harris to make her sharpest break yet with Biden during her three-month campaign for the White House. She’s come under fire for not differentiating herself enough from the unpopular Democratic incumbent. Harris says she disagrees ‘with any criticism of people based on who they vote for’ WASHINGTON — The vice president was responding on Wednesday to comments made by President Joe Biden on Tuesday night. Biden was on a campaign call Tuesday evening reacting to a comic who called Puerto Rico garbage during a Trump rally last weekend. The president said, 'The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters.' Biden’s remarks were quickly seized on by Republicans who said he was denigrating Trump supporters, a distraction for Harris when she is trying to reach out to GOP voters. He quickly sent a social media post seeking to clarify his remarks. 'His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable,' Biden said of Trump. 'That’s all I meant to say.' Harris noted that Biden later clarified his comments. Walz says Biden calling Trump supporters ‘garbage’ doesn’t undermine Harris’ unity message. Democratic vice-presidential candidate Tim Walz says Kamala Harris’s unity message wasn’t undermined by President Joe Biden calling Donald Trump’s supporters 'garbage.' Walz said Wednesday on 'CBS Mornings' that Biden 'was very clear that he’s speaking about the rhetoric we heard, so it doesn’t undermine it.' Harris argued the case for her candidacy in a speech Tuesday night in Washington in which she promised to be an inclusive president. During a call Tuesday organized by a Hispanic advocacy group, Biden said the 'only garbage' he sees floating out there are Trump supporters. He was responding to a comic at Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally on Sunday who said Puerto Rico is a 'floating island of garbage.' Biden later clarified his remarks, saying in a post on the social platform X that he was referring to 'hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump’s supporter' at the rally. Walz was also asked about Biden’s comments when he appeared on ABC’s 'Good Morning America' and said the president had issued a clarification. 'Let’s be very clear, the vice president and I have made it absolutely clear that we want everyone as a part of this. Donald Trump’s divisive rhetoric is what needs to end,' Walz said. Trump to campaign with former NFL quarterback Donald Trump will be campaigning with former Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre in Wisconsin on Wednesday night at the same time that popular musicians will be rallying with Vice President Kamala Harris about two hours away in the swing state’s capital city. Mumford &amp; Sons, Gracie Abrams, Remi Wolf and members of the band The National were slated to appear at the Harris rally Wednesday night in Madison. At the same time, about 140 miles (225 kilometers) northeast of there, Trump was to hold a rally not far from Lambeau Field with Favre. Both Harris and Trump will again be in Wisconsin for dueling events on Friday. Trump is holding a rally Friday night in Milwaukee at the Fiserv Center, which was the site of the Republican National Convention. Harris is planning multiple stops in the state but has not said where yet. Wisconsin is one of seven battleground states that’s seen multiple visits from Trump, Harris, their running mates and other surrogates. Two closing arguments show the stark choice between Trump and Harris NEW YORK — In the shadow of the White House, seven days before the final votes of the 2024 election are cast, Kamala Harris vowed to put country over party and warned that Donald Trump is obsessed with revenge and his own personal interests. Less than 48 hours earlier inside Madison Square Garden, Trump called his Democratic opponent 'a trainwreck who has destroyed everything in her path.' His allies on stage labeled Puerto Rico a 'floating island of garbage' and made a baseless claim that Harris, a former prosecutor and senator who is trying to become the first woman to be elected president, had begun her career as a prostitute. Two nights and 200 miles apart, the dueling closing arguments outlined in stark terms the choice U.S. voters face on Nov. 5 when they will weigh two very different visions of leadership and America’s future.

Banning UNRWA will lead to a vacuum and more suffering for Palestinians, the agency's chief says	RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) — The head of the U.N. agency caring for Palestinian refugees said Wednesday that newly passed Israeli laws effectively banning its activities in Israel will leave a vacuum that will cost more lives and create further instability in Gaza and the West Bank. Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner-general of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, or UNRWA, told The Associated Press in an exclusive interview — the first since the laws were passed — that the legislation is 'ultimately against the Palestinians themselves,' effectively denying them a functioning provider of lifesaving services, education and health care. UNRWA has been the main agency procuring and distributing aid in the Gaza Strip, where almost the entire population of around 2.3 million Palestinians relies on the agency for survival amid Israel's nearly 13-month-old war with the militant Hamas group. Tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians are sheltering in UNRWA-run schools. Other aid groups say the agency's strong, decades-old infrastructure across Gaza is irreplaceable. So far, Israel has put forward no plan for getting food, medicine and other supplies to Gaza's population in UNRWA's absence. Israel alleges that Hamas and other militants have infiltrated UNRWA, using its facilities and taking aid — claims for which it has provided little evidence. The laws, passed by parliament this week, sever all ties with UNRWA and ban its operations in Israel. And since the agency's operations in Gaza and the West Bank must go through Israeli authorities, the laws threaten to close its activities there as well. The laws are expected to come into effect in three months. If the Israeli decision is implemented 'this would be a total disaster, it is like throwing (out) the baby with the water,' Lazzarini told the AP, speaking in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, where he is attending a conference to discuss the Mideast conflict. 'This would create a vacuum. It would also feed more instability in the West Bank and Gaza,' he said. 'Having UNRWA ending its activities within the three months would also mean more people will die in Gaza.' He said the agency is looking for 'creative ways to keep our operation going.' He appealed for support from the U.N. General Assembly and donors to keep providing services and called on Israel to rescind the decision or extend the three-month grace period. He said Israel has not officially communicated with the agency following the adoption of the laws. For decades, UNRWA has operated networks of schools, medical facilities and other services around Gaza and the West Bank — as well as in neighboring Lebanon, Syria and Jordan. In Gaza especially, it plays a major role in maintaining social services and the economy, as the territory's largest single employer and the source of education and health care for much of the population. The laws threaten to shut down all those operations, impacting the education and welfare of hundreds of thousands of children well into the future, he said. 'We have today 1 in 2 persons in Gaza below the age of 18, among them 650,000 girls and boys living in the rubble, deeply traumatized at the age of primary and secondary school,' he said. 'Getting rid of UNRWA is also a way to tell these children that you will have no future. We are just sacrificing your education. Education is the only thing which has never, ever been taken away from the Palestinians.' UNRWA was established to help the estimated 700,000 Palestinians who fled or were driven out of what is now Israel during the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation. It now offers support to the refugees and their descendants, who number some 6 million around the region. Lazzarini said the Israeli laws are the 'culmination of years of attack against the agency.' He said 'the objective is to strip the Palestinian from refugee status.' International law gives Palestinian refugees and their descendants the right to return to their homes. Israel has refused to allow their return, saying it would end the Jewish majority in the country. Israel has said the refugees should be taken in by their host countries, and officials often argue that UNRWA's services keep Palestinians' hopes for return alive. In a letter to the U.N, Lazzarini said the Israeli laws and campaign against the agency 'will not terminate the refugee status of the Palestinians, which exists independently of UNRWA’s services, but will severely harm their lives and future.' Israel claims hundreds of Palestinian militants work for UNRWA, without providing evidence, and that more than a dozen employees took part in Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel that ignited the latest war. The U.N. has fired nine staffers after internal investigations found they may have participated in the attack. UNRWA has nearly 30,000 staff around the region, including 13,000 in Gaza, most of them Palestinians. Israel also says Hamas fighters operate in UNRWA schools and other facilities in Gaza — and has hit many of them with airstrikes. UNRWA denies knowingly aiding armed groups and says it acts quickly to purge any suspected militants from its ranks. Lazzarini said Israel has not responded to inquiries from UNRWA for details about other allegations, including that the agency's premises are used by militant groups.. With the continued fighting, the agency has been unable to verify the claims, he said and called for an independent investigation. At least 237 UNRWA staff have been killed in the war in Gaza, a toll among U.N. staff not seen in any other conflict. Over 200 UNRWA facilities have been damaged or destroyed, killing more than 560 people sheltering there. Lazzarini spoke on the sidelines of the conference by the Global Alliance for a Two-State Solution, a Saudi government-created initiative attended by foreign ministers from Arab, Muslim, African and European countries. 'If we want to be successful in any future political transition, we need an agency like UNRWA taking care of education and the primary health of the Palestinian refugees' until there is a viable functioning state or administration to do so, he said. ___ El Deeb reported from Beirut.	https://apnews.com/article/gaza-unrwa-west-bank-israel-aid-1db00a3979b5b8759823e1a81da9c6fb	2024-10-30T04:38:38-07:00	
Georgia begins investigating its disputed election but the opposition calls the probe into question	TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — The Prosecutor’s Office in Georgia said Wednesday it has launched an investigation into alleged vote rigging in last weekend’s parliamentary election, which officials said was won by the ruling party and the opposition denounced as illegitimate. The opposition immediately raised objections that the Prosecutor’s Office would not conduct an independent investigation because its head was appointed by parliament, which is dominated by the Georgian Dream ruling party. Georgian Dream, which has deepened the South Caucasus nation’s ties with Russia, was declared the winner of Saturday’s election with about 54% of the vote. The balloting was seen by many Georgians as a choice between continuing to support the ruling party or seeking closer integration with the European Union. European observers said the election took place in a 'divisive' environment marked by intimidation and instances of vote-buying, double voting and physical violence. Georgian observers also reported multiple violations and said the results do not reflect 'the will of the Georgian people.' The United States and the EU have called for a full and transparent investigation of the alleged violations. Thousands of people rallied outside the parliament building Monday night to hear opposition speakers, including President Salome Zourabichvili, denounce what they called a stolen election. The nation of 3.7 million people, which borders Russia, was granted the status of an EU candidate in 2022, but Brussels halted the process indefinitely after the parliament, dominated by Georgian Dream, adopted a 'foreign influence law,' similar to ones enacted in Russia to crack down on dissent. The party was set up by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia and served briefly as Georgia’s prime minister but has stayed out of public view since 2013. The investigation was requested by the Central Election Commission, and Zourabichvili was summoned for questioning Thursday about the allegations; others 'who may possess information related to the alleged criminal act' also would be questioned, the Prosecutor’s Office said. But Salome Samadashvili of the opposition Strong Georgia coalition, questioned whether the Prosecutor's office was independent of Ivanishvili's influence. 'If somebody thinks that they can fool the Georgian people or our international partners into believing that Bidzina will investigate his own election fraud, they are mistaken. Nobody can be fooled,' Samadashvili said. 'That is why we are saying that the investigation should be conducted by an international mission with the adequate mandate and qualifications. Until this is done, this election cannot and will not have legitimacy or trust,' she added. Zourabichvili, who has a mostly ceremonial role as president, suggested that 'Russian elections' were held in the country, and said 'technology was used to whitewash counterfeiting. Such a thing has never happened before.'	https://apnews.com/article/georgia-election-rigging-investigation-eu-70bf4ba10b156b5222414b1a0fe45d46	2024-10-30T04:34:12-07:00	
Trial begins in the assassination of Rio de Janeiro councilwoman Marielle Franco	RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — A trial opened Wednesday against two former policemen accused in the 2018 killing of Rio de Janeiro councilwoman Marielle Franco, who was Black, bisexual and from humble roots and who has become a major icon of Brazil's political left. Franco, 38, and her driver, Anderson Gomes, were killed in a drive-by shooting on March 14, 2018. Ronnie Lessa is accused of firing the gun, while Élcio Queiroz is accused of being the driver. Two brothers with purported ties to criminal groups — one of them a sitting federal lawmaker — have been accused of ordering the killing, allegedly because the councilwoman's work went against the interests of those gangs, known as militias. They have yet to go on trial. Lessa and Queiroz, arrested in 2019, have signed plea bargains confessing their roles, but the jury has final word on their guilt. Jurors could technically overrule the plea bargains, but analysts say that is unlikely. Hundreds of demonstrators gathered Wednesday in front of the trial venue in Rio de Janeiro, many carrying sunflowers and shouting 'Justice!' 'Today we have a chance to change the face of justice in Rio de Janeiro and in Brazil,' Antônio Francisco da Silva Neto, Marielle’s father, told journalists before the trial began. Her mother, sister and daughter were also on site, as was Anderson’s wife, Agatha Arnaus. 'These individuals, confessed defendants, need to be condemned in an exemplary way so that the message gets across that they are not God, they cannot take the life of any human being and go unpunished,' he added. Known universally by her first name, Marielle, the killing was seen in Brazil as an attack on democracy. Raised in one of Rio’s poor communities known as favelas, she became known for her efforts to improve the lives of ordinary Rio residents. Following her election in 2016, she fought against violence targeting women while defending human rights and social programs. Outrage over her killing sparked mass protests. Her silhouette can be found printed on T-shirts and painted on walls nationwide. The accused faced questions over the double deaths and also the attempted killing of Fernanda Chaves, Franco’s assistant and friend, who was injured but survived. Chaves recounted Marielle’s final moments before the court on Wednesday. 'We were talking about things about life, work, domestic things. At one point she was doubting whether to stop or not to buy bread at the bakery ... It was when the car was going very slowly that I heard a rush... As an immediate reflex, I got down,' Chaves said. 'I noticed (Anderson’s) right arm was off the steering wheel, Marielle was immobile. I felt her arm on top of me, the weight of her body against me.' Lessa told the court that he fired the shots to Marielle's head, and that Anderson was killed accidentally. 'I took the risk, knowing that the ammunition wasn’t appropriate. It was a 9mm ammunition... if it had been a revolver, for example, only the councilwoman would have died, not Anderson,' he said. Prosecutors are seeking the maximum prison sentence for the double killings, which could reach 84 years each, according to Rio’s public prosecutors’ office. In September, Edilson Barbosa dos Santos was convicted of dismantling the car used in the drive-by shooting. But many see Wednesday's trial as the first time some of the main people allegedly responsible for her death are held to account. Both defendants participated in the trial by videoconference from prison. Lessa is in Sao Paulo while Queiroz is in Brazil’s capital, Brasilia. The jury heard eight witnesses, six called by the state public prosecutors’ office and two others by Lessa’s defense. Queiroz’s defense opted not to call any. Federal authorities started investigating the case in earnest once leftist President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva took office in 2023. In March, Federal Police detained federal lawmaker Chiquinho Brazão and his brother Domingos Brazão, a member of Rio state’s accounts watchdog, on suspicion of ordering Franco’s killing. Both are allegedly connected to the militias, which illegally charge residents for various services, including protection. They have denied any involvement in the killing or with militias. In his plea bargain, Lessa told police that the two politician brothers hired him and informed him that the then-chief of the state’s civil police, Rivaldo Barbosa, had signed off beforehand. Barbosa was also arrested in March. Police accuse the politicians of ordering her killing because she was an obstacle to militias’ interests. Guilhermo Catramby, a delegate of the Federal Police, joined the case at the request of the then Minister of Justice, Flávio Dino, early 2023. He said the motivation of the crime was 'undoubtedly' Marielle’s work regarding land rights, even though it wasn’t central to her mandate. 'Marielle’s mandate … (was) a thorn in the side of militia interests, especially in the West Zone of Rio de Janeiro,' he added. Before the trial started, Anielle Franco, Marielle’s sister and Lula’s minister for racial equality, said the day bought a 'mixture of feelings.' 'It’s a certainty that we fought hard and we’re going to keep fighting. Not just for Mari, for Anderson, but for everyone who will come. For my daughters, for my granddaughters and for all the generations to come. So that we have a safer place.'	https://apnews.com/article/brazil-marielle-franco-trial-police-c20b31ebb5f152bfaddf2a0c44722d0b	2024-10-30T04:01:56-07:00	
Afghan women cannot pray loudly or recite in front of other women, says Taliban minister	ISLAMABAD (AP) — Afghan women are forbidden from praying loudly or reciting the Quran in front of other women, according to a Taliban government minister. It’s the latest restriction on women following morality laws that ban them from raising their voice and baring their faces outside the home. They are already excluded from education after sixth grade, many public spaces and most jobs. Nobody from the Vice and Virtue Ministry was immediately available Wednesday to clarify the official’s remarks or confirm if the prohibition would also become part of the morality laws. During an event in eastern Logar province on Sunday, Vice and Virtue Minister Khalid Hanafi said: 'It is prohibited for a grown woman to recite Quranic verses or perform recitations in front of another grown woman. Even chants of takbir (Allahu Akbar) are not permitted.' He said that uttering similar expressions like 'subhanallah,' another word central to the Islamic faith, was also not allowed. A woman was not permitted to perform the call to prayer, he told the gathering. 'So, there is certainly no permission for singing.' Audio of Hanafi’s remarks was shared on the ministry’s social media platforms but was later deleted. The ministry said Tuesday that a nationwide awareness program about the laws is underway involving ministry officials at provincial and district levels. 'Organising such programs will contribute to shaping public perception and increasing awareness of divine rulings,' the ministry added. Afghan provinces are already barring the media from showing images of living things, another controversial and widely criticized feature of the morality laws. The Taliban set up the ministry for the ' propagation of virtue and the prevention of vice' after seizing power in 2021. Since then, the ministry has enforced decrees issued by the Taliban leadership that have a disproportionate impact on women and girls, like dress codes, segregated education and employment, and having a male guardian when they travel.	https://apnews.com/article/afghanistan-women-taliban-morality-laws-1b52f8effabc3058accd59dd07789829	2024-10-30T03:29:18-07:00

Russia and Ukraine exchange drone strikes as North Korea's top diplomat visits Moscow	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia and Ukraine exchanged scores of drone strikes Wednesday as North Korea's top diplomat arrived in Russia for talks after his country reportedly deployed thousands of soldiers to help Moscow's war efforts. Ukraine's air force said that Russia launched 62 drones and one missile overnight, adding that 33 of them were intercepted and 25 were jammed. The drones struck a residential building and a kindergarten in Kyiv, injuring nine people, including a child, according to the city administration. 'Russian drones did not change their constant tactics — they approached the capital from different directions, at different heights,' it said. Russian attacks also targeted other regions of Ukraine, killing at least four and injuring about 30 others over the past 24 hours, authorities said. At the same time, Russian forces have pressed their slow-moving offensive in eastern Ukraine. In Moscow, the Defense Ministry announced the capture of the village of Kruhlyakivka in the Kharkiv region. The ministry said that air defenses downed 25 Ukrainian drones over several regions in the country's west and southwest. The new attacks come as North Korea's Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui arrived in Moscow for talks that South Korea's spy agency said could involve discussions on sending additional troops to Russia and what the North would get in return. The Pentagon said North Korea has sent about 10,000 troops to Russia, and that they will likely fight against Ukraine 'over the next several weeks.' Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, said Tuesday that a 'relatively small number' of North Korean troops are now in the Kursk region, where Russia has struggled to push back a Ukrainian incursion. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-north-korea-39eb411523195516dce893ce47c0faf6	2024-10-30T02:46:10-07:00	
Middle East latest: Israel issues evacuation warning for the entire Baalbek city in eastern Lebanon	The Israeli army issued an evacuation warning for residents in the entire eastern Lebanese city of Baalbeck, along with surrounding areas and key routes in the Bekaa Valley. The area marked for evacuation includes the ancient Roman temple complex, inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage site. Lebanon’s Heath Ministry said more than 2,790 people have been killed and 12,700 wounded since Oct. 8, 2023, when Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel, drawing retaliation. Israeli ground forces invaded southern Lebanon at the beginning of October. Multiple United Nations agencies rallied Tuesday around their fellow organization, UNRWA, that provides aid to Palestinian refugees, after Israel’s parliament took steps to ban it in the coming months. The foreign ministers of Cyprus and Luxembourg say the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees is 'indispensable' to providing food, education and health care to Palestinians. Turkey’s Foreign Ministry called Israel’s decision a 'clear violation of international law.' United States President Joe Biden’s administration says it is seeking an explanation from Israel about its attack Tuesday on a town in northern Gaza that Palestinians say killed at least 88 people, including dozens of women and children. The death toll from more than a year of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza has passed 43,000, Palestinian officials reported Monday, without distinguishing between civilians and combatants. The Israel-Hamas war began after Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. ___ Here’s the latest: Israeli military says Tuesday’s strike on Gaza building was targeted JERUSALEM — An Israeli military official says the target of Tuesday’s attack on a five-story building that Gaza health officials reported resulted in scores of deaths was a spotter with binoculars in the building, and that the intent was not to destroy the structure. The military official agreed to provide details only on condition of anonymity, citing military protocol and the ongoing investigation into the incident. The official said Wednesday the building was not known to be a shelter for civilians, and that it collapsed as a result of the strike on the spotter. The Gaza Health Ministry said Tuesday that at least 70 people were killed in the first of two strikes on the northern Gaza town of Beit Lahiya, and that more than half of the victims were women and children. The Israeli military had earlier said it was investigating the strike. The Gaza Health Ministry’s casualty tolls do not differentiate between civilians and militant fighters. The official said there were discrepancies between the numbers of victims reported by authorities in Gaza and what Israeli intelligence indicates, and that the victims included known militants. The official did not provide detailed evidence to support that assertion. The Israeli military has repeatedly struck shelters for displaced people in recent months. It says it carries out precise strikes targeting Palestinian militants and tries to avoid harming civilians, but the strikes often kill women and children. —By Adam Schreck Israeli hospital officials say rocket from Lebanon wounded 2 JERUSALEM — Hospital officials in Israel say a rocket fired from Lebanon has wounded two men, one seriously. The men were wounded by rocket shrapnel on Wednesday in Metula, an Israeli town just across the border from Lebanon, said a spokesperson for the Rambam Hospital, where they were airlifted. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. Hezbollah has fired thousands of rockets into Israel since Oct. 8, 2023, when it opened fire in solidarity with Hamas a day after its cross-border attack from the Gaza Strip. All-out war erupted last month, when Israel carried out large waves of airstrikes and killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and most of his senior commanders. Israel launched a ground invasion at the start of October. Israel issues an evacuation warning for the entire Baalbek city in eastern Lebanon BEIRUT — For the first time in the ongoing Israel-Hezbollah war, the Israeli army has issued an evacuation warning for residents in the entire eastern city of Baalbek, along with surrounding areas and key routes in the Bekaa Valley. Earlier Wednesday, a drone strike targeted a van on Lebanon's Aaraya highway, a major road linking Beirut to the Bekaa, about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the Lebanese capital, resulting in flames, according to Lebanese state media. Another vehicle in Bchamoun, roughly 10 kilometers (6 miles) southeast of Beirut, was also targeted, as reported by the state-run National News Agency. This is the first time in the conflict that the area is targeted. The number of casualties and the intended targets were not yet known. The area marked in Wednesday’s evacuation order includes the ancient Roman temple complex, inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage site. On Oct. 6, an Israeli strike hit some 700 meters (750 yards) away from the ancient citadel, which houses two of the largest Roman temples in the world. Norway wants clarity on Israel's obligation to Palestinians under international law OSLO, Norway — Norway is asking for a clarification on Israel’s responsibility under international law when preventing the United Nations, international humanitarian organizations and states from helping Palestinians. 'The international community cannot accept that the U.N., international humanitarian organizations and states face systematic obstacles to being able to work in Palestine and provide humanitarian aid to the Palestinians under occupation,' Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre said Wednesday. 'It undermines the Palestinians’ right to vital aid. Then we have to react.' The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, also known as UNRWA, provides essential services to millions of Palestinians across the Middle East and has underpinned aid efforts in Gaza throughout the Israel-Hamas war. Legislation barring it from operating in Israel passed with an overwhelming majority Monday. Israel says UNRWA has allowed itself to be infiltrated by Hamas, with the militants siphoning off aid and using the agency’s facilities as shields. UNRWA denies the allegations, saying it is committed to neutrality and acts quickly to address any wrongdoing by its staff. Norway has called for a resolution in the U.N. General Assembly that asks the International Court of Justice 'to give an advisory opinion on the duties of Israel as an occupying power to facilitate aid to the population of Palestine.' Gahr Støre added that a number of countries have expressed support for the initiative, in addition to UNRWA. Under international law, Israel has an obligation to help the Palestinian population under occupation, Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said. 'With this initiative, Norway wants to establish that no country can rise above its obligations under international law,' Barth Eide said. 'We see similar trends in other countries — that leaders try to undermine humanitarian law and aid work in situations of crisis and conflict. We must stop this development.'	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-hezbollah-mideast-latest-30-october-2024-32c614e64e8959768ac3f50aa67548ea	2024-10-30T02:25:10-07:00	
A New Zealand city waves goodbye to its 'disturbing' giant hand sculpture that many came to love	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Perched on two fingers on the roof of an art gallery in Wellington, New Zealand, the giant sculpture of a hand has loomed over the city for five years. Named Quasi, the 16 feet — almost 5 meters — creation of Australia-based sculptor Ronnie van Hout bears an unsmiling human face — because why not? Some found it disturbing, and now, after five years of provoking controversy and myriad emotions — from horror and revulsion to delight — among residents of New Zealand’s capital, Quasi will be removed from the roof of City Gallery this week. It will be taken to a new home, the gallery said Wednesday. 'This is either a great day for Wellington or a terrible day for Wellington and there’s not much view in between,' said Ben McNulty, a Wellington city council member. Personally, McNulty told The Associated Press he felt 'devastated' by the sculpture’s departure. Quasi is made of steel, polystyrene and resin, and was based on scans of van Hout’s hand and face. It was named in part for Quasimodo, the bellringer in Victor Hugo’s 1831 novel 'The Hunchback of Notre-Dame.' Hence the male gender some have attributed to Quasi. Quasi first graced — or haunted — an art gallery in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 2016 but proved polarizing. It was the subject of an op ed in the local newspaper listing reasons the sculpture 'must go,' including claims that one of its outstretched fingers 'appears to be inappropriately and belligerently pointing at pedestrians and office workers.' 'Perhaps the monster just wants to be loved?' van Hout responded at the time. In 2019, Quasi was installed in Wellington, where he grew over time on its residents. 'He arrived and I won’t say the city unanimously hated him but I reckon 80% were like, ‘What is this monster? What have we done?’' McNulty said. 'But I think that over time there’s been a bit of a softening, there’s sort of a pro-Quasi group, which I consider myself part of,' he added. On Wednesday, many at Wellington’s Civic Square, where the gallery with Quasi is located, said they had warmed to him too. 'It’s really disturbing but it’s a staple of Wellington now,' said Anja Porthouse, who had brought friends and family to see Quasi and was 'gutted' it was leaving. Quasi is to be lifted from the roof by helicopter on Saturday, when the giant hand will travel to an undisclosed location in Australia, the gallery said. 'Everything comes to an end eventually,' van Hout told the AP. 'I am sure it will be missed, but even Lovecraftian nightmares have to return to where they came from, and now you only have an absence to reflect on.' Dozens responded to the news on social media with dismay, glee and jokes about the curse that local lore has attributed to Quasi being lifted. The sculpture has adorned the Wellington skyline during 'some of its most difficult times,' McNulty said. The city has struggled with earthquake-prone buildings, widespread plumbing problems and political division in recent years. Other comments took guesses about where Quasi might end up. 'He’s going to The Hague,' wrote one New Zealander on X. 'He will be missed,' said Jane Black, who heads the Wellington Sculpture Trust. 'I’ll personally be pleased to see it head somewhere else for a change,' the city's mayor, Tory Whanau, told the AP. 'I think there’s a strong feeling of relief.'	https://apnews.com/article/quasi-giant-hand-wellington-sculpture-zealand-art-cfcd3599eda341b78741dcfcf519edbd	2024-10-30T01:34:20-07:00	
More spending and tax hikes expected in Britain in the Labour government's first budget	LONDON (AP) — British Treasury chief Rachel Reeves will deliver her first budget in Parliament on Wednesday, a tightrope act that aims to find billions for investment through borrowing and tax hikes without roiling businesses or raising taxes on working people. It’s the first budget by a Labour Party government in almost 15 years, and the first ever delivered by a female finance minister. It could set the tone for the length of the current parliament, which runs until 2029, and the party's ability to win a second term at the next election. Reeves, who left her offices at No. 11 Downing Street with the famous red briefcase that contains the budget in hand, has a tough balancing act. She has pledged to put 'more pounds in people’s pockets,' give a much-needed financial boost to public services, such as schools and hospitals, and get the economy growing. All this has to be done within the confines of stretched public finances, which the government has said are in a much worse state than thought when it was elected in July. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has warned that the budget will reflect 'the harsh light of fiscal reality' but that there will no return to the austerity that marked the early years of the previous Conservative government after it was first elected in 2010. The center-left Labour Party was elected July 4 after promising to banish years of turmoil and scandal under Conservative governments, get Britain’s economy growing and restore frayed public services, especially the state-funded National Health Service. The center-left government argues that higher taxes and limited public spending increases are needed to 'fix the foundations' of an economy that it argues has been undermined by 14 years of Conservative government. The Conservatives say they left an economy that was growing, albeit modestly, with lower levels of debt and a smaller deficit than many other Group of Seven wealthy nations. Pumping money into health, education and housing is a priority of the new government, made harder by a sluggish economy, hobbled by rising public debt and low growth. The government also says there is a 22 billion pound ($29 billion) 'black hole' in the public finances left by the Conservative government. That means the budget is certain to include tax increases — though Labour has pledged not to raise the tax burden on 'working people,' a term whose definition has been hotly debated in the media for weeks. The Treasury has announced that about 3 million of the lowest-paid workers will get a 6.7% pay increase next year, with he minimum wage rising to 12.21 pounds ($15.90) an hour. Reeves — Britain’s first female chancellor of the exchequer, a position that has existed for some 800 years — is widely expected to tweak the government’s debt rules so that she can borrow billions more for investment in the health system, schools, railways and other big infrastructure projects, and to raise money by hiking tax paid by employers, though not employees. 'The U.K. is at a critical juncture: after years of sluggish growth and deteriorating public infrastructure, a sustained rise in government investment is vital to promote long-term growth and boost living standards,' said Monica George Michail, an economist at the independent think tank The National Institute of Economic and Social Research. Though the budget is set to be one of the most consequential in years, Reeves will no doubt be careful not to cause concern in financial markets. Two years ago, the short-lived premiership of Liz Truss foundered after a series of unfunded tax cuts roiled financial markets and sent borrowing costs surging. Her successor Rishi Sunak sought to get a grip on the public finances but was unable to dislodge the notion that the Conservative Party had lost control of the economy, arguably the biggest reason why it suffered its worst election defeat in 200 years. In the run-up to the budget statement, the U.K.'s borrowing costs in the markets have edged higher, suggesting there is some unease about the path ahead.	https://apnews.com/article/britain-budget-reeves-labour-tax-spending-11443e4186797dcc91446dc50dcad6c5	2024-10-30T01:28:02-07:00	
At least 63 people die in devastating flash floods in eastern Spain	BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — At least 63 people have died in eastern Spain after flash floods swept away cars, turned village streets into rivers and disrupted rail lines and highways in the worst natural disaster to hit the European nation in recent memory. Emergency services in the eastern region of Valencia confirmed a death toll of 62 people on Wednesday. The central government office for Castilla La Mancha region added that an 88-year-old woman was found dead in the city of Cuenca. Rainstorms on Tuesday caused flooding in a wide swath of southern and eastern Spain, stretching from Malaga to Valencia. Floods of mud-colored water tumbled vehicles down streets at high speeds, while pieces of wood swirled in the water with household items. Police and rescue services used helicopters to lift people from their homes and rubber boats to reach drivers trapped on the roofs of cars. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said dozens of towns had been flooded and warned that the danger is not over. 'For those who are looking for their loved ones, all of Spain feels your pain,' Sánchez said in a televised address. 'Our priority is to help you. We are putting all the resources necessary so that we can recover from this tragedy.' Authorities reported several missing people late Tuesday, but the following morning brought the shocking announcement of dozens found dead. 'Yesterday was the worst day of my life,' Ricardo Gabaldón, the mayor of Utiel, a town in Valencia, told national broadcaster RTVE. He said several people were still missing in his town. 'We were trapped like rats. Cars and trash containers were flowing down the streets. The water was rising to three meters,' he said. Over 1,000 soldiers from Spain’s emergency response units were deployed to the devastated areas. Rescue services were also rushing eastwards from other parts of Spain. Spain’s central government set up a crisis committee to help coordinate rescue efforts. One elderly couple was rescued from the upper story of their house by a military unit using a bulldozer, with three soldiers accompanying them in the huge shovel. Television reports showed videos shot by panicked residents documenting waters flooding the ground floors of apartments, streams bursting their banks and bridges giving way. Spain has experienced similar autumn storms in recent years. Nothing, however, compared to the devastation over the last two days, which recalls floods in Germany and Belgium in 2021 that saw 230 people killed. The death toll will likely rise with other regions yet to report victims and search efforts continuing in areas with difficult access. In the village of Letur in the neighboring Castilla La Mancha region, Mayor Sergio Marín Sánchez said six people were missing. Spain is still recovering from a severe drought and continues to register record high temperatures in recent years. Scientists say increased episodes of extreme weather are likely linked to climate change. The storms unleashed a freak hailstorm which punched holes in car windows and greenhouses as well as a rarely seen tornado. Transport was also impacted. A high-speed train with nearly 300 people on board derailed near Malaga, although rail authorities said no one was hurt. High-speed train service between Valencia city and Madrid was interrupted, as were commuter lines. Valencian regional President Carlos Mazón urged people to stay at home, with travel by road already difficult due to fallen trees and wrecked vehicles. As the waters fell, thick layers of mud mixed with refuse made streets unrecognizable. 'The neighborhood is destroyed, all the cars are on top of each other, it’s literally smashed up,' Christian Viena, a bar owner in the Valencian village of Barrio de la Torre, said by phone. 'Everything is a total wreck, everything is ready to be thrown away. The mud is almost 30 centimeters deep.' Outside Viena's bar, people were venturing out to see what they could salvage. Cars were piled up and the streets were filled with clumps of water-logged branches. Relatives of the missing filled social media and local television and radio outlets with appeals to find their loved ones. Leonardo Enrique told RTVE that his family had been searching for hours for his son, Leonardo Enrique Rivera, 40, who was driving a delivery van when it began to rain. His son had sent a message saying his van was flooding and that he had been hit by another vehicle when he was near Ribarroja, an industrial town which is one of the worst affected, Enrique said. Located south of Barcelona down the Mediterranean coast, Valencia is a tourist destination known for its beaches, citrus orchards, and as the home of Spain’s paella rice dish. Like some other areas of Spain, Valencia has gorges and small riverbeds that spend much of the year completely dry but quickly fill with water when it rains. Many of them pass through populated areas. The rain had subsided in Valencia by late Wednesday morning as the storm headed north, prompting authorities in the Barcelona region to issue weather alerts. ___ Associated Press journalist Teresa Medrano in Madrid contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/spain-floods-valencia-weather-ef0dffabe1a106a05c239dca4dfec1ae	2024-10-30T00:03:44-07:00	
North Korean troops sent to Russia may be pleased to be there, even as they face ferocious fighting	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — The thousands of young soldiers North Korea has sent to Russia, reportedly to help fight against Ukraine, include many elite special forces, but that hasn't stopped speculation they'll be slaughtered because they have no combat experience, no familiarity with the terrain and will likely be dropped onto the most ferocious battlefields. That may be true, and soon. Observers say some of the troops have already arrived at the front. From the North Korean perspective, however, these soldiers might not be as miserable as outsiders think. They may, in fact, view their Russian tour with pride and as a rare chance to make good money, see a foreign country for the first time and win preferred treatment for their families back home, according to former North Korean soldiers. 'They are too young and won't understand exactly what it means. They'll just consider it an honor to be selected as the ones to go to Russia among the many North Korean soldiers,' said Lee Woong-gil, a former member of the same special forces unit, the Storm Corps. He came to South Korea in 2007. 'But I think most of them won’t likely come back home alive.' Troop deployment is Kim's ‘big gamble’ Worries about North Korea’s likely participation in the Russian-Ukraine war were highlighted this week when the Pentagon said North Korea has sent about 10,000 troops to Russia, and that they will likely fight against Ukraine 'over the next several weeks.' South Korea’s presidential office said Wednesday that more than 3,000 North Korean soldiers have been moved close to battlefronts in western Russia. North Korea's troop deployment could mark a serious escalation of the almost three-year war. It caught many outside observers by surprise because North Korea has its own security headache, a festering standoff with the United States and South Korea over its nuclear program. Large North Korean troop casualties would be a major political blow for the country’s 40-year-old ruler, Kim Jong Un, whose government hasn't formally confirmed the deployment. But experts say Kim may see this as a way to get much needed foreign currency and security support from Russia in return for joining Russia's war against Ukraine. 'Kim Jong Un is taking a big gamble. If there are no large casualty numbers, he will get what he wants to some extent. But things will change a lot if many of his soldiers die in battle,' said Ahn Chan-il, a former North Korean army first lieutenant who is now head of the World Institute for North Korean Studies think tank in Seoul. Ordinary soldier's wage is less than $1, defectors say The Storm Corps, also known as the 11th Corps, is one of Kim’s top units. Its main missions would be infiltrating agents into South Korea, blowing up important facilities in the South and assassinating key figures in the event of war on the Korean Peninsula. Lee, who served in the Storm Corps in 1998-2003, recalled that his unit received better food and supplies than other units, but many members still suffered from malnutrition and tuberculosis. Despite a gradual economic recovery in North Korea over the past 30 years, defectors say the average monthly wage for ordinary North Korean workers and soldiers is less than $1. They say many people engage in capitalist market activities to make a living because the country's state rationing system remains largely broken. Russia is expected to pay all the costs related to the deployment of North Korean troops, including their wages, which observers estimate will be at least $2,000 per month for each person. About 90% to 95% of their stipends will likely go to Kim’s coffers, and the rest to the soldiers. This means one year of service in Russia would earn a North Korean soldier $1,200 to $2,400. That's big enough to prompt many young soldiers to volunteer for risky Russian tours, former soldiers say. Ahn said North Korea will likely offer other incentives meant to elevate the social standings of soldiers, such as membership in the ruling Workers’ Party and the right to move to Pyongyang, the country’s showcase capital. Kang Mi-Jin, a defector who runs a company analyzing North Korea’s economy, said even family members of soldiers sent to Russia could be given benefits such as good houses or entrance to good universities. Choi Jung-hoon, a former first lieutenant in North Korea’s army, said serving on foreign soil will attract many soldiers who are eager to see other countries for the first time. North Koreans are barred from accessing foreign news and need state approval to move from one province to another within the country. North Korean construction, logging and other workers sent abroad to bring in foreign currency have often been called 'slaves' by international human rights groups. But defectors testify that such overseas jobs are often better than staying in North Korea, and many used bribery and family connections to get them. 'North Korean soldiers would see going to Russia as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,' Ahn said. Ahn and other observers say such views could change if the soldiers see colleagues dying in large numbers. They say many North Korean soldiers could surrender to Ukraine forces and ask for resettlement in South Korea. North Korean soldiers lack familiarity of the terrain North Korean soldiers have been trained on the Korean Peninsula's mountainous terrain and are not familiar with the largely flat plain battlefields in the Russian-Ukraine war. They also don't understand modern warfare, including drone use, because North Korea hasn’t fought a big battle since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War, experts say. 'My heart ached,' said Choi, now leader of an activist group in Seoul, when he saw a Ukraine-released video purportedly showing undersized North Korean soldiers believed to be in their late teens or early 20s. 'None would think they are going to Russia to die,' Choi said. 'But I think they're cannon fodder because they will be sent to the most dangerous sites and will surely be killed.' Leader Kim Jong Un may also be hoping that his troop offer will push Russia to share sophisticated and highly sensitive technology that he needs to perfect his nuclear-capable missiles. That transfer could depend on how long the war continues and how many more troops Kim will send. Nam Sung-wook, a former director of a think tank run by South Korea’s spy agency, said North Korea will likely get hundreds of millions of dollars because of the soldiers' wages. The soldiers will get direct experience of modern warfare but will likely die in large numbers, and Russia will be reluctant to hand over its high-tech missile technology, he said. 'North Korea will continue to hide its troop dispatches from its own people because the public will be agitated if they know their soldiers are being sent abroad to be killed,' said Nam, who is now a professor at Korea University in South Korea.	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-soldiers-russia-ukraine-war-651ac7615c3124fde657043a9193d6b1	2024-10-29T23:46:30-07:00	
In Lebanon, a family's memories are detonated along with their village	ARAMOUN, Lebanon (AP) — Ayman Jaber’s memories are rooted in every corner of Mhaibib, the village in southern Lebanon he refers to as his 'habibti,' the Arabic word for 'beloved.' The root of the village’s name means 'the lover' or 'the beloved.' Reminiscing about his childhood sweetheart, the 45-year-old avionics technician talks about how the young pair would meet in a courtyard near his uncle's house. 'I used to wait for her there to see her,' Jaber recalls with a smile. 'Half of the village knew about us.' The fond memory contrasts sharply with recent images of his hometown. Mhaibib, perched on a hill close to the Israeli border, was leveled by a series of explosions on Oct. 16. The Israeli army released a video showing blasts ripping through the village in the Marjayoun province, razing dozens of homes to dust. The scene has been repeated in villages across southern Lebanon since Israel launched its invasion a month ago with the stated goal of pushing Hezbollah militants back from the border. On Oct. 26, massive explosions in and around Odaisseh sparked an earthquake alert in northern Israel. Israel says it wants to destroy a massive network of Hezbollah tunnels in the border area. But for the people who have been displaced, the attacks are also destroying a lifetime of memories. Mhaibib had endured sporadic targeting since Hezbollah and Israeli forces began exchanging fire on Oct. 8 last year. Jaber was living in Aramoun, just south of Beirut, before the war, and the rest of his family evacuated from Mhaibib after the border skirmishes ignited. Some of them left their possessions behind and sought refuge in Syria. Jaber's father and two sisters, Zeinab and Fatima, moved in with him. In the living room of their temporary home, the siblings sip Arabic coffee while their father chain-smokes. 'My father breaks my heart. He is 70 years old, frail and has been waiting for over a year to return to Mhaibib,' Zeinab said. 'He left his five cows there. He keeps asking, ‘Do you think they’re still alive?’' Mhaibib was a close-knit rural village, with about 70 historic stone homes lining its narrow streets. Families grew tobacco, wheat, mulukhiyah (jute mallow) and olives, planting them each spring and waking before dawn in the summer to harvest the crops. The village was also known for an ancient shrine dedicated to Benjamin, the son of Jacob, an important figure in Judaism. In Islam, he is known as the prophet Benjamin Bin Yaacoub, believed to be the 12th son of prophet Yaacoub and the brother of prophet Yousef. The shrine was damaged in the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, then renovated. Pictures show the shrine enclosed in a golden cage adorned with intricate Arabic inscriptions beside an old stone mosque crowned by a minaret that overlooked the village. The mosque and the shrine are now gone. Hisham Younes, who runs the environmental organization Green Southerners, says generations of southerners admired Mhaibib for its one-or two-story stone homes, some built by Jaber’s grandfather and his friends. 'Detonating an entire village is a form of collective punishment and war crime. What do they gain from destroying shrines, churches and old homes?' Younes asks. Abdelmoe’m Shucair, the mayor of neighboring Mays el Jabal, told the Associated Press that the last few dozen families living in Mhaibib fled before the Israeli destruction began, as had residents of surrounding villages. Jaber's sisters attended school in Mays al-Jabal. That school was also destroyed in a series of massive explosions. After finishing her studies in Beirut, Zeinab worked in a pharmacy in the neighboring village of Blida. That pharmacy, too, is gone after the Israeli military detonated part of that village. Israeli forces even bulldozed their village cemetery where generations of family members are buried. 'I don’t belong to any political group,' Zeinab says. 'Why did my home, my life, have to be taken from me?' She says she can't bring herself to watch the video of her village’s destruction. 'When my brother played it, I ran from the room.' To process what’s happening, Fatima says she closes her eyes and takes herself back to Mhaibib. She sees the sun setting, vividly painting the sky stretching over their family gatherings on the upstairs patio, framed by their mother’s flowers. The family painstakingly expanded their home over a decade. 'It took us 10 years to add just one room,' Fatima said. 'First, my dad laid the flooring, then the walls, the roof and the glass windows. My mom sold a year’s worth of homemade preserves to furnish it.' She paused. 'And it was gone in an instant.' In the midst of war, Zeinab married quietly. Now she’s six months pregnant. She had hoped to be back in Mhaibib in time for the delivery. Her brother was born when Mhaibib and other villages in southern Lebanon were under Israeli occupation. Jaber remembers traveling from Beirut to Mhaibib, passing through Israeli checkpoints and a final crossing before entering the village. 'There were security checks and interrogations. The process used to take a full or half a day,' he says. And inside the village, they always felt like they were 'under surveillance.' His family also fled the village during the war with Israel in 2006, and when they returned they found their homes vandalized but still standing. An uncle and a grandmother were among those killed in the 34-day conflict, but a loquat tree the matriarch had planted next to their home endured. This time, there is no home to return to and even the loquat tree is gone. Jaber worries Israel will again set up a permanent presence in southern Lebanon and that he won't be able to reconstruct the home he built over the last six years for himself, his wife and their two sons. 'When this war ends, we’ll go back,' Ayman says quietly. 'We’ll pitch tents if we have to and stay until we rebuild our houses.'	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-hezbollah-village-detonated-mhaibib-0d1220d7f23ca2ca66e9030b36fefa9c	2024-10-29T21:35:27-07:00	
Botswana's election decides if a party that's been in power for 58 years gets another term	GABORONE, Botswana (AP) — Polls opened in an election in Botswana on Wednesday and a country was set to decide if one of Africa's longest-ruling parties stays in power for another five-year term. The Botswana Democratic Party has been in power in the southern African nation for 58 years since independence from Britain in 1966. The one-day election will decide the makeup of Parliament and lawmakers will later elect the president. President Mokgweetsi Masisi, a 63-year-old former high school teacher and United Nations employee, is seeking a second and final term. Botswana has been held up as one of Africa's success stories as a peaceful and stable democracy with one of the best standards of living in the region, but it is facing new economic challenges that have pushed the BDP to concede that policy change is needed. That's largely because of a global downturn in demand for diamonds, which Botswana's economy relies on. Unemployment in the nation of some 2.5 million people has risen to 27% this year, and it's significantly higher for young people. The BDP says it has listened to the concerns of voters and is open to policy changes that could diversify an economy where diamonds account for more than 80% of Botswana's exports and a quarter of the GDP, according to the World Bank. Three men have registered to challenge Masisi for president: Duma Boko of the main opposition Umbrella for Democratic Change party, Dumelang Saleshando of the Botswana Congress Party and Mephato Reatile from the Botswana Patriotic Front. Counting is expected to start straight after polls close Wednesday evening and the results could be announced within days. While the BDP has dominated Botswanan politics since independence, recent economic uncertainty has closed the gap between it and the opposition, analysts say. Botswana is the second biggest producer of diamonds behind Russia and has been responsible for all the biggest rough gems found in the past decade. But sales of rough diamonds at Debswana, the company the Botswana government jointly owns with the De Beers Group and a critical source of state revenue, were down nearly 50% in the first half of 2024, according to authorities. That has put a dent in the public purse and raised criticism of Masisi and the BDP for not taking steps to diversify the economy. Government employees have received their salaries late as a result of the tight financial position, taking the shine off of Botswana’s reputation for efficient government. Ahead of the election, the BDP said it would now put emphasis on processing mineral resources for new revenue streams, while also building the agriculture and tourism sectors. Just over a million people have registered to vote, according to the Independent Electoral Commission. Botswana is larger than France but has a small population, with the Kalahari Desert covering large portions of the landlocked country that borders South Africa. Drought and desertification threaten Botswana’s development and the livelihoods of many of its people. The election could also revive Masisi’s feud with former President Ian Khama, the man he succeeded as Botswana’s leader and then fell out with. Khama, the son of Botswana’s founding president, quit the BDP and went into exile in South Africa in 2021, accusing Masisi of taking an authoritarian approach to criticism. Khama was charged with illegal possession of a firearm and receiving stolen property in a criminal case he said was politically motivated to silence him. Khama returned to Botswana in September to attend a court hearing and has campaigned for the Botswana Patriotic Front in an attempt to oust Masisi. ___ AP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa	https://apnews.com/article/botswana-election-bdp-masisi-7ae583e904f30e4fe3df3e6de2ecefb6	2024-10-29T20:54:16-07:00	
Japan's Nikkei rises over 1% after Big Tech stocks push Nasdaq to record high	HONG KONG (AP) — Asian markets were mixed on Wednesday with Japan's benchmark index gaining more than 1% after a rally in technology stocks propelled the Nasdaq composite to a record high. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was down 1.3% to 20,438.54 and the Shanghai Composite index dropped 0.6% to 3,267.42. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 index was up 1.3% at 39,390.49, as the Bank of Japan began a two-day policy meeting on Wednesday. Australia’s S&amp;P/ASX 200 dipped 0.9% to 8,177.90 after its inflation rate in the third quarter came in at 2.8%, the lowest level in more than three years, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Elsewhere, South Korea’s Kospi was down 0.8% to 2,596.61 and Taiwan’s Taiex gained 0.1%. U.S. futures and oil prices rose. The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.2% to 5,832.92 on Tuesday. Gains for influential Big Tech stocks helped mask weakness elsewhere, and they pushed the Nasdaq composite up 0.8% to 18,712.75. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, meanwhile, fell 0.4% to 42,233.05. Mortgage rates have been climbing recently because the 10-year Treasury yield has been charging higher. Yields have rallied as report after report has shown the U.S. economy remains stronger than expected. On Tuesday, reports said confidence among U.S. consumers jumped more than economists expected, while the number of job openings edged lower in September, but the number of hires remained relatively steady. Such numbers have forced traders to ratchet back expectations for how much the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates, now that it’s just as focused on keeping the economy humming as getting inflation down. Traders are even betting on a slim chance the Fed will keep its main interest rate steady at its meeting next week, according to data from CME Group. That’s after the Fed kicked off its rate-cutting campaign in September with a larger-than-usual reduction. Just a month ago, many traders were thinking the Fed would follow up in November with another bigger-than-usual cut. Yields have also climbed as investors have seen former President Donald Trump’s chances of re-election improving. Economists say a Trump win could help push inflation higher in the long term, and worsening inflation could lead to higher interest rates. Trump Media &amp; Technology Group, the company that tends to move more with Trump’s re-election odds than on its own profit prospects, climbed another 8.8% to $51.51 Tuesday. It moved so sharply during the day that trading of its stock was briefly halted several times. The parent company of Trump’s Truth Social platform has been rallying since hitting a bottom of roughly $12 in late September. Treasury yields, like stocks, have historically tended to be shaky heading into an Election Day, only to calm afterward regardless of which party wins. In other dealings early Thursday, U.S. benchmark crude oil gained 36 cents to $67.57 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard, surged 36 cents to $71.09 per barrel. The dollar slipped to 153.31 Japanese yen from 153.36 yen.

A man is arrested on suspicion of killing a woman in a Hong Kong park	HONG KONG (AP) — A foreign man living in Hong Kong has been arrested on suspicion of killing a Southeast Asian woman at a waterfall inside a park in the Chinese territory. The woman, who was about 25 years old, was a domestic worker in Hong Kong but did not work for the suspect, police superintendent Sin Kwok-ming told reporters Tuesday night. The woman went to the waterfall inside a park in Pok Fu Lam on Hong Kong Island on Sunday night with the suspect, but he rushed off alone in a taxi after staying there for about half an hour, police said. On Monday morning, residents spotted the woman's body floating in the pond below the waterfall, Sin said. An initial autopsy showed the woman drowned after being hit in the head with an unspecified hard object. Sin said the woman had injuries to her head and limbs. The suspect and his wife, a Hong Konger, had gone to mainland China before officers arrested them when they returned to the city on Tuesday, Sin said. The man was detained on suspicion of murder and his wife was held on suspicion of assisting offenders. The man holds a Hong Kong identity card, but police did not specify which country he or the victim was from. 'We found so many unreasonable things related to the arrested man. He didn't report to the police and immediately left Hong Kong after the incident. Some evidence related to him had disappeared too,' Sin said. The investigation was continuing. The man and his wife were still in detention and have not been charged as of Wednesday morning, police said. 'This case involves a person’s life, and we take that very seriously. We will carefully unravel every detail to uncover the truth and to bring justice to the deceased,' Sin said.	https://apnews.com/article/hong-kong-woman-killed-e38e424a0cc5b972e605dd89eeeb3899	2024-10-29T20:35:48-07:00	
How Putin views the choice between Harris and Trump, and what the election means for Russia	The question posed to Vladimir Putin in September about the U.S. election drew a wry smile and an arched eyebrow from the Russian president. Asked whether he preferred Donald Trump or Kamala Harris, Putin caught listeners up short with his teasing reply that also included a gentle jab at President Joe Biden. 'Our ‘favorite,’ if you can call it that, was the current president, Mr. Biden,' he told the audience at an economic forum in the Far East port of Vladivostok. 'But he was removed from the race, and he recommended all his supporters to support Ms. Harris. Well, we will do so — we will support her,' he said sardonically, citing her 'expressive and infectious laugh' that shows 'she’s doing well.' The election Tuesday carries significant stakes for the Kremlin, and despite Putin's noncommittal and somewhat teasing answer, it appeared to encapsulate Russia's view as a choice between two unappealing possibilities. Analysts say neither offers much promise of improving relations that have hit their lowest point since the Cold War. Harris, the current vice president, has taken a hard line against Russia, while Trump, the former president, is known for his admiration of Putin. Still, at the September gathering, Putin complained that when Trump was in office, there were 'so many restrictions and sanctions against Russia like no other president has ever introduced before him.' Timothy Colton of the Harvard Academy for International and Area Studies said that the Kremlin leadership is 'by and large convinced nothing good is going to come in the election from Russia’s point of view.' But he added that on the whole, Trump 'is probably their preference; he’s more of a known quantity.' Key issues for Russia as the U.S. election looms: What will happen to aid for Ukraine? Harris is seen as likely to continue the Biden administration's massive military and economic support for Ukraine as Russia's invasion stretches toward a third year. Trump has bragged that his rapport with Putin and respect from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy are so strong that he could negotiate an end to the war 'in 24 hours.' He declines to detail his strategy, but recent remarks criticizing sanctions in general suggest he could lift those against Russia as an inducement to help settle the conflict. During their debate, Trump twice refused to directly answer whether he wanted Ukraine to win the war, while Harris praised Western support for Kyiv and urged it to continue. 'Otherwise, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv with his eyes on the rest of Europe. Starting with Poland,' she said. Trump's running-mate Sen. JD Vance has mentioned proposals that could suggest Trump's thinking: having Ukraine demilitarize territory occupied by Russia and agree to permanent neutrality. Those terms would be anathema to Kyiv, but Trump has shown little sympathy for Ukraine, saying Zelenskyy 'should never have let that war start.' Harris has not specified how her position would differ from Biden's. The U.S. has provided Ukraine more than $59.5 billion in weapons and assistance since Russia invaded in 2022. She has said previously it would be foolish to risk global alliances the U.S. has established and decried Putin’s 'brutality.' A Harris win 'likely promises continued U.S. support as long at the administration can maintain congressional backing,' the International Crisis Group said in a commentary, though it said she could seek an end to the fighting more actively than Biden did. Growing congressional animosity to vast outlays of aid for Ukraine could hobble or reshape her strategy. How will the U.S. approach Russia on human rights? Harris has confronted Russia directly on such matters, particularly in the case of the death in prison of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. She was among the first foreign leaders to comment on his death, calling it 'a further sign of Putin’s brutality.' Trump put off comment for days, then did not connect Putin to the matter. He likened Navalny’s punishment to his own fraud prosecution, calling his case 'a form of Navalny.' Trump has called for a bill declaring there to be only two genders and pledged to keep transgender women out of women’s sports — positions that parallel how Russia under Putin has rolled back LGBTQ+ rights and lauded 'traditional values.' His characterization of Democrats and his rivals as 'the enemy within' is little different in spirit than Russia's accelerating suppression of opposition. How will NATO be affected? Trump has wrestled with other members of the NATO alliance, demanding that they meet the agreed spending levels for their militaries in their national budgets. He said that as president, he warned leaders that he would not only refuse to defend nations that don’t meet those targets, but that Russia could 'do whatever the hell they want' to such countries. Trump also has questioned the NATO charter's mutual-defense clause, asking in an interview why the United States should be obliged to defend the 'very aggressive people' of NATO member Montenegro. Harris says the United States' commitment to NATO is 'ironclad.' She has not weighed in on whether she supports Ukraine becoming an alliance member. What about arms control deals with Russia? Putin has repeatedly brandished the nuclear sword as he seeks to deter the West from supporting Ukraine. The last remaining nuclear arms control treaty between Moscow and Washington, New START, is to expire in 2026. a year after the new administration takes office, and its prospects are troubled. Biden renewed the treaty quickly upon taking office, and Harris could be expected to follow that support for the pact that limits the number of intercontinental nuclear missile launchers. Russia suspended participation in 2023 — although it did not withdraw — and the U.S. retaliated with measures including halting the sharing of information on missiles' location and status. Trump, although he has warned of the threat of 'nuclear warming,' took steps while in office to dismantle the arms control regime, including pulling out of the INF Treaty on intermediate-range nuclear weapons — which banned ground-based nuclear and conventional missiles with a range of 500-5,500 kilometers (310-3,410 miles), While in office, Trump called for a new nuclear pact that would include both Russia and China.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-putin-election-trump-harris-biden-a94e45dfb0912bf44d5f83532b977b3b	2024-10-29T20:26:05-07:00	
How Mexican cartels manage the flow of migrants on their way to the US border	CIUDAD HIDALGO, Mexico (AP) — The first place where many migrants sleep after entering Mexico from Guatemala is inside a large structure, a roof above and fenced-in sides on a rural ranch. They call it the 'chicken coop' and they don’t get to leave until they pay the cartel that runs it. Migrant encounters at the U.S.-Mexico border have reached a four-year low, but days before the U.S. election, in which immigration is a key issue, migrants continue pouring into Mexico. While U.S. authorities give much of the credit to their Mexican counterparts for stemming the flow to their shared border, organized crime maintains stricter control of who moves here than the handful of federal agents and National Guardsmen standing by the river. Kidnapped migrants who pay the $100 ransom for their release are stamped to signal that they have paid. From January to August, just in this southernmost corner of Mexico, more than 150,000 migrants were intercepted by immigration agents, considered a fraction of the flow. Six migrant families interviewed by The Associated Press, who had passed through an initial abduction and were held until paying, explained how it works. A Mexican federal official corroborated much of it. They all requested anonymity for fear of reprisals. Mexican immigration agents encountered 925,000 undocumented migrants through August of this year, well above last year’s annual total and triple the 2021 total. Yet, they’ve only deported 16,500, a fraction of previous years. Rev. Heyman Vázquez, a priest in Ciudad Hidalgo along the Suchiate river that divides Mexico and Guatemala, sees it daily. 'It’s them (the cartel) that says who passes and who doesn’t,' Vázquez said. 'The numbers of migrants that they take every day are big and they do it in front of the authorities.' Pay to continue north On Monday morning, Luis Alonso Valle, a 43-year-old Honduran traveling with his wife and two children, climbed off a raft lashed together with truck inner tubes and boards that had carried them across the Suchiate to Mexico. They hadn’t made it 50 yards toward Ciudad Hidalgo before three men approached on a motorcycle to tell them they couldn’t keep walking. Then seeing journalists they left. The family looked scared. In Ciudad Hidalgo’s central plaza, Valle asked for a van that could take them the 23 miles (37 kilometers) to Tapachula, considered the main entry point for southern Mexico. Climbing aboard, the driver asked in a whisper that journalists stop recording. 'They (organized crime) are going to stop me,' he said. This is often how migrants arrive at the ranch. Taxi or van drivers working for the cartel take them there and hand them over. They’re forced to sleep on the ground. 'There were more than 500 people there, some had been there 10, 15 days,' said a Venezuelan woman who was released Sunday with her husband and two children. 'Whoever doesn’t have money stays and whoever decides to pay leaves,' she said. A 28-year-old baker from Ecuador was escorted to a bank to withdraw money to free himself, his wife, daughter and four other relatives. His family was held as insurance until he returned. Once the payment is made, migrants' photos are taken and their skin stamped. Gunmen stop vans and taxis headed to Tapachula and check for the stamps. Those without them are sent back. Migrants said that once they got to Tapachula they were told to wash them off to avoid trouble with other gangs. According to the nongovernmental organization Fray Matias de Cordova in Tapachula, at least one-third of the hundreds of migrants they have attended to this year arrived stamped. Director Enrique Vidal Olascoaga said those who cannot pay are often sexually assaulted. None of the families interviewed by AP said they had been harmed. The official with knowledge of migrants' statements to investigators said that more than 100 migrants freed by security forces in Ciudad Hidalgo in September, as well as a group of several dozen migrants who were shot at by soldiers on Oct. 1, had passed through similar kidnapping and extortion scenarios. Cartel-controlled border Organized crime’s strict control at Mexico’s southern border tracks with the growing violence generated by the struggle between the Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation cartels. The state of Chiapas is only one of their battlegrounds, but it is key to controlling smuggling routes for people, drugs and weapons from Central America. Migrants have become the most lucrative commodity, according to experts. The cartels’ increasingly aggressive presence is becoming an obstacle to the organizations trying to help migrants. Earlier this month, gunmen killed an outspoken Catholic priest in Chiapas. And Vidal said that sometimes the groups prevent the migrants from receiving humanitarian aid. President Claudia Sheinbaum has said the government is dealing with the violence, but refuses to confront the cartels. She appears to maintain tactics that began under the administration of former President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, to cycle migrants from the north back down to the south exhausting their resources and keeping them far from the U.S. border — exposing them to more kidnappings and extortion. Ciudad Hidalgo Mayor Elmer Vázquez claimed to not know anything about migrant safe houses operating in the area and said his town always looks after migrants. But Rev. Vázquez (no relation to the mayor), who has spent two decades defending migrants, said the prosecutor’s office, National Guard, special prosecutor for crimes against migrants do nothing even when crimes are reported. 'They are colluding with organized crime and, of course, they make it look like they’re doing their jobs,' he said. Race against time In August, the U.S. government expanded access to CBP One, an online portal used to schedule appointments to request asylum at the border, south to Chiapas. Mexico requested the move to relieve pressure migrants felt to travel north to get an appointment. The Mexican government followed by opening 'mobility corridors' to help migrants with CBP One appointments to travel safely from southern Mexico to the U.S. border. The appointments are just a first step, but most applicants are allowed to wait out the lengthy process from inside the U.S. But from Sept. 9 to Oct. 11, Mexico’s National Immigration Institute said it had transported only 846 migrants from Tapachula to the northern border. Others traveling on their own have told of being extorted by Mexican authorities and kidnapped – again – by cartels near the northern border, forcing them to miss their appointments. Donald Trump has said he would do away with CBP One and close other legal routes to enter the U.S. In Tapachula on Tuesday, hundreds of migrants with confirmed CBP One appointments waited outside Mexican immigration agency offices for permits that would allow them to travel north. Jeyson Uqueli, a 28-year-old Honduran, had slept outside the office to make sure he was the first in line when it opened. He was traveling alone, but planned to reunite with his sister in New Orleans. To have any chance at doing so, he would have to make it to the border between Brownsville, Texas and Matamoros, Mexico by Nov. 6 for his CBP One appointment. He planned to fly from Tapachula to the northern city of Monterrey and then take a bus to Matamoros. He was nervous about making it in time, but relieved to have the appointment, 'because Donald Trump is going to come in and get rid of (them),' he said. ___ AP journalists Matías Delacroix in Tecun Uman, Guatemala, and Edgar Clemente in Tapachula, Mexico, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-migrants-cartels-smuggling-chiapas-us-border-67d4851eefa60981bceb772bf26d7204	2024-10-29T20:23:41-07:00	
AP-NORC poll finds Democrats and Republicans split on Israel's responsibility for war's escalation	WASHINGTON (AP) — Many American voters are concerned that the ongoing Middle East conflict will escalate into an all-out regional war, a new poll finds. About half of voters are 'extremely' or 'very' worried about the possibility of a broader war in the region. Though there is concern about the conflict growing, according to the survey from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, fewer voters — around 4 in 10 — are concerned that the United States will be drawn into a war in the Middle East. This poll was conducted prior to Israel's strike on military bases in Iran on Friday. The conflict in the Middle East has become a major campaign issue as former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris attempt to win over Muslim and Jewish voters in battleground states like Michigan and Pennsylvania. And although Democrats and Republicans are similarly worried about the potential for the war to expand, they disagree about who is to blame for its recent escalation and how the U.S. should be involved going forward. Partisan divide on Israeli government’s level of responsibility About 6 in 10 voters say the Palestinian militant group Hamas, the Iranian government and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah have 'a lot' of responsibility for the escalation of the war in the Middle East. Roughly 4 in 10 voters think the Israeli government has 'a lot' of responsibility, and only about 2 in 10 say the U.S. government has 'a lot' of responsibility. But there's a big partisan split on whether the Israeli government bears 'a lot' of responsibility for the war's escalation. About 6 in 10 Democrats say they do — similar to the share of Democrats who say Hamas bears 'a lot' of responsibility — while only about one-quarter of Republicans say the Israeli government bears 'a lot' of responsibility. Voters support Iran sanctions, but not sending US troops Voters broadly support economic sanctions on Iran, which could hinder support to its proxy groups Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza. A majority, 55%, are in favor of imposing sanctions. They are about evenly divided on whether the U.S. should be providing weapons to Israel’s military, and voters are more likely to oppose sending government funds to aid Israel’s military than to support it. Deploying U.S. troops to aid Israel’s military garners little support among voters, regardless of their partisan affiliation. About half of voters oppose deploying U.S. troops to aid Israel’s military. Only about 2 in 10 voters favor deploying U.S. troops to assist Israel, and a similar share have a neutral view. Many think the US is doing what it can on cease-fire efforts The U.S. is still pressing for any movement on short-term cease-fire proposals, despite letdowns in the past and little expectation of immediate breakthroughs ahead of the election. About half of voters think the U.S. is doing 'about as much as it can' to push for a cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hamas and Hezbollah, while 3 in 10 say it could be doing more. Roughly 2 in 10 voters say the U.S. should be doing less. Republicans are more likely than Democrats to want less U.S. involvement in cease-fire efforts. About 3 in 10 Republicans say the U.S. should do less, compared to about 1 in 10 Democrats. About 6 in 10 Democrats say the U.S. is doing what it can, compared to about 4 in 10 Republicans. Democrats, Republicans and independents are about equally likely to say the U.S. could be doing more. ___ The poll of 1,072 adults was conducted Oct. 11-14, 2024, using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for registered voters is plus or minus 4.2 percentage points.	https://apnews.com/article/poll-israel-gaza-hezbollah-hamas-middle-east-e1cfd92c19d57842f2ec2f5f3f489856	2024-10-29T20:03:38-07:00	
Canada alleges Indian Home Minister Amit Shah ordered campaign targeting Sikh separatists	OTTAWA, Ontario (AP) — A Canadian official alleged Tuesday that Indian Home Minister Amit Shah ordered a campaign of violence, intimidation and intelligence-gathering targeting Sikh separatists inside Canada. Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister David Morrison told Parliament members of the national security committee that he had confirmed Shah’s name to The Washington Post, which first reported the allegations. 'The journalist called me and asked if it was that person. I confirmed it was that person,' Morrison told the committee. Morrison did not say how Canada knew of Shah's alleged involvement. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said a year ago that Canada had credible evidence agents of the Indian government were involved in the murder of Canadian Sikh activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in British Columbia in June 2023. Canadian authorities have repeatedly said they have shared evidence of that with Indian authorities. Indian government officials have repeatedly denied Canada has provided evidence and have called the allegations absurd. India's embassy in Ottawa didn't immediately respond to messages for a request for comment on the allegation against Shah. On Oct. 14, Canada expelled the Indian high commissioner and five other diplomats, alleging they were persons of interest in multiple cases of coercion, intimidation and violence aimed at quieting a campaign for an independent Sikh state known as Khalistan. Canada is not the only country that has accused Indian officials of plotting an assassination on foreign soil. The United States Justice Department announced criminal charges in mid-October against an Indian government employee in connection with an alleged foiled plot to kill a Sikh separatist leader living in New York City. In the case announced by the Justice Department, Vikash Yadav, who authorities say directed the New York plot from India, faces murder-for-hire charges in a planned killing that prosecutors have previously said was meant to precede a string of other politically motivated murders in the United States and Canada. Nathalie Drouin, Trudeau's national security adviser, told the committee Tuesday that Canada has evidence the Indian government first gathered information on Indian nationals and Canadian citizens in Canada through diplomatic channels and proxies. She said the information was then passed to the government in New Delhi, which allegedly works with a criminal network affiliated with Lawrence Bishnoi. Bishnoi is currently in prison in India, but Drouin said his vast criminal network has been linked to homicides, assassination plots, coercion and other violent crimes in Canada. Before the Royal Canadian Mounted Police went public with allegations that Indian diplomats were persons of interest in criminal investigations, Drouin said there was an effort to work with the Indian government to ensure accountability. Drouin said a meeting was held with Modi’s national security adviser, Ajit Doval, in Singapore two days earlier. She said the decision was made to go public when it became evident the Indian government would not cooperate with Canada on proposed accountability measures. That included asking India to waive diplomatic immunity for the persons of interest, including the high commissioner in Ottawa. Drouin said this was not seen as likely. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said it took the extraordinary step of talking publicly about ongoing investigations because of threats to public safety. The Indian government denies the allegations and has expelled six Canadian diplomats in return. Nijjar, 45, was fatally shot in his pickup truck after he left the Sikh temple he led in Surrey, British Columbia. An Indian-born citizen of Canada, he owned a plumbing business and was a leader in what remains of a once-strong movement to create an independent Sikh homeland. Four Indian nationals living in Canada were charged with Niijar’s murder and are awaiting trial. Drouin and Morrison were called as witnesses at the committee alongside Royal Canadian Mounted Police Commissioner Mike Duheme, as well as the director of Canada's spy service.	https://apnews.com/article/canada-india-amit-shah-sikh-c86c66930302357e3159688bede3e4e6	2024-10-29T14:21:12-07:00

Flash floods in Spain sweep away cars, disrupt trains and leave several missing	BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Several people were reported missing by Spanish authorities after flash floods swept cars through village streets and disrupted rail service in large areas of eastern and southern Spain on Tuesday. Rushing mud-colored waters caused havoc in a huge arc of the European country, running from the provinces of Malaga in the south to Valencia in the east. Images shot by people with smartphones reproduced on Spain’s national broadcaster RTVE showed frighteningly swift waters carrying away cars and rising several feet into the lower level of homes. A high-speed train with nearly 300 people on board derailed near Malaga, although rail authorities said no one was hurt. The high-speed train service between Valencia city and Madrid was interrupted as were several commuter lines. The national government office for the Castilla La Mancha region told radio channel Cadena Ser that six people in the region were missing. Spanish news agency EFE said that one truck driver was missing in L’Alcudia, a town in Valencia. Also in Valencia, the mayor of Utiel, Ricardo Gabaldón, told RTVE that several people were trapped in their homes. Police and rescue services used helicopters to lift people from homes and cars which were in danger of drowning. An emergency rescue brigade of Spain’s army deployed to help rescue efforts. Storms were forecast to continue through Thursday, according to Spain’s national weather service. Spain has experienced similar autumn storms in recent years. The country has recovered somewhat from a severe drought this year thanks to rainfall. Scientists say that increased episodes of extreme weather are likely linked to climate change.	https://apnews.com/article/spain-floods-storms-weather-e9fac3b8b7f135f99fca421bd6895bc4	2024-10-29T11:48:17-07:00	
Pro Women's Hockey League announces it could add as many as 2 teams for 2025-26 season	The six-team Professional Women’s Hockey League is launching its expansion process with plans to add as many as two franchises for the start of the 2025-26 season, a league executive announced Tuesday. Speaking at the ESPNW Summit in New York, senior vice president of business operations Amy Scheer said the league will begin sending requests for proposals to several markets starting as early as next week, while also accepting applications. '(We’re) looking for the right market size, right fan base, right facilities, right economic opportunity — so a lot of research to be done over the next couple months,' Scheer said, without specifying which markets the league might be targeting. 'But yeah, looking to continue to build the league and grow the number of teams.' Among the U.S. expansion candidates are Detroit and Pittsburgh, where the PWHL hosted neutral site games during its inaugural season last year. Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia would also be regarded as candidates after both were considered before the league established teams in Boston, New York and Minnesota. Denver and Seattle are also considered potential candidates. In Canada, where the league has teams in Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal, Quebec City has already announced its intention of being a candidate for an expansion franchise. Calgary would be a potential option with the city previously being home to the Inferno from 2011 to 2019, before the Canadian Women's Hocky League folded. Scheer also announced the league plans to hold neutral site games in nine markets across North America, and is considering holding an outdoor game. Scheer added the league is also working on holding games in Europe, without specifying when that might happen. The PWHL’s second season opens on Nov. 30, and features an expanded schedule with each team playing 30 games — up from 24 last year. The league has yet to announce where it’s neutral site games will be played. Quebec City councilor Jackie Smith announced earlier on Tuesday that the PWHL has agreed to play a neutral site game at the city’s Videotron Centre on Jan. 19. The PWHL’s schedule has Ottawa playing Montreal on that day, with the site yet to be determined. Smith called the development the first step in Quebec City landing an expansion team. ___ AP Women’s Hockey: https://apnews.com/hub/womens-hockey	https://apnews.com/article/womens-hockey-pwhl-expansion-20e84fec388fd3b29a0c54ee0c5c7a33	2024-10-29T09:43:55-07:00	
Albania's opposition blocks roads in a protest to demand a caretaker Cabinet	TIRANA, Albania (AP) — Albanian opposition activists blocked major roads for several hours Tuesday in a nationwide rally demanding that the government be replaced by a technocratic caretaker Cabinet before the 2025 parliamentary election. Lawmakers led hundreds of opposition supporters in rallies that blocked traffic at a main highway into the capital, Tirana, and at five other major roads around the country. 'Civil blockade, today or never!' was the motto of the protest on the website of the main opposition Democratic Party. In Tirana, opposition lawmakers parked their cars to block traffic for three hours. In other places, opposition supporters staged sit-ins at the roadside or burned tires. The conservative Democrats led by former Prime Minister Sali Berisha have long accused Prime Minister Edi Rama’s Socialists of corruption, manipulating earlier elections and usurping the powers of the judiciary. Thousands of police were deployed to protect government buildings, traffic and the rule of law, and there were sporadic clashes between officers and activists before the rallies ended in the late evening. The opposition activists lifted their blockades when their leaders pledged to take unspecified anti-government action later. Democrats and their supporters in an opposition coalition have been holding protests over the arrests of Berisha and former President Ilir Meta in separate corruption cases, saying the charges are politically motivated. Another Democratic lawmaker, Ervin Salianji, has also been convicted of slander and imprisoned. The Democrats have staged violent protests against the government since 2013, when they left power. Albania holds parliamentary elections next spring, which Rama's Socialists are poised to win, partly because the opposition is divided. The United States and the European Union have urged the opposition to resume dialogue with the government, saying violence won’t help the country integrate into the 27-nation EU bloc. In 2020, the EU decided to launch full membership negotiations with Albania. Earlier in October, Tirana started discussions with the bloc on how the country aligns with EU stances on the rule of law, the functioning of democratic institutions and the fight against corruption. ___ Follow Llazar Semini at https://x.com/lsemini	https://apnews.com/article/albania-opposition-protest-corruption-election-cabinet-tirana-76e08889c6cc00aeb552a5cda65a04fd	2024-10-29T09:31:20-07:00	
Judge tosses GOP congressmen's lawsuit over Pennsylvania's overseas and military votes	HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — A federal judge on Tuesday threw out a lawsuit by six Republican members of Congress seeking to make Pennsylvania election officials institute new checks confirming the identity of soldiers, sailors, and others who vote from overseas and to make sure they're eligible. U.S. District Judge Christopher Conner said he agreed with the defendants — Secretary of State Al Schmidt and one of his top deputies — who argued there were no grounds to sue and that the case was launched too late and too close to Election Day. The Pennsylvania congressmen 'provide no good excuse for waiting until barely a month before the election to bring this lawsuit,' Conner wrote. More than 25,000 overseas ballots had already been sent out when the case was filed in late September, the judge noted. The lawsuit was filed by six of the state’s eight Republican members of the U.S. House: Reps. Guy Reschenthaler, Dan Meuser, G.T. Thompson, Lloyd Smucker, Mike Kelly and Scott Perry. The other plaintiff is PA Fair Elections, a group led by Heather Honey, an election researcher whose work has fueled right-wing attacks on voting procedures. Messages seeking comment were left Tuesday with their lawyers. During a streamed update on election matters Tuesday, Schmidt said his agency 'is pleased that this frivolous lawsuit was dismissed.' Conner said the plaintiffs were asking 'to impose new verification procedures the contours of which plaintiffs themselves have been unable to fully flesh out three weeks into this litigation.' He said an injunction now 'would upend the commonwealth's carefully laid election administration procedures to the detriment of untold thousands of voters.' During oral arguments on Oct. 18, Conner asked why the plaintiffs had not sued earlier over procedures that have been in place for years. He also pressed their lawyers to show how their clients were directly harmed by the current policies, as required for such claims. The order issued Tuesday said the Republican congressmen had only 'hypothetical concerns' about the impact overseas votes might have on their own reelection contests. 'Their status as candidates, without more, gets them nowhere,' the judge wrote. The case could have affected thousands of ballots in Pennsylvania, a pivotal swing state in the presidential contest between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. The plaintiffs had asked the judge to declare current practices illegal under federal law and to order that the secretary of state's office confer with the congressmen and PA Fair Elections about how to verify the identity and eligibility of people casting votes under the U.S. Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act. They also asked to have overseas and military ballots segregated during the current election season pending the additional verification. Lawyers for Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro's administration, representing Schmidt and his deputy, had argued that the plaintiffs were saying valid votes could be diluted by improper ones, which they said would not be sufficient grounds for the judge to act. They said federal laws exempt overseas voters 'from identification requirements imposed on other voters who register to vote by mail.' Military voters are more likely to be Republican, while other overseas voters tend to lean Democratic. The Democratic Party is spending money this year in an effort to boost their turnout.	https://apnews.com/article/pennsylvania-military-overseas-ballots-1cb8e5b1b4e564482125e1633642c06b	2024-10-29T09:17:47-07:00	
The EU will impose duties on electric vehicle imports from China by Thursday	BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union is set to impose duties on imports of electric vehicles from China by Thursday after talks between Brussels and Beijing failed to find an amicable solution to their trade dispute. Electric vehicles have become a major flashpoint in a broader trade dispute over the influence of Chinese government subsidies on European markets and Beijing’s burgeoning exports of green technology to the bloc. 'By adopting these proportionate and targeted measures after a rigorous investigation, we’re standing up for fair market practices and for the European industrial base,' European Commission Executive Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis said on Tuesday. 'In parallel, we remain open to a possible alternative solution that would be effective in addressing the problems identified and (World Trade Organization)-compatible,' he added. The duties would stay in force for five years, unless an amicable solution is found. According to the commission, which manages trade disputes on behalf of the 27 EU member countries, sales of Chinese-built electric cars jumped from 3.9% of the EV market in 2020 to 25% by September 2023, in part by unfairly undercutting EU industry prices. The duties on Chinese manufacturers will be 17% on cars made by BYD, 18.8% on those from Geely and 35.3% for vehicles exported by China’s state-owned SAIC. Geely has brands including Polestar and Sweden’s Volvo, while SAIC owns Britain’s MG, one of Europe’s bestselling EV brands. Other EV manufacturers in China, including Western companies such as Volkswagen and BMW, would be subject to duties of 20.7%. The commission has an 'individually calculated' rate for Tesla of 7.8%. The EU’s retaliatory duties have run into opposition in Germany, which has Europe’s biggest economy and is home to major automakers. The head of Germany’s auto industry association, VDA, said the imposition of the tariffs is 'a setback for free global trade and so for prosperity, the preservation of jobs and Europe’s growth.' Hildegard Müller said the move increases the risk of a far-reaching trade conflict. 'The industry is not naive in dealing with China, but the challenges must be resolved in dialogue' Müller said in a statement. The commission says China boosted its EU market share with the help of subsidies across the production chain. These ranged from cheap land for factories provided by local governments, to cut-price supplies of lithium and batteries from state-owned enterprises, to tax breaks and easy financing from state-controlled banks. The rapid growth in China's market share has sparked concern in the EU that Chinese cars will eventually threaten the EU’s ability to produce its own green technology to combat climate change. Business groups and unions also fear that the jobs of 2.5 million auto industry workers could be put in jeopardy, as well those of 10.3 million more people whose employment depends indirectly on EV production. ——— Associated Press correspondent Geir Moulson contributed from Berlin.	https://apnews.com/article/eu-china-trade-electric-vehicles-duties-ev-9c720558b83316fdb6e1a0f9c2b55a15	2024-10-29T08:11:52-07:00	
An electric hydrofoil ferry offers cleaner journeys among Stockholm's 14 islands	STOCKHOLM (AP) — A high-tech electric ferry service began operating in Stockholm Tuesday, offering commuters a low-carbon way to zip through the waterways of the Swedish capital, which is built on 14 islands. In what Stockholm claimed as a world first, 25 commuters in the suburb of Ekero boarded the Nova, a hydrofoil ferry powered by electric motors. The ferry skimmed about 1 meter (3 feet) above the water and covered 15 kilometers (9 miles) to reach Stockholm’s City Hall in just 30 minutes. The morning commute on the regular diesel-powered ferry line takes 45 minutes without stops. 'We are doing this to show the way in the green transition at sea,' said Gustav Hemming, the city councilor in charge of climate and infrastructure. The aim of the nine-month pilot project was to 'make more people park their cars and buy a (public transportation) card instead.' Gustav Hasselskog, chief executive of the electric boat manufacturer Candela, called it 'a paradigm shift for urban transport and a revival of our waterways.' He said the Nova was the first of Candela’s new P-12 model to enter service. Its computer-controlled hydrofoil wings lift the hull above water, reducing energy consumption by 80% compared to conventional vessels by cutting water friction. 'Conventional ships haven’t evolved much in 100 years and are among the least energy-efficient transport modes, only rivaled by a battle tank,' Hasselskog said in a statement. As of Tuesday, the Nova becomes part of the ferry fleet operated by Stockholm’s public transport provider SL. The vessel is designed to carry 25 passengers, including one wheelchair space. There are speed limits on part of the route but on open water there is no restriction. The hydrofoil has a cruising speed of around 25 knots (46 kph or 29 mph) and can reach a maximum speed of 30 knots (56 kph or 35 mph) — considerably faster than other electric passenger ferries. It achieves this with carbon fiber hydrofoil wings that lift the boat out of the water, reducing drag. An added benefit is that the vessel is exempt from the 12-knot speed limit in Stockholm because it leaves no wake — waves made by a boat’s displacement through water that increase with speed and could swamp other vessels or erode the shoreline. Candela says its technology reduces the energy per passenger-kilometer by 95% compared with the diesel ferries in the picturesque Stockholm archipelago. The vessel can operate in waves of up 2 meters (6.5 feet). Candela hopes that as well as Stockholm, cities like San Francisco, New York and Venice will lead the electrification of waterborne public transport. Stockholm has approximately 70 public transport vessels which use fossil fuels. There were around 6.2 million public transport boat journeys in the Stockholm region in 2022, and while boat traffic remains a small part of the entire public transit system, it is the fastest-growing mode of public transport after the COVID-19 pandemic.	https://apnews.com/article/stockholm-electric-ferry-archipelago-sweden-clean-energy-e2b39de682f97e657538c61999c8291a	2024-10-29T08:04:14-07:00	
Election 2024 Latest: With 1 week to go, Harris heads to Washington and Trump stumps in Pennsylvania	Vice President Kamala Harris will deliver her campaign’s 'closing argument' Tuesday from the same spot in Washington where former President Donald Trump helped incite a mob that attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. One week out from Election Day, Harris’ address from the grassy Ellipse near the White House is designed to encourage Americans to visualize their alternate futures if she or Trump takes over the Oval Office in less than three months. Trump opened his remarks to reporters at Mar-a-Lago Tuesday morning by saying Harris is running on a 'campaign of destruction' and 'of absolute hate,' accusing her team of 'perhaps even trying to destroy our country.' He will head to Pennsylvania later in the day for a Building America's Future event in Drexel and a rally Tuesday night in Allentown. Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: What is The Ellipse? The Ellipse, where Vice President Kamala Harris will deliver her closing message against former President Donald Trump, is a grassy park between the White House and the Washington Monument in Washington, D.C. The area, which is administered by the National Park Service, has long played host to a range of political events and national traditions. Most recently, it was where then-President Trump delivered a lie-filled speech on Jan. 6, 2021, shortly before hundreds stormed the U.S. Capitol as Congress met to certify to 2020 election. While the White House is often the backdrop for events on the Ellipse, expressly political events are allowed in the park, unlike at the White House. The park was first developed in the 1850s and was part of landscape architect Pierre Charles L’Enfant’s plans for the nation’s capital. However, its development was cut short by a lack of funds and the Civil War, according to the National Park Service. During the conflict, soldiers were housed on the site, and the area had also been used as horse pens, a slaughterhouse and a trash dump, according to the Park Service. Harris’ closing argument against Trump is far from her final event Vice President Kamala Harris will deliver what her campaign is touting as her closing argument against former President Donald Trump on Tuesday in Washington, D.C. But the event, a large gathering on the Ellipse park just south of the White House, will be far from her last rally. Harris is slated to crisscross the country in the final days of the campaign, hitting all key battleground states as she makes her last pitch to voters. Harris’ campaign has crafted the Tuesday event as both a physical and rhetorical counter to Trump. She will urge voters to 'turn the page' toward a new era and away from Trump, lambasting both the kind of rhetoric Trump has used and what it would mean to give him four more years as president. Physically, Harris will be standing in the same park where Trump delivered a lie-filled speech on Jan. 6, 2021, shortly before hundreds stormed the Capitol as Congress met to certify to 2020 election. ‘We are on track to win a very close election,’ Harris campaign chair says Harris’ campaign chair says early voting returns in key states suggest the vice president’s supporters are turning out in numbers she needs to win. In an online video running nearly three and a half minutes, Jen O’Malley Dillon says a lot of Republican-leaning voters were voting early in strong numbers as well — but those tended to be folks who would have otherwise voted on Election Day. By contrast, she said, the Harris campaign believes low-propensity voters are breaking for the vice president. O’Malley Dillion said the campaign’s polling shows that late-breaking undecided voters 'are more open to supporting' Harris if they find out 'more information' about her in the campaign’s closing days. 'It’s OK to be worried,' before Election Day, she said, but added, 'We are on track to win a very close election.' ‘This truly is a margin of error race’ Harris campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon has released a video telling supporters, 'Why you don’t have to feel anxious and you can feel good' about next week’s election. As the campaign has been arguing for months, O’Malley Dillon says Harris has 'multiple pathways' to get to the 270 electoral votes needed to clinch the White House. She said seven states remain in play — the 'blue wall' of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, as well as Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada. O’Malley Dillon said that, rather than conceding any of those, as sometimes happens late in races, Harris is still campaigning hard in all of them because 'this truly is a margin of error race.' Hundreds of Miami-Dade County ballots were found on the side of the road The elections department in Florida’s largest county confirmed Tuesday that a sealed bin and a sealed bag had been found by a driver and the ballots inside had already been scanned and tabulated at an early voting site on Monday, according to reporting by the Miami Herald. A county employee forgot to lock the back of a truck and the containers fell out when they drove off, according to county elections supervisor Christina White, who said election workers confirmed nothing was damaged or tampered with. A video posted by the popular South Florida social media account Only in Dade shows a passing driver apparently stopping to pick up the containers labeled with county barcodes and drive them to a police station. The employee driving the truck has since been fired. Harris campaign takes over Las Vegas’ Sphere to help get out the vote The vice president’s team says her campaign is the first to advertise on the entertainment venue, which opened in 2023. The exterior of the Sphere features a rotating series of messages encouraging people to vote for Harris and running mate Tim Walz by Election Day, Nov. 5. The messages include her slogan, 'When we fight, we win,' and other phrases. Nevada is among the handful of battleground states that the Democrat and Republican rival Donald Trump are trying hard to win. Harris’ team says the Sphere advertising is a 'critical piece' of their efforts in Nevada, which also include taking over the homepages of top newspapers and mobile billboards in Reno, Carson City and Las Vegas. Harris is scheduled to campaign in Reno and Las Vegas on Thursday. Trump on his Madison Square Garden rally: ‘There’s never been an event so beautiful’ While he didn’t mention a comedian’s controversial remarks about Puerto Rico, Trump expounded at length about his Madison Square Garden rally, which he called a 'lovefest,' a term he has also used to reference the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. At Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday, Trump noted 'there’s never been an event so beautiful' as the Sunday night rally in his hometown of New York City. Trump called it 'terrible to say,' as some of his critics have pointed out, that the same arena was host to a gathering of Nazis in 1939. More than 20,000 people attended a Feb. 20, 1939 rally at the Garden organized by the German American Bund, a pro-Nazi group that hung swastikas alongside a huge portrait of George Washington. Several of the speakers on Sunday referenced that event, including former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan, who said, 'I don’t see no stinkin’ Nazis in here.' 'Nobody’s ever had love like that,' Trump said of the hourslong Sunday event that featured speakers including some of his children, wife Melania and high-level surrogates and supporters including TV psychologist Dr. Phil McGraw and former Fox News host Tucker Carlson. 'It was really love for our country.' Trump wraps his remarks without referencing comments of a comedian at his New York rally Trump has yet to address the controversy, also not mentioning it during his appearances in Georgia on Monday. On Tuesday, he did reference the event overall, calling it 'an absolute lovefest' in his hometown. Comedian Tony Hinchcliffe called Puerto Rico a 'floating island of garbage' during the Sunday event at Madison Square Garden. His remark has drawn wide condemnation and highlighted the rising power of a key Latino group in the swing state of Pennsylvania. He also made demeaning jokes about Black people, other Latinos, Palestinians and Jews during his routine before Trump’s appearance. The Harris campaign has released an ad that will run online in battleground states targeting Puerto Rican voters and highlighting the comedian’s remarks. The comments landed Harris a show of support from Puerto Rican music star Bad Bunny and prompted reactions from Republicans in Florida and Puerto Rico. Head of Puerto Rico’s Republican Party calls Hinchcliffe remarks ‘totally reprehensible’ The president of Puerto Rico’s Republican Party, Ángel Cintrón, rejected the comments of a comedian at a Trump rally in New York where he called the U.S. territory 'a floating island of garbage.' Cintrón said the 'poor attempt at comedy' by Tony Hinchcliffe on Sunday was 'disgraceful, ignorant and totally reprehensible.' 'There is no room for absurd and racist comments like that. They do not represent the conservative values of republicanism anywhere in our nation,' Cintrón said in a statement. He noted that there are 3 million U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico and nearly 6 million in the U.S. mainland. 'Whether we are Republicans or Democrats, we are American and Puerto Rican citizens proud of our roots and incalculable contributions to American democracy for more than one hundred years,' Cintrón said. Harris will have to ‘get herself a job someplace,’ Trump says A week away from the end of voting in the general election, Trump is reflecting on his presidential run, saying, 'We’ve had a great campaign' and predicting that Harris will have to go home and 'get herself a job someplace, who knows.' Trump is featuring speakers who say they were harmed by policies under Harris’ time in office Tammy Nobles talked about the death of her daughter, saying the perpetrator was an MS-13 gang member in the country illegally. Michael Koppy, owner of Go Green Dry Cleaners, talked about how he has had to help other small businesses unable to keep up with inflation and rising costs. Christy Shamblin, whose daughter-in-law Marine Sgt. Nicole Gee was killed during the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, said Donald Trump 'demonstrates peace through strength.' Trump: Anything positive about the economy during Harris’ time in office was ‘fake’ Saying that the economy under Harris’ time in office has caused destruction, Trump said that any boon was 'fake.' He then cited 'one of the most respected people on Wall Street' as saying that 'the economy is only good' because 'people think Trump is going to get elected.' Trump says he would create ‘compensation fund’ for the ‘victims of migrant crime’ As he has many times along the campaign trail, Trump is decrying federal authorities for dropping plane-loads of migrants 'all over the Midwest,' mentioning Aurora, Colorado, and Springfield, Ohio. Saying he was announcing the intent 'for the first time,' Trump said that as president he would be 'seizing the assets of the criminal gangs and drug cartels,' and using those assets 'to create a compensation fund to provide restitution for the victims of migrant crime.' Trump calls immigration reform ‘the single biggest issue’ for his campaign Immigration reform — and blaming Democrats for issues caused by an influx of immigrants across the U.S.-Mexico border — has long been Trump’s signature campaign issue, and a week out from Election Day, he is sticking to that. Saying that 'we talk about inflation and the economy,' Trump added, 'To me, there’s nothing more important than the fabric of our country being destroyed,' calling the border 'the single biggest issue.' Trump plays video featuring mother of 12-year-old found dead in Texas Trump is playing a video featuring comments from the mother of Jocelyn Nungaray, a 12-year-old Texas girl who was found dead in a creek not far from her home. Police charged two Venezuelan men who had entered the U.S. illegally with the girl’s murder. Alexis Nungaray said that her daughter is 'six feet in the ground based off of' Harris’ decisions and called for Trump’s reelection. Trump alleges Harris ‘keeps talking about Hitler and Nazis because her record is horrible’ Trump accused Harris of not caring about the impact of her actions in what he called her 'campaign of absolute hate,' saying that she intends to 'keep this misery going, and she’s going to keep it going for as long as she can.' Trump alleged that Harris 'keeps talking about Hitler and Nazis because her record is horrible.' Trump said that the 'three great people' on stage with him would share their own stories about 'how their lives have been shattered' by Harris’ policies. Trump says he is ‘running on a plan to save America’ The GOP nominee said his Democratic rival, now Harris, is running on a 'campaign of destruction' and 'of absolute hate,' accusing her team of 'perhaps even trying to destroy our country.' Trump again said Democrats 'stole the presidency of the United States' by ousting Biden from their ticket this year. As he spoke, Trump was flanked on stage by three people, none of whom he has identified thus far. Trump has arrived at his Mar-a-Lago event Supporters cheered his name and raised cellphones in the air as he walked into the room, exactly one week before Election Day. Two days ahead of Halloween, the former president walked out just after the playing of Michael Jackson’s 'Thriller,' which has become a staple at many of his campaign rallies. Trump began his remarks by saying that things are 'going very well' but noted some 'bad spots in Pennsylvania where some serious things have been caught or are in the process of being caught.' Reading from paper on the podium in front of him, Trump began by criticizing Kamala Harris, saying she 'has obliterated our borders' and has 'caused so much destruction and death at home and abroad.' Musk’s pro-Trump super PAC uses vulgarity demeaning women to describe Harris as a ‘communist’ Elon Musk’s super political action committee created an ad attacking Vice President Kamala Harris that includes multiple references to a vulgarity often used to demean women before calling her a 'communist.' The 35-second video from America PAC begins with a warning that it 'contains multiple instances of the C-word.' Calling Harris 'a big ole C-word,' a narrator describes the Democratic nominee as a 'tax-hiking, regulation-loving, gun-grabbing communist,' over images of her, as well as an illustration of a cat in a Soviet-style military uniform. Musk endorsed Trump earlier this year and has appeared both at his rallies and at his own pro-Trump events throughout the battleground state of Pennsylvania. Both Musk and Trump have repeatedly referenced Harris as 'Comrade Kamala,' implying that as president she would seek to implement socialist policies in the U.S. The post is getting attention as Trump and his allies use increasingly inflammatory language in the final stretch of the campaign. Trump has repeatedly ridiculed Harris, at one point calling her 'mentally impaired.' He has referred to CNN’s Anderson Cooper with a woman’s name, evoking the trope of gay men as effeminate. A Trump rally at Madison Square Garden on Sunday featured multiple crude and racist jokes, including one from comedian Tony Hinchcliffe who called Puerto Rico a 'floating island of garbage.' A spokesperson for the PAC declined to comment on the video. Puerto Rico’s archbishop calls on Trump to disavow comedian’s rally comments SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — The archbishop of Puerto Rico, Roberto O. González Nieves, has joined a long list of Puerto Ricans decrying the comments a comedian made at a Donald Trump rally on Sunday that disparaged the island. González said in a letter that he was 'dismayed and appalled' after hearing Tony Hinchcliffe say, 'I don’t know if you guys know this, but there’s literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now. I think it’s called Puerto Rico.' González called on Trump to disavow the comments, saying it was insufficient that his campaign issued a brief apology. 'It is important that you, personally, apologize for these comments,' González wrote. The archbishop said that while he enjoys a good joke, humor has its limits. 'It should not insult or denigrate the dignity and sacredness of people,' he wrote. 'These kinds of remarks should not be a part of the political discourse of a civilized society.' Trump’s event at Mar-a-Lago has gotten underway with operatic and Broadway musical selections Dozens of supporters, many clad in pro-Trump gear, stood near their seats and craned their necks to see if the GOP nominee and former president were about to enter an ornate Mar-a-Lago room set up for his remarks. Several American flags and a screen with the words, 'TRUMP WILL FIX IT!' were set up along the platform from which Trump was expected to speak. ‘We have to forgive and let it go,’ Trump supporter says Madison Square Garden rally remarks A supporter of Trump who attended his event at Mar-a-Lago and heads the Republican Latino Club of Palm Beach said in Spanish it was important to clarify that the former president was not the one who made the crude comments about Puerto Rico. 'He is a comedian. He tries to be funny and says a lot of nonsense. The man is dumb. He has no clue about Puerto Rico and doesn’t know our culture. He screwed up. We have to forgive and let it go,' said Lydia Maldonado, who is Puerto Rican. 'Our economy needs a change. Enough of this.' The Allentown School District is closed ahead of Trump’s Pennsylvania visit The district said in a statement that schools will be closed 'out of an abundance of caution' since the rally is 'expected to bring large crowds, heavy traffic and potential disruptions that may impact the safety and security of our students and staff.' Trump is due to speak at the PPL Center in downtown Allentown at 7 p.m. ET. Podcast host Joe Rogan polls listeners on a potential interview with Harris In a post on the social platform X, Rogan says the Democrat’s campaign offered a date for Tuesday for an hourlong conversation, but that he would have had to meet her on the road. Rogan said he feels strongly that the conversation is best when done in his studio in Austin, Texas. He headlined the post: '!! Austin TX podcast or let her walk. Thoughts?' Asked for comment, a Harris campaign official said they were willing to sit down with Rogan when Harris was in Texas last week, but Rogan couldn’t accommodate. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the campaign’s internal deliberations, said Rogan was offered the option of joining Harris on the road but that Rogan has insisted that the conversation be taped in Austin. Trump sat down with Rogan for three hours last Friday in Texas. Harris aide says Washington speech will focus on the ‘clear choice voters are facing this election’ Vice President Kamala Harris, who spent years working as a prosecutor, has spent her campaign for president laying out the case to voters for why she should be elected, a top aide said Tuesday. Cedric Richmond says over the past three months Harris has given her opening statement and laid out evidence and the facts for voters. On Tuesday, she’ll deliver a speech meant to sum it all up. 'She’ll make her closing argument directly to the American people — or the jury — and that’s who’s going to decide the outcome of this election,' he said. 'And that’s how it should be.' Richmond says the speech will be about the 'clear choice voters are facing this election between Trump and his obsession with himself versus her new generation of leadership that is focused on the American people.' Harris to focus on what her generation of leadership ‘really means’ in Washington speech Vice President Kamala Harris chose the area near the White House and Washington Monument to speak on Tuesday because 'it’s a reminder of the gravity of the job,' her campaign chairwoman says. Campaign leader Jen O’Malley Dillon says the location, where Donald Trump helped incite a violent mob on Jan. 6, 2021, is a visual reminder of how much a president can do for good — or for ill. It’s a 'stark visualization of probably the most infamous example of Donald Trump and how he’s used his power for bad,' she said. But Harris won’t spend a lot of time rehashing the violence of that day or recounting Trump’s continued efforts to lie about the election and sow doubt over voting. O’Malley Dillon says Harris will focus on talking about what her generation of leadership 'really means,' and how much she will work to shape the country and impact people’s lives for the better. Harris to sit for interviews in Detroit, Milwaukee, Philadelphia and elsewhere on Tuesday Vice President Kamala Harris is doing five interviews Tuesday, including one with a Spanish-language radio in Pennsylvania aimed at Latino voters, in particular Puerto Ricans. The interviews come after a comic at Donald Trump’s rally on Sunday made racist and vile jokes that singled out Puerto Ricans among other groups. Trump did not denounce the racist jokes. But he claimed he didn’t know the comic who gave a live performance at the venue before the Republican nominee took the stage. Harris is also doing interviews in Detroit, Milwaukee, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. That’s before she gives a speech in Washington later Tuesday where she’ll lay out her closing arguments. ‘I don’t know him,’ Trump says of comedian from New York rally without denouncing his remarks Donald Trump said he doesn’t know the comic who made racist and vile jokes at his big Madison Square Garden rally. But he’s not denouncing the comments either. 'I don’t know him, someone put him up there. I don’t know who he is,' Trump told ABC News in an interview Tuesday ahead of his remarks at Mar-a-Lago, according to the network. The comedian, Tony Hinchcliffe, had told a series of raunchy and crude jokes, including calling Puerto Rico an 'island of floating garbage.' The comments have drawn outrage from Puerto Rican leaders with just a week to go before the election. In the interview, Trump also insisted he hadn’t heard Hinchcliffe’s comments, according to ABC. But, 'When asked what he made of them, he did not take the opportunity to denounce them, repeating that he didn’t hear the comments.' Trump supporters are gathering near the entrance of Mar-a-Lago’s main ballroom The former president has arrived at his private club and residence in Palm Beach, Florida. He is set to meet with reporters at 10 a.m. ET. It is unclear whether the Republican will take questions. Harris calls Los Angeles Times and Washington Post decisions not to endorse in the presidential race ‘disappointing’ The Democratic presidential nominee commented during an interview with Charlamagne tha God, DJ Envy, and Loren LoRosa for 'The Breakfast Club' that aired Tuesday morning. Both newspapers announced last week that they will not make endorsements in the presidential contest between Harris and Republican Donald Trump. Harris sought to tie the decisions to billionaires in 'Donald Trump’s club.' Both publications are owned by wealthy executives, Jeff Bezos at the Post and Patrick Soon-Shiong at the Times. Arab American voters make their choice — Harris, Trump or neither — in the election’s final days DEARBORN, Mich. — Bowls of labneh and platters of za’atar bread covered the tables in a Lebanese restaurant near Detroit, yet no one seemed to have much of an appetite. On one side were Kamala Harris ’ top emissaries to the Arab American community. On the other were local leaders who were explaining — once again — why many in the community couldn’t vote for the vice president because of the war in Gaza. 'I love this country, but I’ll tell you, we have never been so disappointed in this country as we are now,' said Nabih H. Ayad, chairman of the Arab American Civil Rights League. 'We wanted to give the Democratic Party the opportunity to do something, and they haven’t.' 'The one line we can’t cross,' Ayad said, 'is genocide.' ▶ Read more on what Arab Americans are saying about the election GOP works to turn out pro-Trump Jewish voters in swing states to trim Democrats’ edge WEST BLOOMFIELD, Mich. — Rachel Weinberg calls herself a religious Jew first, then a proud American. She said she has only one choice for president: Donald Trump. 'I don’t like everything he says,' the 72-year-old retired preschool teacher from Michigan said after volunteer canvassers for the Republican Jewish Coalition knocked on her door Sunday. 'But I vote for Israel. It is our life. I support Israel. Trump supports Israel with his mouth and his actions.' Weinberg’s home in West Bloomfield, in vote-rich Oakland County, was among more than 20 that the Republican Jewish Coalition was visiting that morning. She has voted for Trump in previous elections as well. The door-to-door outreach to Jewish voters with a history of backing Republicans is part of a new effort the group is undertaking this year in five presidential battleground states in hopes of boosting Trump over Democrat Kamala Harris in the Nov. 5 election. ▶ Read more about Republicans' outreach to Jewish voters	https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-kamala-harris-election-2024-4d54837e83d91f1d200f56a6948a96b8	2024-10-29T05:12:01-07:00	
Care for a sweet treat during Mexico's Day of the Dead? Have a bite of 'pan de muerto'	MEXICO CITY (AP) — The first bite is an assault to the senses. A sugary, citric, fluffy delight. 'Pan de muerto' or 'bread of the dead' is baked in Mexico every year, from early October to mid-November, amid Day of the Dead celebrations. Shaped like a bun, decorated with bone-like bread pieces and sugar on top, pan de muerto can be seen at coffee shops, dinner tables or home-made altars, which Mexicans build to remember their deceased loved ones and welcome them back for a night on Nov. 2. Its date of origin can’t be specified, but pan de muerto can be thought of as a fusion of Mesoamerican and Spanish traditions, said Andrés Medina, a researcher at the Anthropological Research Institute of the National Autonomous University of Mexico. Mexicans have remembered the dead with festivities and food for centuries Since pre-Hispanic times, festivities for the dead have existed and skull-shaped products have been made. But in the 1500s, when the Spaniards arrived, new elements such as sugar and bread were incorporated into Indigenous offerings. Those early celebrations, Medina said, coincided with the crop season, which provides pan de muerto a spiritual, symbolic meaning. If its decorations resemble bones, it’s because Mesoamerican worldviews regarded them as the origin of life. According to an ancient myth, Quetzalcóatl created humankind out of bones. Details vary from one source to another, but soon after the god apparently stole them from the underworld, he fell. And from his blood, the seed of life was born. 'Under this worldview, the human body’s bones, just like the fruit’s insides, are seeds,' Medina said. 'So, in a way, altars are offerings to fertility. And Day of the Dead is a celebration of the life contained in each seed.' Pan de muerto’s shape, ingredients and preparations differ from one Mexican state to another, but is enjoyed all over the country. 100 and counting: One man’s quest to try every variation of 'pan de muerto' In Mexico City, hundreds of bakeries make their own version. Rodrigo Delgado has spent years trying to taste them all. For fun, he challenges himself to try as many as possible and review them on his Instagram account. On his first quest, a decade ago, he tried 15. In 2023, he had a bite of 100. This year, he expects to taste at least 110. 'I like pan de muerto because of what it means during Day of the Dead season,' said Delgado, who also reviews local restaurants on his blog, Godínez Gourmet. 'The mix of flavors of the bread, as much as its texture, are very comforting.' He can’t remember the first time he tried pan de muerto, but he treasures the memories of his mother baking it at home. He and his brother used to knead the dough, he said, and shape the bone-like decorations of its top. Baking pan de muerto is not an easy task. At Panadería Dos Veinte, in Mexico City's San Rafael neighborhood, owner Manu Tovar said that having these sweet buns ready for sale takes three days of work: one to extract the infusions that will provide the bread with its flavor, another to incorporate them into the dough and one more day to knead and shape the buns. There’s no secret in his recipe, Tovar said. The ingredients — although seasonal — are simple: orange blossom, tangerine zest, anise and butter. His special touch, what makes his bread unique, is the sourdough. 'It’s an ancestral process,' Tovar said. 'A millenary way to make bread.' The sourdough that he and four assistants use is 20 years old. He incorporates water and flour daily, to keep it alive, and mixes part of it with new dough. This gives the bread a better taste, he said, and makes it easier to digest. Pan de muertos' seasonal flavors help make it special For years, said Tovar, he resisted the temptation of baking pan de muerto in early October. The quality of the ingredients improves as November gets closer, but customers kept asking when the buns would be ready, so he caved. This season, aside from baking 90 pan de muertos per day, he came up with two new creations: a croissant roll filled with marigold cream and a bun — locally known as 'concha' — shaped like a marigold flower and prepared with tangerine instead of vanilla or chocolate. 'If you bake it in a traditional way, you can only have pan de muerto now, because that’s when the fruit is available,' Tovar said. 'That’s what I think makes it so special.' The ambience of the Day of the Dead season, he added, also plays a role. Nightfall comes earlier during this time of year and there’s certain mysticism, a particular feeling in the air. 'It probably has to do with the melancholy of what this festivity means,' he said. 'For one day a year, you can feel closer to those who are no longer with you.' ____ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Duterte’s jarring testimony into drug killings in Philippines relives a nightmare for many	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The cockiness, expletives and threats unleashed by former President Rodrigo Duterte in a Senate inquiry brought back the nightmare of the bloody 'war on drugs' for many families of the thousands of victims who were gunned down under his rule. Speaking under oath in Monday's televised hearing into the killings, a defiantly combative Duterte returned to the national spotlight for the first time since leaving office in 2022 with little show of remorse. He got away with it again, critics say. 'If I’m given another chance, I’ll wipe all of you,' Duterte, 79, who is seeking a new term as mayor of his southern home city of Davao next year, said of drug dealers and criminals. Duterte again denied that he authorized extrajudicial killings of drug suspects, saying there were no 'state-sponsored killings.' But he acknowledged that as mayor of Davao, before becoming president, he kept a small ' death squad ' of gangsters whom he had ordered to eliminate other criminals. Duterte's profanity-laced outbursts scared Randy delos Santos, who was invited by the Senate to speak about the killing of his nephew, Kian, by police under Duterte’s 'war on drugs.' It felt, he said, like a nightmare had returned. 'I had this frightening feeling that thousands of innocent people may be gunned down again,' delos Santos told The Associated Press on Tuesday. 'I was wondering why he was allowed to speak with disrespect and given a stage to vent his past excuses.' Duterte has upended politics in Philippines The thousands of killings — which human rights groups estimate could exceed 20,000 — under Duterte's administration 2016-2022 were unprecedented in recent Philippine history and triggered an International Criminal Court investigation as a possible crime against humanity. They have also become a delicate fault line in the increasingly hostile rivalry between Duterte and his children, including Vice President Sara Duterte, and President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. They had a bitter political fallout over key issues. While Duterte had nurtured cozy ties with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian leader Vladimir Putin, Marcos has broadened defense and military relations with the United States and its Western allies. 'It’s unfortunate that drug-related crimes are on the rise again. Everyday you can read about children being raped, people getting killed and robbed and just recently a drug den was raided within the Malacanang complex,' Duterte said, referring to the presidential palace in Manila. 'Purveyors of this menace are back in business.' Duterte has previously accused Marcos of being a drug addict and weak leader. Marcos had retorted that Duterte was a user of fentanyl, a painkiller and powerful opioid. Looking frail and misstating his age as 73 at one point, the daylong Senate hearing also served as the latest reality check on the political restraints that Duterte and his family face after he relinquished his grip on power. Duterte was one of Asia’s most unorthodox leaders and carved a controversial political name for his deadly campaign against criminality, expletives-laced outbursts and disdain for human rights and the West. He once called the pope a 'son of a bitch' for setting off a monstrous traffic jam during a Manila visit and told then-President Barack Obama to 'go to hell' for criticizing his brutal anti-drugs crackdown. Duterte’s profanities became a trademark of his political persona and some regarded him as Asia’s Trump. During a heated exchange on Monday, Duterte raised his voice at Sen. Risa Hontiveros, a staunch human rights activist, who said that his campaign had killed 122 children, including a baby. Hontiveros asked the chairman overseeing the hearing to restrain the increasingly volatile Duterte, who rambled on as she spoke. He later stopped and apologized. 'You’re trying to pin me down on semantics,' Duterte blurted out at Hontiveros, who shot back: 'You’re pinned by your own words.' 'You were never a mayor, prosecutor … I was a prosecutor, mayor, president and I know my job. You should talk like, `Son of a bitch, you stop, or I will kill you,’' Duterte told the senators. The killings left deep scars A Roman Catholic priest, the Rev. Flavie Villanueva, showed during the hearing a list of more than 300 victims, many of them breadwinners of poor families, who were killed under Duterte’s crackdown. A roll of white paper with the victims’ names that the priest unfurled was so long it touched the carpeted floor. Former Sen. Leila de Lima, one of the most vocal critics of Duterte who was arrested and detained for years during his presidency, confronted him during the hearing. The drug charges against her, she said, were fabricated by Duterte and his officials to stop her investigation of the drug killings. She was cleared of the charges and freed last year. 'This man … for so long has evaded justice and accountability,' de Lima said of Duterte, who sat near her. Sen. Jinggoy Estrada asked why de Lima failed to file any criminal complaint against Duterte for so long. Witnesses against Duterte, she said, were afraid to come out during his presidency when larges-cale killings were unfolding. 'There was an atmosphere of fear, a culture of fear and impunity,' she said. 'I hope many more will come out now.'	https://apnews.com/article/philippines-duterte-drug-killings-testimony-448d440e057506e5a9cbe615372ccd45	2024-10-29T02:18:09-07:00	
Germany recalls ambassador from Iran as it protests the execution of an Iranian German prisoner	BERLIN (AP) — Germany protested to Iran on Tuesday over the execution of Iranian German prisoner Jamshid Sharmahd, who lived in the U.S. and was kidnapped in Dubai in 2020 by Iranian security forces, and recalled its ambassador to Berlin for consultations. The Foreign Ministry wrote on the social network X that Iran's charge d'affaires in Berlin was summoned to hear 'our sharp protest' against Tehran's action and added that it reserves the right to take 'further measures.' It didn't elaborate. At the same time, German Ambassador Markus Potzel 'protested in the strongest terms against the murder of Jamshid Sharmahd' to the Iranian foreign minister, it said. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock then recalled him to Berlin for consultations. Sharmahd, 69, was put to death in Iran on Monday on terrorism charges, the country’s judiciary said. That followed a 2023 trial that Germany, the U.S. and international rights groups dismissed as a sham. He was one of several Iranian dissidents abroad in recent years either tricked or kidnapped back to Iran as Tehran began lashing out after the collapse of its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers including Germany. Iran accused Sharmahd, who lived in Glendora, California, of planning a 2008 attack on a mosque that killed 14 people — including five women and a child — and wounded over 200 others, as well as plotting other assaults through the little-known Kingdom Assembly of Iran and its Tondar militant wing. Iran also accused Sharmahd of 'disclosing classified information' on missile sites of Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard during a television program in 2017. His family disputed the allegations and had worked for years to see him freed. Sharmahd had been in Dubai in 2020, trying to travel to India for a business deal involving his software company. He hoped to get a connecting flight despite the coronavirus pandemic disrupting global travel. Sharmahd’s family received their last message from him on July 28, 2020. It’s unclear how the abduction happened. But tracking data showed that Sharmahd’s mobile phone traveled south from Dubai to the city of Al Ain on July 29, crossing the border into Oman. On July 30, tracking data showed the mobile phone traveled to the Omani port city of Sohar, where the signal stopped. Two days later, Iran announced it had captured Sharmahd in a 'complex operation.' The Intelligence Ministry published a photograph of him blindfolded. Germany expelled two Iranian diplomats in 2023 over Sharmahd’s death sentence.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-iran-sharmahd-execution-protest-ambassador-ac9afe1d2b1a5949f0b578c69763a6b8	2024-10-29T01:53:46-07:00	
Russia's embassy in Pakistan says it is verifying reports that one of its citizens was abducted	ISLAMABAD (AP) — Russia's embassy in Pakistan said Tuesday it is attempting to verify reports that one of its citizens was abducted in the South Asian nation's troubled northwest. The embassy provided no further details in a post on the social media platform X. The announcement by the embassy came days after a small militant group headed by commander Gul Bahadur said it captured a Russian national in Dera Ismail Khan, a district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. The group released a photo showing a man sitting with two bearded men. Local police said they have not been approached by the Russian Embassy about the reported abduction. Insurgents often attack Pakistani security forces and foreigners, especially Chinese working on Chinese-funded projects across the country, but Russians have not previously been targeted. Most Russians who travel to Pakistan are climbers who scale mountains in the scenic north.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-russia-abduction-northwest-f5900ab5b0bdca5889af0af5d88b89c2	2024-10-29T01:31:57-07:00	
Russia strikes Ukraine's 2 biggest cities in its latest barrage, officials say	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russian drones, missiles and bombs smashed into Kyiv and Kharkiv, Ukraine’s biggest cities, in nighttime attacks, killing four people and wounding 15 in a continuing aerial onslaught, authorities said Tuesday. Russia has bombarded civilian areas of Ukraine almost daily since its full-scale invasion of its neighbor almost three years ago, causing thousands of casualties. The Russian army is also pushing hard against front-line defenses in the eastern Donetsk region of Ukraine. In another worrying development for Kyiv officials, Western countries say North Korea has sent some 10,000 soldiers to help Russia’s military campaign. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was expected to speak about that new threat at a meeting Tuesday in Reykjavik with the leaders of Denmark, Iceland, Finland, Norway and Sweden. A Russian aerial attack struck Kharkiv, in Ukraine’s northeast, at around 3 a.m., hitting a house and killing four people, regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said. Nearly 20 houses were damaged in the attack, he said. Several hours earlier, Russia dropped a glide bomb on the landmark Derzhprom building in Kharkiv city center, injuring seven people, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said. Derzhprom, also known as the Palace of Industry, is included in UNESCO’s World Heritage List as an example of modernist architecture. Terekhov said that Russia has concentrated attacks on Kharkiv in recent days. He urged people not to ignore air raid warnings. Authorities in Kyiv said debris from intercepted Russian drones fell on two city districts, injuring six people. Ukraine has also used long-range drones to disrupt Russia’s war machine and embarrass the Kremlin by striking targets on Russian soil. A special forces academy in the Russian province of Chechnya was hit by drones, causing a fire that was quickly extinguished, according to Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, who is close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. It was the first drone attack of the war on Chechnya, which lies about 800 kilometers (500 miles) east of Ukraine.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-attacks-zelenskyy-north-korea-1b327a2d85d4ce9faf321dd27992f568	2024-10-29T01:27:18-07:00	
AP PHOTOS: River and air pollution in India's capital pose a severe health threat to residents	NEW DELHI (AP) — One of India’s most sacred rivers, the Yamuna in New Delhi, is covered with white toxic foam, with vast sections frothing as a result of pollutants discharged from industries around the city. The pollution poses a severe health threat to residents since the river provides more than half of the Indian capital's water. New Delhi also has some of the world’s most polluted air every year, and the current festival season is exacerbating the situation. On Tuesday, the air-quality index deteriorated to 'a very poor' reading of 273, 18 times more than the World Health Organization’s quality guidelines. The tiny PM 2.5 particulate matter can enter deep into the lungs and cause diseases. Still, Hindu devotees have not given up their religious practices at the Yamuna. On Tuesday morning, a young couple was among a group that visited the river bank, had a dip, and then left. Jasraj, a 70-year-old retired government clerk, said he has been visiting the river for a bathing ritual since 1980. 'I worship the river as a mother, and there is no question of its being clean or dirty. It's dirty on the surface but clean below the top,' said Jasraj, who uses one name. Imran Khan, a student, said one can't breathe properly in Delhi's polluted air. 'People are here for jogging, and they are facing problems, too. Our environment should be cleaner,' he said. Shishupal Kumar, a contract worker, said people visit the river from far-off places to perform religious rituals. 'The river has become completely dirty. It is full of chemicals. It looks like snowfall has happened here, like it happens on mountains,' Kumar said. The 1,376-kilometer (855-mile) Yamuna is one of the holiest rivers for Hindus. It is also among the most polluted in the world. Dangerously unhealthy waterways are a concern for many, especially with pollution expected to worsen during the upcoming Chhath Puja, a Hindu festival. The river has become dirtier over the years as sewage, farm pesticides and industrial effluents flow into the waterway despite laws against polluting and authorities setting up dozens of sewage treatment plants. The New Delhi government said officials were using defoamers to tackle the problem. Authorities have deployed dozens of motorboats to disperse the toxic foam and erected bamboo barricades to keep people away from the river banks. The officials worry that thousands of Hindu devotees next month will stand knee-deep in its frothy, toxic waters, sometimes even immersing themselves in a holy dip to mark Chhath Puja. Winters, in particular, have become a time of health woes in India’s capital, which is home to more than 20 million people. The city during winter is covered with a toxic haze that obscures the sky. Pollution levels soar as millions of Hindus celebrate 'Diwali,' the festival of light, amid emissions from massive firecrackers. Diwali will be celebrated on Thursday. Farmers in neighboring agricultural regions also set fire to their land after harvests to clear it for the next crop season. India's Supreme Court earlier this month slammed northern Indian states for not taking stricter action against people burning crop residues ahead of the winter season and aggravating the region's air pollution. Authorities each year shut construction sites, restrict diesel-run vehicles and deploy water sprinklers and anti-smog guns to control the haze and smog enveloping the skyline of the capital region. ___ Videojournalist Piyush Nagpal contributed to this report from New Delhi.	https://apnews.com/article/india-river-air-pollution-6c0a891de6fd1ce35c5689831b9220bc	2024-10-29T00:56:25-07:00	
Middle East latest: Hezbollah chooses new leader and vows to continue 'until victory'	Lebanon’s Hezbollah has chosen Sheikh Naim Kassem to succeed longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in an Israeli airstrike last month, as the militant group vowed Tuesday to continue 'until victory is achieved.' Kassem, 71, who had been Nasrallah’s deputy leader for over three decades, was elected the new secretary-general of Hezbollah by its decision-making Shura Council, the group said in a statement. Lebanon’s Health Ministry reported that more than 2,700 people had been killed and nearly 12,600 wounded since Oct. 8, 2023, when Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel, drawing retaliation. Israeli ground forces invaded southern Lebanon at the beginning of October. The death toll from more than a year of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza has passed 43,000, Palestinian officials reported Monday, without distinguishing between civilians and combatants. The Israel-Hamas war began after Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. ___ Here’s the latest: Israeli strikes in the Lebanese city of Sidon kill at least one person, state media says BEIRUT — At least one person was killed by two Israeli strikes in Sidon in south Lebanon, marking the second such attack on the historic coastal city since the recent escalation between Hezbollah and Israel, Lebanese state media reported. According to the National News Agency, the strikes hit an area housing displaced people that was adjacent to a Hezbollah complex called Sayyed Shohada, located a few hundred meters from a Lebanese army barracks. Four other people were wounded in the strike. The intended target of the strikes remains unclear and the number of casualties is expected to rise. Earlier Tuesday, the Israeli military had issued evacuation orders for 16 villages in South Lebanon, instructing residents to move north of the Awali River; however there was no warning issued prior to the strikes in Sidon. Rights group criticizes Israeli law to restrict UN agency's aid efforts to Palestinians JERUSALEM – Rights group Amnesty International slammed the Israeli parliament’s decision to restrict operations of the U.N. agency helping Palestinian refugees. 'This unconscionable law is an outright attack on the rights of Palestinian refugees. It is clearly designed to make it impossible for the agency to operate in the occupied Palestinian territory,' Amnesty's secretary-general, Agnès Callamard, said. 'It amounts to the criminalization of humanitarian aid and will worsen an already catastrophic humanitarian crisis.' Callamard said UNRWA plays an indispensable role in providing food, water, medical services, shelter and education in Gaza. She urged the international community to condemn the legislation and press for its repeal. 'This appalling, inhumane law will only exacerbate the suffering of Palestinians, who have endured unimaginable hardship since the horrific attacks by Hamas and other armed groups in southern Israel one year ago, and whose need for global support is greater than ever,' she said. UN agencies warn that Israel's ban on UNRWA would leave big gaps in support for Palestinians GENEVA — Multiple United Nations agencies rallied Tuesday around their fellow organization that provides aid to Palestinian refugees after Israel’s parliament took steps to ban it in the coming months. The World Food Program is deeply concerned about the restrictions, spokeswoman Abeer Etefa said Tuesday when asked whether the WFP might take up the work of UNRWA. 'The World Food Program’s mandate is to deliver food assistance to people in need,' she said. 'WFP cannot replace the equally important critical functions of UNRWA in Gaza, including the running of shelters and health clinics.' Spokesman Tarik Jasarevic of the World Health Organization said 3,000 of UNRWA’s roughly 13,000 staff are health workers. Those health staff have provided more than 6 million medical consultations from its centers over the last year. Activities include immunizations, disease surveillance, and screening for malnutrition, and UNRWA’s work 'couldn’t be matched by any agency — including WHO.' Spokespeople from U.N. agencies for children, health and migration were among those who stressed that UNRWA is the 'backbone' of the world body’s operations in Gaza, Jeremy Laurence, spokesman for the U.N. human rights office, said that 'without UNRWA, the delivery of food, shelter, health care, education, amongst other things, to most of Gaza’s population would grind to a halt.' 'Civilians have already paid the heaviest price of this conflict over the past year,' he said. 'Cruelly, this decision will only make matters worse for them' Hezbollah-Israel conflict threatens Lebanon's fragile economy, report says BEIRUT — Analysis from a humanitarian group working in Lebanon forecasts two scenarios in its report on the Hezbollah-Israel conflict, both predicting a severe economic contraction in Lebanon by early 2025. Mercy Corps’ Lebanon Crisis Analysis Team says Israel’s continued strikes on suspected Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, without blocking key infrastructure, will still bring severe economic and humanitarian risks. Lebanon’s economy could contract by 12.81% , or $2.305 billion by January 2025, with impacts hitting agriculture, manufacturing, and services hard in the South and Bekaa Valley. Agriculture in South Lebanon, which drives 80% of its economy, may come to a halt, while factories face shutdowns, the report says. 'The Bekaa Valley, responsible for 2% of national GDP, will see similar disruptions, with 70% of farmland under threat and many Syrian laborers fleeing,' it adds. The service sector, particularly tourism, stands to lose $1.256 billion, potentially crippling a vital part of the economy. If Israel imposes a stricter blockade and expands bombings to key infrastructure, Lebanon’s economic loss could rise to 21.9% of GDP, or $3.938 billion, according to the report. Over 1.5 million people could be displaced, with political and intercommunal tensions intensifying as Shia Muslims flee to diverse religious regions that are majority Christian, Druze or Sunni Muslim, the report adds. Already, 1.2 million people have been displaced from villages in southern and eastern Lebanon as well as Beirut’s southern suburbs. Lebanon, already enduring a five-year economic crisis marked by a severe currency collapse, had just begun showing signs of recovery before the war erupted. France says Israel's UNRWA ban will have serious consequences for Gaza PARIS — France 'deeply deplores' the adoption by the Israeli Parliament of two bills aimed at banning the activities of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees on Israeli soil, the French foreign ministry said. 'The implementation of these bills would have very serious consequences on the humanitarian situation in Gaza, which is already catastrophic, but also throughout the occupied Palestinian territories, depriving hundreds of thousands of civilians of essential aid in terms of shelter, care, education and food,' the statement said. France 'reaffirms its support to UNRWA' and will continue to 'ensure that the reforms needed' to ensure its neutrality are implemented, the French foreign ministry said. Austrian soldiers in UN Lebanon force are lightly injured by missile strike VIENNA — Eight Austrian soldiers serving in the U.N. force in Lebanon were lightly injured in a missile strike at the Naqoura camp on Tuesday, Austrian authorities said. Defense Ministry spokesperson Michael Bauer wrote on social network X that the incident happened Tuesday lunchtime. He said it wasn’t immediately clear who was responsible for the strike. The injuries were 'light and superficial scrapes,' Bauer said. UNIFIL said in a statement that the rocket that hit its headquarters in Naqoura this afternoon was fired from the north, 'likely by Hezbollah or an affiliated group.' 'Peacekeepers were not in bunkers at the time. While some peacekeepers suffered minor injuries, fortunately, no one was seriously injured,' the statement added. UNIFIL spokesperson Dany Ghafary confirmed to the Associated Press that it was the same episode that injured eight Austrian U.N. peacekeepers. 'We have opened an investigation into the incident. We remind Hezbollah and all actors of their obligations to ensure the safety and security of UN personnel and property,' the statement said. 4 Israeli soldiers killed in northern Gaza, military says TEL AVIV, Israel — The Israeli military said that four soldiers were killed Tuesday in battle in the northern Gaza Strip. The military did not disclose the exact circumstances behind the deaths. Israel has refocused its offensive in Gaza on the territory’s hard-hit north, which was an early target of the war. Soldiers have been conducting raids and strikes to target what the military says are pockets of militancy. More than 360 soldiers have been killed since Israel launched its ground invasion in Gaza last year in response to Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023 attacks on southern Israel. Foreign ministers of Cyprus and Luxembourg say UNRWA is ‘indispensable’ NICOSIA, Cyprus — The foreign ministers of Cyprus and Luxembourg say the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees is 'indispensable' to providing food, education and health care to Palestinians and that the international community must do whatever it can to enable the agency to continue its work. Cyprus’ top diplomat Constantinos Kombos said after talks with his Luxembourgian counterpart Xavier Bettel on Tuesday that the work of UNRWA is 'extremely valuable' throughout the Middle East, calling its delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza 'imperative.' Bettel said 'there is no alternative' to UNWRA’s work to help people in Palestine because without the agency, 'there is no education, there is no health, there is no food.' The diplomats made the remarks after the Israeli parliament on Monday passed two laws that could prevent UNRWA from being able to continue its work. The laws ban the agency from operating and cut all ties between it and the Israeli government. Bettel said his country would continue to support UNWRA and would raise the issue in his meetings with his Israeli counterpart and the president of the Israeli parliament when he visits Israel later Tuesday. He will also meet with the Palestinian prime minister and UNWRA officials. UNICEF spokesman sharply criticizes Israeli parliament's move to ban UNRWA GENEVA — A UNICEF spokesman says the move by Israeli’s parliament to ban the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees 'means that a new way has been found to kill children.' James Elder says an inability for the refugee agency, UNRWA, to operate 'would likely see the collapse of the humanitarian system in Gaza' and the U.N. children’s agency 'would become effectively unable to distribute lifesaving supplies.' He said that would impede deliveries of vaccines, winter clothes, hygiene kits, health kits, water, and ready-to-use therapeutic food to combat malnutrition. Elder said a decision like the one by the Israeli parliament, or Knesset, 'suddenly means that a new way has been found to kill children.' IOM head says the migration agency unable to fill a gap left by UNRWA GENEVA — The director-general of the International Organization for Migration, Amy Pope, said that the United Nations body is not capable of fully filling a gap left by UNRWA, which she described as 'absolutely essential.' 'They provide, education. They provide health care. They provide some of the most basic needs, for people who have been living there for decades,' Pope said of UNRWA. 'That’s not something that IOM does what IOM does well.' She said IOM is able to assist with ongoing humanitarian support, such as offering help to displaced people and providing shelter and hygiene kits. 'There’s no way for IOM to step in to do what UNRWA has done. UNRWA is absolutely essential to the people of Gaza, and I don’t want to leave anyone with the misimpression that IOM can play that role, because we cannot,' she said. Projectile launched from Lebanon kills 1 in northern Israel TEL AVIV, Israel — Israeli authorities said Tuesday one person was killed after a projectile launched from Lebanon slammed into a northern city. The Israeli military said about 50 projectiles were launched from Lebanon into Israel. It said some of the launches were intercepted by Israel’s aerial defense system and others fell in the area. Israeli police said they received a number of reports of fallen projectiles, which caused damage to property, in the city of Maalot-Tarshiha. The Israeli rescue service Magen David Adom said a man was killed in the strike. The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah said it fired rockets toward the area. Hezbollah has fired thousands of rockets into Israel since Oct. 8, 2023, when it began attacking Israel in solidarity with Hamas a day after its cross-border attack. Fighting between Israel and Hezbollah has intensified in recent weeks after Israel launched a ground invasion into Lebanon. Turkey slams Israeli decision to ban UNRWA activity violates international law ISTANBUL — Turkey’s Foreign Ministry called Israel’s decision to ban the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East a 'clear violation of international law.' In a statement Tuesday, the Turkish Foreign Ministry said the move undermines efforts toward a two-state solution and obstructs the right of return for Palestinian refugees. 'By targeting UNRWA, Israel aims to eliminate the two-state solution and prevent the return of Palestinian refugees to their homeland,' the statement read. Israel accuses the agency of turning a blind eye to staff members it says belong to Hamas, divert aid and use UNRWA facilities for military purposes. Israel says around a dozen of the agency's 13,000 employees in Gaza participated in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel. The agency denies it knowingly aids armed groups and says it acts quickly to purge any suspected militants among its staff. The agency is the major distributor of aid in Gaza and provides education, health and other basic services to millions of Palestinian refugees across the region, including in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. 'It is the legal and moral obligation of the international community to take a strong stance against attempts to ban the activities of UNRWA,' the ministry added, noting that the agency was created by a U.N. General Assembly resolution. Turkey, which currently chairs the UNRWA’s Working Group on Financing, pledged to continue its support for the agency. British charity Christian Aid criticizes Israeli parliament's move to restrict UNRWA's work JERUSALEM — Christian Aid, a British charity, criticized the Israeli parliamentary decision to restrict the work of UNRWA. 'Severing this lifeline in Gaza as winter threatens to exacerbate an already desperate situation is cruel and dangerous,' the group’s Middle East head, William Bell, said in a statement Tuesday. Israeli lawmakers passed two laws Monday that could threaten the work of the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees. UNRWA is the largest aid provider in Gaza, but the laws would sever Israel’s ties with the agency and bar it from operating on Israeli soil, raising concerns about whether it could continue to provide basic services in both Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Bell alleged that the move is part of Israel’s 'ongoing challenge to the eligibility of Palestinian refugees to claim the right of return' in Israel and occupied Palestinian territories. 'Once again international leaders have either been unable or unwilling to protect the most basic rights of Palestinians, including their existence as a sovereign people,' he said. Lebanon’s Hezbollah says it has chosen Naim Kassem to replace slain leader Hassan Nasrallah BEIRUT — Lebanon’s Hezbollah militant group says it has chosen Naim Kassem to replace its slain leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in September in an Israeli airstrike. Kassem, a longtime deputy to Nasrallah, has served as the militant group’s acting leader since Nasrallah’s death. His appointment to replace Nasrallah was announced Tuesday. Dozens are killed or wounded in an Israeli strike on a building housing displaced Palestinians in Gaza DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — An Israeli strike on a five-story building where displaced Palestinians were sheltering in the northern Gaza Strip killed at least 60 people early Tuesday, according to health officials. Dr. Marwan al-Hams, director of the field hospitals’ department at the Gaza Health Ministry, announced the toll from Tuesday’s strike in the northern town of Beit Lahiya at a news conference. He says another 17 people are missing. The ministry’s emergency service says the dead include at least 12 women and 20 children, including babies. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, which has been waging a large-scale operation in northern Gaza for more than three weeks, targeting what it says are pockets of Hamas militants who have regrouped there. Dr. Hossam Abu Safiya, the director of the nearby Kamal Adwan Hospital, said it was overwhelmed by the wave of wounded people from the strike. Israeli forces raided the medical facility over the weekend, detaining dozens of medics. Israel says it detained scores of Hamas militants in the raid. The Israeli military has repeatedly struck shelters for displaced people in recent months, saying it carried out precise strikes targeting Palestinian militants and tried to avoid harming civilians. The strikes have often killed women and children. United Nations chief warns Israel against barring UNRWA from its work UNITED NATIONS — The United Nations chief is warning that if two laws adopted by Israel’s parliament are implemented, the U.N. agency providing essential services to Palestinian refugees in Gaza and the West Bank would likely be prevented from continuing work that is mandated by the U.N. General Assembly. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the work of the agency known as UNRWA 'indispensable,' and said implementing the laws 'could have devastating consequences for Palestinian refugees in the occupied Palestinian territories, which is unacceptable.' 'There is no alternative to UNRWA,' he said in a statement issued Monday night. UNRWA was established by the General Assembly in 1949 to provide relief for Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes before and during the 1948 war that followed Israel’s establishment, as well as their descendants. The laws adopted Monday by Israel’s parliament, which do not immediately go into effect, will sever ties with the agency and bar UNRWA from operating on Israeli soil. They were approved amid an escalating humanitarian crisis in Gaza, now in the second year of Israel’s military retaliation following Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attacks in southern Israel. Guterres called on Israel 'to act consistently with its obligations' under the U.N. Charter and international law, as well as the privileges and immunities of the United Nations. 'National legislation cannot alter those obligations,' Guterres stressed. He said implementing the laws would be detrimental to resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and more broadly for peace and security in the region.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-hezbollah-mideast-latest-29-october-2024-18bf8e25ae51c6e608346b0ef8b125c4	2024-10-29T00:47:35-07:00	
Hungary's Orbán boosts Georgia's ruling party over election despite an outcry the vote was rigged	TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán gave a boost Tuesday to Georgia’s ruling party, saying its victory in a parliamentary election in the South Caucasus nation was free and democratic despite a massive opposition protest that denounced the vote as rigged and illegitimate. Orbán, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s closest partner in the European Union, is the first foreign leader to visit Georgia following Saturday's vote that the country's electoral commission said was won by the ruling Georgian Dream party. Georgia's president and opposition said the election was 'stolen' with the help of Russia, claiming there was widespread ballot fraud and violence, with the EU and the U.S. calling for a full investigation. But Orbán gave a different assessment after meeting with his counterpart, Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze, and congratulating him on the victory by his Georgian Dream party. 'I look at the debate that has erupted around the election, I read the evaluations of international organizations, and I see that no one dares to question that this election was a free and democratic choice,' Orbán said. People rallied outside parliament Monday night, demanding a new election under international supervision and an investigation into the alleged vote rigging. The protest underlined tensions in the country which lies between Russia and Turkey and where the Georgian Dream party has become increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow. Orbán was booed after arriving at his hotel in Tbilisi on Monday evening. Protesters called him a 'political prostitute' and 'puppet' in Russian and Hungarian, using expletives to tell him to leave the country. Kobakhidze said Orbán's visit had 'particular significance' as it takes place during Hungary’s presidency of the Council of the European Union although the bloc said he doesn't have any mandate for the visit. Georgian Dream told voters it is committed to joining the EU despite the fact Brussels suspended Georgia’s membership process after the party adopted a Russian-style 'foreign influence law' in June that critics say curbs press freedom. Pursuit of EU membership and NATO is written into Georgia's constitution and many in the country of 3.7 million viewed Saturday’s vote as a pivotal referendum on the opportunity to join the bloc. Georgian Dream, established by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia, has adopted laws similar to those used by the Kremlin to crack down on freedom of speech and LGBTQ+ rights. The party campaigned on joining Europe with 'dignity' — a principle Kobakhidze referenced Tuesday when he suggested Georgia and Hungary shared 'Christian values,' possibly alluding to similar laws passed in Hungary. Orbán said it was clear 'the opposition and the ruling party are committed to European integration,' rejecting opposition claims that Georgian Dream opposes it. 'While you are pursuing a pro-European policy, you have not allowed your country to become a second Ukraine,' Orbán said, urging Kobakhidze to ignore any criticism about the election. Orbán’s comments appeared to echo some of Georgian Dream’s campaign rhetoric that accused the opposition of trying to destabilize the country and hinted that Ukraine's fate could befall Georgia. President Salome Zourabichvili, who has rejected the election results, told The Associated Press on Monday that Georgia has fallen victim to Russian pressure against joining the EU. She said she hopes the West backs the opposition and protesters who are disputing the result of the election. 'We’ve seen that Russian propaganda was directly used,' said Zourabichvili, whose duties are mostly ceremonial president. A fierce critic of Georgian Dream, she said the government has been 'working hand-in-hand with Russia,' and 'probably' received help from Moscow’s security services. The Kremlin rejected accusations of interference. Zourabichvili said 'technology' was used to manipulate the vote and suggested some voter IDs were confiscated before the election from prisoners or people on welfare and used to vote 'up to 17 times.' Monday night's protest ended peacefully, with no clear plans for further actions from the president or opposition, and it was unclear who would investigate the alleged voting irregularities. 'There is no trust for the state to investigate these cases,' said Natia Seskuria, executive director of the Regional Institute for Security Studies in Tbilisi. 'The most immediate task that they have is to prove the elections were rigged,' she said, adding it will be difficult in a system which is 'largely run by the ruling party.' Civil society and opposition groups claim to have widespread evidence of violence, fraud and other voting irregularities but it is unclear how they will demonstrate it, Seskuria said. The Central Election Commission said Tuesday it was asked by opposition parties to provide a list of people who cast ballots. It declined, said CEC spokeswoman Natia Ioseliani, citing the risk of disclosing 'personal data,' which is 'one of the recognized fundamental principles of elections.' Accepting the election result would mean 'Georgia is lost for its people and Georgia is lost for Europe for the foreseeable future,' said Zaza Bibilashvili, founder of the Chavchavadze Center, a civil society organization. 'The stakes,' he said, 'are very high.' Zourabichvili urged the West not to abandon Georgia in the election's aftermath. Asked if she wants sanctions imposed on Georgian officials, Zourabichvili told AP that it’s up to Western leaders but that 'certainly time has not come to renew relations with authorities that are not legitimate.' EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell urged Georgian authorities to hold a 'transparent inquiry' and said the 'democratic backsliding in the country needs to be reversed.' In Washington, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Georgia's election environment was 'shaped by the ruling party’s policies, including misuse of public resources, vote-buying and voter intimidation.' 'We encourage Georgia’s governing officials to consider the relationship they want with the Euro-Atlantic community, rather than strengthening policies that are praised by authoritarians,' he said. The U.S. has consistently urged the Georgian government to 'walk back' its anti-democratic actions, he said, adding that 'we do not rule out further consequences,' although he did not elaborate. ___ Associated Press writer Sophiko Megrelidze in Tbilisi contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/georgia-election-russia-eu-protests-923b9523fb45d31d3fff655127a28c60	2024-10-29T00:15:37-07:00	
Boat carrying Egyptian migrants to Europe capsizes off Libyan coast, killing 12	CAIRO (AP) — A boat carrying 13 Egyptian migrants to Europe has capsized off Libya's coast, killing all on board except for one person, local authorities and a Libyan group said Tuesday. Al-Abreen, a group that provides humanitarian assistance to migrants in Libya, said on Facebook that the boat capsized 60 kilometers (37 miles) east of the city of Tobruk on Monday evening. One migrant survived, according to the group, which said the bodies were recovered and brought to shore. The Directorate for Combating Illegal Migration in Tobruk also confirmed the incident. In recent years, the North African nation has become the dominant transit point for migrants fleeing war and poverty in Africa and the Middle East. Last month, a migrant boat carrying 32 people capsized off the Libyan coast due to engine failure, leaving one person dead and 22 others missing, according to Libyan authorities. The coast guard in Tobruk said nine people were rescued. Al-Abreen said the boat was bound for Europe and was carrying migrants from Egypt and Syria. Human traffickers have long taken advantage of instability in Libya that escalated after a NATO-backed uprising overthrew and killed longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi in 2011. Traffickers smuggle migrants on crammed, poorly equipped vessels on risky sea trips across the North African nation’s borders, which are shared with six countries. Last year, 962 migrants died and 1,563 went missing off Libya, the International Organization for Migration said. About 17,200 migrants were intercepted and sent back to Libya in 2023, the organization said.	https://apnews.com/article/libya-egyptian-migrants-boat-capsize-65a8574344deafdba6880e5461d165af	2024-10-28T23:53:20-07:00	
Israeli strike in northern Gaza kills at least 60, officials say, as Hezbollah announces new leader	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — An Israeli strike on a five-story building where displaced Palestinians were sheltering in the northern Gaza Strip killed at least 60 people early Tuesday, more than half of them women and children, Gaza’s Health Ministry said. In a separate development, Lebanon's militant group Hezbollah said it has chosen Sheikh Naim Kassem as its new top leader following the killing of Hassan Nasrallah in an Israeli airstrike last month. Israel also faced backlash from aid groups after its parliament passed legislation that could severely restrict the ability of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees to operate in the Palestinian territories. The agency, known as UNRWA, is the largest aid provider in Gaza. Hezbollah said in a statement that its decision-making Shura Council elected Kassem, who had been Nasrallah's deputy leader for over three decades, as the new secretary-general. Hezbollah vowed to continue with Nasrallah’s policies 'until victory is achieved.' Kassem, 71, a founding member of the militant group established following Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon, had been serving as acting leader after Nasrallah was killed on Sept. 27. He has given several televised speeches vowing that Hezbollah will fight on despite a string of setbacks. Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel, drawing retaliation, after Hamas’ surprise attack out of Gaza on Oct. 7, 2023, triggered the war there. Iran, which backs both groups, has also traded fire with Israel on two occasions. The tensions with Hezbollah boiled over last month, as Israel unleashed a wave of heavy airstrikes and killed Nasrallah and most of his senior commanders. Israel launched a ground invasion into Lebanon at the start of October. Strike in northern Gaza comes as Israel wages a major operation there Even as attention has shifted to Lebanon and Iran in recent weeks, Israel has continued to wage a large operation in northern Gaza and to carry out airstrikes across the territory. Dr. Marwan al-Hams, director of the field hospitals’ department at the Gaza Health Ministry, announced the toll from Tuesday’s strike in the northern town of Beit Lahiya at a news conference. He said another 17 people are missing. The ministry's emergency service said at least 12 women and 20 children were among the dead, including babies. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, which has been waging the operation in northern Gaza for more than three weeks, targeting what it says are pockets of Hamas militants who have regrouped there. The dead included a mother and her five children, some of them adults, and a second mother with her six children, according to an initial casualty list provided by the emergency service. Dr. Hossam Abu Safiya, the director of the nearby Kamal Adwan Hospital, said it was overwhelmed by the wave of wounded people from the strike. Israeli forces raided the medical facility over the weekend, detaining dozens of medics. The army said it detained scores of Hamas militants. 'The healthcare system has completely collapsed,' Abu Safiya said in a voice message to journalists on Tuesday. He said people who arrive wounded are dying because there is no care for them. The Israeli military has repeatedly struck shelters for displaced people in recent months, saying it carried out precise strikes targeting Palestinian militants and tried to avoid harming civilians. The strikes have often killed women and children. The military said it detained scores of Hamas militants in the raid on Kamal Adwan, the latest in a series of raids on hospitals since the start of the war. Israel's latest major operation in northern Gaza, focused on the Jabaliya refugee camp, has killed hundreds of people and driven tens of thousands from their homes in another wave of mass displacement more than a year into the war in the tiny coastal territory. Israeli laws targeting UN agency could further restrict aid Israel has also sharply restricted aid to the north this month, prompting a warning from the United States that failure to facilitate greater aid efforts could lead to a reduction in military aid. Palestinians fear Israel is enacting a plan proposed by a group of former generals, who suggested the civilian population of the north should be ordered to evacuate, aid supplies should be cut off, and anyone remaining there should be considered a militant. The military has denied carrying out such a plan while the government has not said clearly whether it is carrying out all or part of it. On Monday, Israel's parliament passed two laws that ban UNRWA from operating on Israeli soil and cut all ties between the agency and the Israeli government. Israel controls access to both Gaza and the occupied West Bank, and it was unclear how the agency would continue to operate there. Israel says UNRWA has been infiltrated by Hamas and that the militant group siphons off aid and uses U.N. facilities to shield its activities, allegations denied by the U.N. agency. Aid groups have warned that there is no immediate replacement for UNRWA, which provides education, health care and emergency aid to millions of Palestinian refugees from the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation and their descendants. Refugee families make up the majority of Gaza's population. 'Severing this lifeline in Gaza as winter threatens to exacerbate an already desperate situation is cruel and dangerous,' said William Bell, the Middle East head of Christian Aid, a British charity. The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 43,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities. Around 90% of the population of 2.3 million have been displaced from their homes, often multiple times. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo and Mroue from Beirut. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-lebanon-hezbollah-iran-news-10-29-2024-befe1b42ef25599539198fa04e089f04	2024-10-28T23:01:11-07:00	
Congo wants UN peacekeepers gone. But endless war around minerals is complicating that	GOMA, Congo (AP) — The end of one of the world's deadliest and yet most shadowy wars is as difficult to predict as the end of the large peacekeeping force meant to contain it. Congo desperately wants stability in its mineral-rich east, of intense interest to the global economy. But political friction means the government wants the longtime United Nations peacekeeping force there to get out. That would leave the vast region, overrun with dozens of armed groups including one affiliated with the Islamic State organization, with even less defense for millions of displaced civilians. But frustration has become so high with the peacekeepers that many Congolese want them gone, too. The Associated Press witnessed the dilemma on a rare visit and night patrol with the U.N. force now known as MONUSCO, which entered Congo more than two decades ago and has 14,000 peacekeepers on the ground. It patrols a landscape that feels far from the authority of Congo's government, with its dirt roads churned into slippery mud in pounding rains and residents long accustomed to feeling that, security-wise, they are on their own. Some of the region's armed groups are self-defense collectives. During a visit to one frontline town, Sake, about 14 miles (24 kilometers) from the regional hub of Goma, the AP spoke with militia members trying to defend the population from a resurgent group, the M23, and its sniper fire from surrounding hills. The M23 is backed by neighboring Rwanda, whose government denies it. The involvement of better-equipped Rwandan forces, with U.N. experts estimating up to 4,000 of them in Congo, has led to talk of war by Congo's government. A July truce brokered by the United States and Angola has reduced the fighting between Rwandan and Congolese forces, but clashes between M23 and other militias continue. 'We are fighting the enemy who is a foreigner in our country. They are not Congolese, but they want to take Congo,' said one fighter, Amini Bauma. Sake is one of the last main routes into Goma under government control, but fierce fighting this year forced most residents to flee, leaving boarded-up homes. About 160 civilians and soldiers came through Sake’s military hospital during the summer, most with gunshot wounds, said Omar Kalamo, a nurse. In August, a bomb exploded behind the building, he said. Some who fled are now returning, finding little safety elsewhere. Bitakuya Buhesha found his house destroyed. But he said he’d rather brave the gunfire than live in displacement camps, which have been infiltrated by fighters. 'We’ve waited a long time and we do don’t know whether our army will win this war or if it’ll be the M23 rebels,' he said. Many Congolese who once looked to the U.N. peacekeeping force with hope are now angry. Multiple protests, some of them violent, have targeted the force in recent years. Last year, at Congo’s request, the U.N. Security Council voted unanimously to draw down the peacekeeping force and gradually hand over its security responsibilities to Congo’s government by this December. But the soaring violence means that departure is now delayed. On a recent day, peacekeepers in armored vehicles pulled into a small base in the hazy hills outside Goma, its tents surrounded by looping razor wire and sandbags. Troops perched with a machine gun pointed in the rebels' direction. In recent months, clashes between Congo’s army and M23 came within a mile of the base. The U.N. force is trying to find new ways to repel the rebels. Last year, it established new bases between the frontlines and about 600,000 displaced people sheltering around Goma. It is training Congolese soldiers in the hope that they can fill the security void once it leaves. 'If the belligerent armed groups had come forward and attacked the civilians, the MONUSCO would have changed its stance purely from defensive to offensive operations,' said U.N’s center sector commander for North Kivu province, Brig. General Ranjan Mahajan. MONUSCO described the security challenges 'multiple and multifaceted' and said only one of its brigades is tasked to go on the offensive. That affects a single area, Beni, where deadly attacks have been especially frequent. The U.N. mission otherwise is defensive and works alongside Congolese forces and others. But some Congolese, who see the U.N. force as not aggressive enough, said any new efforts to protect them are futile. 'You can see that MONUSCO is there, but that’s in name only ... People are dying, but it does nothing,' said Maombie Aline, a displaced person in Goma. And yet, the international community has warned that the U.N. force's pullout would leave a security vacuum. More than 80% of Congo’s 7 million displaced people live in areas protected by the U.N., according to the Africa Center for Strategic Studies. Last month, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said the peacekeepers' pullout from South Kivu province in June left critical gaps, and the Security Council shouldn't authorize further withdrawals until there's a plan to mitigate them. The U.S. is the force's top financial supporter. Congo’s communication minister, Patrick Muyaya, said there would be a new timeline for MONUSCO’s departure, but didn't give details. He said a joint team of government and U.N. officials was evaluating the situation. Goma's streets are full of armed men, local and foreign. In addition to the U.N. force and an unknown number of Congolese forces, there are about 1,000 foreign mercenaries, a coalition of local militia and a Southern African regional force. A recently deployed East African force was kicked out amid criticism it was ineffective. 'It’s a military jungle,' said Onesphore Sematumba, a Congolese researcher for the International Crisis Group. 'There are many actors, but everyone has their own agenda ... they can’t make a difference because they are divided.' Global interest in eastern Congo's minerals is one reason the violence is so difficult to be contained, experts said. Congo is the world’s largest producer of cobalt, a mineral used to make lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles and smartphones. It also has substantial gold, diamond, copper and cobalt reserves. In May, M23 fighters seized the town of Rubaya, which holds deposits of tantalum — used in electronics, including Apple devices —and extracted from coltan. The area is estimated to supply more than 15% of global production of tantalum and now generates about $300,000 a month for M23, said Bintou Keita, head of Congo's U.N. mission. U.N. experts in June said a portion of Rubaya minerals have been smuggled across the Rwandan border. Rwanda is selling minerals from eastern Congo and passing them off as conflict-free, said Darren Davids, an analyst with the Economist Intelligence Unit — allegations documented by both U.N experts and the U.S. Davids said the international community has hesitated to meaningfully call on Rwanda to stop the fighting because it has become a reliable trading partner for the West as competition grows for the minerals. Meanwhile, the Rwandan-backed rebels are accused of obstructing and threatening the U.N. mission so it can seize more territory, and are widely expected to benefit from its departure. Rwanda’s government and M23 didn’t respond to requests for comment. ___ The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

As Israel strikes deeper into Lebanon, fear rises in communities where the displaced took refuge	AITO, Lebanon (AP) — Dany Alwan stood shaking as rescue workers pulled remains from piles of rubble where his brother’s building once stood. An Israeli airstrike destroyed the three-story residential building in the quiet Christian village of Aito a day before. His brother, Elie, had rented out its apartments to a friend who'd fled here with relatives from their hometown in southern Lebanon under Israeli bombardment. Things were fine for a few weeks. But that day, minutes after visitors arrived and entered the building, it was struck. Almost two dozen people were killed, half of them women and children. Israel said it targeted a Hezbollah official, as it has insisted in other strikes with high civilian death tolls. This strike — in northern Lebanon, deep in Christian heartland — was particularly unusual. Israel has concentrated its bombardment mostly in the country’s south and east and in Beirut's southern suburbs — Shiite-majority areas where the Hezbollah militant group has a strong presence. Strikes in the traditionally 'safe' areas where many displaced families have fled are raising fears among local residents. Many feel they have to choose between helping compatriots and protecting themselves. 'We can’t welcome people anymore,' Alwan said as rescue teams combed through the rubble in Aito. 'The situation is very critical in the village, and this is the first time something like this has happened to us.' The war brings out long-running tensions Aito is in the Zgharta province, which is split between Christian factions who are supporters and critics of Hezbollah. Some Christian legislators critical of Hezbollah have warned of the security risks that could come with hosting displaced people, mostly from the Shia Muslim community. They worry that many may have familial and social ties to Hezbollah, which in addition to its armed wing has civilian services across southern and eastern Lebanon. Some also worry that long-term displacement could create demographic changes and weaken the Christian share in Lebanon’s fragile sectarian power-sharing system. The tiny country has a troubled history of sectarian strife and violence, most notably in a 15-year civil war that ended in 1990. Lebanon for decades has struggled to navigate tensions and political gridlock within its sectarian power-sharing government system. Parliament is deeply divided among factions that back and oppose Hezbollah and has been without a president for almost two years. When Hezbollah fired rockets at northern Israel in solidarity with Palestinian ally Hamas in the war-torn Gaza Strip, the move was met with mixed feelings. Critics say it was a miscalculation that has brought the widespread devastation of Gaza here. Many have been moved to help After nearly a year of low-level fighting, the Israeli military escalated its attacks against Hezbollah a month ago, launching daily aerial bombardments and a ground invasion. Most of Lebanon’s estimated 1.2 million displaced people fled over the past month. In late September, traffic jams stretching for miles clogged streets leading to Beirut as people left, some with nothing but the clothes on their backs. For many, the violence has moved them to help their fellow residents, cutting across sectarian lines. Michella Sfeir, who was safe in the north, said she wanted to take action after seeing a picture of a driver pouring water from his bottle into a nearby driver’s empty one. 'The first thing you can think of is: How can I help immediately?' she said. She now helps prepare meals at a women’s art center that's become a community kitchen and donation dropoff center for blankets, clothes, and supplies in Aqaibe, a seaside town just north of Beirut. Displaced women who found shelter in surrounding neighborhoods regularly visit, while some people involved in other initiatives help deliver the hot meals to shelters around dinnertime. 'We get lots of questions like, ‘When you go to give the help, is there a member of Hezbollah waiting for you at the door?’' Sfeir said, citing blowback in the community from people who perceive the displaced as Hezbollah members, supporters and relatives. 'Some people ... would ask us ‘Why are you helping them? They don’t deserve it; this is because of them.'' Anxiety rises far from the border Though northern coastal cities such as Byblos and Batroun with pristine beaches and ancient ruins have not felt the direct pain of the conflict, anxiety is rising in surrounding areas. On one coastal road — the busy Jounieh highway — an Israeli drone struck a car earlier this month, killing a man and his wife. Such rare but increasing Israeli strikes have rattled residents in the north. Many feel torn: Should they risk their security by hosting displaced people, or compromise their morals and turn them away? Zeinab Rihan fled north with family and relatives from the southern Nabatiyeh province when they couldn’t bear the airstrikes approaching closer to their homes. But, Rihan said, they found many landlords quoting outlandish rent figures in an apparent attempt to turn them away. Some might have been acting out of personal prejudice, Rihan said, but it's likely most were simply afraid. 'They were scared that they might rent their place to someone who turns out to be targeted,' Rihan said. 'But this is our current reality, what can we do?' For some, helping is a sense of duty A resident of one northern town near the coast said the local government didn't want to welcome displaced people, but many residents pressured the municipality to change course. He cited the town’s common sympathy and sense of duty to help others, despite the security risks. He spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity for fear of stirring tension among residents. Elsewhere, in the hilly village of Ebrine, a stone’s throw away from Batroun, residents have been regularly visiting dozens of displaced families sheltering in two modest schools. This month, an Israeli strike hit a village a short drive away, but that hasn't stopped some residents from hiring the displaced — for some, to work in olive groves during the harvest season. Back in Aqaibe, some displaced women from nearby areas have joined Sfeir and others volunteering at the kitchen: chopping vegetables, cooking rice in vats, packaging meals in plastic containers, and having coffee together on the balcony. 'Just because we’re in an area that doesn’t have direct conflict or direct war doesn’t mean that we’re not worried about Beirut or the south,' said Flavia Bechara, who founded the center, as she took a break from chopping onions and potatoes. 'We all used to eat the olives and olive oil of the south, and we used to go there to get fruits and vegetables.' Bechara and several women finished packing dozens of meals for the day, and a group of women came to pick up winter clothes for their kids. Bechara said she isn’t phased by the criticism or questions she gets from some of her neighbors. 'There’s always anxiety,' said Bechara, who just recently could hear strikes a short drive away, in Maisra. 'There’s always (the fear) that what is happening there can happen here at any moment.'	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-war-displacement-hezbollah-395ccfd8ff7e230b474867b13e594b1b	2024-10-28T20:25:50-07:00	
Stock market today: Global shares mostly rise after Wall Street climbs on Big Tech gains	TOKYO (AP) — Global shares were mostly up Tuesday after U.S. stocks closed broadly higher with gains in Big Tech companies offsetting a skid in oil and gas stocks. France's CAC 40 gained 0.3% in early trading to 7,580.12, while Germany's DAX rose nearly 0.3% to 19,586.90. Britain's FTSE 100 was also up 0.3% to 8,308.83. U.S. shares were set to be little changed, with Dow futures down less than 0.1% at 42,576.00. S&amp;P 500 futures inched up less than 0.1% at 5,864.00. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 added 0.8% to finish at 38,903.68. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 gained 0.3% to 8,249.20. South Korea's Kospi added 0.2% to 2,617.80. Hong Kong's Hang Seng edged up 0.5% to 20,701.14, while the Shanghai Composite slipped 1.1% to 3,286.41. In Japan, the government reported that unemployment stood at 2.4% last month, marking an improvement of 0.1 percentage point, and the second straight month of recovery. The continuing weak yen is helping hold up Japanese stocks. In currency trading, the U.S. dollar gained to 153.32 Japanese yen from 153.23 yen. The euro cost $1.0820, inching up from $1.0817. Recently, stocks in the oil-and-gas industry have been hurt by the sinking price of oil. In energy trading in Asia Tuesday, benchmark U.S. crude rose 15 cents to $67.53 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, added 18 cents to $71.60 a barrel. On Monday, a barrel of benchmark U.S. crude fell 6.1%, and Brent crude slid 6.1%. That was the first trading for them since Israel attacked Iranian military targets on Saturday, in retaliation for an earlier barrage of ballistic missiles. Israel’s attack was more restrained than some investors had feared it could be, and it raised hopes that a worst-case scenario may be avoided. Beyond the violence that is taking a human toll, the worry in financial markets is that an escalating war in the Middle East could cut off the flow of crude from Iran, which is a major oil producer. Such worries had sent the price of Brent crude up to nearly $81 per barrel in early October, despite signals that plenty of oil is available for the global economy. It’s since fallen back below $72. Financial markets are also dealing with the volatility that typically surrounds a U.S. presidential election, with Election Day one week away. Markets have historically been shaky heading into an election, only to calm afterward regardless of which party wins. Investors are eyeing the U.S. jobs report set for release Friday. They want to see more evidence of solid hiring to keep alive hopes for the economy. ___ Yuri Kageyama is on X: https://x.com/yurikageyama	https://apnews.com/article/financial-markets-oil-prices-tech-stocks-1f348c34204ce132997defdd9a15a31a	2024-10-28T19:45:25-07:00	
North Korea sends foreign minister to Russia as its troops train to fight in Ukraine	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea said Tuesday its top diplomat is visiting Russia, in another sign of their deepening relations as rival South Korea and Western nations say the North has sent thousands of troops to support Russia’s war in Ukraine. North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency said a delegation led by Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui departed for Russia on Monday, but didn’t specify the purpose of the visit. In a closed-door hearing at South Korea’s parliament, the South’s spy agency said Choe may be involved in high-level discussions on sending additional troops to Russia and negotiating what the North would get in return, according to Lee Seong-kweun, a lawmaker who attended the meeting. The announcement of Choe’s visit came hours after the Pentagon said North Korea has sent about 10,000 troops to Russia, who are expected to arrive in battlefields in Ukraine within 'the next several weeks.' South Korean and Western leaders have expressed concern that North Korean involvement could help prolong Russia’s aggression in Ukraine, and that Russia may offer technology in return that could advance the threat posed by North Korea’s nuclear weapons and missile program. Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh told reporters Monday that some of the North Korean soldiers have already moved closer to Ukraine and were believed to be heading for the Kursk border region, where Russia has been struggling to push back a Ukrainian incursion. South Korea’s National Intelligence Service told lawmakers it’s examining the possibility that some groups of North Korea’s military personnel in Russia, including generals or other high-ranking officials, may have already moved to frontline areas. The spy agency also said the two sides appear to be struggling to resolve communication issues although the Russian military is training North Korean troops on Russian military terminology, Lee said. The agency said space-based reconnaissance is an area where North Korea is likely receiving Russian help. It said North Korea may be acquiring advanced components from Russia as it prepares to launch another military reconnaissance satellite following a failed attempt in May, said Park Sun-won, another lawmaker who attended the hearing. North Korea first placed a spy satellite in orbit last November. Its leader Kim Jong Un has described those assets as crucial for monitoring South Korean and U.S. military activities and enhancing the threat of his nuclear-capable missiles. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol in telephone calls with European Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte on Monday shared South Korean intelligence assessments that North Korean troops could be deployed to battlefronts 'more quickly than anticipated.' He called for closer coordination with European governments aimed at 'monitoring and blocking 'illegal exchanges between Pyongyang and Moscow, Yoon’s office said in a statement. After initially denying the claims about North Korean troop deployments, Pyongyang and Moscow have adopted a vaguer stance, asserting that their military cooperation conforms with international law without directly admitting the presence of North Korean forces in Russia. North Korea has also been accused of providing millions of artillery shells and other military equipment to Russia to fuel its war in Ukraine. The United States and its partners have described Russia’s procurement of North Korean personnel and supplies as a violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions, and raised suspicions that Moscow is helping Pyongyang to evade sanctions and unlawfully finance its weapons program. Russia, along with China, has blocked U.S.-led efforts at the Security Council to tighten sanctions on North Korea over its recent missile testing activities, which intensified after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Russia also vetoed a U.N. resolution to extend the mandate of a panel of monitors in March in a move that effectively abolished oversight by U.N. experts of Security Council sanctions against North Korea. It prompted Western accusations that Moscow was acting to shield its arms purchases from Pyongyang. 'The illegal military collusion between Russia and North Korea poses a significant security threat to the international community and a serious matter that could potentially harm our security. We must thoroughly examine all possibilities and prepare countermeasures,' Yoon said in a Cabinet meeting in Seoul on Tuesday. Yoon last week raised the possibility of supplying Ukraine with weapons while saying Seoul is preparing countermeasures that could be rolled out in stages depending on the degree of military cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow. South Korea, a growing arms exporter, has provided humanitarian aid and other non-lethal support to Ukraine and joined U.S.-led economic sanctions against Moscow. It has so far resisted calls by Kyiv and NATO to directly supply Ukraine with weapons, citing a longstanding policy of not providing arms to countries engaged in active conflict.	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-russia-ukraine-war-choe-son-hui-foreign-minister-c67d98128d06e8959aa34f21428f5081	2024-10-28T19:35:32-07:00	
Guatemalan journalist released from prison fears for the future and being targeted for his work	GUATEMALA CITY (AP) — When Guatemalan journalist José Rubén Zamora returned to his home after more than two years in prison without a conviction, he found it empty. He said it smelled of abandonment after his family fled the country, fearing they would face his same fate. On Monday, one week after his release, Zamora discussed his own uncertain future in an interview with The Associated Press under the shadow of efforts to keep him behind bars and his concern for other journalists that do the kind of investigative work he did. Not only have Guatemalan journalists — including eight from the outlet El Periódico that he founded — been forced into exile under threat of prosecution, but those who remain wrestle with the fear that if they investigate 'they can end up in jail,' Zamora said. Thrust into the spotlight, the 68-year-old journalist is shy, not keen to be the target of news. He said he can still feel the aftermath of imprisonment in his bones, and also in his day-to-day life after funding his legal defense forced him to sell his belongings, only skating by through support from his children. 'Frankly, the feeling of not having any money, that is mine, is complicated and I don’t have the means to get around,' he said. The interview comes after a long journey for Zamora, who has spent the past three decades working as a journalist. Twenty-four of those years were as president of El Periódico, the news organization he founded to investigate corruption in Guatemala. It’s a dangerous topic to investigate in a country like Guatemala, where the Attorney General's Office raided electoral facilities, seized and opened ballot boxes and targeted the Seed Movement party of now-President Bernardo Arévalo in an effort to keep him from taking office. To this day, Zamora believes it was his paper's investigative work that led him to be targeted by prosecutors. In particular, it was his pointed criticism of former President Alejandro Giammattei and his ally, current Attorney General Consuelo Porras, who was sanctioned by the United States for allegedly obstructing corruption investigations. Porras' agents raided Zamora's house in July 2022 and arrested him, accusing him of money laundering after he asked a friend to deposit $38,000 that Zamora said was a donation to his news organization. Zamora said he did not put the money in the bank himself because the person who made the donation feared being retaliated against for supporting the media outlet. He was initially convicted and sentenced to six years, a ruling that was annulled due to procedural failures. He was later accused of falsifying documents and faced a second trial for allegedly lying in the first case against him. In late October, he was finally set free, after a judge cited that two years of pre-trial detention violated national and international human rights law. Upon his release, one of his first visitors was President Arévalo. 'I explained to him that in Guatemala, there have never been institutions dedicated to control or rigorous oversight,' Zamora said. 'That is why the press is so important: There is no prosecution or punishment for the corrupt, rather there are walls of impunity.' Zamora said he was happy to finally speak to his family, but it was clear he still lives with the fallout of his two years in jail and a deep sense of uncertainty over what comes next. Upon his arrest, his newspaper El Periódico disappeared. Eight of its journalists and columnists live in exile like his family for publishing articles on the abuse of power of judges and prosecutors — including about his case. Since Porras remains attorney general, Zamora worries that he could once again be thrown in jail. He said he’s been left without a job, and worries about friends, family and even people who he speaks to at the prosecutor's office when he goes for his required regular check-ins. 'I worry about people greeting me, because they may face some consequences,' he said. The only thing that remains of his old life are piles of old copies of his newspaper in his home's garage. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/guatemala-journalist-zamora-interview-jailed-23dc6016a4b3e9b7dc104c390e603b8a	2024-10-28T18:25:43-07:00	
Fans in Shohei Ohtani's Japanese hometown pack in to watch Game 3 of the World Series	OSHU CITY, Japan (AP) — Hundreds of fans filed into a public viewing center in Shohei Ohtani's hometown in northern Japan on Tuesday morning — the country is 13 hours ahead of Yankee Stadium — to cheer the country's top celebrity in Game 3 of the World Series. Fans lined up outside the Oshu City Cultural Center, a 500-seat auditorium, on a perfect fall morning to watch their local hero in a live telecast. They were there an hour before the game started. Many came dressed in Dodger Blue — caps or jerseys — and were supplied with various noisemakers, including thunder sticks. The hall was adorned with posters announcing Ohtani as 'The Pride of Oshu City.' Ohtani, playing two days after dislocating his left shoulder in Game 2, drew a walk on his first at-bat. That drew wild cheers from the 250 fans attending, who chanted 'Go, Go. Shohei.' Then came even more cheers when the Dodgers took a 2-0 lead on Freddie Freeman's home run. 'He's more like a Japanese treasure than just a local (treasure),' said fan Hiromitsu Kikuchi. 'I think he has passed beyond the hometown and is more like world-class. We have never had a star player like this before from our hometown.' Among the mostly older fans were about 20 children from the kindergarten that Ohtani attended. They came equipped with small flags emblazoned with Ohtani's smiling face. Several fans said they were worried Ohtani might not play but set out from home when they got the good news. 'I came to see Ohtani because the television news reported that he would play,' said fan Tadashi Onodera. 'It's fantastic. We are proud to have such a player from out hometown.' This is the town where Ohtani played Little League, starred as a pitcher and hitter at Hanamaki Higashi High School, and became the favorite son of Iwate Prefecture, a mountainous region abutting the Pacific Ocean. His hometown is located about 300 miles (500 kilometers) north of Tokyo, a largely rural place far from the capital, its hundreds of skyscrapers and high-end prosperity. All eyes at the viewing were on the Dodgers superstar — and his left shoulder. His injury briefly cast a pall and flipped Japan's mood from magic to morose. Then came relief. The magic returned as Dodgers manager Dave Roberts started Ohtani as the designated hitter and leadoff hitter in Game 3, what local fans and all of baseball wanted to see. 'I was concerned (about the injury), but believed it would be okay,' said Masatoshi Honmyo, another local fan. 'I would say he is a hero.' ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB	https://apnews.com/article/world-series-shohei-ohtani-japan-03bac61f1ff62c6482cba84006c9e617	2024-10-28T16:40:37-07:00	
Thousands of soldiers fence off a Salvadoran neighborhood in pursuit of gang remnants	SAN SALVADOR (AP) — More than 2,000 soldiers and 500 police officers surrounded a populous neighborhood on the outskirts of El Salvador's capital on Monday in an effort to quash the remnants of gangs the president said were trying to set up shop in the area. 'There is a group of gang members in hiding. We have established a security fence throughout the neighborhood... to extract every last gang member in the area,' wrote Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele in a post on X. Police surrounded the San Marcos neighborhood with a military fence, setting up checkpoints to prevent gang members from escaping, said Defense Minister René Francis Merino Monroy. The fence was the third of its kind to be installed in parts of San Salvador intended to find and arrest gang members still operating in the country. In March, Bukele ordered similar barricades to be put up in a northern part of the country, which he said was to dismantle a faction of the Barrio 18 gang. The blockade is the latest in the populist leader's war on gangs, announced by Bukele following a surge of violence in March 2022. Bukele's government called for a 'state of emergency' and waived constitutional rights to arrest more than 1% of El Salvador's population with little evidence. The crackdown has fueled sharp criticism from human rights groups, raising alarm about prison conditions and saying many of those arrested were innocent or only had loose ties to gangs. Other measures he's taken, like seeking re-election despite a constitutional ban of presidents serving two consecutive terms, have raised other democratic alarms. But the war on gangs also dealt a strong blow to the Barrio 18 and MS-13 gangs that have long sowed terror in much of the country, extorting money, murdering those who didn't pay and trafficking drugs. The measures resulted in a sharp dip in homicides and spurred a populist fervor for Bukele. Despite effectively declaring victory in his war, the president has continued to extend the 'state of emergency' for over two years now, claiming that such measures are needed to take out the remains of El Salvador's gangs. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/el-salvador-gangs-nayib-bukele-state-of-emergency-violence-1f6dcc2fad3b5fc45f724031806d2fc0	2024-10-28T14:01:45-07:00	
Treasury issues rule to block US investors from helping China develop advanced military technology	WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Treasury Department, seeking to keep the Chinese military from gaining an edge in advanced technologies, issued a rule Monday to restrict and monitor American investments in China in artificial intelligence, computer chips and quantum computing. The finalized rule arises from an executive order issued in August 2023 by President Joe Biden. The order sought to limit the access that 'countries of concern'' — specifically China including Hong Kong and Macao — have to American dollars to fund technologies that could be used, for example, to break codes or develop next-generation fighter jets. It will take effect Jan. 2. 'U.S. investments ... must not be used to help countries of concern develop their military, intelligence and cyber capabilities''' said Paul Rosen, assistant Treasury secretary for investment security. He noted the investments can mean more than just money: they can deliver 'intangible benefits,'' including managerial help and assistance finding top talent and tapping other sources of financing. Blocking China's high-tech ambitions is one of the few issues that enjoys broad support in Washington from both Republicans and Democrats. Biden in May slapped a stiff tariff on electric vehicles from China. He also has imposed export controls to keep the Chinese from acquiring advanced computer chips and the equipment to produce them. Former President Donald Trump has vowed to dramatically increase taxes on all imports from China if voters send him back to the White House. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said Tuesday that the government had lodged a protest with the U.S. over the latest action. 'China strongly deplores and firmly opposes the U.S. rolling out restrictions on investment in China,' Lin Jian said at a daily briefing in Beijing. In Hong Kong, the city's leader said the move undermined normal investment and trade and would cause damage to the global supply chain. 'In pursuing their political agenda, American politicians are harming not only others but also the interests of their own country, their people and their businesses. They will have to face the consequences of their actions,' John Lee said, noting that the U.S. has enjoyed a trade surplus of $472 billion with Hong Kong in the past 10 years. The Biden administration sought comment from businesses and from U.S. allies before putting out the final version. In addition to blocking investments, the rule requires Americans and companies in the United States to notify the U.S. government of transactions that involve 'technologies and products that may contribute to a threat to the national security of the United States.'' Violators can be hit with fines of up to $368,136 or twice the value of the prohibited transaction, whichever is greater. Treasury is setting up an Office of Global Transactions to oversee the new rule. ____ Associated Press writers Ken Moritsugu in Beijing and Kanis Leung in Hong Kong contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/treasury-rule-china-artificial-intelligence-chips-investment-86bae5f144e544416e0bf9ca16e7d5af	2024-10-28T13:00:27-07:00	
Shohei Ohtani leads off for Dodgers in World Series Game 3, two days after dislocating shoulder	NEW YORK (AP) — Shohei Ohtani wasn't on the team bus from Dodger Stadium to Los Angeles International Airport because he was getting tests Saturday night after partially separating his left shoulder in Game 2 of the World Series. So the Japanese star reached out in a group chat with fellow Dodgers players to erase any doubts over his status. 'The text just like literally said: `I can play,'' infielder Max Muncy recalled Monday. 'I mean, there was more to it than that.' True to his word, Ohtani remained in the lineup in his regular leadoff slot as the designated hitter for Game 3 of the World Series with Los Angeles holding a 2-0 lead over the New York Yankees. Ohtani was the only Dodgers starter wearing a warmup jacket during pregame introductions and high-fived teammates with his right hand. A black wrapping was visible over his left shoulder. He didn't swing in his first plate appearance, taking four balls from Clarke Schmidt. Ohtani kept his left arm at an angle over his chest while at first base, hand holding his collar, and held it there while rounding the bases on Freddie Freeman's two-run homer. Ohtani had a swing and miss in the third, slighting grimacing, before grounding out. He held the hand to his chest as he jogged back to the dugout. Muncy said Ohtani wrote the text himself in English without assistance from interpreter Will Ireton. 'We all just put it to the side at that moment,' Muncy remembered. 'We all said: `All right, he’s got us. We'll be ready for him to be in the lineup.'' Dodgers manager Dave Roberts didn't get the text message — 'that group chat is for us — that’s for the players,' Muncy said — and wasn't aware of it until Monday. 'Would have been helpful if I was on that thread. I would have slept better Saturday night,' Roberts said with a smile. Ohtani got hurt sliding into second base when he was caught stealing to end the seventh inning of Saturday night’s 4-2 victory in Los Angeles. Roberts said Ohtani's shoulder was popped back into place by the athletic training staff at the ballpark and an MRI showed no structural damage. He wasn't sure whether the injury will heal on its own or any procedure would be needed after the Series. Asked whether Ohtani received medication, an injection or was being taped up, Roberts said 'it's all of the above on the treatment and stuff. The tape is just protecting and stabilizing, not really limiting.' Ohtani took swings off a tee in a Yankee Stadium batting cage Sunday night and was hitting balls 102 mph, which changed Roberts' mood to 'joy.' 'He was very adamant that he was going to play,' Roberts said. 'Obviously, there’s some discomfort.' A separated shoulder is subject to recurrence. Roberts said he doubted Ohtani will attempt any more stolen bases during the Series. 'If you keep the best player in the game in the lineup, that’s usually good for your team,' Muncy said. 'Obviously, it’s a big guy to have in there. It helps a lot. He’s had some big moments for us, and we’re obviously expecting a couple more big moments out of him.' With the Dodgers chasing their eighth championship and second in five years, Walker Buehler was scheduled to start Game 3 for Los Angeles in the best-of-seven Series. Ohtani was 0 for 3 with a walk in Game 2. The likely NL MVP was 1 for 8 in the first two games of the Fall Classic and batting .260 with three home runs and 10 RBIs in his first postseason in the majors. 'It was very tough in the moment to see him in pain like that,' Muncy said. 'We were two innings away from winning that ballgame. We knew we had to refocus. Obviously, it sucks seeing Sho in that kind of pain, but we still had a job to do in the moment. 'After the game we all checked on him to see how he was doing. It was like a buffet line going in there to see how he’s doing. Yeah, it was tough in the moment, but we refocused to win the game.' A two-time AL MVP with the Los Angeles Angels, Ohtani joined the Dodgers last December for a record $700 million, 10-year contract. The 30-year-old slugger hit .310 with 54 homers, 130 RBIs and 59 stolen bases, becoming the first player with at least 50 homers and 50 stolen bases in a season. The two-way star did not pitch this season while recovering from elbow surgery on Sept. 19, 2023, and has been limited to designated hitter. 'You see him walk off holding (his arm) like that, obviously that’s a concern. But hopefully he is OK,' Yankees manager Aaron Boone said before Game 3. 'We want to all be out here competing with and against the best, and obviously Shohei embodies that. So hopefully everything’s OK, and we’ll get to go compete against him.' ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb	https://apnews.com/article/world-series-ohtani-dodgers-311bc657971726bc04028326dcf1cf72	2024-10-28T12:05:18-07:00	
World Series averaging 15.15 million viewers in Japan, including 15.9 for Game 2	LOS ANGELES (AP) — The World Series is averaging 15.15 million viewers in Japan through two games. According to Major League Baseball, the Los Angeles Dodgers' 4-2 victory over the New York Yankees in Game 2 averaged 15.9 million, making it the most-watched MLB postseason game in the nation's history. Besides the allure of superstar and presumptive NL MVP Shohei Ohtani, the game had Yoshinobu Yamamoto as the Dodgers' starting pitcher. The Los Angeles Dodgers’ dramatic 6-3 victory over the New York Yankees in Game 1 — which ended on Freddie Freeman’s walk off grand slam in the 10th inning — averaged 14.4 million. Tokyo is 16 hours ahead of Los Angeles, meaning the games started around 9 a.m. on Saturday and Sunday morning in Japan. The games are being carried through Fuji TV, NHK BS and J Sports. Combined with the United States ratings, the first two games have a combined 29.7 million average in the two countries. The World Series is averaging 14.55 million viewers in the U.S. on Fox, Fox Deportes and streaming, putting it on track for its best performance since 2017. It is also the first time since the final two games of the 2021 series between the Atlanta Braves and Houston Astros that the World Series has drawn back-to-back games of at least 13.4 million viewers. According to Nielsen, the matchup between the Yankees and Dodgers has also meant a 93% increase in viewership within the 18-34-year-old demographic. According to MLB, social engagement is up 225% and views on social channels have increased 229%. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb	https://apnews.com/article/world-series-yankees-dodgers-japan-ratings-4a3732f1a500d49f5380ee4cb3929bd6	2024-10-28T11:17:03-07:00	
US presses ahead with modest Mideast plans despite election uncertainty	WASHINGTON (AP) — With the U.S. presidential election just a week away, the Biden administration is not giving up hope for short-term deals for cease-fires between Israel and Hamas in Gaza and Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. But U.S. officials are mindful that political uncertainty in the United States has made the sides reluctant to commit to any significant agreements before it is clear who has won the White House. In the meantime, the Middle East is uneasy about what happens next after Israel struck Iranian military targets over the weekend in retaliation for Iran's barrage of ballistic missile attacks on Oct. 1. U.S. officials said they believe Israel’s attack — whose targets were coordinated with Washington — will not draw an escalatory reaction from Iran. But the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to share sensitive diplomatic discussions, caution that nothing is certain. The Biden administration was able to persuade Israel to keep its response limited — gaining assurances it wouldn’t hit nuclear or oil sites in Iran that would have escalated the conflict — despite limited U.S. influence as Biden's term wraps up. As Israel’s closest ally and a key mediator in the Middle East, the U.S. still is pressing for any movement on a truce despite letdowns in the past and little expectation of immediate breakthroughs. 'I don’t sense that the Israelis are feeling a huge amount of urgency,' said Jon Alterman, director of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. 'I feel like they are feeling much less urgency now than a few months ago.' U.S. efforts in Gaza As conditions, particularly in Gaza, continue to deteriorate, the administration is backing an Egyptian proposal for a two-day Gaza cease-fire that would see Hamas release a limited number of hostages and potentially open more routes for badly needed humanitarian assistance to reach the enclave, the U.S. officials say. President Joe Biden said Monday that he would join his staff in discussing the proposal. 'We need a cease-fire. We should end this war. It should end. It should end. It should end,' Biden said. One of the officials said the administration would support virtually any suggestion that leads to a reduction in suffering for Palestinian civilians and the release of hostages but stressed that 'we’re not holding our breath.' Secretary of State Antony Blinken ’s visit to Israel, Saudi Arabia and Qatar last week was aimed at gauging the region’s willingness for such a deal. Officials said Blinken came away from his meetings cautiously optimistic but acknowledged that previous similar hopes have been dashed. 'What we really have to determine is whether Hamas is prepared to engage,' Blinken said last week. He said the killing of Hamas military chief Yahya Sinwar helped open a window for new talks on a cease-fire proposal that has been languishing for months. To underscore U.S. support for a deal, CIA Director William Burns participated in weekend talks in Doha with senior Israeli and Qatari officials on a potential path forward. There was no immediate result, but lower-level talks are expected to continue this week. The prospects for the success of even such a modest proposal — which would fall well short of previous plans for three-phase cease-fire deal — are uncertain as Hamas, despite heavy losses on the ground, has rejected calls for anything less than a full-on truce and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza. Hamas has yet to formally respond to the Egyptian plan, though Israel has signaled a willingness to consider the idea. Longer-term ideas for the post-conflict future of Gaza are a work in progress, according to the U.S. officials, who say that Israel’s battlefield assessments will play a major role in determining what Israel might agree to. Until now, Israel has adamantly rejected any governance or security role for the Palestinian Authority in Gaza, something that is a deal-breaker for both the authority and for Arab nations whose support will be critical for any plan to succeed. While the U.S. election may be a factor, even if there wasn’t the Nov. 5 vote, Israel is showing few signs it is motivated to pursue a cease-fire, said Alterman, the analyst. 'From what I know, it doesn’t feel like we are on a brink of a breakthrough,' Alterman said. U.S. push in Lebanon In Lebanon, where Israel has been intensifying military operations against Hezbollah for the past month, U.S. officials allow that a short-term fix is probably unrealistic. That’s because Lebanon’s fractured political leadership is distrusted by Israeli officials and because the Lebanese Armed Forces have yet to move convincingly to keep Hezbollah fighters from attacking Israel from southern Lebanon. Biden aide Amos Hochstein — who has been a point man on administration efforts to keep Israel and Hezbollah from entering a full-scale war — is expected in the region this week to get a sense from Israeli officials on what they would be willing to support. Depending on what he hears, he may then travel to Lebanon to explore what officials there would be willing to do to prevent further Hezbollah rocket strikes on northern and central Israel, officials said. Complicating matters in both Gaza and Lebanon is that neither Hamas nor Hezbollah have announced replacements after Israel killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and Sinwar of Hamas in recent weeks. ___ AP reporters Tara Copp in Washington, Aamer Madhani in New Castle, Delaware, and Abby Sewell in Beirut, Lebanon, contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/us-israel-gaza-lebanon-iran-hamas-hezbollah-a02b674e9a930313436a218da729795d	2024-10-28T10:54:34-07:00	
Brazil fines meatpacking companies, including giant JBS, for buying illegally raised cattle	BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) — Brazil's environmental agency has levied $64 million in fines against 23 meatpacking companies and their suppliers for buying and selling cattle raised illegally on deforested land in the Amazon. The operation, dubbed Cold Meat 2, launched last week. It tracked 18,000 head of cattle raised in 100 square miles (260 square kilometers) of pasture that has been banned for commercial use due to illegal deforestation. The agents also apprehended 8,854 head of cattle found inside the restricted areas. News of the fines began emerging over the weekend. Cattle raising is the main driver of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon, with 90% of the area cleared between 1985 and 2023 converted to pasture. That represents 227,800 square miles (590,000 square kilometers), slightly larger than France. As a result, 14% of the Amazon is covered by grazing land, according to MapBiomas, a network of nongovernmental organizations that monitors land use. 'We are inspecting the production chain to hold offenders accountable for acquiring products from deforestation and to ensure that crime does not pay,' Jair Schmitt, chief of environmental protection at Brazil’s federal environmental agency, known as Ibama, told The Associated Press. Among those fined was JBS, the world's largest meat-packing company. JBS has applied to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, a move that has faced opposition from some U.S. lawmakers and environmental nonprofits. It's not clear when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission may make a decision on JBS' bid. The JBS fine was $108,000 for purchasing 1,231 head of cattle, the fifth largest penalty among the fined companies. The operation followed three months of investigation by Ibama's intelligence unit and is the latest episode linking JBS to illegal deforestation. In December, AP revealed that it is facing lawsuits for allegedly purchasing cattle raised illegally in Jaci-Parana, a protected area in the Brazilian Amazon. In a statement, JBS denied buying cattle from embargoed areas and said it had already submitted documents to Ibama demonstrating their legal origin. However, the company declined to comment on the Jaci-Parana’s case despite repeated requests for clarification from AP since it published the story. 'JBS has maintained its Responsible Procurement Policy for 15 years and has a geospatial monitoring system in place to ensure that the company does not purchase animals from farms involved in illegal deforestation, encroachment on Indigenous lands or conservation areas that are under embargo by Ibama,' read the statement. Agropam, a meatpacker in Boca do Acre city, received the largest fine, $493,000, for buying 5,624 head of cattle from illegal areas. The company, which operates under the name of Frizam, sells beef only for Brazil's internal market. A message requesting comment was not returned. The other top companies targeted were Mafrico, Frigol and 163 Beef. Mafrico and Frigo did not respond to requests for comment left by phone and on their websites. Contact information for 163 Beef was not immediately available, as numbers on its Facebook page were disconnected. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

South Africa submits its main legal claim to the top UN court which accuses Israel of genocide	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — The South African legal team delivered a nearly 5,000-page document to the United Nations’ top court on Monday, the latest step in a case the country brought accusing Israel of committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. The document, which the International Court of Justice will not make public until a later stage in the proceedings, puts forth the 'main case' that Israel has a 'special intent to commit genocide,' according to a statement from South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa. Israel has fiercely denied the allegations. The government called the case 'blood libel' when South Africa launched the complaint in Dec. 2023. On Monday a court official at the ICJ confirmed that they had received the document. The filing takes place as the Israeli military has called on Palestinians to evacuate northern Gaza, where it has been waging a large offensive for more than three weeks. The U.N. said earlier this month at least 400,000 people are still in northern Gaza and hunger is rampant as the amount of humanitarian aid reaching the north has plummeted over the past month. The Hague-based court has so far issued three rounds of emergency measures, ordering Israel to halt a military offensive in Rafah and open more land crossings for aid into Gaza. South Africa says Israel has refused to comply. 'Israel’s continued shredding of international law has imperiled the institutions of global governance that were established to hold all states accountable,' the president’s statement said. Palestine, Spain, Chile and seven other countries have petitioned the court to join the case. Israel now has until July 2025 to reply. Israel launched its military action in Gaza after Hamas-led militants on Oct. 7, 2023, attacked Israel, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others.	https://apnews.com/article/icj-israel-south-africa-genocide-c16b0e8ad715ac41f489d3255964a373	2024-10-28T10:15:54-07:00	
US warns of visa restrictions for people who undermine Ghana's democracy	ACCRA, Ghana (AP) — The U.S. State Department warned Monday that it would restrict U.S. visas for people who undermine Ghana's democracy, ahead of the West African country’s general election in December. Ghana has held peaceful, free, fair and transparent elections for nearly two decades. The presidential and parliamentary elections will be held concurrently on Dec. 7. It will be the ninth consecutive general election since the country’s return to multi-party democracy in 1992. But allegations of voter roll irregularities this year have created concerns about a possible democratic backslide. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was quoted as saying in a statement that the visa policy announced Monday would be directed only at people 'who undermine democracy' and not at the government or people of Ghana. Last month, Ghana’s biggest opposition party, the National Democratic Congress, or NDC, held nationwide protests demanding an audit of the voter roll, alleging it detected thousands of unauthorized transfers and erasures of voter names. Current President Akufo-Addo is stepping down this year after his second and final four-year term. Former President John Dramani Mahama of the NDC, who lost in the 2016 and 2020 elections, will face off with Vice President Mahamudu Bawumia of the New Patriotic Party in this year’s election. Last year, the U.S. State Department announced a similar policy of visa restrictions ahead of the Nigerian general election, restricting entry to people 'believed to be responsible for, or complicit in, undermining democracy in Nigeria.'	https://apnews.com/article/us-state-department-visas-general-election-ghana-74cbf5f1a608a1c39a0f2321741e8141	2024-10-28T09:56:12-07:00	
Fitness app Strava gives away location of Biden, Trump and other leaders, French newspaper says	PARIS (AP) — An investigation by French newspaper Le Monde found that the highly confidential movements of U.S. President Joe Biden, presidential rivals Donald Trump and Kamala Harris and other world leaders can be easily tracked online through a fitness app that their bodyguards use. But the U.S. Secret Service told the newspaper that it doesn’t believe the protection it provides was in any way compromised. Le Monde found that some U.S. Secret Service agents use the Strava fitness app, including in recent weeks after the two assassination attempts on Trump, in a video investigation released in French and in English. Strava is a fitness tracking app primarily used by runners and cyclists to record their activities and share their workouts with a community. Le Monde also found Strava users among the security staff for French President Emmanuel Macron and Russian President Vladimir Putin. In one example, Le Monde traced the Strava movements of Macron’s bodyguards to determine that the French leader spent a weekend in the Normandy seaside resort of Honfleur in 2021. The trip was meant to be private and wasn’t listed on the president’s official agenda. Le Monde said the whereabouts of Melania Trump and Jill Biden could also be pinpointed by tracking their bodyguards’ Strava profiles. In a statement to Le Monde, the U.S. Secret Service said its staff aren’t allowed to use personal electronic devices while on duty during protective assignments but 'we do not prohibit an employee’s personal use of social media off-duty.' 'Affected personnel has been notified,' it said. 'We will review this information to determine if any additional training or guidance is required.' 'We do not assess that there were any impacts to protective operations or threats to any protectees,' it added. Locations 'are regularly disclosed as part of public schedule releases.' In another example, Le Monde reported that a U.S. Secret Service agent’s Strava profile revealed the location of a hotel where Biden subsequently stayed in San Francisco for high-stakes talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2023. A few hours before Biden’s arrival, the agent went jogging from the hotel, using Strava which traced his route, the newspaper found. The newspaper’s journalists say they identified 26 U.S. agents, 12 members of the French GSPR, the Security Group of the Presidency of the Republic and 6 members of the Russian FSO, or Federal Protection Service, all of them in charge of presidential security, who had public accounts on Strava and were therefore communicating their movements online, including during professional trips. Le Monde did not identify the bodyguards by name for security reasons. It said movements trackable on Strava could lead to security breaches, especially when security agents travel in advance to places like hotels where leaders then stay and hold meetings. Macron's office said Monday the consequences of the issues reported by Le Monde 'are very slight and in no way affect the security of the President of the Republic.' Local authorities are aware of Macron's movements ahead of time and the places where Macron is staying are always fully secure, 'so the risk is non-existent,' the statement said. 'A reminder was nevertheless issued to agents by the chief of staff asking them not to use this app,' Macron's office added. Identifying the presidential bodyguards — some of them using their full name on Strava — could also help finding other details about their personal address, their family, their movements and photos they posted on various social media, all of which could possibly be used to put pressure on them for malicious purposes, the report stressed.	https://apnews.com/article/biden-trump-macron-bodyguards-security-strava-0a48afca09c7aa74d703e72833dcaf72	2024-10-28T09:50:16-07:00	
People opt out of organ donation programs after reports of a man mistakenly declared dead	WASHINGTON (AP) — Transplant experts are seeing a spike in people revoking organ donor registrations, their confidence shaken by reports that organs were nearly retrieved from a Kentucky man mistakenly declared dead. It happened in 2021 and while details are murky surgery was avoided and the man is still alive. But donor registries in the U.S. and even across the Atlantic are being impacted after the case was publicized recently. A drop in donations could cost the lives of people awaiting a transplant. 'Organ donation is based on public trust,' said Dorrie Dils, president of the Association of Organ Procurement Organizations, or OPOs. When eroded, 'it takes years to regain.' Only doctors caring for patients can determine if they're dead -- the law blocks anyone involved with organ donation or transplant. The allegations raise questions about how doctors make that determination and what’s supposed to happen if anyone sees a reason for doubt. Key is ensuring 'all doctors are doing the right tests and doing them well,' said Dr. Daniel Sulmasy, a Georgetown University bioethicist. An alleged near miss in Kentucky The 2021 case first came to light in a congressional hearing last month, with unconfirmed details in later media reports – allegations that a man who’d been declared dead days earlier woke up on the way to the operating room for organ-donation surgery and that there was initial reluctance to realize it. The federal agency that regulates the U.S. transplant system is investigating, and the Kentucky attorney general’s office said it is 'reviewing the facts to identify an appropriate response.' A coalition of OPOs and other donation groups is urging that findings be made public quickly and the public withhold judgment until then, saying any deviation from the industry's strict standards would be 'entirely unacceptable.' The number of people opting out of organ donation has spiked Donate Life America found an average of 170 people a day removed themselves from the national donor registry in the week following media coverage of the allegations – 10 times more than the same week in 2023. That doesn’t include emailed removal requests or state registries, another way people can volunteer to become a donor when they eventually die. Dils' own organ agency, Gift of Life Michigan, usually gets five to 10 calls a week from people asking how to remove themselves from that state’s list. In the last week, her staff handled 57 such calls, many mentioning the Kentucky case. The Kentucky allegations reverberated in France Unlike the voluntary U.S. donation system, French law presumes all citizens and residents will be organ and tissue donors upon death unless they clearly opt out. After the reports from Kentucky reached France, the number joining that nation’s donation refusal registry jumped from about 100 people a day to 1,000 a day in the past week, according to the French Biomedicine Agency. Dr. Régis Bronchard, an agency deputy director, said the spike 'reflects anxiety, incomprehension among the general public' that could have 'catastrophic consequences.' What’s supposed to happen after death and before organ donation Doctors can declare two types of death. What’s called cardiac death occurs when the heart stops beating and breathing stops, and they can’t be restored. Brain death is declared when the entire brain permanently ceases functioning, usually after a major traumatic injury or stroke. Ventilators and other machines keep the heart beating during special testing to tell. Only about 1% of deaths occur in a way that allows someone to become an organ donor – most people declared dead in a hospital will quickly be transferred to a funeral home or morgue. But most organ donations are from brain-dead donors. Only after that declaration does the donor agency assume responsibility for the deceased, looking for potential recipients and scheduling retrieval surgery — while typically nurses at the hospital where the person died continue care to ensure equipment properly maintains their organs until they're collected. What if something goes wrong? The donor agency and transplant surgeons arriving to retrieve organs must check records of how death was determined. Anyone – donor hospital employees, donor agency staff or surgeons – who sees anything concerning is supposed to speak up immediately. 'This is extremely rare,' Dr. Ginny Bumgardner, an Ohio State University transplant surgeon who also leads the American Society of Transplant Surgeons, said of the Kentucky case. In operating rooms 'the whole process stops' if someone sees a hint of trouble, and independent doctors are called to doublecheck the person really is dead, Bumgardner said. In her 30-year career, 'I’ve never had a case where the original declaration was wrong.' Georgetown’s Sulmasy agreed problems are infrequent. But he said there’s wide variation in what tests different hospitals perform to determine if someone’s brain-dead, whether they’re a potential organ donor or not. Doctors are debating whether to add additional test requirements. Stricter criteria could 'assure the public that we have done enormous due diligence before we determine that somebody’s dead,' he said. It could help 'to get people to stop ripping up their organ donor cards.' —- John Leicester, the AP's chief correspondent in Paris, contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

Israel approves two bills that could halt UNRWA's aid delivery to Gaza. What does that mean?	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Israel's parliament has passed two laws that could prevent the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, a main provider of aid to Gaza, from being able to continue its work. The laws ban the agency, UNRWA, from operating in Israel, designate it a terror organization, and cut all ties between the agency and the Israeli government. It's the culmination of a long-running campaign against the agency, which Israel contends has been infiltrated by Hamas. But supporters say Israel's real aim is to sideline the issue of Palestinian refugees. The agency is the major distributor of aid in Gaza and provides education, health and other basic services to millions of Palestinian refugees across the region, including in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The head of the agency, Commissioner General Philippe Lazzarini, called the move 'unprecedented' on X following the vote and said the bills 'will only deepen the suffering Palestinians, especially in Gaza where people have been going through more than a year of sheer hell.' Israel accuses the agency of turning a blind eye to staff members it says belong to Hamas, divert aid and use UNRWA facilities for military purposes. Israel says around a dozen of its 13,000 employees in Gaza participated in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel. The agency denies it knowingly aids armed groups and says it acts quickly to purge any suspected militants among its staff. The bills severely hamper UNRWA One of the bills passed Monday evening bans all UNRWA activities and services on Israeli soil and is set to take effect in three months. The second bill designates UNRWA a terrorist organization, severs all ties between government employees and UNRWA and strips its staff of their legal immunities. Together, the bills likely bar the agency from operating in Israel and the Palestinian territories, because Israel controls access to both Gaza and the West Bank. It could force the agency to relocate its headquarters from Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem. Lazzarini warned earlier this month that humanitarian operations in Gaza 'may disintegrate' if the legislation passes, disrupting the provision of food, shelter and health care as winter sets in. Gaza's population of some 2.3 million is almost entirely dependent on aid to survive. Around 90% of the population has been displaced. Hundreds of thousands live in tent camps and schools-turned-shelters, most run by UNRWA. Experts say hunger is rampant. Israel’s campaign in Gaza in retaliation for the Oct. 7 attack has killed over 43,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, whose count does not differentiate between civilians and militants. Israel is reportedly considering taking over aid distribution itself or subcontracting it, but it has yet to put forth a concrete plan. Any such effort would likely require a large number of troops and other resources at a time when Israel is at war on two fronts in Gaza and Lebanon. Other U.N. agencies and aid groups say there is no substitute for UNRWA, which also runs 96 schools hosting around 47,000 students, three vocational training centers and 43 health centers in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. A decades-old mission rooted in the conflict’s bitter history The U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East was established to help the estimated 700,000 Palestinians who fled or were driven out of what is now Israel during the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation, UNRWA supporters say Israel hopes to erase the Palestinian refugee issue by dismantling the agency. Israel says the refugees should be permanently resettled in other countries, and Israeli opponents of the agency have suggested ending UNRWA services would force them to do so. Palestinians say refugees and their descendants, who now number nearly 6 million, should be allowed to exercise their right under international law to return home. Israel refuses, saying the result would be a Palestinian majority inside its borders. The issue was among the thorniest in the peace process, which ground to a halt in 2009. UNRWA operates schools, health clinics, infrastructure projects and aid programs in refugee camps that have grown into urban neighborhoods in Gaza, the West Bank, Lebanon, Syria and Jordan. A long-running dispute over UNRWA’s neutrality Israel says hundreds of Palestinian militants work for UNRWA, without providing evidence, and that more than a dozen employees took part in Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack. UNRWA immediately fired the employees accused of taking part in the Oct. 7 attack, in which Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people and abducted around 250. An independent investigation earlier this year found that UNRWA had 'robust' mechanisms to ensure its neutrality but pointed to gaps in implementation, including staff publicly expressing political views and textbooks with 'problematic content' in UNRWA-run schools. UNRWA says it thoroughly investigates any allegations of wrongdoing and holds staff accountable, and that it provides lists of all of its staff to Israel and host countries. It says Israel has largely ignored its requests to provide evidence for its claims against staffers. Israel has repeatedly struck U.N. schools-turned-shelters, claiming Hamas fighters operate inside them. It also says it has uncovered tunnels running near or under UNRWA facilities. UNRWA has long been the biggest single employer in Gaza, where the population has been impoverished by years of Israeli and Egyptian blockade. Hamas has ruled the territory since 2007, and it has civilian political operations alongside its armed wing. The militant wings of Hamas and other groups are highly secretive, their members virtually unknown outside of intelligence agencies. That complicates efforts by civilian organizations to vet employees. Fatah Sharif, an UNRWA teacher in southern Lebanon, was killed last month along with his family in an Israeli airstrike. It then emerged that he was a senior Hamas commander, something he had kept secret. Lazzarini, UNRWA's head, said Sharif was suspended without pay in March after the agency learned he belonged to Hamas’ political party, and that an investigation had been launched. He said he didn’t know Sharif was a militant commander until after his death. UNRWA has strong international support Several Western countries suspended funding for UNRWA after the allegations related to the Oct. 7 attack. All except the United States, which had been its biggest donor, have since restored it. The Biden administration recently warned Israel that if it did not allow more aid into Gaza it could lose out on some of the crucial American military assistance it has relied on throughout the war. The letter sent by Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to their Israeli counterparts said they shared Israeli concerns about 'the serious allegations' of UNRWA employees taking part in the Oct. 7 attack and of 'Hamas misusing UNRWA facilities.' But it said enacting the bills’ restrictions 'would devastate the Gaza humanitarian response at this critical moment ... which could have implications under relevant U.S. law and policy.' A joint statement from Canada, Australia, France, Germany, Japan, South Korea and Britain last week expressed 'grave concern' over the legislation. It said the agency provides 'essential and life-saving humanitarian aid,' the provision of which would be 'severely hampered, if not impossible' without it. ___ Frankel and Lidman reported from Jerusalem. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-un-aid-refugees-16bc0524adc947b95abe25d7d9eca038	2024-10-28T09:10:09-07:00	
Albania stops a ship suspected of harboring massive amounts of toxic waste from docking	TIRANA, Albania (AP) — Albania prevented Monday a ship suspected of transferring a huge amount of hazardous waste from docking at Tirana’s main port, officials said, after a watchdog group alerted authorities. The Turkish-flagged Moliva XA443A ship was kept about a mile away from the port of Durres, 33 kilometers (20 miles) west of the capital. Prosecutors ordered the containers to be seized and stored 'at an environmentally and physically safe place' to monitor. The Seattle-based Basel Action Network nongovernmental organization, or BAN, which focuses on environmental issues, said it flagged the ship to authorities in August following a whistleblower's note that its '102 containers' are suspected of carrying 'an estimated 2,100 total metric tonnes of ... waste pollution control filter dust from the steel industry.' BAN said the 'massive shipment' first left Durres on July 4th, 2024, on two Maersk chartered ships with the 'intended destination of Thailand.' The group said it also alerted several transit countries and collaborated with EARTH, a leading Thai environmental organization, and together raised the alarm about the shipment Thailand refused to accept the shipment, asking authorities in Singapore to stop it. The ships then docked at a Turkish port and the shipment was loaded on the Turkish-flagged ship, which briefly stopped at the Italian port of Gioia Tauro before going to Albania, BAN said. The customs documentation stated the containers harbored iron oxide, according to local reports. Albanian opposition accused the government in August of taking part in illegally trafficking hazardous material. Prime Minister Edi Rama said in Parliament in September that the shipment's documents were verified and that iron oxide is 'not considered as toxic waste in the European catalogs on which the environmental and customs procedure of our country is based.' Jim Puckett, BAN’s head, was in Durres when the ship arrived and called on authorities to have a public opening and sampling of the containers to ensure transparency. The group also wants to analyze the samples in 'different labs in parallel.' He told reporters they suspected the toxic steel furnace dust was collected from pollution control filters from an Albanian company and also illegally smuggled from Kosovo and Germany. 'It is up to the Albanian government to find a solution for their elimination,' Puckett said. Puckett told The Associated Press that government officials said the prosecutor’s office in Durres has taken control of the ship at the anchorage and that he can liaise with them to get the needed samples. 'We very much hope the wastes will be properly sampled and analyzed with third parties ... so that the public can trust in the result,' a BAN statement said. Albania is looking to integrate into the European Union and the government has been keen on aligning its hazardous waste policy with that of the 27-nation bloc, banning 'the export of hazardous wastes, household wastes, electronic wastes and plastic wastes to developing countries.' There has been no immediate comment from the Ministry of Tourism and Environment.	https://apnews.com/article/albania-toxic-waste-environment-organization-alarm-404112bd77ec535a33d486bbd6718c82	2024-10-28T07:35:23-07:00	
The Latest: Trump and Harris enter the final stretch of the 2024 campaign	Uncertainty reigns entering the final full week of the 2024 campaign with Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump locked in a fiercely competitive presidential contest. What happens in the coming days will be pivotal in deciding the winner of next week's election. Trump on Sunday held a rally at Madison Square Garden where several speakers made racist and crude remarks, including comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who described Puerto Rico as 'a floating island of garbage.' Shortly after those remarks, Puerto Rican reggaeton artist Bad Bunny endorsed Harris. Trump plans to hold a rally in Atlanta Monday evening while Harris will make several campaign stops in Michigan, including a rally with singer-songwriter Maggie Rogers. Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: ‘We cannot rest on tradition’ Vice President Kamala Harris told an audience at a semiconductor facility in Saginaw County, Michigan, on Monday that their work represents 'the best of who we are as a country,' balancing the traditions of the nation and the desire to push technology forward. 'When we understand who we are as a nation, we take great pride in being a leader on so many things. And we have a tradition of that,' she said at the Hemlock Semiconductor facility in central Michigan. 'But I think that what we know as Americans is that we cannot rest on tradition.' Harris added: 'We have to constantly be on top of what is happening, what is current, and investing in the industries of the future, as well as honoring the traditions and the industries that have built up America’s economy.' Hemlock Semiconductor recently received a $325 million federal grant for a new factory. Trump will speak to reporters at Mar-A-Lago on Tuesday The Republican nominee for president will deliver what his campaign is calling 'remarks to the press' at 10 a.m. at his private club and residence in Palm Beach, Florida. It is unclear whether the former president will take questions. Americans in Puerto Rico can’t vote for US president. Their anger at Trump is shaping the race SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — A comic calling Puerto Rico garbage before a packed Donald Trump rally in New York was the latest humiliation for an island territory that has long suffered from mistreatment, residents said Monday in expressions of fury that could affect the presidential election. Puerto Ricans cannot vote in general elections despite being U.S. citizens, but they can exert a powerful influence with relatives on the mainland. Phones across the island of 3.2 million people were ringing minutes after the speaker derided the U.S. territory Sunday night, and they still buzzed Monday. ▶ Read more about Puerto Ricans’ response to the remarks Biden criticizes Musk’s $1M giveaway as ‘inappropriate’ President Joe Biden said it was 'totally inappropriate' for Elon Musk to pledge to give away $1 million a day to voters for signing his political action committee’s petition. The billionaire and owner of the social platform X has gone all-in on Republican Donald Trump. The giveaway has raised questions and alarms among some election experts who say it is a violation of the law to link a cash handout to signing a petition that also requires a person to be registered to vote. 'I think it’s totally inappropriate,' he said in Delaware where he just voted. Since Labor Day, the campaigns have made more visits to Pennsylvania than to other states The Democratic and Republican presidential tickets are heading into the final week of campaigning with a familiar strategy: Rally supporters in the handful of states that will decide the race. Pennsylvania, Michigan, North Carolina and Wisconsin have received the most attention from Kamala Harris, Donald Trump and their running mates since the Labor Day weekend — the point when campaigning traditionally intensifies. The Democratic ticket has been more active over the past two weeks, according to Associated Press tracking of the campaigns’ public events. From Oct. 14 through this past weekend, Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, held 42 campaign events over the seven swing states while Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, held 25. There has been a stark contrast in Wisconsin: Harris and Walz visited the state eight times between Oct. 14 and Sunday, compared to just one visit by Trump and Vance during that span. The Republicans are headed back to Wisconsin this week, including a rally in Milwaukee. The AP tracker shows that from Labor Day through this past weekend both campaigns have made more visits to Pennsylvania (43) than to Georgia, Arizona and Nevada combined (40).

Biden calls Trump’s New York rally ‘simply embarrassing’ In response to Donald Trump’s New York rally where speakers made crude and racist insults, President Joe Biden said: 'It’s simply embarrassing. That’s why this election is so important.' Biden was speaking after he voted Monday in Delaware. 'Most of the presidential scholars I’ve spoken to talk about the single most consequential thing about a president is character. Character,' Biden said. 'And he puts that in question every time he opens his mouth.' Biden has voted in the 2024 election President Joe Biden waited in line for about 40 minutes Monday before he cast his ballot. He handed his identification to the election worker, who had him sign and then announced: 'Joseph Biden now voting.' As Biden voted behind a black drape, some first-time voters were announced and the room erupted in cheers for them. Alaska Sen. Murkowski says neither Trump nor Harris will get her vote U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican and outspoken critic of former President Donald Trump, says she won’t vote for him or Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, in the general election. 'I want to vote for somebody and not against someone,' she told the Anchorage Daily News. She added she was disappointed with the choices from both major parties. Murkowski voted to impeach Trump after the Jan. 6 insurrection and also called for him to resign. She said she didn’t vote for him in 2016 or 2020. 'I am going to be voting for someone and hopefully I will feel good about that, even knowing that that individual probably is not going to be in the winner column,' Murkowski said. Murkowski declined to say who would get her vote. There are six other candidates on the Alaska ballot for president, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr. even though he dropped out of the race in August. Biden is waiting in line to cast his ballot When President Joe Biden arrived at the polling place at the Delaware Department of Elections on Monday, there was a long line of people lined up waiting to vote. He chatted with some and was pushing an older woman in a wheelchair who was ahead of him in line. They were all casting ballots early for the Nov. 5 election. Harris: Trump is ‘fixated on his grievances, on himself, and on dividing our country’ Kamala Harris said Donald Trump’s rally at Madison Square helped prove her point about the stakes of the election. Speaking to reporters on Monday, Harris said the Sunday event 'really highlighted the point that I’ve been making throughout this campaign,' which is that Trump is 'fixated on his grievances, on himself, and on dividing our country, and it is not in any way something that will strengthen the American family, the American worker.' Harris plans to deliver her closing argument on Tuesday in Washington. 'There’s a big difference between he and I,' she said.

US voters concerned about post-election violence and efforts to overturn the results: AP-NORC poll WASHINGTON — American voters are approaching the presidential election with deep unease about what could follow, including the potential for political violence, attempts to overturn the election results and its broader implications for democracy, according to a new poll. The findings of the survey, conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, speak to persistent concerns about the fragility of the world’s oldest democracy, nearly four years after former President Donald Trump’s refusal to accept the 2020 election results inspired a mob of his supporters to storm the U.S. Capitol in a violent attempt to stop the peaceful transfer of power. About 4 in 10 registered voters say they are 'extremely' or 'very' concerned about violent attempts to overturn the results after the November election. A similar share is worried about legal efforts to do so. And about 1 in 3 voters say they are 'extremely' or 'very' concerned about attempts by local or state election officials to stop the results from being finalized. ▶ Read more about the latest AP-NORC poll Biden breakfasts in Wilmington with Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester President Joe Biden swung by a breakfast spot near his home outside Wilmington, Delaware, with a longtime ally who is vying to represent Delaware in the U.S. Senate. The president and Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester headed to The Legend Restaurant &amp; Bakery in New Castle. Blunt Rochester, who has served as Delaware’s lone House member since 2017, is trying to become the first Black woman elected to represent Delaware in the U.S. Senate. Biden formally endorsed Blunt Rochester in a video released on Sunday evening by the lawmaker’s campaign. He is set to cast his early-vote ballot later Monday before heading back to Washington. Harris says she’d take a cognitive test if asked to As former President Donald Trump continues to attack Vice President Kamala Harris with deeply personal insults, he has also suggested she should take a cognitive test. In an interview with CBS News, Harris said 'sure' when asked whether she’d take such a test. 'I would challenge him to take the same one,' Harris said. 'I think he actually is increasingly unstable and unhinged and has resorted to name-calling because he actually has no plan for the American people.' It’s the same line Trump used when President Joe Biden was still running for president as questions swirled about the 81-year-old’s age and mental acuity following his disastrous debate performance in June. Trump is 78 and is now the oldest candidate to run for office. Biden plans to cast an early ballot on Monday President Joe Biden plans to cast an early ballot on Monday near his home outside Wilmington, Delaware, according to the White House. For all but a few years since 1970, Biden has held office or has been running for one during election season. But this year, his hopes lie with a newer generation of Democrats, including three on the Delaware ballot looking to make history. Vice President Kamala Harris, who Biden endorsed after dropping out of the presidential race in July, is vying to become the first Black woman and first person of South Asian descent to serve as president. Meanwhile, state Sen. Sarah McBride is looking to become the first openly transgender candidate to be elected to the U.S. House. McBride is aiming to succeed Democrat Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester, who is looking to become Delaware’s first Black woman to win the U.S. Senate seat. She has served as Delaware’s lone representative in the House since 2017. Biden on Sunday evening formally endorsed Blunt Rochester, cutting a video for her campaign in which he called her 'Delaware through and through.' Harris highlights costs of living, abortion rights and border security as 3 immediate priorities Kamala Harris says she has three immediate legislative priorities when she takes office, should she be elected president. In an interview with CBS News, Harris said her first priority will be reducing costs for Americans with an expanded child tax credit and efforts to reduce the cost of groceries and make homes more affordable. The second is to work to restore abortion rights protections and the third will be to work on passage of a border security bill. Harris and Republican Donald Trump are in a tight race for the White House. Harris heads to Michigan Kamala Harris will focus on manufacturing jobs Monday as she heads back to Michigan. She’s set to visit Corning’s Hemlock Semiconductor Next Gen Facility. The Saginaw company received a $325 million investment from the CHIPS and Science Act, legislation passed by the Biden administration. She’s then touring a labor training facility in Macomb County. The election is in a week and one day, and Harris is hoping to appeal to many different voting blocs in the battleground states, in a dead-heat race with Donald Trump. On Tuesday she’ll give a closing speech in Washington.

Attack on a Chad military base kills 40 soldiers, presidency says	DAKAR, Senegal (AP) — Unidentified assailants killed at least 40 soldiers during an overnight attack on a military base in the country’s west, Chad’s presidency said Monday. President Mahamat Deby Itno visited the base in Barkaram, an island in Chad's Lake region, early morning and announced the launch of a military operation to track the assailants, according to a statement from the presidency. Chad has long battled with an insurgency in the country’s west, near the border with Nigeria. It was not immediately known who was behind the latest attack, but previous attacks in the region have been blamed by the government on the Boko Haram militant group. In March, an attack the government blamed on Boko Haram killed seven soldiers, reviving fears of violence in the Lake Chad area, after a period of peace following a successful operation launched in 2020 by the Chadian army to destroy the extremist group’s bases there. Schools, mosques and churches reopened and humanitarian organizations returned. Boko Haram, which launched an insurgency more than a decade ago against Western education, seeks to establish Islamic law in Nigeria’s northeast. The insurgency has spread to West African neighbors including Cameroon, Niger and Chad. Chad, a country of nearly 18 million people, has been reeling from political turmoil before and after a controversial presidential election that resulted in Deby Itno’s victory. He had led the country as interim president during the period of military rule that followed the death of his father in 2021.	https://apnews.com/article/chad-military-base-attack-50da737aa5f71456d19dbeaf9378d84f	2024-10-28T04:14:00-07:00

The tally includes 96 dead who arrived at hospitals in Gaza over the past two days, it said Monday. The ministry says at least 43,020 people have been killed and 101,110 others wounded since the war started on Oct. 7, 2023.

NATO confirms that North Korea has sent troops to join Russia's war in Ukraine	BRUSSELS (AP) — NATO on Monday confirmed that North Korean troops have been sent to help Russia in its almost three-year war against Ukraine and said some have already been deployed in Russia’s Kursk border region, where Russia has been struggling to push back a Ukrainian incursion. 'Today, I can confirm that North Korean troops have been sent to Russia, and that North Korean military units have been deployed to the Kursk region,' NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte told reporters. Rutte said that the move represents 'a significant escalation' in North Korea’s involvement in the conflict and marks 'a dangerous expansion of Russia’s war.' Adding thousands of North Korean soldiers to Europe’s biggest conflict since World War II will pile more pressure on Ukraine’s weary and overstretched army. It will also stoke geopolitical tensions in the Korean Peninsula and the wider Indo-Pacific region, including Japan and Australia, Western officials say. Russian President Vladimir Putin is keen to reshape global power dynamics. He sought to build a counterbalance to Western influence with a summit of BRICS countries, including the leaders of China and India, in Russia last week. He has sought direct help for the war from Iran, which has supplied drones, and North Korea, which has shipped large amounts of ammunition, according to Western governments. Ukraine, whose defenses are under severe Russian pressure in its eastern Donetsk region, could get more bleak news from next week’s U.S. presidential election. A Donald Trump victory could see key U.S. military help dwindle. In Moscow, the Defense Ministry announced Monday that Russian troops have captured the Donetsk village of Tsukuryne — the latest settlement to succumb to the slow-moving Russian onslaught. Rutte spoke in Brussels after a high-level South Korean delegation, including top intelligence and military officials as well as senior diplomats, briefed the alliance’s 32 national ambassadors at NATO headquarters. Rutte said NATO is 'actively consulting within the alliance, with Ukraine, and with our Indo-Pacific partners,' on developments. He said he was due to talk soon with South Korea’s president and Ukraine’s defense minister. 'We continue to monitor the situation closely,' he said. He did not take questions after the statement. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, citing intelligence reports, claimed last Friday that North Korean troops would be on the battlefield within days. He previously said his government has information that some 10,000 troops from North Korea were being readied to join Russian forces fighting against his country. Days before Zelenskyy spoke, American and South Korean officials said there was evidence North Korea had dispatched troops to Russia. The U.S. said around 3,000 North Korean troops had been deployed to Russia for training. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-north-korea-nato-ukraine-war-9b7357344d988ea32d8ca21f6e22dcc5	2024-10-28T03:27:36-07:00	
In wartime Ukraine, soccer fans bury rivalries and find a moment of calm at matches	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — At soccer games in Ukraine, crowd sizes are determined by the capacity of the nearest bomb shelter. For the first time since the full-scale war began in 2022, the Ukrainian Premier League is holding a full season with fans present, as martial-law bans on public gatherings have been eased. Despite the constant threat of airstrikes, Dynamo Kyiv supporters eagerly snap up the 1,700 tickets available for each home game at the 16,000-seat Valeriy Lobanovskyi Stadium. Many fans are keen to experience a rare moment of calm, free from the country’s traditionally intense sporting rivalries. While the war forced Dynamo to relocate its home matches in the Europa League to Hamburg, Germany, it uses its home stadium in Kyiv for domestic league matches. Vitalii Kozubra brought his 9-year-old son Makar to watch Dynamo, a title contender, face mid-table Zorya Luhansk, a club displaced by Russian attacks in eastern Ukraine. 'Even though there’s a war going on, this is something people can enjoy together,' Kozubra said, noting the friendly atmosphere at the stadium, where Zorya fans mingled with locals. Makar marveled at the difference between watching a game in person and on television. As the players took the field, all 22 of them draped in Ukrainian yellow-and-blue flags, the crowd, which included servicemen and families with children, erupted in applause. The stadium was alive with the sound of players’ exertion and the thud of the ball. Children rushed to the touchline for autographs, drawn by the few foreign players from Brazil, Senegal, Ivory Coast and Panama who have chosen to remain despite the war. Zorya wasn’t booed once. Sirens and shelters Ukraine’s 16-team top-flight league has managed to continue, despite increasing challenges. Matches are scheduled for early afternoon due to frequent power outages and the logistical challenges of travelling across Europe’s second-largest country during war. When air raid sirens interrupt play – sometimes for hours – players and fans alike head to shelters as alarms blare from loudspeakers and thousands of mobile phones. 'This season, we’ve been lucky in Kyiv, with no air alarms during our home games,' said Dynamo club spokesman Andrii Shakhov. 'But it’s a different story for away games... The longest one we had lasted 4½ hours because of four air alarms.' Ukrainian soccer players are subject to the draft at age 25 but clubs can apply for exemptions under business protection rules. Two teams currently play permanently outside their home field due to the war, amid broader disruption, while two others withdrew after fighting started due to stadium damage. The country's soccer tradition dates back to its Soviet past, when it was a soccer powerhouse, producing top-tier players and coaches. In the 1980s, fan movements often became expressions of Ukrainian identity, defying Soviet authority. After Ukraine declared independence in 1991, soccer continued to be a source of national pride through years of political and financial turmoil. Ukraine reached the quarterfinals of the 2006 World Cup and co-hosted the 2012 European Championships. Rivalries have been set aside At home, supporters’ groups have set aside violent rivalries for more than a decade, ever since they united to back protesters during the deadly 2013-14 uprisings against Russian influence. Later, they organized military recruitment drives to fight in the ensuing wars. 'Dexter,' a red-bearded Dynamo supporter and civilian contractor for the military, explained why the truce among rival fan groups still holds. 'It became necessary because we needed to unite against a common enemy. These internal conflicts lost their relevance when people from rival fan groups ended up fighting together in the same military units,' he said, while walking his dog along the banks of the Dnipro River. He added that fan organizations are involved in nearly every aspect of the war effort, from active combat duty to fundraising, veteran support, and providing technical skills like computer programming to the military. He and others serving in or working alongside the armed forces spoke on the condition that they be identified only by their call signs in keeping with Ukrainian military protocol. Dynamo officials estimate that more than 80% of their pre-2022 fanbase is now serving on the front lines in eastern Ukraine or performing other military duties. Soccer fans at the front Eight hours east of Kyiv, in the Kharkiv region bordering Russia, servicemen from the 3rd Assault Brigade played a match on a field near bombed-out buildings. Many of these fighters had been recruited through soccer-related channels and acquaintances. 'Organized fans play a huge role in this war because they’re highly motivated,' said a serviceman with the call sign 'Shtahet,' a Dynamo supporter currently on deployment. Combat medic 'Poltava' noted that soccer remains a vital morale booster. 'We get together whenever we can and rent spaces to play,' he said. 'There’s not much entertainment here, so football is our only joy.' Back in Kyiv, Dynamo fan 'Escobar' was grateful to catch a game while home on leave before heading back to the front. 'This is football, it’s a game,' the soldier said, in uniform and wearing a camouflage bucket hat, after Dynamo’s 2-0 win over Zorya. 'There are no bad feelings between the teams, and it’s great to see such a friendly atmosphere.' Vitaliy Buyalskyi and Maksym Braharu scored second-half goals for Dynamo, and even though Zorya players looked dejected as they walked off the field, they were still applauded by the fans. ___ Dmytro Zhyhinas and Evgeniy Maloletka in Kyiv contributed. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-war-soccer-football-russia-bd4904af397834c4d8fd2baa9b9f8b3a	2024-10-28T03:00:44-07:00	
Founder of far-right English Defense League gets 18 months in prison for court contempt	LONDON (AP) — The founder of the far-right English Defense League was sentenced Monday to a year and a half in prison for violating a court order barring him from repeating libelous allegations against a Syrian refugee. Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, better known as Tommy Robinson, admitted in Woolwich Crown Court that he was in contempt of court for violating a 2021 injunction by giving interviews in a podcast and shown on YouTube, and in a documentary he presented during a rally in London's Trafalgar Square in July that was also posted on his X account and widely viewed. Justice Jeremy Johnson said Robinson’s breaches of the injunction were not 'accidental, negligent or merely reckless' but a 'planned, deliberate, direct, flagrant breach of the court’s orders.' 'The defendant has not shown any remorse for his breaches of the order. It would have been surprising had he done so,' Johnson said. 'All of his actions so far suggest he regards himself as above the law.' Robinson, 41, who has been jailed in the past for assault, mortgage fraud and contempt of court, founded the nationalist street protest group EDL in 2009 in response to radical Islam preacher Anjem Choudary. Even after the group faded from view around 2013, he remained one of the most influential far-right figures in Britain and can still draw large crowds to the streets. This summer, police blamed EDL for starting what became a week of rioting across England and Northern Ireland after social media users falsely identified the suspect in a stabbing rampage that killed three young girls in the seaside community of Southport as an immigrant and a Muslim. Robinson, who was out of the country at the time of the attack, was blamed for using his social media presence to stir up the unrest. Although he was banned from Twitter in 2018, he was allowed back after Elon Musk took over the social network and now has 1 million followers on the platform now known as X. Thousands of people rallied in support of Robinson on Saturday in central London at a Unite the Kingdom rally that he planned but wasn’t able to attend because he had been jailed ahead of the hearing. Robinson was locked up Friday on a warrant issued after he failed to appear for the court contempt hearing in July and left the country for Cyprus. He had been ordered not to repeat false allegations he made in 2018 that a teen, Jamal Hijazi, was a violent thug who bullied and threatened other students at a school in West Yorkshire in northern England. Videos Robinson made about Hijazi were viewed more than 1 million times and led to abuse being directed at the boy. He dropped out of school and his family had to leave their home. Hijazi successfully sued Robinson for libel in London's High Court and was awarded 100,000 British pounds ($130,000) in damages and his court costs. An injunction was issued that prevented Robinson from repeating the allegations. But Robinson violated the injunction 10 times since 2023, most notably by airing a documentary, titled 'Silenced,' he made on the case that has been viewed more than 44 million times. Defense lawyer Sasha Wass insisted that Robinson was a journalist who believed in free speech and stood by the documentary, which she said was produced by Alex Jones, the U.S. conspiracy theorist who founded Infowars. 'He acted the way that he did, and he accepts his culpability, because he passionately believes in free speech, a free press and the overwhelming desire that he has to expose the truth,' Wass said. 'Having said all of that, he accepts the breaches as set out, but wants me to make it clear on his behalf that at all times he was following his principles.' Attorney Aidan Eardley, on behalf of the Solicitor General, said that disobeying a court order created a risk that others might not respect court orders. 'The harm here is that millions of people could see Mr. Yaxley-Lennon thumbing his nose at the court,' Eardley said. Robinson's supporters packed the gallery in court and crowded outside the courthouse during the hearing. Robinson, who stood in the dock in a gray suit and white shirt, looked at the dozens of people in the gallery and shrugged his shoulders as the sentence came down. He pounded his chest as he left the courtroom.	https://apnews.com/article/tommy-robinson-contempt-of-court-english-defense-league-2234f6eef821543feb688441c019384f	2024-10-28T02:55:09-07:00

Philippine ex-President Duterte says he kept a 'death squad' as mayor to kill criminals	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte told a Senate inquiry Monday that he had maintained a 'death squad' of gangsters to kill other criminals when he was mayor of a southern Philippine city. Duterte, however, denied authorizing police to gun down thousands of suspects in a bloody crackdown on illegal drugs he had ordered as president and which is the subject of an investigation by the International Criminal Court as a possible crime against humanity. Duterte, 79, attended the televised inquiry in his first public appearance since his term ended in 2022. The Senate is looking into the drug killings under Duterte, which were unprecedented in their scale in recent Philippine history. Duterte acknowledged without elaborating that he once maintained a death squad of seven 'gangsters' to deal with criminals when he was the longtime Davao city mayor, before he became president. 'I can make the confession now if you want,' Duterte said. 'I had a death squad of seven, but they were not policemen, they were also gangsters.' 'I’ll ask a gangster to kill somebody,' Duterte said. 'If you will not kill (that person), I will kill you now.' Sen. Aquilino Pimentel III, who was overseeing the inquiry, and Sen. Risa Hontiveros, pressed Duterte to provide more details but the former president responded in unclear terms and said he would explain further in the next hearing. Often cursing during the hearing, Duterte said he would take full responsibility for the killings that happened while he was president from 2016 to 2022. But he said he never ordered his national police chiefs, who also attended the inquiry, to undertake extrajudicial killings. 'Did I ever tell you to kill any criminal?' Duterte asked his former police chiefs. They included Ronald Dela Rosa, the current senator who first enforced Duterte's campaign against illegal drugs as his national police chief. 'No, Mr. president,' dela Rosa responded. Aside from the International Criminal Court’s ongoing investigation, there have been no known criminal complaints filed against Duterte in Philippine courts over the killings. 'I’m puzzled why the Justice Department hasn’t filed any case,' Duterte said. 'I’ve been killing people for a long time and they haven’t filed any case up to now?' Former Sen. Leila de Lima, one of the most vocal critics of Duterte who once investigated the drug killings in Davao, said there was adequate evidence and witnesses of the extrajudicial killings but they were scared of testifying against Duterte when he was in power. De Lima was arrested early on in Duterte’s presidency on drug charges she said were fabricated to stop her from proceeding with her Senate investigation. She was cleared of the charges and released from more than six years of detention last year. 'This man, the former mayor of Davao city and the former president of the Republic of the Philippines, for so long has evaded justice and accountability,' said de Lima, sitting near the former president. 'We have not made him to account after all these years,' she said, and added that witnesses could now surface and help prosecute Duterte and his associates. Arturo Lascanas, a retired police officer who served under Duterte for many years in a unit fighting heinous crime in Davao, told The Associated Press in an interview in 2022 that as many as 10,000 suspects may have been killed in Davao city on orders of Duterte and the former mayor’s key aides, including him. Lascanas, who has gone into hiding abroad, said he had provided his testimony and other evidence to the International Criminal Court. Duterte's associates may have removed the remains of the large number of victims buried in a quarry site in Davao city but Lascanas said the remains of some victims who were buried elsewhere by his group of policemen could still be retrieved and used as key evidence against the former leader and others. Duterte sounded defiant through the hearing. 'If I’m given another chance, I’ll wipe all of you,' Duterte said of drug dealers and criminals, who he added had resumed their criminal actions after he stepped down from the presidency. One of Asia’s most unorthodox contemporary leaders, Duterte ended his turbulent six-year term in June 2022, closing out more than three decades in the country’s often-rowdy politics, where he built a political name for his expletives-laced outbursts and disdain for human rights and the West while reaching out to China and Russia. Activists regarded him as 'a human rights calamity' not only for the widespread deaths under his so-called war on drugs but also for his brazen attacks on critical media, the dominant Catholic church and political opposition.	https://apnews.com/article/philippines-duterte-death-squad-killings-fc44bd8305f8e5468dcc6528825170fc	2024-10-28T01:34:11-07:00	
Georgia's president urges West to back protests against governing party after it claims election win	TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — Georgia's president on Monday urged the West to support opposition protests against the official results of a weekend parliamentary election in which the governing party was declared victorious amid voting irregularities and allegations of Russian meddling. Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili, who refused to recognize the official results, told The Associated Press in an interview that the South Caucasus nation has fallen victim to Russian pressure aimed at derailing its plans to join the European Union. 'We’ve seen that Russian propaganda was directly used,' said Zourabichvili, a fierce critic of the governing party. She said Georgia's government has been 'working hand-in-hand with Russia' and probably had help from the Russian security services. On Sunday, Zourabichvili stood alongside opposition leaders and urged Georgians to join a rally on the main street of the capital, Tbilisi, on Monday night to protest what she called a 'total falsification, a total stealing of your votes.' She told the AP that she expects the U.S. and the EU to back the protests. 'We need to have the firm support of our European partners, of our American partners,' Zourabichvili said. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on the social media platform X that 'the Georgian people embraced democracy yesterday' and urged Georgia’s political leaders to 'respect the rule of law, repeal legislation that undermines fundamental freedoms, address deficiencies in the electoral process, and move Georgia toward its Euro-Atlantic future.' The Kremlin has rejected the accusations of interference. 'We aren't meddling in Georgia's internal affairs, and we have no intention of meddling,' Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. He charged that it was the West that had tried to influence the outcome of the vote. Asked about Zourabichvili's call for the Georgians to join protests, he described it as an attempt to destabilize the country. The Central Election Commission said Sunday that the governing Georgian Dream party received 54.8% of Saturday’s votes with almost all ballots counted. The party — established by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia — has become increasingly authoritarian over the past year, adopting laws similar to those used by the Kremlin to crack down on freedom of speech. The EU suspended Georgia’s membership application process indefinitely because of a Russian-style 'foreign influence law' passed in June. Many Georgians viewed Saturday’s vote as a pivotal referendum on the opportunity to join the EU. The election campaign in the nation of 3.7 million people, which borders Russia, was marked by a bitter fight for votes and allegations of a smear campaign. European electoral observers said the election took place in a 'divisive' environment marked by intimidation and instances of vote buying, double voting and physical violence. During the campaign, Georgian Dream used 'anti-Western and hostile rhetoric ... promoted Russian misinformation, manipulations, and conspiracy theories,' said Antonio López-Istúriz White, the head of the European Parliament monitoring delegation. The election observers said instances of intimidation and electoral violations were particularly noticeable in rural areas. Georgian Dream scored its highest share of the vote — almost 90% — in the Javakheti region of southern Georgia. In the capital it received no more than 44% in any district. Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze, a member of Georgian Dream, on Sunday described his party’s success as 'impressive and obvious,' and that 'any attempts to talk about election manipulation ... are doomed to failure.' Initial figures suggested voter turnout was the highest since Georgian Dream was first elected in 2012. The party has vowed to continue the push toward EU accession but also 'reset' ties with Georgia's former imperial master, Russia. In 2008, Georgia fought and lost a brief war with Russia, which then recognized the independence of two breakaway Georgian regions and beefed up its military presence there. The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, called on Georgian officials to 'swiftly, transparently and independently investigate' the electoral irregularities and urged the governing party to demonstrate its 'firm commitment' to the EU. Hungary’s Victor Orbán was the first foreign leader to congratulate Georgian Dream and will be the first to visit Georgia and meet the prime minister during a trip to Tbilisi on Monday and Tuesday. ___ Associated Press journalist Sophiko Megrelidze contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/georgia-election-russia-european-union-protests-f6667dd64b537bd2082bfc5396f4a955	2024-10-28T01:18:11-07:00	
Borissov appears winner of Bulgaria’s parliamentary election	SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) — The center-right GERB party of ex-premier Boyko Borissov appears to be the winner of Bulgaria’s parliamentary election, the country’s central electoral commission said Monday, with 98% of the ballots counted. Results showed the GERB party receiving 26.5% of the vote, nearly 12 percentage points more than the pro-Western reformist bloc led by the We Continue the Change party. Seven other parties also appear to have gained seats in the 240-seat chamber, according to the latest results. The far-right, ultranationalist and populist party Vazrazhdane came in third with 13.5% of the vote. Capitalizing on pro-Russian sentiments shared by many in this former communist nation, it demands that Bulgaria lift sanctions against Russia, stop helping Ukraine, and hold a referendum on its membership in NATO. The Movement for Rights and Freedoms, which traditionally represented Bulgaria’s large ethnic Turkish minority, recently split into two rival factions, one around party founder Ahmed Dogan, and the other behind U.S.-sanctioned businessman and former media tycoon Delyan Peevski. Both factions entered parliament — the first with 7%, and the latter with 11% of the vote. The remaining seats in the chamber will be divided between four small populist and pro-Russian groups, among them the Socialist Party — heir of the once-almighty Communist Party. It could take days before the final official results are announced. If confirmed, Borissov will be handed a mandate to form his fourth government. In his first comment after the vote, Borissov described his party’s victory as 'categorical' and said that he was ready to compromise to form a coalition with all other parties except Vazrazhdane. But it seems Borissov will face an uphill struggle to cobble together a governing coalition. Political analysts predicted that the results, which do not differ significantly from the six previous elections held within the past three-and-a-half years, will be followed by difficult coalition talks. They don’t rule out another election.	https://apnews.com/article/bulgaria-parliament-election-government-borissov-russia-e280c068db463f13c458735aa212d63e	2024-10-28T00:52:57-07:00	
The trajectory of Ukraine's fight against Russia hangs on the outcome of the US election	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — There is no doubt that the U.S. election will determine the trajectory of the war in Ukraine. The status of military aid from Kyiv’s chief international backer is dependent on who becomes president, as is any prospect for a cease-fire that could benefit Ukraine. Some in Kyiv say the country's very existence hinges on who wins the White House. As Americans vote, exhausted and outmanned Ukrainian soldiers are holding defensive lines under constant Russian fire, knowing the results will dictate their future. The war in Ukraine is one of the most divisive issues of the Nov. 5 election: Former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, advocate very different views on how much support the U.S. should continue to give Ukraine. After a whirlwind Western tour, Kyiv’s leaders have tried to promote their version of what President Volodymyr Zelenskyy calls his 'victory plan.' They hope key decisions will be made — including Ukraine’s bid for NATO membership — by the new administration. For now, they have no choice but to wait. 'We believe that regardless of the last name of the future president of the U.S., the country of the United States will not give up global dominance, global leadership as such. And this is possible only through the support of Ukraine and through the defeat of the Russian Federation,' said Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskyy. Harris would likely continue Biden's policies Harris, who has decried President Vladimir Putin's 'brutality,' would likely carry on President Joe Biden's policy of support, albeit within the strict limits on Ukraine's ability to strike deep inside Russian territory that have frustrated Kyiv's leaders. 'President Biden has made it clear from the beginning of this conflict that his top priority has been to avoid an all-out war with Russia. I think that remains the top American priority,' said Malcom Chalmers, deputy director general at the Royal United Services Institute in London. The U.S. has provided Ukraine more than $59.5 billion in military weapons and assistance since Russia invaded in February 2022. But throughout, Kyiv has been captive to fraught American politics that often undermined its battlefield potential. Ukraine lost territory and manpower as weapons stocks dwindled during the six months it took the U.S. Congress to pass an aid package. Even promised military assistance has failed to arrive on time or in sufficient quantities. Ukraine is still hoping for Western approval of strikes inside Russian territory with longer-range weapons supplied by its allies. It also holds hundreds of square kilometers (square miles) in Russia's Kursk region after an incursion in August. Still, Biden’s commitment to support Ukraine has never wavered. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced a $400 million package during his recent visit. Zelenskyy said he expects another worth $800 million, the first tranche for Ukraine’s production of long-range capabilities. Still another $8 billion is expected by the end of the year. But for some, all that is too late. 'If the amount of aid that was promised but not delivered had been fulfilled, we could have entered negotiations in a stronger position with Russia,' said Gen. Lt. Ihor Romanenko, former deputy chief of the General Staff. Trump's vague vows and praise for Putin Trump has repeatedly taken issue with U.S. aid to Ukraine, made vague vows to end the war and has praised Putin. He also is considered highly unpredictable. Some Ukrainian officials even privately welcome this quality, saying it could bring about results quicker. But so much is unknown about what decisions Trump would make. 'He has emphasized that he has a very different approach to Ukraine than Kamala Harris. And if what he’s saying now is translated into action, then it’s going to be a very rocky period for Ukraine,' Chalmers said. 'Donald Trump is raising the very distinct probability that the United States will cut off most if not all military aid to Ukraine, which given that the situation on the ground, although deadlocked, is one which Russia currently has the advantage, could tip the balance in Russia’s favor,' he added. Podolyak said Trump 'understands the logic' of Zelenskyy’s plans after meeting with him. 'Mr. Trump realized that there is no way to agree on something in this war, because it is necessary to ensure Russia’s compulsion to understand what a war is, what consequences Russia will have in this war. That is, Russia can be forced to do something, but not asked.' Faced with Trump’s harsh rhetoric, some Ukrainian officials say that despite his stated views, his actions as president at times benefited Ukraine. Some of the toughest sanctions fell on Russia’s elite during his administration. Trump also approved the sale of lethal weapons to Ukraine, something President Barack Obama fell short of doing. Most Ukrainians fear Trump will halt all military aid to Kyiv, and no other country can match the U.S. support. Ukrainian soldiers remain defiant, saying they'll continue to hold the line, no matter what. But the practical implications would be dire, and Kyiv may be forced to accept devastating cease-fire terms, with a fifth of its territory under Russian control. 'If the aid is stopped, the situation will become more complicated,' Romanenko said. 'In this case, the seizure of Ukrainian land will continue, but we do not know how fast, because their offensive potential is not unlimited.' Zelenskyy's plans hang in the balance Zelenskyy has presented his vision for ending the war to both Trump and Harris, arguing for its necessity. He said Ukraine hopes for a post-election response from Washington, particularly on the question of NATO membership, insisting that such an invitation be irreversible. Both Ukraine and Russia are feeling considerable economic and societal strain to maintain the war effort. For the first time, Zelenskyy has openly discussed the potential for a partial cease-fire. But important questions remain about the fate of Russian-occupied territories. Russia has allocated a large part of its government budget to defense spending and continues to lose thousands of men. The potential introduction of what Zelenskyy has put at 10,000 North Korean troops signals that Moscow is having issues with mobilizing new conscripts. Ukraine's battered energy infrastructure and struggling mobilization drive is under far more pressure than Russia, however. Kyiv must find a way to de-escalate the intensity of the war and attacks on shipping and energy assets. 'In the end, it’s only going to happen if both sides calculate that they will get a net benefit from doing so,' Chalmers said. 'My concern would be in the uncertainty of the coming months when the Russians may believe that one last push and they can really get much larger concessions from the Ukrainians,' he added. Zelenskyy’s plans were developed with this reality in mind. It's why his team insists Russia must be forced to talk rather than convinced to do so. Without nuclear weapons to serve as a deterrent, NATO is the only logical alternative. 'I said, ‘We don’t have nuclear weapons, and we are not in NATO, and we will not be in NATO during the war.

France's president is visiting Morocco after his Western Sahara change brings a 'new honeymoon'	RABAT, Morocco (AP) — French President Emmanuel Macron arrives Monday in Morocco, where he is expected to meet with the North African kingdom’s leaders and discuss partnerships regarding trade, climate change and immigration. During the president’s three-day visit to Rabat, he is scheduled to meet with King Mohammed VI and Prime Minister Aziz Akhannouch and address Morocco’s Parliament. It comes months after Macron changed France’s longstanding public position and backed Morocco’s autonomy plan for the disputed Western Sahara. The move endeared the country to Morocco and alienated it from Algeria, which hosts refugee camps governed by the pro-independence Polisario Front and has long pushed for a U.N.-organized referendum to solve the conflict. In the days leading up to the visit, Moroccan publications lauded the 'warm reunion' and a 'new honeymoon' between the two countries while French flags were hung throughout Rabat. France and Morocco have historically partnered on issues ranging from counterterrorism to Western Sahara. Morocco is the top destination for French investment in Africa and France is Morocco’s top trade partner. Morocco imports French cereals, renewable energy infrastructure like turbines and weapons. Morocco exports goods to France including tomatoes, cars and airplane parts. Moroccans are among the largest foreign-born communities in France, where North African immigrants are a key political constituency and a focal point of debates about the roles of Islam and immigration in French society. In recent months, France’s new Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau has pushed for the country to take a hard-line approach toward immigration and seek deals with countries like Morocco to better prevent would-be migrants from crossing into Europe. On Macron’s last visit to Morocco, he and King Mohammed VI inaugurated Al Boraq, Africa’s first high-speed rail line, made possible by French financing and trains manufactured by the French firm Alstrom. Despite close ties, relations have at times been fragile between France and Morocco, which was a French protectorate from 1912 to 1956. In 2021, Morocco suspended consular relations France momentarily reduced the number of visas offered to Moroccans in protest of its refusal to provide documents needed to deport people who migrated to France without authorization. Relations between the two countries soured further that year when a 2021 report revealed Morocco’s security services had used Israeli spyware to infiltrate the devices of activists and politicians, including Macron. Morocco denied and sued over the allegations.	https://apnews.com/article/morocco-france-macron-visit-rabat-76c3a7d87b0a86d89d7749909c69e4c8	2024-10-27T21:12:59-07:00	
Developers begin cutting trees in a Tokyo park that environmentalists want to protect	TOKYO (AP) — Tree-cutting began Monday in the Jingu Gaien park district of central Tokyo, a flashpoint for more than a year between environmentalists and real estate interests. Developers led by real-estate company Mitsui Fudosan have a 10-year, multi-billion-dollar plan to build three skyscrapers on the coveted land and to raze a historical baseball stadium, replacing it with a new stadium. A small group of protesters gathered Monday. They object to the destruction of trees in a city that lacks green space and is seeing many parks handed over to commercial interests. The plan is backed by Tokyo Gov. Yuiko Koike, who once was Japan’s environmental minister.	https://apnews.com/article/developers-destruction-park-tokyo-japan-tree-cutting-1dd27843bb70d1b2b6fe1285dd27d5fa	2024-10-27T21:10:14-07:00	
Woman charged with assaulting Australian senator who shouted at the king	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — A woman appeared in an Australian court on Monday charged with a May assault on the Indigenous senator who shouted at King Charles III during a royal reception last week. The assault allegedly occurred on May 25, when independent Sen. Lidia Thorpe attended an Australian Rules Football match in her hometown of Melbourne. Ebony Bell, 28, appeared by a video link in Melbourne Magistrates’ Court. She has been charged with two counts of recklessly causing injury and three counts of unlawful assault at a stadium. A police statement described the 51-year-old senator’s injuries from the alleged assault as 'minor.' But she said in a statement to the AP on Monday she had 'sustained serious nerve and spinal injuries in my neck, which required spinal surgery and a plate to be inserted.' The assault was reported to police the next day and Bell was arrested on July 25. The women knew each other, but the motive for the alleged attack was not explained in court. Bell’s lawyer Manny Nicolosi told Magistrate Belinda Franjic the prosecution case had 'real deficiencies.' He said the prosecution had on Friday made an 'offer,' an apparent reference to a plea deal. 'I haven’t had enough time to really consider it,' Nicolosi told the court. Nicolosi explained that his Indigenous client hadn’t appeared in court in person because of 'recent threats.' The lawyer did not elaborate on those threats. Bell remains free on bail until she appears in court next on Nov. 22. The magistrate agreed to allow her to appear again by video. Thorpe made her first public statement about the alleged assault after she launched an expletive-laden rant at Charles during a reception in Australian Parliament House in Canberra last week. 'You are not our king. You are not sovereign,' Thorpe yelled at Charles as she was led by security guards from the reception. 'You committed genocide against our people. Give us our land back. Give us what you stole from us: our bones, our skulls, our babies, our people,' she added. The main opposition party has called for Thorpe to resign from the Senate due to her attitude toward Charles, who is Australia’s head of state, and have requested legal advice. Thorpe is renowned for high-profile protest action. When she was affirmed as a senator in 2022, she wasn’t allowed to describe the then-monarch as 'the colonizing Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.' She briefly blocked a police float in Sydney’s Gay and Lesbian Madri Gras last year by lying on the street in front of it. Last year, she was also banned for life from a Melbourne strip club after video emerged of her shouting abuse at male patrons. She revealed her injuries after The Australian newspaper reported she had missed 16 of the Senate's 44 sitting days this year. 'I was ordered by the doctor not to travel and could not attend parliament after I sustained the injury and during recovery from surgery. My doctor told me to take time off work,' her statement said. 'I would have preferred to keep this matter private and I will not be commenting on it further at this stage,' she added. Thorpe was widely criticized for being disrespectful to the monarch during her outburst last week. She faces a further backlash next week when senators sit for the first time since the royal visit. Her office said Monday she has not decided whether she plans to attend senate committee meetings in person or remotely. She also raised questions about the validity of her appointment to the Senate when she recently said she had deliberately affirmed her allegiance to Queen Elizabeth II and her 'hairs,' rather than 'heirs,' during her affirmation ceremony in 2022 to exclude Charles. Thorpe later walked back that statement, saying the mispronunciation was accidental. Lawyers agree that a mispronunciation did not invalidate an affirmation and that Thorpe also signed a written version of the affirmation of allegiance with the correct wording. Sydney University constitutional lawyer Anne Twomey said the Senate's ability to discipline Thorpe was limited because her outburst occurred outside the chamber in Parliament's Great Hall.	https://apnews.com/article/australia-senator-assaulted-king-charles-lidia-thorpe-6433e69a991a429b7e26587bec7ac485	2024-10-27T20:36:14-07:00	
A French court postpones Gérard Depardieu's sex assault trial because of his health	PARIS (AP) — A criminal court in Paris on Monday postponed French actor Gérard Depardieu's trial on charges of sexually assaulting two women on a film set because of concerns about his health, shifting the start of the proceedings to March. Depardieu, who has denied any wrongdoing, is accused of using 'violence, coercion, surprise or threat' in the alleged sexual assaults that prosecutors say took place in 2021 on the set of 'Les Volets verts' ('The Green Shutters.') The court also ordered an expert to assess the 75-year-old actor's health issues. Depardieu’s lawyer Jérémie Assous requested the postponement, saying that the actor has heart trouble and diabetes-related issues. Assous said that doctors decided the actor was not well enough to attend the proceedings even though he was eager to appear in court. 'He is anxious to defend himself, because for over three years, a huge number of inaccuracies, false information and lies have been systematically disseminated and relayed,' Assous told The Associated Press. 'Now, finally, we’re going to be able to have the word of the defense.' Lawyers for both women also argued in favor of the postponement, saying that their clients want to hear Depardieu’s explanations. Prosecutors say that in both cases, women reported that the actor trapped them between his legs and groped their buttocks, genitals, chest and breasts over their clothes. Outside the courtroom, one of the plaintiffs, a 53-year-old production designer, said 'it was extremely difficult to listen to all this violence,' after hearing Depardieu's lawyer defending his client. 'He questioned everything … There were a lot of lies, about almost everything actually.' The Associated Press doesn’t generally identify victims of sexual assault without their consent. Feminist activists protest outside the court France continues to reckon with sexual violence in the wake of the #MeToo movement that initially struggled to find traction, especially in the cinema industry. Depardieu 'is a coward,' French actor Anouk Grinberg told the AP outside the courtroom. Grinberg, who played in 'The Green Shutters,' said she showed up to court 'because I can’t take it anymore... And the impunity, it’s got to stop, society can’t allow it'. About 100 people gathered outside the court on Monday, some holding signs, responding to a call from several feminist groups to show support for victims of sexual violence. Some activists made their way into the courtroom and sat among other members of the general public attending the hearings. Blanche Sabbah, a women’s rights activist, said 'we’re here even though Gérard Depardieu will not show up.' The plaintiffs 'have shown up. They’re here and I am here to support them. That’s why all of these feminists are here.' Prosecutors say there were witnesses on the film set According to Paris prosecutors, the production designer told investigators that Depardieu had earlier made sexual remarks and then one day, as she walked past him, he 'grabbed her, pulled her toward him, blocked her with his legs, and groped her waist, hips and chest, accompanying his gestures with obscene remarks.' Prosecutors said three people witnessed it, and that the woman made an attempt to break away from Depardieu’s grip and seemed 'shocked.' A psychiatrist examined her and granted her a seven-day leave, they said. After the incident, it was arranged for Depardieu to apologize. But in a TV interview that aired Saturday, the woman said the actor was furious and blamed her for causing trouble. Prosecutors said witnesses confirmed that what Depardieu had said did not constitute an apology. In the interview with French online news site Mediapart, the production designer — who spoke on camera but only gave her first name — said the incident had taken a toll on her personal and professional life for at least 18 months. She said she could not sleep well, suffered anxiety attacks and lost weight. The month before the incident, another woman working on the film set had complained about Depardieu, prosecutors said. A director’s assistant told investigators that Depardieu had touched her buttocks on several occasions. She said she had expressed her disapproval and in return Depardieu had been insulting toward her. She was also given a six-day leave by a psychiatrist. Members of the film industry back Depardieu Many have come out in support of Depardieu, including French President Emmanuel Macron, who later expressed 'regret' about not having spoken about the importance for victims to speak out. Late last year, 56 French performers, writers and producers published an essay defending the film star, saying that when 'Gérard Depardieu is targeted this way, it is the art (of cinema) that is being attacked.' Their call came just weeks after national broadcaster France 2 put out a documentary outlining accusations of sexual misconduct by 16 women against Depardieu, and showed the actor making obscene remarks and gestures during a 2018 trip to North Korea. In the footage, Depardieu can be seen making groaning sounds and sexual comments in front of women, including a girl about 10 years old who is riding a horse. He can also be seen posing for a photo, saying he was 'touching the bottom' of a North Korean interpreter by his side. Depardieu was charged in 2020 with rape and sexual assault following allegations from actor Charlotte Arnould. In an open letter, Depardieu said last year, 'I have never, ever abused a woman.' The actor was long seen as a national icon in France. He has been a global ambassador for French film and enjoyed international fame with several roles in Hollywood. —- AP Journalists Nicolas Garriga and Marine Lesprit contributed to the story.	https://apnews.com/article/depardieu-france-sexual-assault-film-d4f9a91e413483ceb49394e754e46d73	2024-10-27T19:42:09-07:00	
Myanmar's civil war reshaped in past year with coordinated offensive by powerful resistance groups	BANGKOK (AP) — Three well-armed militias launched a surprise joint offensive in northeastern Myanmar a year ago, breaking a strategic stalemate with the regime’s military with rapid gains of huge swaths of territory and inspiring others to attack around the country. Before the offensive, the military’s control had seemed firmly ensconced with its vast superiority in troops and firepower, and aided with material support from Russia and China. But today it is increasingly on the back foot, with the loss of dozens of outposts, bases and strategic cities that even its leaders concede will be challenging to regain. How did the offensive unfold? The military seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021, giving rise to intensified fighting with long-established armed groups associated with Myanmar’s ethnic minority groups, and sparking the formation of new pro-democracy militias. But until the launch of Operation 1027, eponymously named for its Oct. 27 start, the military, known as the Tatmadaw, had largely been able to prevent major losses around the country. Operation 1027 brought coordinated attacks from three of the most powerful ethnic armed groups — the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, the Arakan Army and the Ta’ang National Liberation Army, together known as the Three Brotherhood Alliance — and they were able to quickly capture towns and overrun military bases and outposts along the Chinese border in northeastern Shan state. Two weeks later the Arakan Army launched attacks in its home western state of Rakhine, and since then other militia groups and PDFs have joined in around the country. A year later into the offensive, resistance forces now fully or partially control a vast horseshoe of territory that reaches from Rakhine state in the west, across the north, and then south into Kayah and Kayin states along the Thai border. The Tatmadaw has pulled back toward the center around the capital Naypyidaw and largest city of Yangon. What comes next? Many expect the military to launch a counteroffensive when the rainy season soon comes to an end, bolstered with the influx of some 30,000 new troops since activating conscription in February and its continued complete air superiority. But at the same time, resistance groups are closing in on Mandalay, Myanmar’s second largest city in the center of the country. Facing threats from all around the country, 'it doesn’t look like there’s any viable route back for the military to recapture any of the territory that it’s lost,' said Connor Macdonald of the Special Advisory Council for Myanmar advocacy group. 'The military is on the defensive all over the country, and every time it puts its energy into one part of the country, it basically has to shift troops and then is vulnerable in other parts,' he said. What has happened to Myanmar's civilian population? As the military has faced setbacks in the fighting on the ground, it has been increasingly relying on indiscriminate air and artillery strikes, resulting in a 95% increase in civilian deaths from airstrikes and a 170% increase in civilians killed by artillery since the 1027 offensive began, according to a report last month by the United Nations’ Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. The Tatmadaw has been accused of deliberately targeting civilians in retribution for perceived support for the resistance militias, something it denies. Hundreds of thousands of civilians have been displaced by the fighting, and there are now more than 3 million internally displaced people in Myanmar overall, and some 18.6 million people in need, according to the U.N. What happens if the military regime falls? As the front has expanded it has seen militias advancing out of their own ethnic areas, like when Rakhine-based Arakan Army in January seized the Chin town of Paletwa, which has given rise to some friction between groups — foreshadowing possible future problems should the Tatmadaw eventually fall. At the moment there is a degree of solidarity between the disparate ethnic groups with the focus on a common enemy, but Aung Thu Nyein, director of communications for the Institute for Strategy and Policy-Myanmar think tank said that does not translate to common aspirations. Should the Tatmadaw fall, that could lead to the fragmentation of Myanmar unless the groups work hard to resolve political and territorial differences. 'The resistance being able to bring down the junta is unlikely, but I cannot discount this scenario,' he said. 'If we cannot build trust and common goals, it could lead to the scenario of Syria.' Complicating the political picture is the influence of neighboring China, which is believed to have tacitly supported the 1027 offensive in what turned out to be a successful bid to shut down organized crime activities that had been flourishing along its border. In January, Beijing used its close ties with both the Tatmadaw and the Three Brotherhood groups to negotiate a ceasefire in northern Shan, which lasted for five months until the ethnic alliance opened phase two of the 1027 offensive in June, accusing the military of violating the ceasefire. China has been displeased with the development, shutting down border crossings, cutting electricity to Myanmar towns and taking other measures in a thus-far unsuccessful attempt to end the fighting.	https://apnews.com/article/myanmar-civil-war-militia-1027-offensive-takeaways-63b33397204b8ff78ede24f1e699ceef	2024-10-27T19:34:44-07:00	
Resistance forces push military regime close to brink in Myanmar	BANGKOK (AP) — Three well-armed militias launched a surprise joint offensive in northeastern Myanmar a year ago, breaking a strategic stalemate with the regime's military with rapid gains of huge swaths of territory and inspiring others to attack around the country. The military's control had seemed firmly ensconced with vast superiority in troops and firepower, plus material support from Russia and China.

'To us it doesn't look like there's any viable route back for the military to recapture any of the territory that it's lost.' The military seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021, triggering intensified fighting with long-established armed militias organized by Myanmar's ethnic minority groups in its border regions, which have struggled for decades for more autonomy. The army's takeover also sparked the formation of pro-democracy militias known as People's Defense Forces. They support the opposition National Unity Government, which was established by elected lawmakers barred from taking their seats after the army takeover. But until the launch of Operation 1027, eponymously named for its Oct. 27 start, the military, known as the Tatmadaw, had largely been able to prevent major losses around the country. Operation 1027 brought coordinated attacks from three of the most powerful ethnic armed groups, known as the Three Brotherhood Alliance: the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, the Arakan Army and the Ta’ang National Liberation Army. The alliance quickly captured towns and overran military bases and outposts along the Chinese border in northeastern Shan state. Two weeks later, the Arakan Army launched attacks in its western home state of Rakhine, and since then other militia groups and PDFs have joined in around the country. Myanmar's military has been pushed back to the country's center A year after the offensive began, resistance forces now fully or partially control a vast horseshoe of territory. It starts in Rakhine state in the west, runs across the north and then heads south into Kayah and Kayin states along the Thai border. The Tatmadaw has pulled back toward central Myanmar, around the capital Naypyidaw and largest city of Yangon. 'I never thought our goals would be achieved so quickly,' Lway Yay Oo, spokesperson for the Ta’ang National Liberation Army, told The Associated Press. 'We only thought that we would attack the military council together to the extent we could, but it has been easier than expected so we’ve been able to conquer more quickly.' Along the way, the Tatmadaw has suffered some humiliating defeats, including the loss of the city of Laukkai in an assault in which the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army captured more than 2,000 troops, including six generals; and of the city of Lashio, which had been home to the military's Northeast Command. 'The 1027 offensive was a highly impressive operation, quite complex, and the use of drones played a big role because basically they were able to dismantle the military's network of fire-support bases across northern Shan,' said Morgan Michaels, a Singapore-based analyst with the International Institute of Strategic Studies who runs its Myanmar Conflict Map project. 'And then, once the military's artillery support eroded, they were able to overrun harder targets like towns and battalion headquarters.' A year later, the military is 'substantially weakened,' he said, but it's too early to write it off. The military has been weakened, but not defeated The Tatmadaw has managed to claw back the town of Kawlin in the Sagaing region, which had fallen in the first days of the 1027 offensive, stave off an attack by three ethnic Karenni militias on Loikaw, the capital of Kayah state, and has retained administrative control of Myawaddy, a key border crossing with Thailand, after holding off an assault by one ethnic group with the assistance of a rival militia. Many expect the military to launch a counteroffensive when the rainy season soon comes to an end, bolstered by some 30,000 new troops since activating conscription in February and its complete air superiority. But at the same time, resistance groups are closing in on Mandalay, Myanmar's second largest city, in the center of the country. And where they might be out-gunned, they have gained strength, hard-won experience and confidence over the last year, said the Ta’ang National Liberation Army's Lway Yay Oo. 'We have military experience on our side, and based on this experience we can reinforce the fighting operation,' she said. Thet Swe, a spokesperson for the military regime, conceded it will be a challenge for the Tatmadaw to dislodge the Three Brotherhood Alliance from the territory it has gained. 'We cannot take it back during one year,' he told the AP in an e-mailed answer to questions. 'However, I hope that I will give you a joyful message ... in (the) coming two or three years.' Civilian casualties rise as the military turns more to indiscriminate strikes As the military has faced setbacks in the fighting on the ground, it has been increasingly relying on indiscriminate air and artillery strikes, resulting in a 95% increase in civilian deaths from airstrikes and a 170% increase in civilians killed by artillery since the 1027 offensive began, according to a report last month by the United Nations' Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. The Tatmadaw has been accused of deliberately targeting civilians whom it believes support the resistance militias, a tactic that is only turning more against them, said Isabel Todd, coordinator for the SAC-M group. 'It doesn't seem to be having the effect that they want it to have,' she said. 'It’s making them even more hated by the population and really strengthening the resolve to ensure that this is the end of the Myanmar military as it’s known.' Military spokesperson Thet Swe denied targeting civilians, saying it was militia groups that were responsible for killing civilians and burning villages. Hundreds of thousands of civilians have been displaced by the fighting, and there are now more than 3 million internally displaced people in Myanmar overall, and some 18.6 million people in need, according to the U.N. At the same time, the 2024 humanitarian response plan is only 1/3 funded, hindering the delivery of aid, said Sajjad Mohammad Sajid, head of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs operation in Myanmar. 'The humanitarian outlook for the next year is grim, and we anticipate that the deteriorating situation will have a massive impact on the protection of civilians,' he said in an interview. In some areas, however, the offensive has eased pressure, like northwestern Chin state, which borders Bangladesh and India and had previously been the focus of many of the Tatmadaw's operations, said Salai Htet Ni, a spokesperson for the Chin National Front whose armed wing has been involved in fighting the military. 'In October of last year the military convoys that were going up into the Chin mountains were withdrawn,' he said. 'As a result of the 1027 operation there have been almost no major military activities.' Success brings new tensions between resistance groups As the front has expanded it has seen militias advancing out of their own ethnic areas, like when Rakhine-based Arakan Army in January seized the Chin town of Paletwa, which has given rise to some friction between groups, foreshadowing possible future strife should the Tatmadaw eventually fall. In the case of Paletwa, Salai Htet Ni said his group was happy that the AA took it from the Tatmadaw, but added that there should have been negotiations before they began operating in Chin territory and that the AA should now bring Chin forces in to help administer the area. 'Negotiations are mandatory for these regional administration issues,' he said. 'But we will negotiate this case through dialogue, not military means.' At the moment there is a degree of solidarity between the different ethnic groups as they focus on a common enemy, but Aung Thu Nyein, director of communications for the Institute for Strategy and Policy-Myanmar think tank said that does not translate to common aspirations. Should the Tatmadaw fall, it could lead to the fragmentation of Myanmar unless the groups work hard to resolve political and territorial differences. 'As far as I see, there is no established mechanism to resolve the issues,' he said. 'The resistance being able to bring down the junta is unlikely, but I cannot discount this scenario, (and) if we cannot build trust and common goals, it could lead to the scenario of Syria.' Chinese interests and ties with both sides complicate the picture Complicating the political picture is the influence of neighboring China, which is believed to have tacitly supported the 1027 offensive in what turned out to be a successful bid to largely shut down organized crime activities that had been flourishing along its border. In January, Beijing used its close ties with both the Tatmadaw and the Three Brotherhood groups to negotiate a ceasefire in northern Shan, which lasted for five months until the ethnic alliance opened phase two of the 1027 offensive in June, accusing the military of violating the ceasefire. China has been displeased with the development, shutting down border crossings, cutting electricity to Myanmar towns and taking other measures in a thus-far unsuccessful attempt to end the fighting. Its support for the regime also seems to be growing, with China's envoy to Myanmar urging the powerful United Wa State Army, which wasn't involved in the 1027 offensive or related fighting, to actively pressure the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army and Ta’ang National Liberation Army to halt the renewed offensive, according to leaked details of an August meeting widely reported by local media. There is no evidence that the UWSA has done that, however. 'The idea that the northern groups and the Three Brotherhood Alliance etc. are somehow just agents of China is a complete misconception,' Todd said. 'They have their own objectives which they are pursuing that are independent of what China may or may not want them to do, and that's apparent in the incredible amount of pressure that China has put on them recently.' Because of the grassroot support for the resistance, it is less vulnerable to outside influence, said Kyaw Zaw, a spokesperson for the opposition National Unity Government. 'No matter who is putting pressure on us, we are winning because of the power of the people,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/myanmar-civil-war-militia-1027-offensive-60c0edaed37153fde75b1b838670c441	2024-10-27T19:33:56-07:00	
Stock market today: Asian shares rise and the yen dips after Japan's ruling party loses majority	TOKYO (AP) — Asian shares rose Monday, as the yen dipped in the midst of political uncertainty after Japan's ruling party lost its majority in Parliament's lower house in weekend elections. In currency trading, the U.S. dollar rose to 153.76 Japanese yen from 152.24 yen. It was trading at 140-yen levels last month. The euro cost $1.0796, down form $1.0803. The weak yen is a boon for Japan's giant exporters like Toyota Motor Corp., whose stock gained 3.7% in Tokyo trading. Nintendo Co. gained 2.6%, while Sony Corp. rose nearly 2.0%. Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party is still the top party, but several members failed to win reelection in Sunday's vote after a scandal involving unreported campaign funding. All told, the ruling coalition with junior partner Komeito secured 215 seats, down sharply from the majority of 279 it previously held, according to Japanese media. A change of government is not expected but the LDP may need a third coalition partner. Tokyo stocks rose. Analysts say the ruling party defeat had been greatly expected and factored into markets from before. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 surged 1.6% in morning trading to 38,527.52. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 gained nearly 0.1% to 8,217.80. South Korea's Kospi edged up 0.6% to 2,598.73. Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 0.1% to 20,614.74, while the Shanghai Composite rose 0.3% to 3,310.63. On Wall Street, U.S. stock indexes finished last week, drifting to a mixed finish, giving the market its first losing week since early September. The S&amp;P 500 closed little changed after having been up 0.9% earlier in the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.6% and also posted its first weekly loss after six straight gains. The Nasdaq composite rose 0.6%. Company earnings reports, which have been mostly solid, continue to be a key focus for investors. More than a third of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 index have reported their latest quarterly financial results. Most of the results have beat analysts' forecasts. Companies from around the world are scheduled to report earnings in coming weeks. Treasury yields ended last week broadly higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.24% Friday from 4.21% late Thursday. Yields have generally climbed following reports showing the U.S. economy remains stronger than expected. Wall Street will have more updates next week on consumer confidence, jobs and inflation. The Fed raised its benchmark interest rate to its highest level in two decades in an effort to tame inflation back to 2%, without sinking the economy into a recession. A key report on U.S. consumer spending is expected later this week, called the PCE. Analysts expect it to show that the rate of inflation has eased to 2%. The central bank started cutting interest rates in September and economists expect another cut at its meeting in November. Russia’s central bank on Friday raised its key interest rate by two percentage points to a record-high 21%. Moscow is trying to combat growing inflation sparked by military spending after its invasion of Ukraine. In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude fell $3.19 to $68.59 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, fell $3.25 to $72.80 a barrel. ___ AP Business Writers Damian J. Troise and Alex Veiga contributed to this report.

Middle East latest: Social platform X suspends new account on behalf of Iran's supreme leader	The social platform X has suspended a new account on behalf of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei that posted messages in Hebrew. The account was suspended early Monday with a brief note appended to it saying: 'X suspends accounts which violate the X Rules.' It wasn’t immediately clear what the violation was. The Elon Musk-owned social media company did not respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press. The move came after Israel openly attacked Iran for the first time this weekend. Khamenei said in a speech on Sunday that Israel’s strikes — in response to Iran’s ballistic missile attack this month — 'should not be exaggerated nor downplayed,' while stopping short of calling for retaliation. The X account opened Sunday with a message in Hebrew reading: 'In the name of God, the most merciful,' a standard Islamic greeting. Khamenei’s office has maintained multiple accounts for the 85-year-old supreme leader on X for years and has sent messages in a variety of languages in the past. A second message corresponded to a speech Khamenei gave on Sunday and was sent on his English account as: 'Zionists are making a miscalculation with respect to Iran. They don’t know Iran. They still haven’t been able to correctly understand the power, initiative, and determination of the Iranian people.' The message referred to Israel’s attack Saturday on Iran. This isn’t the first time Khamenei has seen a suspension or removal from social media. In February, Meta removed Facebook and Instagram accounts for the supreme leader over his support of the militant group Hamas after its Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Social media platforms like X and Facebook have been blocked in Iran for years, requiring Iranians to use virtual private networks to access them. ___ Here’s the latest: UN Security Council schedules emergency meeting at Iran's request UNITED NATIONS — The U.N. Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting Monday afternoon at Iran’s request on Israel’s air strikes against the country. Switzerland, which holds the council’s rotating presidency, announced the meeting on Sunday and said the Iranian request was supported by Russia, China and Algeria, the Arab representative on the council. Iranian president vows to respond ‘appropriately’ to Israeli strikes TEHRAN, Iran — Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian says his country will respond to Israel 'appropriately,' after Israel openly attacked Iranian military sites for the first time this weekend. 'We are not seeking war, but we will defend the rights of our nation and country and will respond appropriately to the Zionist regime’s aggression,' Pezeshkian was quoted by state TV on Sunday as saying. Pezeshkian also said the U.S. had promised Iran to stop the war in Gaza and Lebanon if Iran restrained. 'They had promised to end the war in response to our restraint, but they did not keep their word,' he said. The Iranian president also warned tensions will escalate if Israel’s aggression continues, adding, 'We know that the United States is encouraging Israel to commit these atrocities.' Iran says a civilian was killed in Israel's attack DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Iran announced Sunday that a civilian had been killed in Israel’s attack on the country, without offering any details on the circumstances of his death. The state-run IRNA news agency identified the dead man as Allahverdi Rahimpour and said he lived in a suburban area of southwestern Tehran. While offering no details on what he was doing or where he was killed, IRNA made a point to say he was not a member of Iran’s armed forces. Iran has offered few details on the attack and the damage caused by them so far.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-hezbollah-mideast-latest-28-october-2024-6e9675722f26251037569ee8ae655088	2024-10-27T18:55:06-07:00	
Brazilian soccer fan dies after ambush by rival supporters	SAO PAULO (AP) — Brazilian authorities said a Cruzeiro soccer fan has died after a roadside ambush by rival supporters in São Paulo state on Sunday morning. The fan was confirmed dead at a hospital in the city of Mairipora, 46 kilometers (28 miles) north of Sao Paulo. Local media reports said at least 12 fans were injured in the same attack. The Cruzeiro fans were traveling back to Belo Horizonte by bus after their team's 3-0 loss at Athletico Paranaense in the top-tier Brazilian league on Saturday. Brazil's federal road police told journalists the victim was a 30-year-old man, but did not provide more details. São Paulo’s public security secretariat said the attack was carried out by ultra supporters of rival Palmeiras. Footage on Brazilian TV showed a bus on fire and several Cruzeiro fans lying on the sidewalk as Palmeiras supporters punched them and hit them with sticks. Cruzeiro said on its social media channels that it 'deeply regrets yet another incident of fan violence' in Brazil. The club also said 'several fans were wounded.' Sao Paulo-based Palmeiras has not commented so far. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer	https://apnews.com/article/brazil-cruzeiro-fan-death-ambush-0cb52ae9343a350a289a6c40764e605e	2024-10-27T12:23:41-07:00	
Shohei Ohtani set to play for Dodgers in Game 3 of World Series following shoulder injury	NEW YORK (AP) — Shohei Ohtani is set to play for the Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 3 of the World Series at Yankee Stadium on Monday night despite a partially dislocated left shoulder. Ohtani got hurt sliding into second base when he was caught stealing to end the seventh inning of Saturday night’s 4-2 victory over the New York Yankees in Game 2 at Los Angeles. 'I just don’t see him not playing Game 3,' Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said before Sunday night's workout at Yankee Stadium. 'If he feels good enough to go, then I see no reason why he wouldn’t be in there.' Ohtani did not travel with the team to New York in order to undergo imaging. He was on a separate flight. 'As far as test results, we’ve got doctors scrambling everywhere. I don’t have them,' Roberts said. 'This is more me going by the training staff, Shohei feeling good this morning, range of motion, strength.' Ohtani was due to arrive at the ballpark in time for the workout, which started at 6 p.m. EDT. Roberts said Ohtani had taken dry swings since the injury and was going to hit off a tee and take batting practice in an indoor cage. 'That’s going to be telling,' the manager said. 'He’s got to still go through the workout and swing the bat, but, again, today feels better than yesterday, and our assumption is tomorrow’s going to feel better than today.' Roberts said the injury causes pain but 'it's just everyone’s tolerance.' 'I don’t see him being compromised,' he added. 'It’s the left shoulder, which is the back shoulder. So I don’t see how that affects his hitting, if he’s able to go.' Seeking their eighth title and second in five years, the Dodgers lead 2-0 in the best-of-seven Series. Walker Buehler starts Game 3 for Los Angeles against Clarke Schmidt. Ohtani hits leadoff, and Roberts is counting on his presence. 'If he is able to play, willing to play, he’s going to play,' the manager said. 'Schmidt will know that Shohei’s in the box, so that means everything.' Ohtani clutched his left forearm after being tagged by shortstop Anthony Volpe for the final out in the seventh on a feetfirst slide. He laid near the bag for a couple of minutes before being tended to by athletic trainers and leaving the field. The likely NL MVP was 0 for 3 with a walk in Game 2. He is 1 for 8 in the first two games of the Fall Classic and is batting .260 with three home runs and 10 RBIs in his first postseason in the majors. A two-time AL MVP with the Los Angeles Angels, Ohtani joined the Dodgers last December for a record $700 million, 10-year contract. The 30-year-old Ohtani hit .310 with 54 homers, 130 RBIs and 59 stolen bases, becoming the first player with at least 50 homers and 50 stolen bases in a season. The two-way star did not pitch this season while recovering from elbow surgery on Sept. 19, 2023, and has been limited to designated hitter. 'Any time you have probably the best baseball player in the world, I think it’s going to help and frees up some of the other guys to kind of play with a little less pressure or a little more freedom,' Buehler said. 'He’s been awesome for the clubhouse and awesome for our team, so it’s been a cool year watching him with the 50-50, just kind of the day to day and the kind of human he is, as well.' Ohtani had been one of the few players on the Dodgers roster who got through the season without a major injury. Nearly every member of the starting rotation spent time on the injured list and the team led the majors in injured list placements with 36 and days on the injured list with 2,342. Among the position players, Mookie Betts was out for nearly two months due to a broken left hand, and Max Muncy was out nearly half the season due to a right oblique strain. Freddie Freeman is playing in the postseason with a sprained right ankle. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb	https://apnews.com/article/world-series-ohtani-dodgers-yankees-e9ad1f46a4a6f12b9aeb99c1dee08db6	2024-10-27T11:36:38-07:00	
British chef Jamie Oliver urges followers to help solve the 'grate cheese robbery'	LONDON (AP) — British chef Jamie Oliver is on the case of the stolen cheddar. Oliver, who rose to fame as 'The Naked Chef' on TV by stripping food down to its essentials, got cheeky in an otherwise serious plea to his social media followers to help solve the mystery of the missing 22 metric tons (48,488 pounds) of award-winning cheddar worth 300,000 British pounds ($390,000) that was stolen in a scam. Calling it the 'grate cheese robbery,' Oliver told his 10.5 million Instagram fans to be on the lookout for 'lorry loads of very posh cheese.' Nearly 1,000 wheels of cloth-wrapped artisanal cheddar were swiped from Neal’s Yard Dairy by a con artist posing as a wholesale distributor for a major French retailer, the company said. The cheese was gone before the company realized it had been scammed and reported the theft Oct. 21. 'If the deal seems too gouda to be true, it probably is! Let’s find these cheese stealers,' Oliver wrote. Cheddar, which is named for the village in southwest England where it originated, is the world's best-known cheese because it does not have the protected status of other regional products like champagne and, thus, is produced in many countries. But there are only a small number of real British cheddar makers, Oliver said. 'These are some of the cheeses, or most of them, that got nicked,' he said in a video accompanying his post. The cheeses were from three makers: Hafod Welsh organic cheddar, Westcombe cheddar, and Pitchfork cheddar. Detectives at Scotland Yard and international authorities are searching for the culprits. Neal's Yard Dairy, a distributor, wholesaler, and retailer of British artisanal cheese, has asked international cheesemongers to be on the lookout for the stolen cheese, particularly in 10-kilogram (22-pound) and 24-kilogram (52-pound) blocks. 'If anyone hears anything about posh cheese going for cheap, it’s probably some wrong’uns,' Oliver said.	https://apnews.com/article/great-cheese-theft-london-cheddar-jamie-oliver-fbaf6d697cd5c7e00de1c95d33837d52	2024-10-27T11:00:10-07:00	
Destruction of Lebanon-Syria border crossings in Israeli airstrikes creates difficulties	QUSAIR, Syria (AP) — A stream of refugees fleeing Lebanon to Syria crossed a narrow makeshift bridge on foot Sunday in the Qusair area of Syria’s Homs province after the official border crossing was put out of commission by an Israeli strike two days earlier. Only three functioning crossings remain between the countries, which share a border 375 kilometers (233 mi) long. In late September, an Israeli airstrike hit the border crossing of Matraba in Lebanon’s northeast, forcing it to close. A few weeks later came a strike on Masnaa, the main crossing between the two countries, putting it out of service. The Jousieh crossing was struck on Friday. The Israeli military has accused the Hezbollah militant group of using the crossings to move weapons and military equipment from Syria to Lebanon. But humanitarian officials say that the closure of the crossings have intensified an already severe humanitarian crisis by blocking key routes for supplies and impeding access for those fleeing to safety. 'The situation is a tragedy,' said Ghossoun Mubarak, who fled with her three children from the city of Baalbek in eastern Lebanon, describing the bombardment that pushed her to leave her home. They crossed via the makeshift foot bridge on Sunday. The United Nations refugee agency, or UNHCR, said this week that around 430,000 people had crossed from Lebanon into Syria over the past month since Israel launched a major aerial bombardment and ground invasion of Lebanon as part of its push against Hezbollah. Lebanese officials give a higher estimate of more than half a million people. Rula Amin, a spokesperson for the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, voiced concern over the damage to the crossings, calling them 'a main lifeline for people escaping the conflict.' 'Today, it was better,' said Omar Abu Jabal, 29, who was returning to Lebanon Sunday via the Jousieh crossing after a work trip. 'No issues along the way. But before, there were bombings, which stopped people from moving.' Nabil Aakoul, director of transportation for the Homs province, said the recent strikes destroyed a bridge over the Orontes River, disrupting movement between vital agricultural areas. Aakoul estimated that rebuilding the bridge will cost around 35 billion Syrian pounds (around $2.5 million dollars at the official exchange rate), while the damage has severed access to agricultural areas and isolated communities dependent on cross-river trade and travel. Yahya Abu Youssef, who lives near the damaged bridge, described the strike as 'inhumane' and reported injuries to children and livestock nearby. 'All that’s here is a bridge connecting villages and farms,' he said, noting that villagers now face an additional 10 kilometers (6 miles) of travel to reach the city of Homs.	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-syria-israel-border-crossing-qusayr-hezbollah-051cf8de4bf5bb5a9448e562ec06fb19	2024-10-27T10:28:48-07:00	
Russian forces thwart attempted cross-border assault from Ukraine, official says	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russian forces thwarted an attempt at another cross-border incursion by Ukraine into southwestern Russia, a local official reported Sunday, months after Kyiv staged a bold assault on its nuclear-armed enemy that Moscow is still struggling to halt. An 'armed group' sought Sunday to breach the border between Ukraine and Russia’s Bryansk region, its governor, Aleksandr Bogomaz, said but was beaten back. Bogomaz did not clarify whether Ukrainian soldiers carried out the alleged attack, but claimed on Sunday evening that the situation was 'stable and under control' by the Russian military. There was no immediate acknowledgement or response from Ukrainian officials. The region neighbors Kursk province, where Ukraine launched a surprise push on Aug. 6 that rattled the Kremlin and constituted the largest attack on Russia since World War II. Hundreds of Russian prisoners were blindfolded and ferried away in trucks in the opening moments of the lightning advance, and Ukraine’s battle-hardened units swiftly pressed on across hundreds of square miles (square kilometers) of territory. Responsibility for previous incursions into Russia’s Belgorod and Bryansk regions has been claimed by two murky groups: the Russian Volunteer Corps and the Freedom of Russia Legion. Russian officials and state media have sought to downplay the significance of Kyiv’s thunderous run in Kursk, but the country’s forces have so far been unable to dislodge Ukrainian troops from the province. Western officials have speculated that Moscow may send troops from North Korea to bolster its effort to do so, stoking the almost three-year war and bringing geopolitical consequences as far away as the Indo-Pacific region. Russian lawmakers Thursday ratified a pact with Pyongyang envisioning mutual military assistance, a move that comes as the U.S. confirmed the deployment of 3,000 North Korean troops to Russia. North Korean units were detected Wednesday in Kursk, according to Ukraine’s Main Intelligence Directorate, known by its acronym GUR. The soldiers had undergone several weeks of training at bases in eastern Russia and had been equipped with clothes for the upcoming winter, GUR said in a statement late Thursday. It did not provide evidence for its claims. Moscow warns West against approving long-range strikes against Russia Also on Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow is working on ways to respond if the U.S. and its NATO allies allow Ukraine to strike deep inside Russia with long-range Western missiles. Putin told Russian state TV that it was too early to say exactly how Moscow might react, but the defense ministry has been mulling a range of options. Russia has repeatedly signaled that it would view any such strikes as a major escalation. The Kremlin leader warned on Sept. 12 that Moscow would be 'at war' with the U.S. and NATO states if they approve them, claiming military infrastructure and personnel from the bloc would have to be involved in targeting and firing the missiles. He reinforced the message by announcing a new version of the nuclear doctrine that considers a conventional attack on Russia by a nonnuclear nation that is supported by a nuclear power to be a joint attack on his country — a clear warning to the U.S. and other allies of Kyiv. Putin also declared the revised document envisages possible nuclear weapons use in case of a massive air attack, opening the door to a potential nuclear response to any aerial assault — an ambiguity intended to deter the West. Ukrainian leaders have repeatedly said they need permission to strike weapons depots, airfields and military bases far from the border to motivate Russia to seek peace. In response, U.S. defense officials have argued that the missiles are limited in number, and that Ukraine is already using its own long-range drones to hit targets farther into Russia. That capability was evidenced by a Ukrainian drone strike in mid-September that hit a large Russian military depot in a town 500 kilometers (300 miles) from the border. The U.S. allows Kyiv to use American-provided weapons in more limited, cross-border strikes to counter attacks by Russian forces. Civilian deaths reported in Kherson as warring sides trade drone strikes In a separate update, Bryansk Gov. Bogomaz claimed that over a dozen Ukrainian drones were shot down over the region on Sunday. Separately, a total of at least 16 drones were downed over other Russian regions, including the Tambov province some 450 kilometers (290 miles) north from the border, officials reported. There were no reports of casualties from any of the alleged attacks. In Ukraine’s southern city of Kherson, Russian shelling killed three civilians on Sunday, local Gov. Oleksandr Prokudin claimed. Another Kherson resident died in a blaze sparked by shells hitting a high-rise, according to Ukraine’s Emergency Service. Air raid sirens wailed for over three hours in Kyiv overnight into Sunday, and city authorities later reported that 'around 10' drones had been shot down. They said no one had been hurt. Ukraine’s air force on Sunday reported that it had shot down 41 drones launched by Russia across Ukrainian territory. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-incursion-kursk-5e37bb46493fa704f942e21c9203334c	2024-10-27T09:41:47-07:00	
Iran’s imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate hospitalized with severe health issues	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iranian authorities have allowed imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi to be hospitalized after almost nine weeks of feeling sick, a group campaigning for the activist said Sunday. The Free Narges Coalition said in a statement that Mohammadi must be granted a medical furlough to receive comprehensive treatment for multiple conditions. It said that just transferring her to the hospital will not address the severe health issues caused by months of neglect and deprivation. Mohammadi is being held at Iran’s notorious Evin Prison, which houses political prisoners and those with Western ties. She already had been serving a 30-month sentence, to which 15 more months were added in January. On Saturday, Iranian authorities issued an additional six-month sentence against her after she staged a protest against the execution of another political prisoner in the women’s ward of Evin Prison on Aug. 6. Mohammadi suffers from heart disease, and according to her medical report issued in September, the main artery of her heart has again developed a serious complication. The coalition said that they continue to demand the unconditional release of Mohammadi and her full access to medical care. Mohammadi is the 19th woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize and the second Iranian woman after human rights activist Shirin Ebadi in 2003. Mohammadi, 52, has kept up her activism despite numerous arrests by Iranian authorities and years behind bars.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-nobel-narges-mohammadi-hospital-71e1ed0c26b0cfa43c521caa619dab99	2024-10-27T07:34:22-07:00	
Bolivia's former President Evo Morales claims his car was shot at in attempted assassination	LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) — Former President Evo Morales of Bolivia claimed he survived an assassination attempt on Sunday after unidentified men opened fire on his car. He was not injured and there was no immediate confirmation of the attack from authorities. Morales alleged the shots were fired while he was being driven in Bolivia’s coca leaf-growing region of Chapare, the ex-president's rural stronghold whose residents have blockaded the country’s main east-west highway for the past two weeks. The roadblocks — protesting what Morales' supporters decry as President Luis Arce’s attempts to sabotage his former mentor and bitter political rival — have isolated cities and disrupted food and fuel supplies. Morales, who led Bolivia from 2006-2019, emerged unscathed from the alleged attack Sunday, appearing on his weekly radio show in his usual calm manner to recount what happened. He told the radio host that as he was leaving home for the radio station, hooded men fired at least 14 shots at his car, wounding his driver. Morales was quick to blame his successor, President Arce, with whom he is fighting to be the candidate of governing socialist party in next year’s presidential election. He claimed that Arce's government resorted to physical force having been unable to defeat him politically. 'Arce is going to go down as the worst president in history,' Morales said. 'Shooting a former president is the last straw.' Officials in Arce's government did not respond to requests for comment on the incident. Cellphone video circulating online shows Morales' driver bleeding from the back of his head. Morales can be seen in the passenger's seat holding a phone to his ear as the vehicle swerves and a woman's voice shrieks 'Duck!' The footage shows the car’s front windshield cracked by at least three bullets and its rear windshield shattered. Morales can be heard saying, 'Papacho has been shot in the head,' apparently referring to his driver. 'They are shooting at us,' Morales continues on the phone. 'They shot the tire of the car and it stopped on the road.' Morales' claim deepens political tensions in Bolivia at a volatile moment for the cash-strapped Andean nation of 12 million. In June there was an alleged attempted coup by a rogue general. Last month Morales led a massive march against the government's mismanagement of the economy that quickly devolved into street clashes with pro-government mobs. Imported goods are scarce and prices are rising. Drivers wait for hours to fill up at gas stations. The gap between the official and black-market exchange rates is widening. Earlier this month, the feud between Morales and Arce moved to the courts as Bolivian prosecutors launched an investigation into accusations that Morales fathered a child with a 15-year-old girl in 2016, classifying their relationship as statutory rape. Morales has dismissed the allegations as politically motivated and refused to testify in the case. Since reports surfaced of a possible arrest warrant against him, the ex-president has been holed up in the Chapare region, in central Bolivia, where supportive coca growers have kept vigilant watch to protect him from arrest. President Arce accuses Morales of trying to undermine his administration to advance his own ambitions. —— DeBre reported from Buenos Aires, Argentina	https://apnews.com/article/bolivia-morales-assassination-attempt-fdddc18fb237d6030782dc49bc4df9cb	2024-10-27T06:30:25-07:00	
On Navajo Nation, a push to electrify more homes on the vast reservation	HALCHITA, Utah (AP) — After a five-year wait, Lorraine Black and Ricky Gillis heard the rumblings of an electrical crew reach their home on the sprawling Navajo Nation. In five days' time, their home would be connected to the power grid, replacing their reliance on a few solar panels and propane lanterns. No longer would the CPAP machine Gillis uses for sleep apnea or his home heart monitor transmitting information to doctors 400 miles away face interruptions due to intermittent power. It also means Black and Gillis can now use more than a few appliances — such as a fridge, a TV, and an evaporative cooling unit — at the same time. 'We’re one of the luckiest people who get to get electric,' Gillis said. Many Navajo families still live without running water and electricity, a product of historic neglect and the struggle to get services to far-flung homes on the 27,000-square-mile (70,000-square-kilometer) Native American reservation that lies in parts of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. Some rely on solar panels or generators, which can be patchy, and others have no electricity whatsoever. Gillis and Black filed an application to connect their home back in 2019. But when the coronavirus pandemic started ravaging the tribe and everything besides essential services was shut down on the reservation, it further stalled the process. Their wait highlights the persistent challenges in electrifying every Navajo home, even with recent injections of federal money for tribal infrastructure and services and as extreme heat in the Southwest intensified by climate change adds to the urgency. ______ EDITOR’S NOTE: This is part of a series of on how tribes and Indigenous communities are coping with and combating climate change. ______ 'We are a part of America that a lot of the time feels kind of left out,' said Vircynthia Charley, district manager at the Navajo Tribal Utility Authority, a non-for-profit utility that provides electric, water, wastewater, natural gas and solar energy services. For years, the Navajo Tribal Utility Authority has worked to get more Navajo homes connected to the grid faster. Under a program called Light Up Navajo, which uses a mix of private and public funding, outside utilities from across the U.S. send electric crews to help connect homes and extend power lines. But installing power on the reservation roughly the size of West Virginia is time-consuming and expensive due to its rugged geography and the vast distances between homes. Drilling for power poles there can take several hours because of underground rock deposits while some homes near Monument Valley must have power lines installed underground to meet strict regulations around development in the area. About 32% of Navajo homes still have no electricity. Connecting the remaining 10,400 homes on the reservation would cost $416 million, said Deenise Becenti, government and public affairs manager at the utility. This year, Light Up Navajo connected 170 more families to the grid. Since the program started in 2019, 882 Navajo families have had their homes electrified. If the program stays funded, Becenti said it could take another 26 years to connect every home on the reservation. Those that get connected immediately reap the benefits. Until this month, Black and Gillis' solar panels that the utility installed a few years ago would last about two to three days before their battery drained in cloudy weather. It would take another two days to recharge. 'You had to really watch the watts and whatever you’re using on a cloudy day,' Gillis said. Then a volunteer power crew from Colorado helped install 14 power poles while the tribal utility authority drilled holes six feet deep in which the poles would sit. The crew then ran a wire about a mile down a red sand road from the main power line to the couple's home. 'The lights are brighter,' Black remarked after her home was connected. In recent years, significantly more federal money has been allocated for tribes to improve infrastructure on reservations, including $32 billion from the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 — of which Navajo Nation received $112 million for electric connections. The Navajo tribal utility also received $17 million through the Biden administration's climate law, known as the Inflation Reduction Act, to connect families to the electric grid. But it can be slow to see the effects of that money on the ground due to bureaucracy and logistics. Next spring, the tribal utility authority hopes to connect another 150 homes, including the home of Priscilla and Leo Dan. For the couple, having grid electricity at their home near Navajo Mountain in Arizona would end a nearly 12 year wait. They currently live in a recreational vehicle elsewhere closer to their jobs, but have worked on their home on the reservation for years. With power there, they could spend more time where Priscilla grew up and where her dad still lives. It would make life simpler, Priscilla said.

Analysis: Iran faces tough choices in deciding how to respond to Israeli strikes	JERUSALEM (AP) — It's Iran's move now. How the Islamic Republic chooses to respond to the unusually public Israeli aerial assault on its homeland could determine whether the region spirals further toward all-out war or holds steady at an already devastating and destabilizing level of violence. In the coldly calculating realm of Middle East geopolitics, a strike of the kind that Israel delivered before dawn Saturday would typically be met with a forceful response. Retaliating militarily would allow Iran's clerical leadership to show strength not only to its own citizens but also to Hamas in Gaza and Lebanon's Hezbollah, the militant groups battling Israel that are the vanguard of Tehran's so-called Axis of Resistance. It is too soon to say whether Iran's leadership will follow that path. Tehran may opt to hold back from forcefully retaliating directly for now, not least because doing so might reveal its weaknesses and invite a more potent Israeli response, analysts say. 'Iran will play down the impact of the strikes, which are in fact quite serious,' said Sanam Vakil, the director of the Middle East and North Africa program at the London-based think tank Chatham House. She said Iran is 'boxed in' by military and economic constraints, and the uncertainty caused by the U.S. election and its impact on American policy in the region. Even while the Mideast wars rage, Iran's reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian has been signaling his nation wants a new nuclear deal with the U.S. to ease crushing international sanctions. A carefully worded statement from Iran’s military issued Saturday night appeared to offer some wiggle room for the Islamic Republic to back away from further escalation. It suggested that a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon was more important than any retaliation against Israel. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's ultimate decision-maker, was also measured in his first comments on the strike Sunday. He said the attack 'should not be exaggerated nor downplayed,' and he stopped short of calling for an immediate military response. Saturday's strikes targeted Iranian air defense missile batteries and missile production facilities, according to the Israeli military. With that, Israel has exposed vulnerabilities in Iran’s air defenses and can still step up its attacks, analysts say. Satellite photos analyzed by The Associated Press indicate Israel's raid damaged facilities at the Parchin military base southeast of Tehran that experts previously linked to Iran's onetime nuclear weapons program and another base tied to its ballistic missile program. Current nuclear facilities were not struck, however. Rafael Mariano Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, confirmed that on X, saying 'Iran’s nuclear facilities have not been impacted.' Israel has been aggressively bringing the fight to the Iranian-backed militant group Hezbollah, killing its leader and targeting operatives in an audacious exploding pager attack. 'Any Iranian attempt to retaliate will have to contend with the fact that Hezbollah, its most important ally against Israel, has been significantly degraded and its conventional weapons systems have twice been largely repelled,' said Ali Vaez, the Iran project director at the International Crisis Group, who expects Iran to hold its fire for now. That's true even if Israel held back, as appears to be the case. Some prominent figures in Israel, such as opposition leader Yair Lapid, are already saying the attacks didn't go far enough. Regional experts suggested that Israel's relatively limited target list was intentionally calibrated to make it easier for Iran to back away from escalation. As Yoel Guzansky, who formerly worked for Israel’s National Security Council and is now a researcher at the Tel Aviv-based Institute for National Security Studies, put it: Israel's decision to focus on purely military targets 'allows them to save face.' Israel's target choices may also be a reflection at least in part of its capabilities. It is unlikely able to destroy Iran's nuclear facilities on its own and would require help from the United States, Guzansky said. Besides, Israel still has leverage to go after higher-value targets should Iran retaliate — particularly now that nodes in its air defenses have been destroyed. 'You preserve for yourself all kinds of contingency plans,' Guzansky said. Thomas Juneau, a University of Ottawa professor focused on Iran and the wider Middle East, wrote on X that the fact Iranian media initially downplayed the strikes suggests Tehran may want to avoid further escalation. Yet it faces a dilemma. 'If it retaliates, it risks an escalation in which its weakness means it loses more,' he wrote. 'If it does not retaliate, it projects a signal of weakness.' Vakil agreed that Iran's response was likely to be muted and that the strikes were designed to minimize the potential for escalation 'Israel has yet again shown its military precision and capabilities are far superior to that of Iran,' she said. One thing is certain: The Mideast is in uncharted territory. For decades, leaders and strategists in the Middle East leaders have speculated about if and how Israel might one day openly strike Iran, just as they wondered what direct attacks by Iran, rather than by its proxy militant groups, would look like. Today, it's a reality. Yet the playbook on either side isn't clear, and may still be being written. 'There appears to be a major mismatch both in terms of the sword each side wields and the shield it can deploy,' Vaez said. 'While both sides have calibrated and calculated how quickly they climb the escalation ladder, they are in an entirely new territory now, where the new red lines are nebulous and the old ones have turned pink,' he said. ___ EDITOR'S NOTE — Adam Schreck, the Asia-Pacific news director for The Associated Press, spent years covering the Mideast and has reported from countries across the region, including both Iran and Israel.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-israel-war-attack-retaliation-analysis-80a619146abd4f8aee2a7776a8f134d1	2024-10-27T05:04:26-07:00	
More than 120 killed in paramilitary rampage in east-central Sudan, UN and a doctors group say	CAIRO (AP) — Fighters from the notorious paramilitary Rapid Support Forces ran riot in east-central Sudan in a multi-day attack that killed more than 120 people in one town, a doctors group and the United Nations said. It was the group's latest attack against the Sudanese military after suffering a series of setbacks, losing ground to the military in the area. The war, which has been going on for more than a year and a half, has wrecked the African country, displacing millions of its population and pushing it to the brink of a full-blown famine. RSF fighters went on a rampage in villages and towns on the eastern and northern sides of the province of Gezira between Oct. 20-25, shooting at civilians and sexually attacking women and girls, the United Nations said in a statement Saturday, adding that they looted private and public properties, including open markets. The attack displaced more than 4,000 people in the city of Tambiuk and other villages in eastern Gezira, according to the International Organization for Migration’s Tracking Matrix. 'The killings and appalling human rights violations in Gezira province intensify the unacceptable human toll this conflict has taken on the people of Sudan,' IOM Director General Amy Pope told The Associated Press ahead of her trip to the country next week. She called for concerted international efforts to stop the conflict, saying: 'There is no time to lose. Millions of lives are in the balance.' 'These are atrocious crimes,' Clementine Nkweta-Salami, U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator in Sudan, said in a statement on Saturday. 'Women, children, and the most vulnerable are bearing the brunt of a conflict that has already taken far too many lives.' She said the attacks resembled the horrors committed during the Darfur genocide in the early 2000s, including rape, sexual violence, and mass killings. The RSF was born out of Arab militias, commonly known as Janjaweed, mobilized by ex-Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir against populations in Darfur that identify as Central or East African. At the time, the Janjaweed were accused of mass killings, rapes and other atrocities, and Darfur became synonymous with genocide. Janjaweed groups still aid the RSF. The Sudanese Doctors’ Union said in a statement that at least 124 people were killed and 200 others were wounded in the town of Sariha, adding that the group rounded up at least 150 others. It called on the U.N. Security Council to pressure the RSF to open 'safe corridors' to enable aid groups to reach people in impacted villages. 'There is no way to help the injured or evacuate them for treatment,' the statement said. Footage circulating online, some shared by RSF fighters themselves, showed members of the paramilitary group abusing detained people. One video showed a man wearing a military uniform grabbing an old man by the chin and dragging him around as other armed men chanted in the background. The RSF didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The Coordination of Civilian Democratic Forces, an alliance of pro-democracy parties and groups, also accused the RSF of storming villages, and opening fire on civilians as well as rounding up and mistreating 'a large number of residents.' In a statement, the alliance held the RSF 'responsible for these massive violations,' and called for holding the preparators accountable. The attack on Gezira came as the military had successfully taken back areas held by the RSF. In September, the military launched a massive operation in and around the capital city of Khartoum, reclaiming large swaths of areas from the RSF. Also, earlier this month, it seized control of Jebel Moya, a strategic mountainous area in Gezira province, as well as areas in Gezira and nearby Sinnar province, driving out RSF forces. In October, a top RSF commander, Abu Aqlah Keikel, the de facto ruler of Gezira, defected and surrendered himself to the military. That prompted RSF fighters to attack villages and towns in Gezira seen as loyal to Keikel, according to local reports. The war in Sudan began in April 2023 when simmering tensions between the military and the RSF exploded into open fighting in Khartoum, before spreading across the country. The war has been marked by atrocities such as mass rape and ethnically motivated killings. The U.N. and international rights groups say these acts amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, particularly in the western region of Darfur, which has been facing a bitter onslaught by the RSF. The conflict has killed more than 24,000 people so far, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data, a group monitoring the conflict since it started.	https://apnews.com/article/sudan-war-military-rsf-6693a4a8c10baa49e8bc70506bc170d6	2024-10-27T05:03:52-07:00	
A Philippine town in the shadow of a volcano is hit by landslides it never expected	TALISAY, Philippines (AP) — As a storm pounded his rural home, Raynaldo Dejucos asked his wife and children to stay indoors and keep safe from possible lightning strikes, slippery roads or catching a fever. One thing the 36-year-old didn't mention was landslides. In the lakeside town of Talisay in the northeastern Philippines, the 40,000 inhabitants have never experienced them in their lifetime. But after leaving home last Thursday to check his fish cages in nearby Lake Taal, an avalanche of mud, boulders and toppled trees cascaded down a steep ridge and buried about a dozen houses, including his. Talisay, about 70 kilometers (43 miles) south of Manila, was one of several towns ravaged by Tropical Storm Trami, the deadliest of 11 storms to hit the Philippines this year. The storm veered toward Vietnam across the South China Sea after leaving at least 152 people dead and missing. More than 5.9 million people were in the storm's path in northern and central provinces. 'My wife was breastfeeding our 2-month-old baby,' Dejucos told The Associated Press on Saturday in a municipal basketball gym, where the five white coffins of his entire family were laid side by side with those of a dozen other victims. 'My children were holding each other on the bed when we found them.' 'I was calling out the names of my wife and our children repeatedly. Where are you? Where are you?' Disasters and migration to danger zones are a deadly mix It's the latest reality check in the Philippines, long regarded as one of the world’s most disaster-prone countries, in the era of climate change extremes. Located between the Pacific Ocean and South China Sea, the Philippine archipelago is regarded as the doorway for about 20 typhoons and storms that barrel through its 7,600 islands each year, some with devastating force. The nation of more than 110 million people also lies in the Pacific 'Ring of Fire,' where many volcanic eruptions and most of the world’s earthquakes occur. A deadly mix of increasingly destructive weather blamed on climate change, and economic desperation that has forced people to live and work in previously off-limits disaster zones, has made many communities across Southeast Asia disasters waiting to happen. Villages have sprouted in landslide-prone mountainsides, on active volcano slopes, on earthquake fault lines and on coastlines often inundated by tidal surges. U.N. Assistant Secretary-General Kamal Kishore, who heads the U.N. disaster-mitigation agency, warned during a recent conference in the Philippines that disasters, including those caused by increasingly ferocious storms, were threatening more people and could derail the region’s economic progress if governments don’t invest more in disaster prevention. A volcano town bears the brunt of calamity The picturesque resort town of Talisay lies north of Taal, one of the country's 24 most active volcanoes nestled on an island in the middle of a lake. Fruit and vegetable farms have flourished on the fertile land, which is also a key tourist destination. Thousands of poor settlers like Dejucos have descended on Talisay over the decades, and its villages have expanded inland away from the lake toward a 32-kilometer (20-mile) long ridge with an average height of 600 meters (2,000 feet). Fernan Cosme, a 59-year-old village councilor, told the AP that the towering ridge at Talisay’s northern fringes had never posed any major risks, at least in his lifetime. The key worry has always been the volcano, which has been restive on and off since the 1500s. 'Many take the risks,' Cosme said of Talisay villagers, who have grown accustomed to Taal's volatility and survived in its shadow. In 2020, Taal's eruption displaced hundreds of thousands and sent clouds of ash all the way to Manila, shutting the main international airport. Kervin de Torres, a carpenter, wanted a safer community for his daughter Kisha, a high school student, but he and his wife separated and she bought a house close to the Talisay ridge, where she lived with Kisha. His daughter was in the house when she was buried by the landslide. The mother survived. A distraught de Torres showed his daughter's picture to police officers who on Saturday searched for the last two missing people — Kisha and a baby from another family. Three hours later, a backhoe dug up school uniforms dangling from plastic hangers, in a spot where Kisha was believed to have been entombed by the debris. Dozens of police and volunteers dug furiously with shovels until a foot was seen in the mud. De Torres wept when the remains of a young girl were placed in a black body bag. He nodded when asked if it was his daughter. Teary-eyed residents expressed their sympathies. Doris Echin, a 35-year-old mother, said she nearly died when the mudslide swamped her up to the waist as she darted out of her hut, carrying her two daughters. She said she prayed hard and managed to plod through. Standing beside her hut, which was half-buried in mud as police and emergency personnel searched the area with backhoes and sniffer dogs, Echin worried about her family's fate. 'If we relocate, where will we get the money to build a new house? Which employer will give us jobs?' she asked. 'If we get to rebuild and stay, we’ll be living between a volcano and a crumbling mountain.' ___ Associated Press journalists Aaron Favila and Vicente Gonzales contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/philippines-talisay-volcano-landslide-trami-e18e6d928e8d8233c521c378ff58c1b1	2024-10-27T03:17:12-07:00	
Satellite images show damage from Israeli attack at 2 secretive Iranian military bases	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — An Israeli attack on Iran damaged facilities at a secretive military base southeast of the Iranian capital that experts in the past have linked to Tehran's onetime nuclear weapons program and at another base tied to its ballistic missile program, satellite photos analyzed Sunday by The Associated Press show. Some of the buildings damaged sat in Iran's Parchin military base, where the International Atomic Energy Agency suspects Iran in the past conducted tests of high explosives that could trigger a nuclear weapon. Iran long has insisted its nuclear program is peaceful, though the IAEA, Western intelligence agencies and others say Tehran had an active weapons program up until 2003. The other damage could be seen at the nearby Khojir military base, which analysts believe hides an underground tunnel system and missile production sites. Iran's military has not acknowledged damage at either Khojir or Parchin from Israel's attack early Saturday, though it has said the assault killed four Iranian soldiers working in the country's air defense systems. Iran announced Sunday a civilian also had been killed, but provided no details. Iran's mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Israeli military declined to comment. However, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Sunday told an audience that the Israeli attack 'should not be exaggerated nor downplayed,' while stopping short of calling for an immediate retaliatory strike. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu separately said Sunday that Israel’s strikes 'severely harmed' Iran and that the barrage 'achieved all its goals.' Damage spread across three Iranian provinces It remains unclear how many sites in total were targeted in the Israeli attack. There have been no images of damage so far released by Iran's military. Iranian officials have identified affected areas as being in Ilam, Khuzestan and Tehran provinces. Burned fields could be seen in satellite images from Planet Labs PBC around Iran's Tange Bijar natural gas production site in Ilam province on Saturday, though it wasn't immediately clear if it was related to the attack. Ilam province sits on the Iran-Iraq border in western Iran. The most telling damage could be seen in Planet Labs images of Parchin, some 40 kilometers (25 miles) southeast of downtown Tehran near the Mamalu Dam. There, one structure appeared to be totally destroyed while others looked damaged in the attack. At Khojir, some 20 kilometers (12 miles) away from downtown Tehran, damage could be seen on at least two structures in satellite images. Analysts including Decker Eveleth at the Virginia-based think tank CNA, Joe Truzman at the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies and former United Nations weapon inspector David Albright, as well as other open-source experts, first identified the damage to the bases. The locations of the two bases correspond to videos obtained by the AP showing Iranian air defense systems firing in the vicinity early Saturday. Base linked to Iran's onetime nuclear weapons program At Parchin, Albright's Institute for Science and International Security identified the destroyed building against a mountainside as 'Taleghan 2.' It said an archive of Iranian nuclear data earlier seized by Israel identified the building as housing 'a smaller, elongated high explosive chamber and a flash X-ray system to examine small-scale high explosive tests.' 'Such tests may have included high explosives compressing a core of natural uranium, simulating the initiation of a nuclear explosive,' a 2018 report by the institute says. In a message posted to the social platform X early Sunday, the institute added: 'It is not certain whether Iran used uranium at ‘Taleghan 2,’ but it is possible it studied the compression of natural uranium hemispheres, which would explain its hasty and secretive renovation efforts following the IAEA’s request to access Parchin in 2011.' It's unclear what, if any, equipment would have been inside of the 'Taleghan 2' building early Saturday. There were no Israeli strikes on Iran's oil industry, nor its nuclear enrichment sites or its nuclear power plant at Bushehr during the assault. Rafael Mariano Grossi, who leads the IAEA, confirmed that on X, saying 'Iran’s nuclear facilities have not been impacted.' 'Inspectors are safe and continue their vital work,' he added. 'I call for prudence and restraint from actions that could jeopardize the safety &amp; security of nuclear &amp; other radioactive materials.' Damage seen at facilities for Iran's ballistic missile program Other buildings destroyed at Khojir and Parchin likely included a warehouse and other buildings where Iran used industrial mixers to create the solid fuel needed for its extensive ballistic missile arsenal, Eveleth said. In a statement issued immediately after the attack Saturday, the Israeli military said it targeted 'missile manufacturing facilities used to produce the missiles that Iran fired at the state of Israel over the last year.' Destroying such sites could greatly disrupt Iran's ability to manufacture new ballistic missiles to replenish its arsenal after the two attacks on Israel. Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, which oversees the country's ballistic missile program, has been silent since Saturday's attack. Iran's overall ballistic missile arsenal, which includes shorter-range missiles unable to reach Israel, was estimated to be 'over 3,000' by Gen. Kenneth McKenzie, then-commander of the U.S. military's Central Command, in testimony to the U.S. Senate in 2022. In the time since, Iran has fired hundreds of the missiles in a series of attacks. There have been no videos or photos posted to social media of missile parts or damage in civilian neighborhoods following the recent attack — suggesting that the Israeli strikes were far more accurate that Iran’s ballistic missile barrages targeting Israel in April and October. Israel relied on aircraft-fired missiles during its attack. However, one factory appeared to have been hit in Shamsabad Industrial City, just south of Tehran near Imam Khomeini International Airport, the country's main gateway to the outside world. Online videos of the damaged building corresponded to an address for a firm known as TIECO, which advertises itself as building advanced machinery used in Iran's oil and gas industry. Officials at TIECO requested the AP write the company a letter before responding to questions. The firm did not immediately reply to a letter sent to it. ___ Associated Press writer Amir Vahdat in Tehran, Iran, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-israel-attack-satellite-photos-gaza-lebanon-wars-0c6ee6a8544268612cb7d49727d8449d	2024-10-27T02:14:29-07:00	
In Beirut, a photographer's frozen moments slow down time and allow the contemplation of destruction	We watch video after video, consuming the world on our handheld devices in bites of two minutes, one minute, 30 seconds, 15. We turn to moving pictures — 'film' — because it comes the closest to approximating the world that we see and experience. This is, after all, 2024, and video in our pocket — ours, others', everyone's — has become our birthright. But sometimes — even in this era of live video always rolling, always recording, always capturing — sometimes the frozen moment can entrance the eye like nothing else. And in the process, it can tell a larger story that echoes long after the moment was captured. That's what happened this past week in Beirut, through the camera lens of Associated Press photographer Bilal Hussein and the photographs he captured. When Hussein set up his camera outside an evacuated Beirut apartment building Tuesday after Israel announced it would be targeted as part of military operations against Hezbollah, he had one goal in mind — only one. 'All I thought of,' he says, 'was photographing the missile while it was coming down.' He found a safe spot. He ensured a good angle. He wasn't stressed, he said; like many photographers who work in such environments, he had been in situations like this one before. He was ready. When the attack came — a bomb, not a missile in the end — Hussein swung into action. And, unsurprisingly for a professional who has been doing this work for two decades, he did exactly what he set out to do. Time slowed down The sequence of images he made bursts with the explosive energy of its subject matter. In one frame, the bomb hangs there, a weird and obtrusive interloper in the scene. It is not yet noticed by anyone around it, ready to bring its destruction to a building that, in moments, will no longer exist. The building's balconies, a split-second from nonexistence, are devoid of people as the bomb finds its mark. These are the kind of moments that video, rolling at the speed of life or even in slow motion, cannot capture in the same way. A photo holds us in the scene, stops time, invites a viewer to take the most chaotic of events and break it down, looking around and noticing things in a strangely silent way that actual life could not. In another frame, one that happened micromoments after the first, the building is in the process of exploding. Let's repeat that for effect, since even as recently as a couple generations ago photographs like this were rare: in the process of exploding. Pieces of building are shooting out in all directions, in high velocity — in real life. But in the image they are frozen, outward bound, hanging in space awaiting the next seconds of their dissolution — just like the bomb that displaced them was doing milliseconds before. And in that, a contemplation of the destruction — and the people it was visited upon — becomes possible. Tech gives us new prisms to see the world The technology to grab so many images in the course of little more than one second — and do it in such clarity and high resolution — is barely a generation old. So to see these 'stills,' as journalists call them, come together to paint a picture of an event is a combination of artistry, intrepidity and technology — an exercise in freezing time, and in giving people the opportunity to contemplate for minutes, even hours, what took place in mere seconds. This holds true for positive things that the camera captures — and for visitations of violence like this one as well. Photography is random access. We, the viewers of it, choose how to see it, process it, digest it. We go backward and forward in time, at will. We control the pace and the speed at which dizzying images hurtle at us. And in that process, something unusual for this era emerges: a bit of time to think. That, among many other things, is the enduring power of the still image in a moving-picture world — and the power of what Bilal Hussein captured on that clear, sunny day in Beirut. ___ Ted Anthony is the director of new storytelling and newsroom innovation for The Associated Press.

Georgia's crucial vote was marred by intimidation, European monitors say	TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — European observers said Sunday that Georgia's election took place in a 'climate of hatred and intimidation' with multiple election violations and cases of violence, undermining the outcome of the vote that could decide the country's future in Europe. The country's Central Election Commission said the ruling Georgian Dream won 54.8% of Saturday’s vote with almost all the ballots counted. Following a divisive pre-election campaign, initial figures suggested turnout is the highest since the ruling party was first elected in 2012. There were multiple concerns about the conduct of the election, including 'the widespread climate of pressure, and party-organized intimidation,' vote buying and the impartiality of state institutions, said Julian Bulai, head of the PACE delegation monitoring the polls. Georgian Dream has become increasingly authoritarian over the past year, adopting laws similar to those used by Russia to crack down on freedom of speech. Brussels suspended Georgia’s EU membership process indefinitely because of a 'Russian law,' passed in June. Many Georgians viewed Saturday's vote as a referendum on the opportunity to join the European Union. During the campaign, Georgian Dream used 'anti-Western and hostile rhetoric ... promoted Russian misinformation, manipulations, and conspiracy theories,' said Antonio Lopez-Isturiz White, the head of the European Parliament monitoring delegation. 'Paradoxically, the government further claimed that it was continuing Georgia’s European integration,' he added. The conduct of the polls, he said, is more evidence that points to the ruling party's 'democratic backsliding.' Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze on Sunday described Georgian Dream's victory as 'impressive and obvious,' and said 'any attempts to talk about election manipulation ... are doomed to failure.' Georgian electoral observers, who were stationed across the country, also reported multiple violations and said the results do not reflect 'the will of the Georgian people.' In the capital Tbilisi, Tiko Gelashvili, 32, said, 'The results that were published are just lies and rigged.' Bidzina Ivanishvili, the billionaire founder of Georgian Dream who made his fortune in Russia, claimed victory almost immediately after polls closed Saturday. 'It is rare in the world for the same party to achieve such success in such a difficult situation,' he said. He had vowed ahead of the election to ban opposition parties should his party win. Tina Bokuchava, the chair of the United National Movement opposition party, accused the election commission of carrying out Ivanishvili’s 'dirty order' and said that he 'stole the victory from the Georgian people and thereby stole the European future.' She indicated the opposition would not recognize the results and 'will fight like never before to reclaim our European future.' The UNM party said its headquarters was attacked on Saturday while Georgian media reported two people were hospitalized after being assaulted outside polling stations. 'The most important question is whether or not these elections will be recognized by the international community,' said Natia Seskuria, executive director of the Regional Institute for Security Studies in Tbilisi. Georgia's 'economic and political prospects' hinge on the election, she said. Many Georgians are concerned the EU may close the door on them and fear the country will be more vulnerable to Russia if Georgian Dream remains in power, she said. Georgians have a complex relationship with Russia, which ruled over it from Moscow until Georgia gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Russia and Georgia fought a short war in 2008, and Moscow still occupies 20% of Georgia's territory. Despite that, Georgian Dream has adopted Russia-style laws and many Georgians fear the govermment is distancing the country from the West and into Moscow's orbit. The election observers said instances of intimidation and electoral violations were particularly noticeable in rural areas. Georgian Dream scored its highest share of the vote — polling almost 90% — in the Javakheti region of southern Georgia, 135 kilometers (83 miles) west of the capital Tbilisi, where it got less than 44% of the vote in any district. The region is predominantly agricultural and many people are ethnic Armenians who speak Armenian, Russian and limited Georgian. Before the election, the AP traveled to the region where voters suggested they were instructed how to vote by local officials. Several questioned why Georgia needed a relationship with Europe and suggested it would be better off allied with Moscow. Around 80% of Georgians favor joining the EU, according to polls, and the country’s constitution obliges its leaders to pursue membership in that bloc and NATO. — Associated Press producer Sophiko Megrelidze contributed to this report	https://apnews.com/article/georgia-russia-election-european-union-8f040cb30e1d9c9e778383cbcbb7b2c1	2024-10-27T01:01:03-07:00	
Palestinian officials say Israeli strikes have killed 22 people in northern Gaza	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli strikes on northern Gaza have killed at least 22 people, mostly women and children, Palestinian officials said Sunday, as its offensive in the hard-hit and isolated north entered a third week and aid groups described a humanitarian catastrophe. The Gaza Health Ministry’s emergency service said that 11 women and two children were among those killed in the strikes late Saturday on several homes and buildings in the northern town of Beit Lahiya. It said another 15 people were wounded and that the death toll could rise. It listed the names of those killed, who mostly came from three families. The Israeli military said it carried out a precise strike on militants in a structure in Beit Lahiya and took steps to avoid harming civilians. It disputed what it said were 'numbers published by the media,' without elaborating or providing evidence for its own account. Israel is still carrying out daily strikes across Gaza, even as it wages and air and ground war with the Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon. Two people were wounded after an explosive drone launched from Lebanon slammed into a building in an industrial area of northern Israel, authorities said. An Israeli airstrike on a southern neighborhood of Beirut sent flames and smoke climbing into the air. On Saturday, Israeli warplanes attacked military targets in Iran — which backs both Hamas and Hezbollah — in response to an Iranian ballistic missile attack earlier this month. Iran’s parliament speaker, Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, followed other senior officials in downplaying the strikes, which state media said had killed four Iranian soldiers. But he said 'a response to this act of aggression is certain, with necessary considerations.' The cascading conflicts have raised fears of an all-out regional war pitting Israel and the United States against Iran and its militant proxies, which also include the Houthi rebels in Yemen and armed groups in Syria and Iraq. Red Cross describes ‘horrific circumstances’ in northern Gaza Israel has been waging a massive air and ground offensive in northern Gaza since Oct. 6, after saying that Hamas militants had regrouped there. Hundreds of people have been killed and tens of thousands of Palestinians have fled to Gaza City in the latest wave of displacement in the yearlong war. Israel says its strikes on Gaza only target militants, and it blames Hamas for civilian casualties because the militants fight in densely populated areas. The military rarely comments on individual strikes, which often kill women and children. Aid groups have warned of a catastrophic situation in northern Gaza, which was the first target of Israel's ground offensive and had already suffered the heaviest destruction of the war. Israel has severely limited the entry of basic humanitarian aid in recent weeks, and the three remaining hospitals in the north — one of which was raided over the weekend — say they have been overwhelmed by waves of wounded people. The International Committee of the Red Cross on Saturday said that ongoing Israeli evacuation orders and restrictions on the entry of essential supplies to the north had left the civilian population in 'horrific circumstances.' 'Many civilians are currently unable to move, trapped by fighting, destruction or physical constraint and now lack access to even basic medical care,' it said. Hospital reels after Israeli raid detains dozens of medics Israeli troops raided the Kamal Adwan Hospital in the north on Friday, detaining dozens of medical staff and causing heavy damage, according to the Health Ministry. Footage circulated online showing the courtyard bulldozed and the wards ransacked. Israeli troops withdrew on Saturday. The head of the World Health Organization said 44 male staff members were detained at the hospital. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said only female staff, the hospital director and one male doctor were left to care for almost 200 patients. Among those detained and taken away was Dr. Mohamed Obeid, head of the orthopedics’ department at nearby Al-Awda Hospital, according to Al-Awda Hospital. His whereabouts are unknown. Throughout the yearlong Israel-Hamas war, Israeli forces have stormed and bombarded a number of hospitals including the strip’s largest medical facility, Shifa Hospital. Israel accuses Hamas of using medical facilities across Gaza for military purposes, allegations denied by hospital staff, who say the raids have recklessly endangered sick and wounded civilians. The war began when Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel's border wall and stormed into southern Israel in a surprise attack on Oct. 7, 2023. They killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, around a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed more than 42,000 Palestinians, according to the local Health Ministry. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count but says more than half of those killed were women and children. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. The offensive has devastated much of the impoverished coastal territory and displaced around 90% of its population of 2.3 million, often multiple times. Hundreds of thousands of people have crowded into squalid tent camps along the coast, and aid groups say hunger is rampant. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo and Krauss from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

Bulgarians vote with little hope of breaking a political deadlock	SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) — Bulgarians were voting Sunday in a seventh general election in just over three years with little hope that a stable government will be formed to stop the country’s further slide into political instability. Voter fatigue and disillusionment with politicians have created an environment where radical political voices, aided by Moscow’s widespread disinformation, are successfully undermining public support for the democratic process and boosting the popularity of pro-Russian and far-right groups. The never-ending election spiral has a serious impact on Bulgaria’s economy and its foreign policy. The country risks losing billions of euros in EU recovery funds due to lack of reforms. Full integration into the open-border Schengen area and joining the eurozone are likely to be delayed further. Polling stations opened at 7 a.m. local time (0500 GMT) on Sunday. Initial exit poll results will be announced after polls close at 8 p.m. (1800 GMT) and preliminary results are expected on Monday. According to latest opinion polls, Bulgarians’ lack of confidence in elections will result in a record low voter turnout. Gallup World Poll data show only 10% of Bulgarians trust the integrity of their elections — the lowest proportion in the EU, where the average is 62%. Some observers have labelled the past few years as a period of 'revolving-door governments,' which has additionally fueled voters’ apathy. There was no clear winner in the latest vote, held in June, and the seven groups elected to the fragmented legislature were unable to put together a viable coalition. Observers suggest that Sunday’s vote will produce more of the same. These early elections are not expected to break a protracted political stalemate, Teneo, a political risk consultancy, said in a report last week. Although former prime minister Boyko Borissov’s center-right GERB party is set to win a plurality of seats, it will likely struggle to form a majority government in a fragmented parliament, Teneo predicted. 'As a result, a technocratic government or another early election are the most likely outcomes. Political instability and a surging budget deficit are key challenges to Bulgaria’s accession to the eurozone,' the consultancy added. The Balkan country of 6.7 million has been gripped by political instability since 2020, when nationwide protests erupted against corrupt politicians that had allowed oligarchs to take control of state institutions. Bulgaria is one of the poorest and most corrupt European Union member states. Attempts to fight graft are an uphill battle against an unreformed judiciary widely accused of serving the interests of politicians. Despite a fall in support for GERB in recent elections, it is tipped to finish first with a quarter of the votes. It will be a hard task for Borisov, however, to secure enough support for a stable coalition government. Analysts believe that the main pro-Russia party in Bulgaria, Vazrazhdane, could emerge as the second-largest group in parliament. The far-right, ultra-nationalist and populist party demands that Bulgaria lift sanctions against Russia, stop helping Ukraine, and hold a referendum on its membership in NATO. The reformist, pro-EU We Continue the Change/Democratic Bulgaria bloc is tipped to come in third. The Movement for Rights and Freedoms, which traditionally represented Bulgaria’s large ethnic Turkish minority, recently split into two rival factions, one around party founder Ahmed Dogan, and the other behind U.S.-sanctioned businessman and former media tycoon Delyan Peevski. Both factions are tipped to enter parliament, gaining between 7 and 9 percent each, Up to four smaller groups could also pass the 4-percent threshold for entering parliament, which would even more complicate the forming of a government.	https://apnews.com/article/bulgaria-parliament-election-government-russia-borissov-a5f340a55ca3f3d3c520b7ea7c9732e8	2024-10-26T21:05:30-07:00	
A Lebanese family was holding a Sunday gathering when an Israeli strike toppled their building	AIN EL DELB, Lebanon (AP) — It was Sunday, family time for most in Lebanon, and Hecham al-Baba was visiting his sister. She insisted he and their older brother stay for lunch, hoping to prolong the warm gathering in stressful times. The brother declined. Like many in Lebanon, he hadn’t been sleeping because of Israel’s intensifying airstrikes, so he left to take a nap. The 60-year-old al-Baba, on his annual visit from Germany to see his family in Lebanon, stayed. His sister Donize even convinced him to call an old flame over for coffee. He excitedly stepped into the bathroom to clean up before his visitor arrived. Within seconds, a huge boom shook the basement apartment. Al-Baba fell to the floor. Something hit him in the chest, knocking the breath out of him. He pulled himself up and reached for the door, screaming his sister’s name. A second explosion threw him back to the floor. The bathroom ceiling — and the whole building above it — collapsed on his back. An Israeli air raid hit the six-story residential building in Ain el Delb, a neighborhood outside the coastal city of Sidon. The entire building tipped over down a hillside and landed on its face, taking with it 17 apartments full of families and visitors. More than 70 people were killed, and 60 injured. Israel said the Sept. 29 strike targeted a Hezbollah commander and claimed the building was a headquarters for the group. It could not be independently confirmed whether any of the residents belonged to Hezbollah. In a video that surfaced online mourning one of the people believed to be residing in the building, he appeared in an old photo wearing military fatigues, a sign of affiliation with Hezbollah. Either way, experts say the strike illustrates Israel’s willingness to kill significant numbers of civilians in pursuit of a single target. That tactic has fueled the high death toll among Palestinians in Gaza in Israel’s year-old campaign against Hamas. Israel has intensified bombardment of Lebanon since Sept. 23, vowing to cripple Hezbollah, which began firing into northern Israel after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack triggered the war in Gaza. Israel says it is targeting Hezbollah members and infrastructure and says the group places military assets in civilian areas. Some 2,000 people have been killed, including Hezbollah fighters and commanders — but also hundreds of civilians, often in strikes on homes. 'It seems to be a feature so similar to Gaza in that these are families being killed together in single strikes,' said Emily Tripp, director of the London-based group Airwars, which monitors conflicts. In the first week of Israel's escalation, it hit a home in Tyre province, killing a family of 15, all of them women and children except for a Hezbollah member. A strike in Byblos killed six family members of a Hezbollah fighter, who had already died in fighting a month before — raising questions about the quality of intelligence used in the strikes. A hit on a shack housing Syrian migrant worker families killed 23. The strike in Ain el Delb was one of the deadliest of the Israeli campaign. Among those killed were al-Baba’s sister, her husband and two of their children, a daughter in her 20s and a teenage boy. Al-Baba was trapped for hours, with the rubble pressing him in an agonizing, kneeling position, his neck twisted, his face stuck to the bathroom floor, unable to feel his legs. He knew his sister’s family was dead from the constant, unanswered ringing of their phones. 'No one said a word. I didn’t hear a movement,' he said. 'People don't know. Israel knows' The Israeli military said it enacted evacuation procedures before acting on confirmed intelligence in the Ain el Delb strike. Residents who spoke to The Associated Press said they received no warning. 'I wish we had. We would have left,' said Abdul-Hamid Ramadan, who lived on the top floor and whose wife Jinan and daughter Julia were killed. 'I would have lost my home. But not my wife and daughter.' Israel says it often issues evacuation orders before striking. But in Lebanon, as in Gaza, rights groups say the advance warnings are often inadequate and come in the middle of the night or through social media. Ramadan, a retired army officer, said he knew of no Hezbollah members or weapons in the building, where he has lived for more than 20 years. No one thought the neighborhood — where most residents are Sunni Muslims and Christians — would be on the list of Israeli targets. In the building, 15 out of the 17 apartments were occupied by longtime residents who all knew each other. Displaced people from the south had begun arriving a week earlier, seeking shelter with relatives in the building. Al-Baba said his sister confided in him before she was killed that she was concerned about a much-loved Shiite tenant, mainly because he had been receiving guests. She feared he may be a target of Israel and asked her brother if she should leave. She decided to stay because she had no idea where to go. Neither al-Baba nor his sister knew anything about the tenant being linked to Hezbollah. Israeli strikes have stoked fears among Lebanese over the possibility their building could be hit for hosting someone who Israel claims, rightly or wrongly, to be connected to Hezbollah. Building administrations have asked tenants to declare the names of displaced sheltering with them. Some have refused to take in people from the south. The first strike hit the building's lower floors around 4 p.m. The Ramadan family were shocked but didn’t think the building was collapsing. Only Ramadan's wife, Jinan, ran for the stairs. A few moments passed, long enough for Ramadan’s son Achraf to bring his sister Julia a glass of water to calm her. Then the second missile hit. The building swayed, then collapsed. Ramadan fell off the couch, which along with a nearby cabinet protected him from the falling ceiling. Achraf, a fitness trainer and former soldier, took cover under a door frame. Julia fell to the floor. For what seemed like two hours, the three communicated through the rubble. Ramadan said Julia was only two meters (yards) away, her voice faint but audible. He called for help using his mobile phone still in his hands. When help came, Achraf got out first; then his father, about six hours after the strike. In the chaos, they thought Julia had been pulled out. But the rescuers returned to find the 28-year-old dead. Her mother died in the hospital from internal bleeding. 'I lost the cornerstone of the house: my wife, my partner and friend,' Ramadan said. 'I lost my daughter Julia ... She was my joy, my smile, the future.' They are buried in unmarked graves in a section of the Sidon cemetery dedicated to the Ain el Delb building victims. Like in Gaza, there is concern that the number of civilian casualties is 'quite high' given that the alleged military target is often unstated or relatively small, said Rich Weir, the senior conflict, crisis and arms researcher at Human Rights Watch. He said there has been an 'escalation in terms of the amount of damage ... the taking down of entire buildings in densely packed residential neighborhoods, which brings inherent risks to civilians.' Israel has also expanded the scope of its targets, hitting Hezbollah financial institutions, he said. Ramadan was not surprised at the killing of so many people for one possible Hezbollah member. It has happened before, he said. 'We hear in the news an apartment was targeted. And people wonder who it was,' he said. 'People don’t know. Israel knows.' ‘Worse than a coffin’ At the bottom of the building’s wreckage, Hecham al-Baba was trapped in pitch black darkness for four hours, squeezed with his legs bent under him. The falling door had broken two of his ribs. It was difficult to breathe. All he could think about was that he might lose his legs. 'There was no blood going to my legs,' he said. 'I couldn’t feel them. I couldn’t move. I tried to stay strong. I don’t want to remember. It upsets me.' Finally, he heard movement: people removing bricks, a bulldozer. He started screaming. His lungs and chest hurt. They called to him to shout louder. 'I told them I can’t.' Then through a hole, a beam of light flashed in the darkness. At the sight of him, a rescuer cried out, 'What a way to be stuck! It’s worse than a coffin.' It took another four hours before the rescuers pulled him out head-first through the floor beneath him, covered in dust and soot. The entire rescue operation took more than 43 hours. The Health Ministry put the death toll at 45, but the civil defense chief for Sidon, Mohamed Arkadan, said first responders pulled 73 bodies from the rubble. Five bodies remain unaccounted for, he said. Doctors told al-Baba his ribs will heal with time. But not his pain. He said he will wear black all his life to mourn his sister. Past conflicts never stopped him from returning to Lebanon to visit family. This time, it may be a while before he comes back. 'There will be no peace,' he said, thinking of his family tragedy and the wars in both Lebanon and Gaza. 'No one will bring me justice. No one.'	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-war-civilian-casualties-families-israel-airstrikes-963fceb3514518420b579a4a381ac286	2024-10-26T20:09:33-07:00	
Uruguay's elections buck the Latin American trend, offering voters a choice between 2 moderates	MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay (AP) — Voters in the small South American nation of Uruguay headed to the polls to choose a new president on Sunday in a race between two moderates that defies regional trends of bitter division and democratic erosion. The contest between Uruguay's incumbent conservative coalition and its challenger, a center-left alliance, got underway with some 2.7 million eligible voters also casting ballots for Parliament and a contentious referendum on overhauling the social security system. The pension vote — which would expand the fiscal deficit in one of Latin America’s wealthiest countries — has consumed more media attention in recent weeks than other top campaign issues, such as child poverty, education and security. With the candidates in broad agreement over many issues, no one expects the outcome of the presidential vote to herald drastic change in this nation of 3.4 million people, long considered a model democracy and bastion of stability in the region. 'In a way, Uruguay has been boring, but boring in this sense is very good,' said Juan Cruz Díaz, a political analyst who runs the Cefeidas consultancy group in Buenos Aires. 'We’ve seen so many dramatic changes in Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, Colombia and suddenly we face elections in Uruguay in which there is a general consensus, there’s stability.' While in neighboring Brazil and Argentina, voters recently vented their rage at the status quo, Uruguay's electorate remains largely satisfied with the government's business-friendly policies and the economy's steady growth. The current center-right president, Luis Lacalle Pou, enjoys a 50% approval rating. The presidential campaigns have played out without the vitriol or personal attacks seen elsewhere, such as the United States, Argentina or Brazil. As constitutional term limits bar Lacalle Pou from running for a second consecutive term, the governing party's candidate is Álvaro Delgado, 55, a congressman and Lacalle Pou's former chief of staff, who started his career as a veterinarian. 'This government leaves us with a very solid first level to continue building the future,' Delgado said at his closing campaign rally. His main challenger is Yamandú Orsi, 57, a center-left former mayor and history teacher with humble roots from the Frente Amplio (or Broad Front) coalition, which governed for 15 years before Lacalle Pou’s 2019 victory. From 2005-2020, Frente Amplio oversaw progressive laws, such as the legalization of same-sex marriage. Uruguay became the first country to legalize cannabis for recreational use and developed one of the world's greenest grids, powered by 98% renewable energy. The latest polls show Orsi in a comfortable lead at 44%, but not winning outright, which would send the country to a run-off on Nov. 24. Orsi has benefited from the support of popular former President José 'Pepe' Mujica, the eccentric former guerrilla who helped spearhead Uruguay's transformation into the continent's most socially liberal country during his 2010-2015 presidency. Now 89, Mujica is battling esophageal cancer, but he still managed to cast his ballot in Montevideo, the capital, on Sunday. Arriving to vote in a wheelchair, he was quickly swarmed by reporters. 'We need to support democracy, not because it is perfect, but because humans have not yet invented anything better,' he told journalists after exiting the polling station. Like Mujica, who lives in a modest farmhouse on the outskirts of Montevideo, Orsi says he wouldn't live in the presidential palace if elected. In a distant third is Andrés Ojeda, 40, a muscular and media-savvy lawyer who has tried to energize apathetic young voters with splashy campaign videos showing him lifting weights at the gym and describing himself as a classic Capricorn. 'I want to be the candidate who inspires and enthralls people,' he said at his campaign event Thursday. He told The Associated Press that his unconventional style draws inspiration from other charismatic 'leaders of the new politics' in Latin America wielding social media to amass fans, like El Salvador's populist Nayib Bukele and Argentina's radical libertarian Javier Milei. But he backs the ruling coalition and promises no radical change. The electoral contest has largely focused on the rise in homicides and robberies, with the governing coalition advocating a tough-on-crime approach and the liberal coalition vowing to increase the state's role in security matters. Voters are also concerned about the one in five Uruguayan children living in poverty and the low rate of high school graduations. But the overlap between the party platforms has left much of the Uruguayan electorate indifferent. 'It was a presidential campaign far removed from the people that did not achieve the levels of engagement that Uruguay historically has,' said Montevideo-based political analyst Julián Kanarek. Perhaps more pressing than the presidential race is the constitutional referendum that would overhaul Uruguay's social security system. If approved by more than 50% of voters, the $23 billion scheme backed by the country's powerful leftist unions would lower the retirement age, boost payouts and transfer Uruguayans' privately managed savings to a government-run trust. Both leading candidates have spoken out against the proposal, which has already sent tremors through global markets. Shrugging off the fiscal consequences, supporters say it would redistribute Uruguay’s resources more fairly. There is also a referendum on allowing nighttime police raids on homes. Uruguayans are not obliged to vote in the plebiscites, but voting in the congressional and presidential races is compulsory. ___ DeBre reported from Buenos Aires, Argentina	https://apnews.com/article/uruguay-election-politics-leftwing-president-rightwing-86984f87bb0607d9c061c293ec11fe71	2024-10-26T20:02:00-07:00	
Yamamoto shuts down Yankees, Freeman homers again as Dodgers win 4-2 for 2-0 World Series lead	LOS ANGELES (AP) — Yoshinobu Yamamoto walked back to his dugout and made the slightest tip of his cap to cheering fans. He left Japan for moments like this, an opportunity to put the Los Angeles Dodgers in control of the World Series. Yamamoto allowed one hit over 6 1/3 innings, Freddie Freeman homered for the second straight night and Los Angeles beat the New York Yankees 4-2 on Saturday for a 2-0 Series lead. But the Dodgers will head to New York uncertain whether Shohei Ohtani can play after their biggest star partially dislocated his left shoulder on a slide at second base. 'We’re going to get some tests at some point tonight, tomorrow, and then we’ll know more in the next couple days,' manager Dave Roberts said. 'The strength was great. The range of motion good. So we’re encouraged.' Tommy Edman and Teoscar Hernández also went deep off starter Carlos Rodón, who tied a Yankees World Series record by allowing three home runs. New York was held to one hit before the ninth, when the Yankees closed to 4-2 on Giancarlo Stanton's one-out RBI single against Blake Treinen. Anthony Volpe struck out with the bases loaded, and Alex Vesia came in to retire pinch-hitter Jose Trevino on a first-pitch flyout for his first postseason save. 'Thinking back to my front yard at my house, that’s what we would envision,' Vesia said. Game 3 is Monday night at Yankee Stadium. Forty-five of 56 teams holding 2-0 World Series leads have gone on to win the title. 'No one said it’s going to be easy,' Yankees manager Aaron Boone said. 'It’s a long series, and we need to make it a long series now. We won’t flinch.' Yankees star Aaron Judge went 0 for 4 with three strikeouts. He is 1 for 9 in the Series and is hitting .150 with six RBIs and 19 strikeouts in 40 postseason at-bats. 'Just expanding the zone. That’s really what it really comes down to,' Judge said. 'I think it's trying to make things happen instead of letting the game come to you. ... Plain and simple, I've got to start swinging at strikes.' Yamamoto turned down the Yankees last December and joined the Dodgers for a $325 million, 12-year contract, a record for pitchers, teaming with Ohtani to create record interest in Major League Baseball back in Japan. The rookie right-hander threw seven scoreless innings at Yankee Stadium on June 7 but was sidelined from June 15 to Sept. 10 because of a strained rotator cuff. This was his finest start since the injury. Yamamoto gave up Juan Soto's third-inning homer, then retired his last 11 batters. 'He was made for those moments,' Hernández said. 'He was doing it in Japan before he got here, and as soon as he got here, he was doing it here.' Yamamoto struck out four and walked two with a five-pitch array that included curveballs, splitters, sliders and cutters. He improved to 2-0 in four postseason starts. 'It was kind of a mixed feeling because I was very (much) looking forward to it and happy, but then after I felt that I started trying to focus,' Yamamoto said through a translator. Soto’s fourth postseason homer, on an inside fastball, was the only run Yamamoto permitted in two starts and 13 1/3 innings against the Yankees this year. Soto also singled off the right-field wall in the ninth and scored on Stanton's one-out base hit off the third-base bag. Jazz Chisholm Jr. singled and Anthony Rizzo was hit by a pitch for the second time in the game, loading the bases. But the rally ended there. 'This is everything to me, playing on the highest stage with literally the two biggest teams you can play for, biggest franchises, most history,' Vesia said. A night after Freeman hit the first walk-off grand slam in Series history to transform a 3-2 deficit with two outs in the 10th inning into a 6-3 win, Edman put the Dodgers ahead with a solo shot in the second. After Soto tied the score, Mookie Betts singled with two outs in the bottom half and Hernández, in a 3-for-27 slide, homered into the right-center pavilion. Freeman, who before Friday hadn’t gone deep since since Sept. 16, worked the count full and homered to right-center again. Playing on a sprained right ankle, Freeman has homered in four straight Series games dating to Atlanta’s last two games against Houston in 2021. That is one shy of the record held by Astros outfielder George Springer. Freeman had six days off entering the World Series. 'I was able to calm my ankle down,' he said. 'So hopefully with the flight tonight — I’ve been swelling a lot on flights — so, hopefully tomorrow we can get it down and get in a good spot for Game 3.' All three Dodgers homers came on fastballs from Rodón, whose 31 longballs allowed during the regular season tied for second-most in the major leagues. Los Angeles had back-to-back Series homers for just the second time, after Pedro Guerrero and Steve Yeager connected against Yankees lefty Ron Guidry for a 2-1 win in Game 5 in 1981. Rodón gave up four runs and six hits in 3 1/3 innings. He got just one swing and miss on his fastball. Los Angeles took a 2-0 Series lead for the first time since 1988, when Kirk Gibson’s walk-off homer against Oakland’s Dennis Eckersley won the opener and Orel Hershiser followed with a three-hit shutout. The Yankees are 0-2 for the first time since 2001, when they rebounded to win three straight at home and lost Games 6 and 7 at Arizona. Ohtani's MRI and a determination of his availability will be anxiously awaited by the Dodgers and their fans. 'Not only the dugout, but the whole stadium went silent,' Hernández said. 'Hopefully he’s OK and the day off tomorrow will help him get back on the field Monday.' UP NEXT Yankees RHP Clarke Schmidt and Dodgers RHP Walker Buehler start on Monday. Schmidt has a 3.86 ERA in a pair of postseason starts, no-decisions in Game 3s against Kansas City and Cleveland. Buehler also has started a pair of Game 3s, allowing six runs over five innings in a 6-5 loss to San Diego and pitching four innings in an 8-0 win at the New York Mets. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb	https://apnews.com/article/world-series-yankees-dodgers-game-2-score-yamamoto-d672c41e864884be79f2629a749363a6	2024-10-26T19:18:40-07:00	
Shohei Ohtani partially dislocates left shoulder during World Series Game 2, status TBD	LOS ANGELES (AP) — Dodgers superstar Shohei Ohtani partially dislocated his left shoulder during the seventh inning of Saturday's Game 2 of the World Series against the New York Yankees when he tried to steal second base. Ohtani's status for Monday's Game 3 in New York is unclear. Los Angeles manager Dave Roberts said Ohtani 'had a little left shoulder subluxation' and would get image testing either Saturday night or Sunday. Ohtani clutched his left forearm after being tagged by shortstop Anthony Volpe for the final out in the inning on a feetfirst slide. He laid near the bag for a couple minutes before being tended to by trainers and leaving the field. 'We’ll know more in the next couple days,' Roberts said. 'The strength was great. The range of motion good. So we’re encouraged. But obviously I can’t speculate because we don’t get the scans yet. So once we get the scans, we’ll know more. Again, with the strength, the range of motion good, that’s certainly a positive.' The Dodgers held on for a 4-2 victory and lead the Series 2-0. The Japanese slugger — and presumptive National League MVP — was 0 for 3 with a walk in the game. He is 1 for 8 in the first two games of the Fall Classic and is batting .260 with three home runs and 10 RBIs in his first postseason in the majors. 'That was tough. You never like seeing the best player in the game get injured like that,' Yankees superstar Aaron Judge said. 'Trying to steal a base like that there, and something like that happens. But hopefully it’s all good news. We’ll see what happens.' Ohtani had been one of the few players on the Dodgers roster who got through the season without a major injury. The pitching staff has been beset by injuries, with nearly every member of the starting rotation spending time on the injured list. Among the position players, Mookie Betts was out for nearly two months due to a broken left hand, and Max Muncy was out nearly half the season due to a right oblique strain. Freddie Freeman is playing in the postseason with a badly sprained right ankle. Betts is optimistic about the Dodgers persevering if Ohtani is sidelined, especially after the team overcame its injuries while earning the most wins in the majors during the regular season and reaching the World Series for the fourth time in eight seasons. 'We've got a great group of guys in here and I believe we can take care of business for sure. I believe in us all,' Betts said. Most of Ohtani's injuries since coming to the majors in 2018 have been pitching-related, including major operations on his right elbow in 2018 and last year. The two-way phenomenon has not pitched this year but became the first player in major league history with at least 50 homers and 50 stolen bases in a season. In September 2019, he had surgery on his left kneecap due to a rare condition. The procedure was on his bipartite patella, or a two-part kneecap that didn’t fuse together at birth. Ohtani missed the 2017 World Baseball Classic after having ankle surgery because of an injury he suffered during the 2016 Japan Series. 'When you have a group like this, they picked me up when I have been down. We’ll try to do the same for him,' Freeman said. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb	https://apnews.com/article/world-series-dodgers-yankees-ohtani-332dfab365b16f5f8ae607fcb5147a01	2024-10-26T18:51:05-07:00	
Indonesian forests pay the price for the growing global biomass energy demand	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — Enormous swathes of pristine forest are being cut down across Indonesia to supply the rapidly rising international demand for biomass material seen as critical to many countries' transitions to cleaner forms of energy. Nearly all of the biomass from forests destroyed for wood pellet production since 2021 has been shipped to South Korea and Japan, The Associated Press found in an examination of satellite images, company records and Indonesian export data. Both countries have provided millions of dollars to support the development of biomass production and use in Indonesia. Indonesia's state-run utility also has plans to dramatically increase the amount of biomass it burns to make electricity. Experts and environmentalists fear the rising international and domestic demand, coupled with weak domestic regulation, will accelerate deforestation at the same time it prolongs the use of highly polluting fossil fuels. Biomass is organic material like plants, wood and waste, and many coal-fired power plants can be easily modified to burn it alongside coal to make energy. 'Biomass production — which is only recently starting to be seen on an industrial scale in Indonesia — is a dire new threat to the country's forests,' said Timer Manurung, director of Auriga Nusantara, an environmental and conservation organization in Indonesia. As countries accelerate their energy transitions, demand for biomass is growing: The use of bioenergy has increased an average of about 3% per year between 2010 and 2022, the International Energy Agency said. Experts including the IEA say it's important for that demand to happen in a sustainable way, such as using waste and crop residue rather than converting forest land to grow bioenergy crops. Deforestation contributes to erosion, damages biodiverse areas, threatens wildlife and humans who rely on the forest and intensifies disasters from extreme weather. And many scientists and environmentalists have rejected the use of biomass altogether. They say burning wood-based biomass can emit more carbon than coal and tree-cutting greatly reduces forests' ability to remove carbon from the atmosphere. Critics also say that using biomass to co-fire, instead of transitioning directly to clean energy, simply prolongs the use of coal. In Indonesia, biomass production is causing deforestation across the archipelago. Auriga Nusantara reports that more than 9,740 hectares (24,070 acres) of forest have been cleared in areas where biomass production is permitted since 2020. Permits have been issued for over 1.4 million hectares (3,459,475 acres) of energy plantation forests in Indonesia, with over one-third of that land being undisturbed forest. Over half of these concession areas are the habitat of flagship species such as sumatran rhino, elephants, orangutans and tigers, said Manurung. In the carbon-rich forests of Gorontalo, Sulawesi, the felling, shredding and shipping of old trees to make energy-dense wood pellets has been streamlined. Over 3,000 hectares (7,410 acres) of forest have been razed in a concession owned by Banyan Tumbuh Lestari, from 2021 to 2024, according to satellite analysis shared with AP by international environmental organization Mighty Earth. An additional 2,850 hectares (7,040 acres) were cleared for logging roads. After trees are cut down, they're turned into wood pellets at a facility near the concessions owned by Biomasa Jaya Abadi, the largest exporter of wood pellets from Indonesia from 2021-2023, according to data Auriga Nusantara compiled from the Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry database. The database has no records of wood pellet exports prior to 2020. Biomasa Jaya Abadi did not respond to repeated requests for interviews or comment. Banyan Tumbuh Lestari do not have contact information publicly available; AP contacted their main shareholders seeking comment but got no response. Indonesia’s ministries of Environment and Forestry; Energy and Mineral Resources and Maritime Affairs and Investment did not respond to requests for comment. Nearly all of Indonesia's wood pellet production is shipped overseas to meet international demand, said Alloysius Joko Purwanto, an energy economist at the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia. Most of Indonesia's wood pellets went to South Korea (61%) and Japan (38%) from 2021-2023, according to government data. 'It's clear that Japan and South Korea's governments are trying to buy more biomass from Indonesia to lower their own domestic emissions,' said Bhima Yudhistira, executive director of the Indonesia-based Center of Economic and Law Studies. Both countries have provided millions of dollars of financial support toward the development of biomass in Indonesia through research, policy, construction and other support, according to a review of publicly available business and government agreements by AP. South Korea's Forest Service, which drives South Korea's biomass expansion and policy, did not reply to requests for comment. Japan's Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries also did not respond to a request for comment. The promotion of biomass production and use has coincided with the ramping-up of Indonesia's domestic biomass use. The country's state electricity company, Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN), plans to implement 10% biomass co-firing for 52 coal plants across the country. PLN estimates that would take 8 million tons of biomass a year — far greater than the wood pellet industry's capacity at the end of 2023 of less than 1 million tons, according to Indonesian civil society organization Trend Asia. To achieve PLN’s ambitions, a 66% increase in forest plantation land would be needed — 'which would likely come at the expense of intact, carbon-rich and carbon-absorbing forests,' according to a report by Mighty Earth. PLN spokesperson Gregorius Adi Trianto told AP that the company's plan relied on biomass from 'organic waste such as tree branches, rice waste, and wood industry waste ... rather than from actively logged forests.' With Indonesia lacking clear regulations and oversight of its expanding biomass industry, experts fear deforestation is likely to spike for years to come. 'We're already far behind when it comes to monitoring and regulating issues around biomass production in Indonesia,' said Yudhistira.

Japan's ruling party braces for a blow to its comfortable majority in the lower house in elections	TOKYO (AP) — Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba’ s conservative ruling party braced for a blow to its comfortable majority in the lower house of parliament in Sunday’s elections amid public rage over the party’s financial scandals and discontent over a stagnant economy. The results could weaken Ishiba's grip on power, possibly leading Japan into political uncertainty, though a change of government was not expected. Ishiba took office on Oct. 1, replacing his predecessor Fumio Kishida who resigned after failing to pacify the public over widespread slush fund practices among Liberal Democratic Party lawmakers. Ishiba immediately ordered a snap election in hopes of shoring up support by using his outspoken, reformist image. Voting began Sunday morning across Japan, where 1,344 candidates, including a record 314 women, are running for office. Polls close at 8 p.m., with early results expected within hours. Ishiba has set a goal of retaining 233 seats for the ruling coalition between the LDP and its Buddhist-backed junior partner Komeito, a majority in the 465-member lower house, the more powerful of Japan’s two-chamber parliament. Ishiba, in his final speeches Saturday in Tokyo, apologized over his party’s mishandling of funds and pledged 'to restart as an equal, fair, humble and honest party.' He said only the LDP’s ruling coalition can responsibly run Japan with its experience and dependable policies. Once a popular politician known for his criticism of even his own party's policies, Ishiba has also seen support for his weeks-old Cabinet plunge. The biggest opposition party, the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, is led by centrist leader Yoshihiko Noda who briefly served as prime minister during the LDP’s 2009-2012 descent from power. Noda's party is expected to make significant gains. Noda says Sunday’s election is a rare chance for a change of government, which will be the most effective political reform, though his party has trouble finding other opposition groups with which to cooperate. At a downtown Tokyo polling station early Sunday, a number of voters said they considered the corruption scandal and economic measures. A 77-year-old man said his biggest concern was rising prices and wondered if the LDP should win despite the wrongdoings. Another resident in her 60s said she would vote in hope of making a change. Analysts suggest Ishiba could fall short of reaching his target, though his LDP was expected to remain the top party in Japan’s parliament as voters are skeptical about the opposition's ability and inexperience. Losing a majority would mean Ishiba would have difficulty establishing policies and could face calls from within his party for a replacement ahead of next summer’s election in the upper house, experts say. 'The public’s criticisms against the slush funds scandal has intensified, and it won’t go away easily,' said Izuru Makihara, a University of Tokyo professor of politics and public policy. 'There is a growing sense of fairness and people are rejecting privileges for politicians.' Makihara suggested Ishiba needs bold political reform measures to regain public trust. Ishiba pledged to revitalize the rural economy, address Japan’s falling birth rate and bolster defense. But his Cabinet has old faces, only two women and was seen as alienating members of the scandal-tainted faction led by late premier Shinzo Abe. Ishiba quickly retreated from earlier support for a dual surname option for married couples and legalizing same-sex marriage, an apparent compromise to the party’s influential ultra-conservatives. His popularity fell because of 'the gap in what the public expected him to be as prime minister versus the reality of what he brought as prime minister,' said Rintaro Nishimura, a political analyst at The Asia Group. The LDP is also being tested Sunday for its ability to break from the legacy of Abe, whose policies focused on security, trade and industry but largely ignored equality and diversity, and its nearly eight-year long rule led to the corruption, experts say. There could be regrouping attempts among opposition parties to decide whether to cooperate among themselves or join the ruling coalition, political watchers say. Potential new partners for the LDP include the Democratic Party of the People, a breakaway group from the CPDJ, which calls for lower taxes, and a conservative Japan Innovation Party, though both are currently denying a possible coalition with the LDP. The LDP, whose dissolution of most factions that used to help bring together support for pushing through on elections and on policy, is less cohesive and could enter the era of short-lived prime ministers. Ishiba is expected to last at least until the ruling bloc approves key budget plans at the end of December. ___ AP video journalist Mayuko Ono contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-ishiba-parliament-election-ldp-opposition-5c6509c7b83963ffe40588c50998967c	2024-10-26T15:12:09-07:00

Supporters of far-right British figure rally as anti-racism demonstrators mount counter-protest	LONDON (AP) — Thousands of supporters of jailed far-right activist Tommy Robinson marched through London on Saturday as anti-racism demonstrators mounted a nearby counter-protest. The so-called Unite the Kingdom march — planned by Robinson and supposed to feature him as speaker — led to calls for his freedom after his arrest Friday on a warrant for contempt of court. 'We want Tommy out,' the crowd of mostly white men chanted. The sea of marchers toted Union and England flags and some waved 'Make America Great' banners as they gathered near a fenced-off statute of former Prime Minister Winston Churchill in the square opposite the Houses of Parliament. The march was countered by thousands of people organized by the group Stand Up to Racism who held signs saying 'Refugees welcome' and 'Oppose Tommy Robinson.' Robinson, 41, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, is the founder of the nationalist and anti-Islamist English Defense League and remains one of the most influential far-right figures in Britain. He has been blamed for stirring up protests that turned into a week of violent disorder across England and Belfast, Northern Ireland this summer after social media users falsely identified the suspect in a stabbing rampage that killed three young girls in the seaside community of Southport as an immigrant and a Muslim. Robinson supporters railed against the jailing of hundreds of rioters who assaulted police officers, set cars ablaze, screamed racist epithets and attacked hotels housing asylum seekers. Some participants wore 'I am Peter Lynch' badges and one man held a fishing pole with a sign reading 'Peter Lynch RIP patriot.' They were referring to a 61-year-old man who died in prison after pleading guilty for his role as part of an angry mob that smashed windows at a hotel in the northern town of Rotherham housing migrants and injured dozens of riot police. A separate march of several hundred family members, friends and supporters of those who have died in police custody also took place. Some of those activists seemed to echo the anti-racism marchers by holding signs that said 'No to hatred, no to fascism.' At least five people were arrested at the main rallies, the Metropolitan Police said. Two were arrested on suspicion of assault, including one allegedly on a police officer, at the anti-racism march. One person was arrested at the Unite the Kingdom march for a public order offense and another on suspicion of a racially aggravated public order offense. A fifth person was arrested for allegedly directing a racist remark at an officer, but the Met hadn't confirmed which protest the person attended. Robinson, who has been jailed in the past for assault, contempt of court and mortgage fraud, faces a hearing Monday in a contempt-of-court proceeding for allegedly violating a 2021 High Court order barring him from repeating libelous allegations against a Syrian refugee who successfully sued him. While Robinson was banned from Twitter in 2018, he was allowed back after Elon Musk took over the social network and rebranded it X. He now has 1 million followers.	https://apnews.com/article/farright-rally-london-tommy-robinson-counterprotest-537a682347e1286e05aa49cdcfdcf2b3	2024-10-26T10:20:43-07:00	
Foreign threats to the US election are on the rise, and officials are moving faster to expose them	WASHINGTON (AP) — A presidential candidate's phone is hacked. A fake video falsely shows ballots burned in Pennsylvania. National security officials warn that U.S. adversaries may incite violent protests after Election Day. These developments — all revealed in the past week — show how Russia, China and Iran have increased the pace of efforts to meddle in American politics ahead of next month's election, just as intelligence officials and security analysts had predicted. At the same time, officials, tech companies and private researchers have adopted a more aggressive defense by swiftly exposing foreign election threats, highlighting the lessons learned from past election cycles that revealed America's vulnerability to disinformation and cyberespionage. Officials say the U.S. election system is so secure that no foreign nation could alter the results at a scale necessary to change the outcome. Nevertheless, authoritarian adversaries have leveraged disinformation and cyberespionage to target campaigns and voters while stoking distrust and discord. Here's what to know as the presidential election approaches: Russia is the top threat Russia is the most active and sophisticated nation working to manipulate the U.S. election, using fake websites, state-controlled media and unwitting Americans to spread misleading and polarizing content aimed at undermining confidence in elections. The Kremlin's disinformation apparatus seizes on contentious issues like immigration, crime, the economy or disaster relief. The goal is to weaken the U.S., erode support for Ukraine as it fights off Russian invaders and reduce America's ability to counter Russia's growing ties to China, North Korea and Iran, officials have said. Intelligence officials and private security analysts have determined that Russia supports former President Donald Trump, and is using disinformation — sometimes AI-generated — to smear his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, suggested cutting funds to Ukraine and repeatedly criticized the NATO military alliance. In one particularly audacious campaign, Russia staged a video that falsely accused Harris of paralyzing a woman in a car crash years ago. Another video made fictitious allegations against Harris' running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. On Friday, the FBI confirmed Moscow's role in creating a third video supposedly showing the destruction of mail ballots in Pennsylvania. Local election officials quickly debunked the video as false. Russia also has tried to pay American influencers who spread the Kremlin’s preferred narratives. Last month, U.S. authorities accused two Russian state media employees of funneling $10 million to a Tennessee company to create pro-Russian content. The company then paid several popular right-wing influencers, who have said they had no idea their work was being supported by Russia. Moscow’s campaign won’t end on Election Day. Instead, intelligence officials and private security analysts predict Russia will exploit claims of election irregularities to suggest the results can’t be trusted. A recently declassified intelligence memo said Russia may also encourage violent protests after the election. 'Putin’s aim is to foment chaos, division and polarization in our society,' said Michael McFaul, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia who now teaches at Stanford University. Russia has rejected claims that it seeks to influence the U.S. election. A message left with Russia's embassy in Washington was not immediately returned Saturday. Iranian hack-and-leak operations Iran has been a particularly brazen player in foreign interference this year. It's accused of hacking Trump campaign associates and offering the stolen communications to media organizations and Democrats in hopes that damaging stories would emerge that could hurt the Republican's prospects. Emails dangling dirt were sent to people associated with President Joe Biden’s campaign, but there’s no indication anyone replied, officials have said. The Justice Department last month charged three Iranian hackers who remain at large, accusing them of a yearslong operation targeting a vast array of victims. U.S. officials have described the hacking as part of a broader effort to interfere in an election that Iran perceives as particularly consequential. Iran, they say, has made clear its opposition to the Trump campaign. His administration ended a nuclear deal with Iran, reimposed sanctions and ordered the killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, an act prompting Iran's leaders to vow revenge. In addition to the cyberoperations, U.S. officials have repeatedly expressed concern about the potential for Iran to carry out violence on U.S. soil against Trump or other members of his administration. Officials in 2022 brought charges in a foiled Iranian plot to kill Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, and this year charged a Pakistani man with ties to Iran in a plot to carry out political assassinations in the U.S., including potentially of Trump. Leaders in Tehran also may try to encourage violent protests after the election, according to the declassified intelligence memo. Authorities say Iran also covertly funded and supported protests in the U.S. over Israel's war in Gaza. Iranian authorities have dismissed allegations that the country is seeking to influence the election. Iran's mission to the United Nations released a statement this week saying, 'Iran neither has any motive nor intent to interfere in the U.S. election.' A neutral China? U.S. intelligence officials believe China is taking a more neutral stance in the election and is focused on down-ballot races, targeting candidates from both parties based on their positions on issues of key importance to Beijing, including support for Taiwan. But the Chinese government has for years operated a sophisticated hacking operation targeting all manners of Western life and industry that goes well beyond election influence. 'From city council to president, they want access,' said Adam Darrah, a former CIA political analyst who is now vice president of intelligence at the cybersecurity firm ZeroFox, which tracks foreign online threats. On Friday, news broke that Chinese hackers as part of a much broader espionage effort had targeted cellphones used by Trump, his running mate JD Vance and people associated with Harris' campaign. It was not immediately clear what data, if any, had been accessed. A spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington said they were unfamiliar with the details and couldn't comment but contended that China is routinely victimized by cyberattacks and opposes the activity. Are these tactics new? Hardly. Foreign adversaries, including the same ones blamed for meddling now, have sought to interfere in the last several election cycles — with varying degrees of success. But the U.S. government, blamed for sitting on information about the scope of Russian interference in the 2016 election, has worked this year to aggressively call out foreign threats as part of an effort to reduce their impact and assure Americans that the election is secure. In 2016, Russian military intelligence officers hacked into the email accounts of Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman and the Democratic Party and released tens of thousands of communications in an effort to boost Trump's successful presidential campaign. Russia also engaged that year in a huge but hidden social media trolling campaign aimed at sowing discord on hot-button social issues, creating division in the American electoral process and harming Clinton's bid for president. The antics continued in the 2020 election cycle when a Ukrainian lawmaker described at the time by U.S. officials as an 'active Russian agent ' released audio recordings of Democrat Joe Biden, who was then running for president. That same year, Iranian hackers were blamed for emails purported to come from the far-right group The Proud Boys that officials said were designed to harm Trump's candidacy.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-harris-russia-iran-china-disinformation-election-6f4cb99be3facb08c58cecd11b2c5d41	2024-10-26T09:56:41-07:00	
Tens of thousands of demonstrators march across Italy calling for an end to war worldwide	ROME (AP) — Tens of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets in seven Italian cities on Saturday calling for an immediate cease-fire in the Middle East, Ukraine and all global conflicts. Peaceful rallies were held in Rome, Turin, Milan, Florence, Bari, Palermo and Cagliari, with the support of hundreds of associations committed to peace, disarmament and human rights. The marches came in response to escalating violence in the Middle East and growing conflicts worldwide and denounced the diminished role of the United Nations on the global scene. In Rome, a few thousand demonstrators marched waving a giant rainbow flag in front of the Colosseum and a banner with the slogan: 'Let’s stop wars. The time for peace is now!' 'The war in Ukraine has been going on for years now and what was the result? Nothing. … There are only a lot of Ukrainian and Russian people who died, many soldiers and many children,' said Daniela Ferraci, a demonstrator in the Italian capital. 'The same is happening in Gaza, in Israel, in Lebanon.' Giulio Marcon, one of the organizers of the Rome rally, said 'wars are never resolving problems.' 'War brings more war, weapons bring more weapons. We must choose the path of negotiation, cease-fire and diplomacy. This is the message from this square,' he said. Maurizio Landini, leader of Italy's CGIL trade union, called for the role of international diplomacy to be reaffirmed. 'Our strongest request is a ceasefire to let governments open a real peace conference, because the new world’s balance can’t be decided by wars,' he said on stage.	https://apnews.com/article/italy-peace-rallies-wars-mideast-ukraine-un-b3f127bcff3d1cb3065590fd06e01e4e	2024-10-26T07:48:22-07:00	
Catholic church reform process expected to disappoint hopes of more equity for women	VATICAN CITY (AP) — A yearslong process to reform the Catholic Church closes Saturday with recommendations that are expected to fall far short of hopes that women would be given more equity but that reflect the pope’s aims for a church that at least listens more to its flock. The Vatican’s top doctrinal officer, Cardinal Victor Manuel Fernandez, told the extraordinary assembly of bishops and laypeople this week that Pope Francis said the moment for allowing ordination of women as deacons in the church 'is not ripe.' The multi-year synod process had sparked great hopes for change, especially for women, who have long complained that they are treated as second-class citizens in the church. Women are barred from the priesthood and the highest ministerial positions in the Catholic Church, yet do the lion’s share of the work running Catholic hospitals and schools and passing the faith onto future generations. Speaking to the synod on Thursday, Fernandez explained that a special working group would continue beyond the closing of the meeting, but that its focus would be on discussing the role of women in the church — not in the diaconate. He added that while working with women in previous pastoral roles, 'most did not ask for or want the diaconate, which would be cumbersome for their lay work.' He did not respond directly to a request to define what would determine 'ripeness' for a greater role for women. The outcome is shaping up to be a disappointment for Catholics who have been campaigning for recognition that women share a spiritual calling that is no different than a man’s. They also noted that despite the inclusion of women in the synodal process, the working group that is guiding discussions on women’s role is being run by the Roman curia, operating outside the synod. 'I think it is very clear that ordained men get to decide when the time is right, and they get to decide what baptismal equality amounts to. It is very frustrating, but they laid it all out,’’ said Kate McElwee, the executive director of the Women’s Ordination Conference. The first phase of the synod process ended last year by concluding it was 'urgent' to guarantee fuller participation by women in church governance positions, and calling for theological and pastoral research to continue about allowing women to be deacons. Deacons perform many of the same functions as priests, such as presiding over baptisms, weddings and funerals, but they cannot celebrate Mass. If before the synod the idea of allowing women to be deacons was a fringe proposal pushed by Western progressives, the idea gained attention during the debate. It became something of a litmus test of how far the church was going to go, or not, to address demands of women for greater equality and representation in the highest ranks of the church. Francis, though, had other ideas, insisting that ordaining women would just 'clericalize' them and that there were plenty of other ways to empower women in the church, even leading Catholic communities, without resorting to ordination. Advocates say allowing women to be deacons would help offset the shortage of Catholic priests and address longstanding complaints about their second-class status. Opponents say ordaining women to the deaconate would signal the start of a slippery slope toward ordaining women to the priesthood. The Catholic Church reserves the priesthood for men. Francis has repeatedly reaffirmed the all-male priesthood and has sharply criticized 'obtuse' agitators pressing for a female diaconate.	https://apnews.com/article/vatican-reforms-women-equity-ordination-synod-francis-5cdd62a4d191b77ec71b30440c59e75e	2024-10-26T05:58:12-07:00	
EU leader denounces Russia's 'hybrid war' aiming to destabilize Western Balkan democracies	PRISTINA, Kosovo (AP) — European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Saturday denounced Russia's hybrid attacks against democracies, saying the European Union is fighting daily to debunk misinformation. Von der Leyen was in Kosovo as part of a trip this week to aspiring EU member states in the Western Balkans to assure them that EU enlargement remains a priority for the 27-nation bloc. Von der Leyen denounced Russia's efforts 'to destabilize these democracies,' adding that Brussels works to unveil propaganda 'to the benefit of a whole region.' 'It is possible for us to stand up with the truth and with transparency and with very clear messaging. So here we are really countering a hybrid attack that Russia is leading against democracies,' she said at a news conference in the capital, Pristina. Von der Leyen came to Kosovo from neighboring Serbia, which has close ties to Russia and has refused to join international sanctions on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine. She did not mention the 13-year old EU-led dialogue to normalize ties between Serbia and its former province, Kosovo, instead focusing on the bloc's efforts to promote the region's economy. Kosovo-Serbia ties remain tense, even 25 years after NATO’s 78-day bombing campaign in 1999 that ended a war between Serbian government forces and ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo, which left about 13,000 people dead, mainly ethnic Albanians. Kosovo proclaimed independence in 2008, which Belgrade has not recognized. Last year EU officials offered a 6-billion-euro (about $6.5 billion) growth plan to the Western Balkan countries in an effort to double the region’s economy over the next decade and accelerate their efforts to join the bloc. That aid is contingent on reforms that would bring their economies in line with EU rules. The Western Balkan countries — Albania, Bosnia, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia — are at different stages in their applications for EU membership. The countries have been frustrated by the slow pace of the process, but Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has propelled European leaders to push the six to join the bloc. The Commission on Wednesday approved the reform agendas of Albania, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia following a green light from EU member states. That was a key step to allow payments under the growth plan upon completion of agreed reform steps. Von der Leyen's trip concludes with a visit to Montenegro.	https://apnews.com/article/european-commission-von-der-leyen-balkans-kosovo-russia-04edfec4d473d88620793c5b9f9d6ed3	2024-10-26T04:29:28-07:00	
At least 126 dead and missing in massive flooding and landslides in Philippines	TALISAY, Philippines (AP) — The number of dead and missing in massive flooding and landslides wrought by Tropical Storm Trami in the Philippines has reached nearly 130 and the president said Saturday that many areas remained isolated with people in need of rescue. Trami blew away from the northwestern Philippines on Friday, leaving at least 85 people dead and 41 others missing in in one of the Southeast Asian archipelago’s deadliest and most destructive storms so far this year, the government’s disaster-response agency said. The death toll was expected to rise as reports come in from previously isolated areas. Dozens of police, firefighters and other emergency personnel, backed by three backhoes and sniffer dogs, dug up one of the last two missing villagers in the lakeside town of Talisay in Batangas province Saturday. A father, who was waiting for word on his missing 14-year-old daughter, wept as rescuers placed the remains in a black body bag. Distraught, he followed police officers, who carried the body bag down a mud-strewn village alley to a police van when one weeping resident approaching him to express her sympathies. The man said he was sure it was his daughter, but authorities needed to do checks to confirm the identity of the villager dug up in the mound. In a nearby basketball gym at the town center, more than a dozen white coffins were laid side by side, bearing the remains of those found in the heaps of mud, boulders and trees that cascaded Thursday afternoon down the steep slope of a wooded ridge in Talisay's Sampaloc village. President Ferdinand Marcos, who inspected another hard-hit region southeast of Manila Saturday, said the unusually large volume of rainfall dumped by the storm — including in some areas that saw one to two months’ worth of rainfall in just 24 hours — overwhelmed flood controls in provinces lashed by Trami. 'The water was just too much,' Marcos told reporters. 'We’re not done yet with our rescue work,' he said. 'Our problem here, there are still many areas that remained flooded and could not be accessed even big trucks.' His administration, Marcos said, would plan to start work on a major flood control project that can meet the unprecedented threats posed by climate change. More than 5 million people were in the path of the storm, including nearly half a million who mostly fled to more than 6,300 emergency shelters in several provinces, the government agency said. In an emergency Cabinet meeting, Marcos raised concerns over reports by government forecasters that the storm — the 11th to hit the Philippines this year — could make a U-turn next week as it is pushed back by high-pressure winds in the South China Sea. The storm was forecast to batter Vietnam over the weekend if it would not veer off course. The Philippine government shut down schools and government offices for the third day on Friday to keep millions of people safe on the main northern island of Luzon. Inter-island ferry services were also suspended, stranding thousands. Weather has cleared in many areas on Saturday, allowing cleanup work in most areas. Each year, about 20 storms and typhoons batter the Philippines, a Southeast Asian archipelago which lies between the Pacific Ocean and the South China Sea. In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest recorded tropical cyclones, left more than 7,300 people dead or missing and flattened entire villages.	https://apnews.com/article/tropical-storm-trami-philippines-vietnam-ee57cf85bc41683260f416f38ed3de30	2024-10-26T03:47:07-07:00	
Five things to know about Israel's attack on Iran	JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel delivered its long-expected response to Iranian missile attacks early Saturday by carrying out a series of airstrikes against the Islamic Republic. Here's what to know: Multiple targets were struck Under the cover of darkness early Saturday, Israel struck multiple sites in different parts of Iran. Explosions were heard in the capital, Tehran, which sits deep inside the country. The Israeli military said its 'precise and targeted strikes' hit missile air defense systems and 'aerial capabilities' as well as missile manufacturing facilities used to produce weapons that have been used against Israel. Iran insisted the strikes caused only 'limited damage.' It was not immediately clear how hard of a blow Israel dealt, with neither country providing detailed assessments of the destruction. Iran said the strikes targeted military bases in the provinces of Ilam, Khuzestan and Tehran. Israel appeared confident in its battering of Iran's air defenses, with military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari saying that 'Israel now has broader aerial freedom of operation in Iran.' What wasn't hit also matters The strikes did not appear to target facilities that would all but ensure a harsh Iranian response. Those most notably include Iran's oil infrastructure, the backbone of the OPEC member's economy, and its nuclear facilities. President Biden earlier this month said he would not support an Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear sites. U.S. officials felt they had secured agreement from Israel not to hit nuclear or oil sites after dispatching another air-defense missile battery and associated troops, though those assurances were not set in stone. This attack has finished Israel signaled that the pre-dawn bombardment was the end of this attack. 'The retaliatory strike has been completed, and its objectives have been achieved,' Hagari said early Saturday, still the Sabbath in Israel. Not long after, Iran’s Civil Aviation Organization said commercial flights would resume after being halted because of the airstrikes. Tehran's shops were open and streets were calm, though lines grew at gas stations as residents stocked up on fuel. The Israeli attacks aimed to deter future aggression and 'show we won’t be silent,' but to do so in a way that would minimize the embarrassment for Iran, said Yoel Guzansky, a researcher at the Tel Aviv-based Institute for National Security Studies. Outrage and calls for restraint The White House indicated that it wants the strikes to end the direct exchanges of fire between Israel and Iran, and warned Iran against responding. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said there was a 'need to avoid further regional escalation' and called on all sides to show restraint. Reactions in the region were tougher. Saudi Arabia, Iran's main Arab rival, condemned the strike, calling it a threat to regional security and 'a violation of international laws and norms.' Turkey accused Israel of having 'brought our region to the brink of a greater war' and said 'putting an end to the terror created by Israel in the region has become a historic duty.' Syria and Iraq were among other countries in the region condemning the strikes. So did Hamas, which along with other militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking some 250 hostages into Gaza. Israel's retaliatory offensive in the Gaza Strip has so far killed more than 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, who don’t differentiate between civilians and combatants but say women and children make up for more than half the deaths. Iran's response will be key The Iranian Foreign Ministry said Iran would respond to the airstrikes, calling them a clear violation of international law as it asserted Tehran's right to self-defense. Israel characterized Saturday's attack as a response to previous aerial assaults by Iran using missiles and exploding drones in April and another missile attack this month. Many of those projectiles were shot down before reaching their targets. Iran could attempt another direct bombardment, though doing so risks provoking yet another direct Israeli attack on its territory at a moment when its defenses are weakened. It could also encourage allied militant groups such as Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon to intensify their attacks, though both have suffered serious blows in their ongoing wars with Israel. 'Iran will play down the impact of the strikes, which are in fact quite serious,' predicted Sanam Vakil, the director of the Middle East and North Africa program at the London-based think tank Chatham House. She said Iran is 'boxed in by their own military limitations, economic constraints from sanctions and by the U.S. election outcome,' which could affect the course of further escalation or diplomatic outreach.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-attack-israel-strikes-mideast-war-tehran-35a2b1474e5feedbb200c3aaa557fe60	2024-10-26T03:29:46-07:00	
Attack on a police convoy in a restive southeastern province of Iran kills 10 officers	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — An attack on an Iranian police convoy Saturday in the country's restive southern province of Sistan and Baluchestan killed at least 10 officers, authorities said. Details remain scarce over the attack in Gohar Kuh, some 1,200 kilometers (745 miles) southeast of the Iranian capital, Tehran. Initially, reports simply described an attack by 'miscreants' without more information. But shortly after, Iranian state media said 10 officers had been killed. HalVash, an advocacy group for the Baluch people of Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan, posted photos and video of what appeared to be a disabled truck painted with the green stripe used by Iranian police vehicles. One graphic photo shared by the group showed what appeared to be the corpses of two police officers in the front seat of the truck. HalVash said the attack appeared to target two security force vehicles and all those riding in them were killed. The truck appeared to have only damage from bullets, rather than any explosive being used. The state-run IRNA news agency said that Eskandar Momeni, the country's interior minister, ordered an investigation into the incident that it described as causing the 'martyrdom of a number of police.' Authorities identified no immediate suspects for the attack, nor did any group claim responsibility. The assault came after Israel launched a major attack across Iran early Saturday morning. The Baluch regions across the three nations have faced a low-level insurgency by Baluch nationalists for more than two decades. Verifying information remains difficult in Iran's Sistan and Baluchistan, which for decades has been home to violence involving heroin traffickers. The province is one of the least developed parts of Iran. Relations between the predominantly Sunni Muslim residents of the region and Iran’s Shiite theocracy have long been strained. Typical attacks involve hit-and-run assaults by militants in the region, like the Sunni militant group Jaish al-Adl, that kill a few security officials at a time. However, there have been mass casualty attacks by militants in the past. In April, gunmen wearing explosive vests attacks several sites in the province, killing 10 before security forces gunned down 18 militants. Last December, another assault killed 11 and wounded eight others. Meanwhile, the Taliban said they are investigating reports that Afghan migrants had been killed by Iranian security forces in the region earlier in October, an incident that threatened to further strain relations between the nations. ___ Associated Press writer Amir Vahdat in Tehran, Iran, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-police-shooting-sistan-baluchestan-province-8e1ea2c0c73606ffd189eb97efaaf05d	2024-10-26T02:24:47-07:00	
US approves $2 billion in arms sales to Taiwan including advanced missile defense system	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — The United States has approved $2 billion in arms sales to Taiwan, including the first-time delivery to the self-ruled island of an advanced surface-to-air missile defense system, in a move sure to anger China. Taiwan’s presidential office on Saturday thanked Washington for greenlighting the potential arms sales. Under the island's new president, Lai Ching-te, Taiwan has been stepping up defense measures as China increased its military threats against the territory it claims as its own. Beijing last week held war games encircling Taiwan for the second time since Lai took office in May. The U.S. is Taiwan’s strongest unofficial ally and its laws bound it to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself. 'Strengthening Taiwan’s self-defense capabilities is the foundation for maintaining regional stability,' Taiwan's presidential spokesperson Karen Kuo said. The potential sales package includes three National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMS) and related equipment valued at up to $1.16 billion, according to the U.S. State Department’s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs. It also includes radar systems worth an estimated $828 million. The Chinese government did not immediately comment on the potential arms sales. The NASAMS system has been battle-tested in Ukraine and will help to strengthen the Taiwanese army’s air defense capabilities, Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said. China’s war games last week were aimed at practicing the 'sealing off of key ports and key areas' around Taiwan, according to Chinese officials. Taiwan counted a record one-day total of 153 aircraft, 14 navy vessels and 12 Chinese government ships.	https://apnews.com/article/us-taiwan-china-arms-sale-missile-defense-bd14986ada9cfc894c5b1168aea27d02	2024-10-26T02:23:44-07:00	
The Menendez brothers built a green space in prison. It’s modeled on this Norwegian idea	COPENHAGEN (AP) — Nearly 30 years after they killed their parents, Erik and Lyle Menendez launched a beautification project in the California prison where they're serving life sentences. Their project was inspired by the Norwegian approach to incarceration that believes rehabilitation in humane prisons surrounded by nature leads to successful reintegration into society, even for those who have committed terrible crimes. Norway is a long, narrow country in northern Europe, running 1,100 miles (1,750 kilometers) from north to south. It has set up small prisons across the country, which allows people to serve their sentences close to home, said Kristian Mjåland, a Norwegian associate professor of sociology at the University of Agder in Kristiansand. The entire country has about 3,000 people in prison, he said, putting Norway’s per-capita incarceration rate at roughly one-tenth that of the United States. Norway has some of the world’s lowest levels of recidivism. Government statistics give the proportion of people reconvicted within two years of release in 2020 as 16%, with the figure falling each year. Meanwhile, a U.S. Department of Justice survey carried out over a decade found that 66% of people released from state prisons in 24 states were rearrested within three years, and most of those were incarcerated again. Mjåland said Norway's incarceration system is based on the principles that people should be 'treated decently by well-trained and decent staff' and have 'opportunities for meaningful activities during the day' — something he called the 'principle of normality' — and that they should retain their basic rights. Mjåland, whose research has focused on punishments and prisons, said that, for instance, prisoners in Norway retain the right to vote and access services such as libraries, health care and education delivered by the same providers working in the wider community. Norway also operates open prisons, some on islands where there is a lot of farm work and contact with nature. The most famous is on the island of Bastoey, 'which is very beautifully located in the Oslo Fjord,' Mjåland said. Even Anders Behring Breivik — who killed eight people in the 2011 bombing of a government building in Oslo, then gunned down 69 more at a holiday camp for left-leaning youth activists — has a dining room, fitness room and TV room with an Xbox. His cell wall is decorated with a poster of the Eiffel Tower and parakeets share his space. The idea of creating normal, humane conditions for people in prison is starting to spread in the U.S. as well. The Pennsylvania Department of Corrections, for instance, has in recent years been trying to apply certain elements of the Nordic approach, and unveiled a program it calls 'Little Scandinavia' in a prison in Chester in 2022. The Menendez brothers’ case was again in the public spotlight Thursday when the Los Angeles County district attorney recommended that their life-without-parole sentences be thrown out. Prosecutors hope a judge will resentence them so they can be eligible for parole. If the judge agrees, a parole board must then approve their release. The final decision rests with the California governor. Their lawyer and the LA district attorney argued that they have served enough time, citing evidence that they suffered physical and sexual abuse at the hands of their entertainment executive father. They also say that the brothers, now in their 50s, are model prisoners who have committed themselves to rehabilitation and redemption. Both point to the brothers' years of efforts to improve the San Diego prison where they have lived for six years. Before that, the two had been held in separate prisons since 1996. In 2018, Lyle Menendez launched the beautification program, Green Space, at the Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility. His brother, Erik Menendez, is the lead painter for a massive mural that depicts San Diego landmarks. 'This project hopes to normalize the environment inside the prison to reflect the living environment outside the prison,' Pedro Calderón Michel, deputy press secretary for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, told the AP in an email Friday. The Menendez brothers' work is ongoing, with the ultimate goal of transforming the prison yard 'from an oppressive concrete and gravel slab into a normalized park-like campus setting surrounded by a majestic landscape mural,' according to the project's website. The final product will include outdoor classrooms, rehabilitation group meeting spaces and training areas for service dogs. The prison system recently launched the 'California Model' in the hopes of bringing similar projects across the state to build 'safer communities through rehabilitation, education and reentry,' Calderón Michel wrote. The brothers' lawyer, Mark Geragos, said he believes Lyle Menendez learned about the Norwegian model during his university classes. Lyle Menendez is currently enrolled in a master's program where he's studied urban planning and recidivism, and Geragos said his client hopes the beautification will make reintroduction into society easier for people who are paroled. 'When you’re there in a gray space that is not very welcoming, it’s disorienting to some degree,' Geragos told The Associated Press on Friday. 'And also you have the issue that the terrain is not something that’s welcoming or helpful in terms of being acclimated and being re-acclimated into a community.' Dominique Moran, a professor at the University of Birmingham in the U.K. said she found in her research that introducing green spaces in prisons improves the wellbeing of prisoners as well as correctional staff. 'Green spaces in prisons reduce self-harm and violence, and also reduces staff sickness,' said Moran, author of 'Carceral Geography: Spaces and Practices of Incarceration.' Moran has studied prisons around the world, and said in an emailed statement that in the Scandinavian approach, 'people go to prison AS punishment, not FOR further punishment.' 'The deprivation of liberty is itself the punishment,' she said. 'There should not be further punishment through the nature of the environment in which people are held.' ___ Gera reported from Warsaw, Poland, and Dazio from Los Angeles.

A suicide attack kills 4 security personnel in northwest Pakistan	PESHWAR, Pakistan (AP) — A suicide attack at a checkpoint killed four Pakistani security personnel and injured five in the country’s northwest on Saturday, police said. The car bombing took place in the Mir Ali area of ​​North Waziristan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, police officer Amjad Khanand said, adding that the injured were in critical condition. There was no immediate claim of responsibility but suspicion is likely to fall on the Pakistani Taliban, who operate out of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and target security personnel. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi condemned the attack and expressed his condolences to the families of the victims. In a separate incident, a remote-controlled bomb struck a military convoy in Tank district, also in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. No casualties were reported. ___ This story corrects the type of vehicle used in bombing.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-suicide-attack-checkpoint-northwest-64329aedc9b41612738e556fa185d0ef	2024-10-26T02:15:00-07:00	
Middle East latest: Israeli airstrikes hit military sites in Iran	Israel unleashed a series of pre-dawn airstrikes against military sites in Iran on Saturday, saying it targeted facilities used to make the missiles fired at Israel and surface-to-air missile locations. The attack risks pushing the archenemies closer to all-out war at a time of spiraling violence across the Middle East, where militant groups backed by Iran — including Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon — are already at war with Israel. Lebanon’s Health Ministry says the total toll over the past year is over 2,600 killed and 12,200 wounded. The fighting in Lebanon has driven 1.2 million people from their homes, including more than 400,000 children, according to the United Nations children’s agency. Israeli strikes have killed much of Hezbollah’s top leadership since fighting ramped up in September. Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not differentiate between militants and civilians. The Israel-Hamas war began after Hamas-led militants on Oct. 7, 2023, blew holes in Israel’s security fence and stormed in, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. ___ Here's the latest: EgyptAir cancels flights to Iraq and Jordan CAIRO — Egypt’s flagship airliner has canceled Saturday flights from Cairo to Baghdad and Erbil in Iraq and Amman, Jordan. EgyptAir blamed the cancellations on 'the ongoing developments in the region.' The flight cancellations came hours after Israel launched a series of pre-dawn airstrikes against military sites in Iran. Turkey accuses Israel of pushing the Mideast to the brink of a greater war ISTANBUL — Turkey accused Israel of having 'brought our region to the brink of a greater war' following its strikes on Iran. 'Putting an end to the terror created by Israel in the region has become a historic duty in terms of establishing international security and peace,' the Foreign Ministry said in a statement. It called on the international community to take 'immediate action to enforce the law and stop the Netanyahu government.' Turkey has been a harsh critic of Israel’s military operations in Gaza and Lebanon while voicing support for Hamas. Israeli troops detain people at a Gaza hospital, Palestinian health officials say CAIRO —Israeli troops withdrew from Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza after holding a number of people inside detained for hours, the Palestinian Health Ministry said. Those held included medical staff and patients, the ministry said, and women were held separately 'with no water or food.' The Israeli army did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The troops later withdrew from the hospital, leaving behind massive damage, the ministry said. Footage circulated online showing the courtyard bulldozered and the wards vandalized. Among those detained and taken away was Dr. Mohamed Obeid, head of the orthopedics’ department at nearby Al-Awda Hospital, according to Al-Awda Hospital. His whereabouts are unknown. The Israeli army began raiding the hospital, located in the Beit Lahiya area, on Friday as part of its weekslong ground offensive on the northern parts of Gaza. Kamal Adwan is one of three hospitals in northern Gaza that has been left largely inaccessible because of the fighting. Earlier this week, the director of the hospital told The Associated Press that the facility is facing a 'catastrophic' shortage of basic supplies and that ambulances can no longer service the site. Throughout the yearlong Israel-Hamas war, Israeli forces have stormed and bombarded a number of hospitals including the strip’s largest medical facility, Shifa Hospital. Israel accuses Hamas of using medical facilities across Gaza for military purposes, an accusation the militant group has denied. Egypt says a cease-fire in Gaza the only way to de-escalate tensions CAIRO — Egypt said it's following with 'great concern the rapid and serious escalation' in the region, including Israel’s attack on Iran, and warned about 'serious confrontations' across the Middle East. The Foreign Ministry said that a cease-fire deal in Gaza 'is the sole means to de-escalate' tensions in the Middle East. Egypt, Qatar and the United States have been leading efforts to reach a cease-fire deal in Gaza, which includes the release of hostages held by Hamas as well as Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. UK prime minister urges restraint APIA, Samoa — British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Iran should not respond to Israeli airstrikes and urged all sides to show restraint. His comments at the Commonwealth Summit in Samoa came after Israel attacked Iran with a series of pre-dawn airstrikes Saturday in what it said was a response to the barrage of ballistic missiles the Islamic Republic fired upon Israel earlier this month. Starmer said Israel has the right to defend itself against Iranian aggression. 'This is a live situation, and we are obviously monitoring it closely alongside our partners,' Starmer said. 'We need to avoid further regional escalation and urge all sides to show restraint. Iran should not respond. We will continue to work with allies to de-escalate the situation across the region.' Iran vows response to Israel's strikes TEHRAN, Iran — Iran's Foreign Ministry condemned the Israeli attacks on military bases and said Iran will respond. A statement by the Foreign Ministry called the attacks a clear violation of international law and the U.N. Charter, particularly regarding the prohibition against threats or the use of force against the territorial integrity and sovereignty of nations. The ministry emphasized Iran’s inherent right to self-defense, as reflected in Article 51 of the U.N. Charter, saying it has an obligation to respond to foreign aggression. Israel's opposition leader says the military should've hit Iran harder JERUSALEM — Israel’s opposition leader Yair Lapid praised the work of the military but said Israel should have struck harder. 'The decision not to attack strategic and economic targets in Iran was wrong. We could and should have exacted a much heavier price from Iran,' Lapid wrote in a post on X. He said the air force actions showed its operational capabilities, and that Israel’s enemies know that its military is strong and can attack anywhere. Iranian army says 2 soldiers died in Israeli bombing TEHRAN, Iran — The Iranian army said two soldiers were killed in Israeli strikes. The army statement was carried by the Arabic-language channel of the state TV, Al-Alam. The report did not elaborate. Iran says Israeli strikes targeted military bases in 3 provinces, causing ‘limited damage’ DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Iran’s military said early Saturday that Israeli strikes on the country targeted military bases in Ilam, Khuzestan and Tehran provinces, causing 'limited damage.' The statement from Iran’s armed forces was read aloud on state television, which showed no images of the damage described. Iran’s military claimed its air defenses limited the damage done by the strikes, without providing additional evidence. Israel said it launched attacks targeting missile manufacturing plants and other sites in the country. Israel says it has completed its strikes on Iran, including missile plants DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Israel said early Saturday it had completed its strikes targeting Iran. The Israeli military issued a statement saying its planes 'have safely returned home.' Its aircraft 'struck missile manufacturing facilities used to produce the missiles that Iran fired at the state of Israel over the last year,' the military said. 'These missiles posed a direct and immediate threat to the citizens of the state of Israel.' It added that it also 'struck surface-to-air missile arrays and additional Iranian aerial capabilities, that were intended to restrict Israel’s aerial freedom of operation in Iran.' It offered no damage assessment. Iran acknowledged only 'limited damage' to military facilities. The early Saturday airstrikes on Iran were in retaliation for a ballistic missile assault Oct. 1, Israeli officials said. The attack, threatened for weeks by Israel, comes as the Middle East sits on the precipice of a regional war more than a year after an initial attack by the militant group Hamas on Israel. In the time since, Israel has launched a devastating ground offensive in the Gaza Strip and an invasion of neighboring Lebanon, targeting militants long armed and aided by Tehran.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-hezbollah-mideast-latest-26-october-2024-41d99530f6f6b728e828198f53d62b6c	2024-10-26T00:30:32-07:00	
Russian strikes on Kyiv and central Ukraine kill 2 teenagers and injure dozens	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A Russian drone strike killed a teenager in Kyiv during a nighttime barrage on the Ukrainian capital that lasted for hours, officials said, while five people were reportedly killed in a missile attack on central Ukraine that also left at least 21 injured. According to Kyiv Mayor Vitalii Klitschko, the drone slammed into a 25-story apartment block Friday night in the city's west, killing a 15-year-old girl and injuring five others. Ukraine's Emergency Service said 100 people were evacuated following the strike, which damaged several apartments on the building's upper floors. Serhii Popko, who heads Kyiv's local military administration, said that Russian forces overnight pummeled the city for 7 1/2 hours. Air raid sirens wailed throughout the night, and Popko said that Ukrainian air defense shot down up to a dozen Russian drones. Also late Friday, a Russian missile hit a residential area in the central city of Dnipro, killing a 14-year-old and four others, said regional Gov. Serhii Lysak, adding that at least 21 others were injured including an 8-year-old and teenagers. The wife and teenage daughter of a local policeman were pulled dead from the rubble, police reported. The attack damaged over a dozen apartment buildings, private houses and a medical facility. A man and woman died after a Russian drone dropped explosives on a village in the southern Kherson region, local prosecutors said, while two people in their 60s were killed by shelling in the Kharkiv province in the northeast. In the Kyiv province, which surrounds but does not include the capital, flying debris from a drone attack killed a woman, Ukraine’s Emergency Service reported. A 13-year-old boy was wounded elsewhere in the region, it said. Russian forces overnight launched a total of 91 drones and seven missiles at Ukrainian territory, Ukraine’s air force said Saturday in the latest of regular media updates. It said 44 of the drones were shot down. In Russia, air defense brought down 17 Ukrainian drones over four regions near the border, the defense ministry in Moscow reported Saturday. Also according to the Russian defense ministry, Moscow's troops have continued eking out battlefield gains in Ukraine's industrial east, capturing the hamlet of Oleksandropil in the Donetsk region. Russia has been conducting a ferocious monthslong campaign along the eastern front in Ukraine, gradually compelling Kyiv to surrender ground. But Russia has struggled to push Ukrainian forces out of its Kursk border region following an incursion almost three months ago.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-kyiv-attack-drone-4325c6b695c010cb2556e48f2efa275c	2024-10-25T23:45:20-07:00	
Israel attacks Iran in series of pre-dawn airstrikes targeting military infrastructure	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel attacked Iran with a series of pre-dawn airstrikes Saturday in what it said was a response to the barrage of ballistic missiles the Islamic Republic fired upon Israel earlier in the month. The Israeli military said its aircraft targeted facilities that Iran used to make missiles fired at Israel as well as surface-to-air missile sites. There was no immediate indication that oil or missile sites were hit — strikes that would have marked a much more serious escalation — and Israel offered no immediate damage assessment. Explosions could be heard in the Iranian capital, Tehran, though the Islamic Republic insisted they caused only 'limited damage' and Iranian state-run media downplayed the attacks. Still, the strikes risk pushing the archenemies closer to all-out war at a time of spiraling violence across the Middle East, where militant groups backed by Iran — including Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon — are already at war with Israel. 'Iran attacked Israel twice, including in locations that endangered civilians, and has paid the price for it,' said Israeli military spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari in a video statement. 'We are focused on our war objectives in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon. It is Iran that continues to push for a wider regional escalation.' Photos and video released by Israel showed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, wearing a casual black jacket, and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant meeting with military advisors and others in a conference room at a military command and control center in the Kirya military base in Tel Aviv. The strikes filled the air for hours until sunrise in Iran. They marked the first time Israel's military has openly attacked Iran, which hasn't faced a sustained barrage of fire from a foreign enemy since its 1980s war with Iraq. It came as part of Israel's 'duty to respond' to attacks on it from 'Iran and its proxies in the region,' Hagari said. 'The Israel Defense Forces has fulfilled its mission,' Hagari said. 'If the regime in Iran were to make the mistake of beginning a new round of escalation, we will be obligated to respond.' The United States warned against further retaliation, indicating that the overnight strikes should end the direct exchange of fire between the Israel and Iran. Nuclear facilities and oil installations were all seen as possible targets for Israel’s response to Iran’s Oct. 1 attack, before U.S. President Joe Biden's administration won assurances from Israel in mid-October that it would not hit such targets, which would be a more severe escalation. Iran’s military said the strikes targeted military bases in Ilam, Khuzestan and Tehran provinces, without elaborating. Iran’s state-run media acknowledged blasts that could be heard in Tehran and said some of the sounds came from air defense systems around the city. But beyond a brief reference, Iranian state television for hours offered no other details. Iran's move to quickly downplay the attack may offer an avenue for it not to respond, averting further escalation. Iran fired a wave of missiles and drones at Israel in April after two Iranian generals were killed in an apparent Israeli airstrike in Syria on an Iranian diplomatic post. The missiles and drones caused minimum damage, and Israel — under pressure from Western countries to show restraint — responded with a limited strike it didn't openly claim. Dozens were killed and thousands wounded in September when pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah exploded in two days of attacks attributed to Israel. A massive Israel airstrike the following week outside Beirut killed Hezbollah’s longtime leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and several of his top commanders. On Oct. 1, Iran launched at least 180 missiles into Israel in retaliation, sending Israelis scrambling into bomb shelters but causing only minimal damage and a few injuries. Netanyahu immediately said Iran had 'made a big mistake.' Israel then ratcheted up the pressure on Hezbollah by launching a ground invasion into southern Lebanon. More than a million Lebanese people have been displaced, and the death toll has risen sharply as airstrikes hit in and around Beirut. Israel and Iran have been bitter foes since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Israel considers Iran to be its greatest threat, citing its leaders’ calls for Israel’s destruction, their support for anti-Israel militant groups and the country’s nuclear program. During their yearslong shadow war, a suspected Israeli assassination campaign has killed top Iranian nuclear scientists and Iranian nuclear installations have been hacked or sabotaged, all in mysterious attacks blamed on Israel. Meanwhile, Iran has been blamed for a series of attacks on shipping in the Middle East in recent years, which later grew into the attacks by Yemen’s Houthi rebels on shipping through the Red Sea corridor. The shadow war has increasingly moved into the light since Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas and other militants attacked Israel. They killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took some 250 hostages into Gaza. In response, Israel launched a devastating air and ground offensive against Hamas, and Netanyahu has vowed to keep fighting until all of the hostages are freed. Some 100 remain and roughly a third are believed to be dead. More than 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, according to local health officials, who don’t differentiate between civilians and combatants but say more than half of the dead have been women and children. ___ Gambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

3 dead after light planes collided in Australia	SYDNEY (AP) — Three men died after two light planes collided midair and crashed into a forested area southwest of Sydney on Saturday. Australian police, fire and ambulance crews reached the two wreckage sites, located in a semirural bushland area about 55 miles southwest of Sydney, on foot. One plane had burst into flames on impact. New South Wales Police Acting Superintendent Timothy Calman confirmed that a Cessna 182 carrying two people collided with an ultralight aircraft from a nearby airfield carrying one. Further details of the victims have not been disclosed. Witnesses saw 'debris coming from the sky' and tried to help, but 'there was probably not much that could’ve been done,' Calman said to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation . He noted both crashes, about one kilometer apart, were 'not survivable.' NSW Ambulance Inspector Joseph Ibrahim, part of the emergency response team, said to the ABC, 'unfortunately, there was nothing they could’ve done.' The cause of the crash will be investigated by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau.	https://apnews.com/article/australia-plane-crash-8c3ff11001d29ab480a1daa7146be40e	2024-10-25T22:22:20-07:00	
Nick Harkaway steps into his father John le Carré's footsteps with spy thriller 'Karla's Choice'	LONDON (AP) — George Smiley, the subtle fictional spymaster navigating treacherous Cold War currents, is back. And so, somewhat surprisingly, is his creator, John le Carré. Four years after the spy writer’s death at the age of 89, comes a new thriller, 'Karla’s Choice.' Billed as 'a John le Carré novel,' it was written by Nick Harkaway, whose qualifications for the job include seven published novels, a lifetime of reading le Carré — and the fact he is the late author’s son. After decades avoiding his famous father’s shadow, like Smiley trying to leave the intelligence agency known as the Circus, he was drawn back in. Apprehensive author Le Carré left a note asking his family, as custodians of his estate, to help his works live on and find new readers. They took that as permission to write new books. But Harkaway, who made his name with sci-fi thrillers including 'The Gone-Away World,' 'Angelmaker' and 'Titanium Noir,' was apprehensive about being the one to do it. 'I would go so far as to say terrified,' said 51-year-old Harkaway, whose real name is Nicholas Cornwell. Le Carré was the pen name of his father, David Cornwell. 'It’s this piece of 20th-century literature that defines a genre and potentially a historical period. This body of work is immense. And it’s my father’s universe,' he said. 'There’s every reason for people to be skeptical.' Sitting in his spacious north London home — in the 'very uncomfortable' writing chair that once belonged to his father – Harkaway has relaxed a bit now that the book has been published (by Viking) to largely glowing reviews. The Daily Telegraph said Harkaway’s 'recreation of the Smiley milieu is note-perfect,' while The Guardian declared the novel 'a treat.' 'Karla’s Choice' is set in 1963, months after the end of le Carré’s breakthrough novel, 'The Spy Who Came in From the Cold.' It opens with a hitman, dispatched by Moscow to assassinate a Hungarian publisher in London, having a last-minute crisis of conscience. A recently retired Smiley is pulled in for one last job. He’s assured it will be short and simple. Famous last words. The peril-filled saga that follows fleshes out the early relationship between Smiley and the Soviet spymaster Karla, who becomes his nemesis in later works like 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy' and 'Smiley’s People.' Childhood memories Harkaway says that once he got over his terror, capturing Smiley’s voice came easily — he had literally grown up with it. Some of his earliest memories involve his father reading aloud draft pages of his works in progress. 'The formative moment in my life where I was actually learning to speak, was learning to use language, I was getting 90 minutes or more of George Smiley in my ear every day,' he said. 'And so when I came to sit down to do this, I found that I did not have to turn the dial very far to find a voice that is absolutely my own, but which reads to people as being sufficiently of the le Carré mood.' That mood is often dark. Le Carré had been a real-life Cold War intelligence agent, and his thrillers are steeped in the moral murk of the spy world. But bespectacled, understated Smiley – antithesis of that other famous fictional spy, James Bond — offers decency and hope. Harkaway sees Smiley as 'this compassionate, anonymous little everyman who can turn up and see the broken pieces of life on the floor and put them back together.' There is a bit more humor in 'Karla’s Choice' than in many of his father’s books, and female characters, including Smiley's wife Ann, get more space and voice. 'I had a flat-out ambition that the Circus and the Circus universe should not just be elderly, straight white men,' Harkaway said. He acknowledges that women were often on the sidelines in his father’s work — a reflection of the male-dominated era, and of a complicated life. David Cornwell’s mother left when he was 5 years old, leaving him with his father, a charismatic conman. He didn’t see her again until he was 21. As an adult he had two long marriages — the second to Harkaway’s mother, Valerie Jane Eustace — and multiple affairs. 'On a fundamental level for him, his relationships with women were about absence and pain,' Harkaway said. 'That got better over time. But when he was writing Smiley, that’s what came through. And that’s not my life.' Grief and joy Harkaway says working on the book didn’t bring 'an Obi Wan Kenobi moment' in which an apparition of his father appeared to offer writing advice. But he found the experience 'very moving.' 'Despite the fact that it’s … slightly a project that has grief attached to it, it’s still a joyful process,' he said. It seems inevitable that more le Carré thrillers will follow. Harkaway also plans to continue writing under his own name and in his own style, with a sequel to 'Titanium Noir' due to be published in April. 'Karla’s Choice' carries a double dedication: To David John Moore Cornwell, 'father, husband, brother, son,' and to 'John le Carré, novelist.' 'John le Carré was, among other things, a shield that my father created, because he was quite a shy guy,' Harkaway said. 'John le Carré was kind of the suit that he put on to be able to do it all. And then David Cornwell was my dad. He was a terrible cook, he was a ping pong player of enormous aggression and flair … he was the person I lived with.

Georgia votes in an election that could take it toward the EU or into Russia's orbit	TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — Georgians headed to the polls Saturday in a ballot many citizens see as a make-or-break vote on the opportunity to join the European Union. The pre-election campaign in the South Caucasus nation of 3.7 million people has been dominated by foreign policy and marked by a bitter fight for votes and allegations of a smear campaign. Some Georgians complained of intimidation and being pressured to vote for the ruling party, Georgian Dream, while the opposition accused the party of carrying out a 'hybrid war' against its citizens. Ahead of the parliamentary election, Bidzina Ivanishvili — a shadowy billionaire who set up Georgian Dream and made his fortune in Russia — vowed again to ban opposition parties should his party win. Georgian Dream will hold opposition parties 'fully accountable under the full force of the law' for 'war crimes' committed against the people of Georgia, Ivanishvili said at a pro-government rally in the capital Tbilisi Wednesday. He did not explain what crimes he believes the opposition has committed. Georgians will elect 150 lawmakers from 18 parties. If no party wins the 76 seats required to form a government for a four-year term, the president will invite the largest party to form a coalition. Many believe the election may be the most crucial vote of their lifetimes; it will determine whether Georgia gets back on track to EU membership or embraces authoritarianism and falls into Russia's orbit. 'It's an existential election,' Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili said. Georgians want 'European integration, want to move forward and want policies which will bring us a better, more stable, future,' Qristine Tordia, 29, told The Associated Press shortly after voting in the capital, Tbilisi. Around 80% of Georgians favor joining the EU according to polls and the country’s constitution obliges its leaders to pursue membership in that bloc and NATO. But Brussels put Georgia’s bid for entry to the EU on hold indefinitely after the ruling party passed a 'Russian law' cracking down on freedom of speech in June. Many Georgians fear the party is dragging the country towards authoritarianism and killing off hopes it could join the EU. The opposition parties have ignored Zourabichvili’s request to unite into a single party but have signed up to her 'charter' to carry out the reforms required by the EU to join. Zourabichvili told the AP on Thursday she believed most Georgians would mobilize to vote 'despite some instances of intimidation, despite the use of state resources ... and the use of financial resources' by the government. Georgian Dream took out billboards across the country contrasting black-and-white images of destruction in Ukraine with colorful images of life in Georgia alongside the slogan, 'Say no to war — choose peace.' The governing and opposition parties told voters they would pursue EU membership even though laws passed by Georgian Dream have put that hope on hold. 'The EU decided to stop Georgia’s integration process unilaterally,' said Vakhtang Asanidze, who spoke to AP at a pro-government rally in Tbilisi. He said he saw no reason why Georgia could not join the EU in spite of the laws. At the EU summit last week, EU leaders said they have 'serious concerns regarding the course of action taken by the Georgian government.' While Georgian Dream has adopted laws similar to those used by the Kremlin to crack down on its critics, voters at the pro-government rally said they did not view the election as a choice between Russia or Europe. 'We remember everything about Russia, including Abkhazia and South Ossetia,' said Latavra Dashniani at the rally, referring to Russia's occupation of 20% of Georgian territory after the two countries fought a short war in 2008. Voting for the ruling party, she said, would ensure Georgia enters Europe 'with dignity,' alluding to its conservative values, including opposition to rights for LGBTQ+ people. Polls opened in the parliamentary election at 8 a.m. local time and will close 12 hours later. Georgian Dream stands against three coalitions: the Unity National Movement, the Coalition for Changes Lelo, and Strong Georgia. The Gakharia for Georgia party, set up by former prime minister Giorgi Gakharia, said it will not go into an alliance with anyone but will support the opposition to form a government. — Associated Press producer Sophiko Megrelidze contributed to this report	https://apnews.com/article/georgia-elections-european-union-russia-06103525947fe3a1d372539a74cb573f	2024-10-25T19:04:23-07:00

War affects over 600 million women and girls, UN says	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — More than 600 million women and girls are now affected by war, a 50% increase from a decade ago, and they fear the world has forgotten them amid an escalating backlash against women’s rights and gender equality, top U.N. officials say. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a new report that amid record levels of armed conflict and violence, progress over the decades for women is vanishing and 'generational gains in women’s rights hang in the balance around the world.' The U.N. chief was assessing the state of a Security Council resolution adopted on Oct. 31, 2000, that demanded equal participation for women in peace negotiations, a goal that remains as distant as gender equality. Guterres said current data and findings show that 'the transformative potential of women’s leadership and inclusion in the pursuit of peace' is being undercut — with power and decision-making on peace and security matters overwhelmingly in the hands of men. 'As long as oppressive patriarchal social structures and gender biases hold back half our societies, peace will remain elusive,' he warned. The report says the proportion of women killed in armed conflicts doubled in 2023 compared with a year earlier; U.N.-verified cases of conflict-related sexual violence were 50% higher; and the number of girls affected by grave violations in conflicts increased by 35%. At a two-day U.N. Security Council meeting on the topic that ended Friday, Sima Bahous, head of the U.N. agency promoting gender equality known as UN Women, also pointed to a lack of attention to women’s voices in the search for peace. She cited the fears of millions of women and girls in Afghanistan deprived of an education and a future; of displaced women in Gaza 'waiting for death'; of women in Sudan who are victims of sexual violence; and of the vanishing hopes of women in Myanmar, Haiti, Congo, the Sahel region of Africa, South Sudan, Syria, Ukraine, Yemen and elsewhere. Bahous said 612 million women and girls who are affected by war 'wonder if the world has already forgotten them, if they have fallen from the agenda of an international community overwhelmed by crises of ever deeper frequency, severity and urgency.' The world needs to answer their fears with hope, she said, but the reality is grim: 'One in two women and girls in conflict-affected settings are facing moderate to severe food insecurity, 61% of all maternal mortality is concentrated in 35 conflict-affected countries.' As for women’s participation in decision-making and politics in countries in conflict, Bahous said it’s stalled. 'The percentage of women in peace negotiations has not improved over the last decade: under 10% on average in all processes, and under 20% in processes led or supported by the United Nations,' she said. U.N. Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed announced the launch of a 'Common Pledge on Women’s Participation in Peace Processes,' and urged governments, regional organizations and others involved in mediation to join the U.N. in taking concrete steps toward that end. The commitments include appointing women as lead mediators and team members, promoting direct and meaningful participation of women in peace processes, consulting women leaders at all stages and embedding women with expertise 'to foster gender-responsive peace processes and agreements,' she said. Many U.N. ambassadors who spoke at the council meeting focused on the lack of 'political will' to promote women in the peace process. 'We’ve seen how the lack of political will continues to stand in the way of the full implementation of the commitments entered into by member states,' Panama’s U.N. Ambassador Eloy Alfaro de Alba said Friday.	https://apnews.com/article/united-nations-women-war-gender-equality-0730fc6f9bb752b955d0078fe8b275a9	2024-10-25T15:45:59-07:00	
Microsoft fires employees who organized vigil for Palestinians killed in Gaza	Microsoft has fired two employees who organized an unauthorized vigil at the company's headquarters for Palestinians killed in Gaza during Israel's war with Hamas. The two employees told The Associated Press they were fired by phone call late Thursday, several hours after a lunchtime event they organized at Microsoft's campus in Redmond, Washington. Both employees were members of a coalition of employees called 'No Azure for Apartheid' that has opposed Microsoft's sale of its cloud-computing technology to the Israeli government. But they contended that Thursday's event was similar to other Microsoft-sanctioned employee gift campaigns for people in need. 'We have so many community members within Microsoft who have lost family, lost friends or loved ones,' said Abdelrahman Mohamed, a researcher and data scientist. 'But Microsoft really failed to have the space for us where we can come together and share our grief and honor the memories of people who can no longer speak for themselves.' Microsoft said Friday it has 'ended the employment of some individuals in accordance with internal policy' but declined to provide details. Mohamed, who is from Egypt, said he now needs a new job in the next two months to transfer a work visa and avoid deportation. Another fired worker, Hossam Nasr, said the purpose of the vigil was both 'to honor the victims of the Palestinian genocide in Gaza and to call attention to Microsoft’s complicity in the genocide' because of the use of its technology by the Israeli military. Nasr said his firing was disclosed on social media by the watchdog group Stop Antisemitism more than an hour before he received the call from Microsoft. The group didn't immediately respond Friday to a request for comment on how it learned about the firing. The same group had months earlier publicly called on Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella to take action against Nasr for his public stances on Israel. Nasr, an Egyptian-raised 2021 graduate of Harvard University, is also a co-organizer of Harvard Alumni for Palestine. Google earlier this year fired more than 50 workers in the aftermath of protests over technology the company is supplying the Israeli government amid the Gaza war. The firings stemmed from internal turmoil and sit-in protests at Google offices centered on 'Project Nimbus,' a $1.2 billion contract signed in 2021 for Google and Amazon to provide the Israeli government with cloud computing and artificial intelligence services. Microsoft said in its statement Friday about the firings that it remains 'dedicated to maintaining a professional and respectful work environment. Due to privacy and confidentiality considerations, we cannot provide specific details.'	https://apnews.com/article/microsoft-fired-workers-israel-palestinians-gaza-72de6fe1f35db9398e3b6785203c6bbf	2024-10-25T15:41:28-07:00	
Delta sues cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike over tech outage that canceled flights	ATLANTA (AP) — Delta Air Lines sued CrowdStrike on Friday, claiming the cybersecurity company had cut corners and caused a worldwide technology outage that led to thousands of canceled flight in July. The airline is asking for compensation and punitive damages from the outage, which started with a faulty update sent to several million Microsoft computers. Delta said the outage crippled its operations for several days, costing more than $500 million in lost revenue and extra expenses. CrowdStrike said Delta is giving 'misinformation,' does not understand cybersecurity and is trying to shift blame for its slow recovery from the outage. The U.S. Department of Transportation is investigating why Delta took longer to recover than other carriers. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said the department also would look into complaints about Delta customer service during the outage, including long waits for help and reports that unaccompanied minors were stranded at airports. In its lawsuit, Delta claims that the outage occurred because CrowdStrike failed to test the update before rolling it out worldwide. Delta canceled about 7,000 flights over a five-day period during the peak summer vacation season. The outage also affected banks, hospitals and other businesses. 'CrowdStrike caused a global catastrophe because it cut corners, took shortcuts, and circumvented the very testing and certification processes it advertised, for its own benefit and profit,' Delta said in the lawsuit, which was filed in Fulton County Superior Court in Georgia, near the company's headquarters. A CrowdStrike spokesperson said the company tried to resolve the dispute — one of its lawyers said in August that CrowdStrike's liability to Delta was less than $10 million. The spokesperson said Delta's claims are based on 'misinformation, demonstrate a lack of understanding of how modern cybersecurity works, and reflect a desperate attempt to shift blame for its slow recovery away from its failure to modernize its antiquated IT infrastructure.'	https://apnews.com/article/delta-airlines-crowdstrike-outage-lawsuit-43bb230d2edf235bb9f7928c4279fec2	2024-10-25T14:38:21-07:00	
AP sources: Chinese hackers targeted phones of Trump, Vance, people associated with Harris campaign	WASHINGTON (AP) — Chinese hackers engaged in a broader espionage operation targeted cellphones used by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, his running mate, JD Vance, and people associated with the Democratic campaign of Kamala Harris, people familiar with the matter said Friday. It was not immediately clear what data, if any, may have been accessed. U.S. officials are continuing to investigate, according to the people, who were not authorized to publicly discuss the ongoing inquiry and spoke on the condition of anonymity to The Associated Press. An FBI statement did not confirm the identities of any of the potential targets but said it was investigating 'unauthorized access to commercial telecommunications infrastructure by actors affiliated with the People’s Republic of China.' 'Agencies across the U.S. Government are collaborating to aggressively mitigate this threat and are coordinating with our industry partners to strengthen cyber defenses across the commercial communications sector,' the FBI said. U.S. officials believe the campaigns were among numerous targets of a larger cyberespionage operation launched by China, the people said. It was not immediately clear what information China may have hoped to glean, though Beijing has for years engaged in vast hacking campaigns aimed at collecting the private data of Americans and government workers, spying on technology and corporate secrets from major American companies and targeting U.S. infrastructure. News that high-profile political candidates and their campaigns were targeted comes as U.S. officials remain on high alert for foreign interference in the final stretch of the presidential campaign. Iranian hackers have been blamed for targeting Trump campaign officials and the Justice Department has exposed vast disinformation campaigns orchestrated by Russia, which is said to favor Trump over Harris. China, by contrast, is believed by U.S. intelligence officials to be taking a neutral stance in the race and is instead focused on down-ballot races, targeting candidates from both parties based on their stance on issues of key importance to Beijing, including support for Taiwan. The New York Times first reported that Trump and Vance had been targeted and said the campaign was advised of the development this week. Three people confirmed the news to the AP, including one who said that people associated with the Harris campaign were also targeted. A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington said Friday that they were not familiar with the specifics and could not comment, but contended that China is routinely victimized by cyberattacks and opposes the activity. 'The presidential elections are the United States’ domestic affairs. China has no intention and will not interfere in the U.S. election. We hope that the U.S. side will not make accusations against China in the election,' the statement said. Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung did not offer any details about the Chinese operation but issued a statement accusing the Harris campaign of having emboldened foreign adversaries, including China and Iran. Trump did not respond to shouted questions about whether his phone had been hacked by China as he departed an event in Texas. The FBI has repeatedly warned over the last year about Chinese hacking operations, with Director Chris Wray telling Congress in January that investigators had disrupted a state-sponsored group known as Volt Typhoon. That operation disrupted a botnet of hundreds of U.S.-based small office and home routers owned by private citizens and companies. Their ultimate targets included water treatment plants, the electrical grid and transportation systems across the U.S, with Wray warning that Beijing was positioning itself to disrupt the daily lives of Americans if the United States and China ever go to war. Last month, Wray said that the FBI had interrupted a separate Chinese government campaign, called Typhoon Flax, that targeted universities, government agencies and other organizations and that installed malicious software on more than 200,000 consumer devices, including cameras, video recorders and home and office routers. The Wall Street Journal reported this month that Chinese hackers had burrowed inside the networks of U.S. broadband providers and had potentially accessed systems that law enforcement officials use for wiretapping requests. ____ Michelle L.

Here's a look at what came out of Blinken's 11th trip to the Middle East	LONDON (AP) — Secretary of State Antony Blinken's weeklong trip to the Middle East ended unexpectedly in London on Friday, but the lack of a cease-fire breakthrough for Gaza came as no surprise to U.S. and Arab officials, who described the growing regional conflicts as a 'nightmare.' The trip to Israel, Qatar and Saudi Arabia had been expected after President Joe Biden said this month that he would dispatch Blinken to the region following Israel’s killing of Hamas military chief Yahya Sinwar, a move that Blinken said helped open a window for new talks on a cease-fire proposal that has been languishing for months. Blinken and other U.S. officials discussed various proposals that could potentially trigger the release of Israeli hostages and end the devastating war in Gaza. The main discussion this week was more focused on a post-war plan for Palestinian governance, reconstruction and security for the larger region. The impact of the war was on full display on Blinken's last day in Tel Aviv, when shortly before departing for the airport Wednesday, air raid sirens blared at the hotel where U.S. officials and press had been staying. The Israeli military said two rockets fired into Israel from Lebanon were intercepted, with smoke visible from the hotel. Here are some takeaways from Blinken's 11th visit to the Middle East since the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza began over a year ago: Reigniting peace talks While expectations were low for an agreement between Israel and Hamas militants, America and Israel did announce that after several weeks with no meetings, U.S. and Israeli negotiators will be arriving in Qatar in the coming days to revive talks. Qatar has served as a key mediator between Israel and Hamas. Blinken, speaking to reporters Thursday in the Qatari capital, Doha, said negotiators would soon return to the Gulf city. 'What we really have to determine is whether Hamas is prepared to engage,' Blinken said. But Hamas’ political representatives have not so far signaled a softer stance. 'There is no change in our position,' senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan told Al Mayadeen, a Lebanese broadcaster. Hamdan said their delegates heard from mediators in Cairo about the potential to revive cease-fire negotiations, but he reiterated that the group still insists on an end to Israel’s offensive in Gaza, as well as its complete withdrawal from the territory. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said the head of the Mossad, the country’s spy agency, would travel to Qatar on Sunday to meet with CIA director Bill Burns and the Qatari prime minister. Laying out red lines Throughout the trip, the U.S. questioned aspects of Israel's handling of the war, raising concerns about a controversial plan in northern Gaza as well as pushing its ally to adhere to U.S. humanitarian law regarding the insufficient level of aid reaching Palestinians. Before leaving Tel Aviv, Blinken and other U.S. officials cornered Netanyahu and members of his government regarding a proposal backed by some Israeli officials in which civilians would be ordered to leave the north and anyone remaining would be starved out or killed. A senior State Department official said Tuesday that both Netanyahu and his aide Ron Dermer denied having a proposal titled the 'General’s Plan' and that it was damaging for such a perception to even exist. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the private talks, said the U.S. responded by imploring the Israelis to go to great lengths to make it clear publicly that this is not their policy. In that same meeting, Blinken also broached the issue of aid getting into Gaza, following up on a stern letter issued by him and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin recently that called for a remedy to the dire situation on the ground for Palestinians. Blinken, according to the official, laid out a series of areas where the Israelis needed to improve, providing a 30-day deadline to begin seeing progress. Days later in Doha, Blinken announced an additional $135 million in U.S. aid to the Palestinians but said again that the assistance would be hopeless if it is not able to get to the civilians in need. Frustration from Arab partners Many Arab leaders this week publicly expressed their exasperation at the status of the cease-fire negotiations more than a year into the conflict. Qatar’s prime minister, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, said he was sad that mediators got so close to a deal several times in recent months only to be derailed. 'Every time we got closer to a solution, unfortunately, there were many steps back,' he told reporters Thursday in Doha. He added that going forward, there would be consequences 'should there be any of the parties that refuse to be constructively part of the negotiations.' Jordan's foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, took it even further, saying directly to Blinken during a meeting Friday in London that the 'Israeli government is not listening to anyone,' and as a result, the conflicts have became a 'nightmare that the region is continuing to live through.' 'The only path to save the region from that is for Israel to stop the aggressions on Gaza, on Lebanon, stop unilateral illegal measures of the West Bank that is also pushing the situation,' Safadi said. Running out of time Many questioned if the timing of the trip was the Biden administration's 11th-hour effort to achieve even the most modest of breakthroughs in the region before the U.S. presidential election. Blinken, instead, pointed to Sinwar's death as providing a much-needed opening for mediators who had spent the last month trying to get back to the negotiating table. The discussions around a post-war plan are being pushed by the U.S. as a way to rebuild goodwill among the various stakeholders after several lethal strikes over the summer, including two that took out the leaders of Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. This is the last time Blinken will be in the region before Election Day in 11 days, and Democrats had hoped for a cease-fire deal by the time Americans began to vote. That would have helped alleviate the serious criticism many voters have had toward Vice President Kamala Harris' stance on the war. Critics say the Biden administration has not gone far enough to deter Israel's conduct of the war, which has left more than 42,000 Palestinians dead. Local health authorities do not differentiate between militants and civilians in their count but say women and children make up more than half the fatalities.	https://apnews.com/article/us-israel-gaza-lebanon-hamas-blinken-c450119702081057ff6c816d6a19e51a	2024-10-25T09:19:37-07:00	
Here's a look at Musk's contact with Putin and why it matters	WASHINGTON (AP) — Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of major government contractor SpaceX and a key ally of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, has been in regular contact with Russian President Vladimir Putin for the last two years, The Wall Street Journal reported. A person familiar with the situation, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter, confirmed to The Associated Press that Musk and Putin have had contact through calls. The person didn't provide additional details about the frequency of the calls, when they occurred or their content. Musk, the world's richest man who also owns Tesla and the social platform X, has emerged as a leading voice on the American right. He's poured millions of dollars into Trump's presidential bid and turned the platform once known as Twitter into a site popular with Trump supporters, as well as conspiracy theorists, extremists and Russian propagandists. Musk's contacts with Putin raise national security questions, given his companies' work for the government, and highlight concerns about Russian influence in American politics. Here's what to know: What they talked about Musk and Putin have spoken repeatedly about personal matters as well as business and geopolitics, The Journal reported Thursday, citing multiple current and former officials in the U.S., Europe and Russia. During one talk, Putin asked Musk not to activate his Starlink satellite system over Taiwan as a favor for Chinese President Xi Jinping, whose ties to Putin have grown closer, the Journal reported. Putin and Xi have met more than 40 times since 2013. Russia has denied the conversations took place. In 2022, Musk said he'd only spoken to Putin once, in a call 18 months earlier focused on space. The Chinese Embassy in Washington said Friday that it was 'not aware of the specifics' of any requests made by Putin on China’s behalf. There was no immediate response to messages left with X and Tesla seeking Musk's comment. What the talks mean for national security Musk’s relationship with Putin raises national security questions given the billions of dollars in government contracts awarded to SpaceX, a critical partner to NASA and government satellite programs. Trump also has vowed to give Musk a role in his administration if he wins next month. The head of any large defense contractor would face similar questions if they held private talks with one of America's greatest adversaries, said Bradley Bowman, a former West Point professor and Senate national security adviser who now serves as senior director of the Center on Military and Political Power at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based defense think tank. Bowman said the timing of the calls as reported by The Journal and Musk's changing views on Ukraine was a 'disturbing coincidence.' 'The policy of the U.S. government is to try to isolate Vladimir Putin, and Elon Musk is directly undercutting that,' Bowman said. 'What is Putin doing with Musk? He's trying to reduce his international isolation and impact American foreign policy.' The request from Putin on Starlink as a favor to China is also likely to get attention, given U.S. support for Taiwan and concerns about the growing partnership between the Kremlin and Beijing. Musk, whose Tesla operates Gigafactory Shanghai, has developed a close relationship with China’s top leaders. His remarks about China have been friendly, and he has suggested Taiwan cede some control to Beijing by becoming a special administrative region. Moscow has growing ties to other American adversaries. The U.S. has accused Russia of sending ballistic missiles to Iran and said North Korea sent troops to Russia, possibly for combat in Ukraine. On Ukraine, Musk's views have shifted since he initially supported Kyiv following Russia's invasion in 2022 and provided it with his Starlink system for communications. Musk then refused to allow Ukraine in 2023 to use Starlink for a surprise attack on Russian soldiers in Crimea. He also floated a proposal in 2022 to end the war that would have required Ukraine to drop its plans for NATO membership and given Russia permanent control of Crimea, which it seized in 2014. The plan infuriated Ukrainian leaders. One person familiar with the talks between Musk and Putin told The Journal that there is no evidence the contact between Musk and Putin represents a security problem for the U.S. Asked about Musk’s contacts with Putin, White House national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters Friday that he had no information to share. The CIA, Pentagon and National Security Agency and had no comment. The State Department didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Musk's close ties to Trump Musk recently appeared at a Trump rally, sporting a Make America Great Again hat and delivered a ominous warning that if Trump lost the race 'this will be the last election.' Last year, Musk mocked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s request for aid for his country with a meme and said in February that the U.S. should cut its assistance because Ukraine couldn’t win. Trump, who has praised Putin’s leadership and criticized the NATO alliance and U.S. aid for Ukraine, has raised questions about what he would be willing to concede if he's elected in a negotiation over Ukraine's future U.S. intelligence officials and private tech analysts have concluded that Russia is working to covertly support Trump with disinformation and propaganda targeting his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris. Since he took over X, it has become a leading online source of Russian propaganda and disinformation aimed at Americans. Trump has faced scrutiny over his own recent contacts with Putin, outlined in a new book by Watergate journalist Bob Woodward. Woodward quoted an unnamed Trump aide who said the former president and Putin may have had as many as seven conversations since Trump lost reelection in 2020. Before one of the calls, the aide said they were asked to leave Trump’s office to give the two privacy. The Trump campaign and the Kremlin have denied those calls occurred. In response to questions about Musk and Putin, Trump campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the billionaire 'a once-in-a-generation industry leader' whose ideas could benefit 'our broken federal bureaucracy.' 'As for Putin, there’s only one candidate in the race that he did not invade another country under, and it’s President Trump,' Leavitt said in a statement. 'President Trump has long said that he will re-establish his peace through strength foreign policy to deter Russia’s aggression and end the war in Ukraine.' Russia confirms one conversation Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Friday rejected The Journal’s report as 'absolutely false information.' Peskov said Putin and Musk once held a 'medium-length phone conversation' prior to 2022 that was 'as more of an introductory nature' and that the two talked about 'visionary technologies, technological solutions for the future.' 'After that, Musk had no contacts with Putin,' Peskov said, dismissing The Journal’s article as political. 'The election has entered its home stretch, and of course the opponents stop at nothing,' Peskov said. 'Remember that a week ago they were saying that Putin allegedly talks to Trump all day long. Now he allegedly talks to Musk all the time. It’s all untrue.' Ukraine’s military intelligence told the AP that they would 'refrain from commenting' about communication between Putin and Musk. ___ Associated Press writers Didi Tang in Washington, Daria Litvinova in Tallinn, Estonia, and Illia Novikov in Kyiv, Ukraine, contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/musk-putin-x-trump-tesla-election-russia-9cecb7cb0f23ccce49336771280ae179	2024-10-25T08:21:30-07:00	
Tunisian commentator sentenced to two years under controversial anti-fake news law	TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) — A well-known Tunisian attorney and commentator was sentenced to two years in prison over remarks she made about the North African country and its treatment of migrants from sub-Saharan Africa. Sonia Dahmani was found guilty on Thursday of violating a statute against fake news that critics have long argued Tunisian authorities use to stifle criticism of President Kais Saied. Saied, a populist, has aggressively pursued his opponents since taking office, often casting them as foreign agents or accusing them of undermining state security. The cybercrime statute, known as Decree-Law 54, makes it illegal 'to produce, spread, disseminate, send or write false news ... with the aim of infringing the rights of others, harming public safety or national defense or sowing terror among the population.' Since its passage in 2022, journalists and human rights groups have said Decree-Law 54 is among the ways that authorities have curbed freedom of expression in Tunisia under Saied. Dozens of opposition figures, journalists and political commentators have been charged after criticizing the government, including Dahmani, who is being prosecuted in several cases for remarks she made earlier this year, her attorney Sami Ben Ghazi told The Associated Press. In May, she sarcastically criticized Tunisia on a private radio station, calling attention to the economic conditions and the racism afflicting Black migrants living in the country. 'What a magnificent country you speak of,' she said on the radio during a discussion about migrants that followed clashes between them and Tunisians. Masked plainclothes officers subsequently raided the headquarters of Tunisia’s bar association to arrest her. Ben Ghazi called Thursday's sentence unjust and 'part of the pattern of harassment practiced by the authorities against free voices' while Dahmani's defense committee said she was a 'victim of injustice and various judicial abuses.' Arrests ramped up in the months before Tunisia's Oct. 6 presidential election, which Saied won with 90.7% of the vote. Government critics including Dahmani, her fellow Radio IFM commentators Mourad Zeghidi and Borhane Bsaïs, and journalist and commentator Mohammed Boughalleb were all sentenced on charges that included violating Decree-Law 54. Zeghidi and Bsais in May were sentenced to one year in prison for violating the statute. Boughalleb was sentenced to six months in prison in April. 'Under such a decree, no critic of the authorities can feel safe,' Human Rights Watch said in a report last December in which it documented 22 court cases against government critics. Tunisia is among the countries in which populist politicians have in recent years pushed for legislation targeting the dissemination of so-called fake news. From Egypt to Uganda, press freedom advocates have said that leaders have exploited newfound concerns about misinformation to pass new laws that stifle legitimate criticism of the government. The National Syndicate of Tunisian Journalists in a statement expressed its 'firm condemnation of the ongoing policy of blackout and restrictions on journalistic work' put in place by authorities. __ Metz reported from Rabat, Morocco.	https://apnews.com/article/tunisia-dahmani-decree-54-misinformation-crackdown-dissent-5d1cd879bb081796439a469db744014e	2024-10-25T08:10:59-07:00	
Brazil reaches a $23 billion settlement with mining firms over a 2015 environmental disaster	SAO PAULO (AP) — Brazil's federal government on Friday reached a multibillion-dollar settlement with the mining companies responsible for a 2015 dam collapse that the government said was the country's worst-ever environmental disaster. Under the agreement, Samarco — a joint venture of Brazilian mining giant Vale and Anglo-Australian firm BHP — will pay 132 billion reais ($23 billion) over 20 years. The payments are meant to compensate for human, environmental and infrastructure damage caused by the release of an immense amount of toxic mining waste into a major river in southeastern Minas Gerais state, killing 19 people and ravaging entire villages. 'We are fixing a disaster that could have been avoided, but wasn’t,' President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said in a hall of the presidential palace, surrounded by governors of the affected states, members of his administration, reporters and victims. Lula's speech, filled with criticism of what he called the mining companies’ irresponsibility in chasing profit over safety, was met with applause from the audience. The toxic sludge — enough to fill 13,000 Olympic-size swimming pools — flowed down the Doce River for 420 miles to the Atlantic Ocean, contaminating waterways and coastal areas in two neighboring states. The mining companies told the federal government during negotiations that they had already paid 38 billion reais ($6.7 billion) in reparations. In a statement Friday, Samarco said the agreement allowed for the resolution of lawsuits related to the dam rupture. Rodrigo Vilela, Samarco's president, said in the statement that the collapse was a watershed in their history, which they 'deeply regret and will never forget.' 'The agreement signed today reinforces Samarco and its shareholders’ commitment to people, communities and the environment, ensuring the continuation of full and definitive repair and compensation for the damages,' he added. The settlement includes compensation for more than 300,000 victims, though that figure does not account for everyone affected. Twice as many people — 620,000 — took their case to a UK court on Monday seeking reparations. The class action lawsuit at the High Court in London seeks an estimated 36 billion pounds ($47 billion) in damages from BHP. The case was filed in Britain because one of BHP’s two main legal entities was based in London at the time. The London suit prompted the Brazilian Supreme Court's Chief Justice, Luís Roberto Barroso, to personally seek Lula's commitment to ensure parties reached an agreement domestically. 'I spoke with Lula and said, ‘Mr. President, there is a case abroad, and it will be very damaging to the Brazilian courts if this matter is resolved outside the country,’' Barroso said Friday at the presidential palace. The Brazilian federal government said victims would receive 35,000 reais ($6,150) each, while fishermen and farmers would be paid 95,000 reais ($17,000) in total through monthly installments over four years. Cristiano Sales, 42, was born and raised in Bento Rodrigues, one of the districts in the municipality of Mariana that was washed over by the sludge nine years ago. When he returned to the ruins of his house three months later, the only item he found was a jersey from his favorite soccer team, Cruzeiro. Sales lives in a new house in a neighborhood built by the mining companies as part of compensation to his father. After filing a lawsuit, he personally received 100,000 reais ($18,000) and is still pursuing additional reparations through the London suit. 'Money can’t pay for what we’ve been through here,' he said. 'We take the money because it’s our right. But to say that 100,000 or even 200,000 or 300,000 could bring back the life we had — I don’t think any amount of money can do that.' Melbourne, Australia-based BHP said in a statement on Oct. 19 it believes the U.K. action is unnecessary because it duplicates matters covered by reparation efforts and legal proceedings in Brazil, but will continue to defend itself. Pogust Goodhead, the law firm representing the plaintiffs, said Friday the settlement in Brazil shouldn’t have any impact on the London case and that there will be no double compensation. The firm added that its clients were excluded from the negotiations and are still pursuing full reparations for unresolved damages. 'The Mariana agreement signed this Friday in Brazil demonstrates that, after 9 years of negligence, the mining companies have finally decided to react to the pressure from public opinion and the trial in England, which began last Monday,' the law firm said in a statement. 'Even so, the amounts defined are far from covering the profound losses suffered by the victims, who continue to fight for justice and full reparations.' ___ Hughes reported from Bento Rodrigues, Brazil.	https://apnews.com/article/brazil-mining-collapse-settlement-bhp-samarco-vale-mariana-8b84c808fa25139e019d7981a3b7de19	2024-10-25T07:58:43-07:00	
Calls for reparations for Britain's slave trade are rooted in dark legacy	LONDON (AP) — A debate about reparations for Britain’s role in the slave trade overshadowed a summit in Samoa of the Commonwealth, many of whose member nations were once British colonies. Britain insists it will not pay to make amends for the historic wrong, but both King Charles III and Prime Minister Keir Starmer addressed the issue indirectly at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. 'None of us can change the past but we can commit with all our hearts to learning its lessons and to finding creative ways to right the inequalities that endure,' Charles said. The legacy of slavery is interwoven in some of Britain’s richest and most revered institutions — from the Church of England to the insurance giant Lloyd’s of London to the monarchy itself. 'Britain benefited from transatlantic enslavement,' said Olivette Otele, professor of the legacies and memory of slavery at the School of African and Oriental Studies at University of London. 'The money and the money trail is there to prove it. So we need to have these conversations much more openly.' It's a discussion that has been going on for a long time. Charles, when he was Prince of Wales, spoke of the 'appalling atrocity of slavery, which forever stains our history' during a visit to Barbados in 2021. At the Commonwealth summit two years ago in Rwanda, he spoke of his sorrow over slavery and its legacy for Indigenous communities and said it was a 'conversation whose time has come.' Here's a look at why the issue is getting attention now. What was Britain's role in the slave trade? Britain got involved in the slave trade in the mid-1500s, following Portugal and Spain. John Hawkins, one of the most notable sailors and naval commanders of the 16th century, is considered one of the pioneers of the English slave trade triangle. Goods were traded in West Africa for captured slaves who were shipped across the Atlantic to work in British sugar and tobacco plantations in the Caribbean and the Americas. Goods produced in the so-called New World were transported back to England. In 1672, the Royal African Company, established under King Charles II and run by his brother, Prince James (the future King James II), was given a monopoly on the slave trade. The company trafficked 80,000 African men, women and children to slavery in the Americas and about 20,000 died on the journey before the monopoly ended in 1698 when any Englishman could trade slaves. At its height, Britain was the world's biggest slave-trading nation and transported more than 3 million Africans across the Atlantic. When was it abolished? An abolitionist movement arose in England in the late 1700s, supported by Quakers, a few politicians and some former slaves. The slave trade was not outlawed until 1807. Even then Parliament did not emancipate slaves in its territories until 1833. 'But it didn’t go as planned,' Otele said. 'Plantation owners, some of them absentee plantation owners because they lived in Britain, were extremely wealthy. Their ancestors had been trading for centuries so they resisted and put pressure on Parliament ... to pay them for the so-called loss of their property..' The 1837 Compensation Act led to 20 million pounds, 40% of the national budget at the time, being paid to plantation owners for the loss of their slaves. It took until 2015 for the Bank of England to pay off the debt from those payouts. What is the current debate about? The movement demanding reparations goes back decades. The U.K. has never formally apologized for its role in the trade. Studies estimate Britain would owe between hundreds of millions and trillions of dollars in compensation to descendants of slaves. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair expressed deep sorrow in 2006 for Britain’s role in the trade but stopped short of offering an apology or compensation for descendants of slaves. Activists said Blair's careful word choice reflected the government’s fear of paying out huge reparations. In 2013, the Caribbean trade bloc known as Caricom made a list of requests including that European governments formally apologize and create a repatriation program for those who wish to return to their homeland, which has not happened. On Thursday, Bahamas Prime Minister Philip Davis said he wanted a 'frank' discussion with Starmer about the matter and would seek mention of reparations in the leaders’ final statement at the Samoa event. All three candidates to be the next Commonwealth Secretary-General — from Gambia, Ghana and Lesotho — have endorsed policies of reparatory justice for slavery. Other European nations, including the Netherlands, and some British institutions have started to own up to their role in the trade. The Church of England last year announced a 100-million-pound ($130 million) fund last year for projects 'focused on improving opportunities for communities adversely impacted by historic slavery,' though a church advisory panel said it should increase it to $1 billion. Some of the descendants of slave traders have made their own amends. A descendant of Scottish 19th-century sugar and coffee plantation owner John Gladstone — father of 19th-century British Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone — apologized last year to Guyana for his great-great-great grandfather's role as an absentee slave owner in what was then British Guiana. He received 100,000 pounds in compensation for hundreds of slaves. After earlier insisting that the Samoa summit should avoid becoming mired in the past and 'very, very long endless discussions about reparations,' Starmer acknowledged 'calls to face up to the harms and injustices of the past through reparatory justice.' Starmer said the 'most effective way to maintain a spirit of respect and dignity is by working together to make sure the future is not in the shadow of the past, but is illuminated by it.' Jacqueline McKenzie — a partner at London law firm Leigh Day — working on the issue of reparations, said the issue of how to reckon with the legacy of the slave trade is 'complex.' 'Reparations is not straightforward,' she said. 'At the moment it’s a discussion among the elites, and the people, the descendants of the enslaved … aren’t really part of the discussion.' ___ Associated Press writer Jill Lawless contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/britain-slavery-history-reparations-colonies-16c0e99c4b4fa6da743baa21c8dcd09f	2024-10-25T07:55:05-07:00
