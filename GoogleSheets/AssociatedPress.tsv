North Korean leader says past diplomacy only confirmed US hostility	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said his past negotiations with the United States only confirmed Washington’s 'unchangeable' hostility toward his country and described his nuclear buildup as the only way to counter external threats, state media said Friday. Kim spoke Thursday at a defense exhibition where North Korea displayed some of its most powerful weapons, including intercontinental ballistic missiles designed to target the U.S. mainland as well as artillery systems and drones, according to text and photos published by the North’s Korean Central News Agency. While meeting with army officers last week, he had pledged a 'limitless' expansion of his military nuclear program. Kim has yet to comment directly on Donald Trump's reelection as U.S. president. During his first term, Trump held three highly orchestrated summits with the North Korean leader in 2018 and 2019, before the diplomacy collapsed over disagreements on exchanging a relaxation of U.S.-led economic sanctions with North Korean steps to wind down its nuclear program. During the speech at the exhibition, Kim touched on the failed summits without naming Trump. 'We have already gone as far as possible with the United States with negotiations, and what we ended up confirming was not a superpower’s will for coexistence, but a thorough position based on force and an unchangeable invasive and hostile policy' toward North Korea, Kim said. Kim accused the United States of raising military pressure on North Korea by strengthening military cooperation with regional allies and increasing the deployment of 'strategic strike means,' apparently a reference to major U.S. assets such as long-range bombers, submarines and aircraft carriers. He called for accelerated efforts to advance the capabilities of his nuclear-armed military, saying the country’s only guarantee of security is to build up the 'strongest defense power that can overwhelm the enemy.' Kim's expanding nuclear weapons and missile programs include various weapons targeting South Korea and Japan and longer-range missiles that have demonstrated the range to reach the U.S. mainland. Analysts say Kim’s nuclear push is aimed at eventually pressuring Washington into accepting North Korea as a nuclear power and to negotiate economic and security concessions from a position of strength. In recent months, the focus of Kim’s foreign policy has been Russia as he tries to strengthen his international footing, embracing the idea of a 'new Cold War' and aligning with President Vladimir Putin’s broader conflicts with the West. Washington and its allies have accused North Korea of providing Russia with thousands of troops and large amounts of military equipment, including artillery systems and missiles, to help sustain its fighting in Ukraine. Kim in return could possibly receive badly needed economic aid and Russian technology transfers that would possibly enhance the threat posed by his nuclear-armed military, according to outside officials and experts. North Korea also held a major arms exhibition in July last year and invited a Russian delegation led by then-Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, who was given a personal tour by Kim that included a briefing on the North's expanding military capabilities, in what outside critics likened to a sales pitch. That event came weeks before Kim traveled to the Russia for a summit with Putin, which sped up military cooperation between the countries. North Korean state media photos of this year's exhibition showed various artillery systems, including what appeared to be 240mm multiple rocket launch systems that South Korea's spy agency believes were part of the North Korean weaponry recently sent to Russia. When asked whether North Korea was showcasing the systems it intends to export to Russia, Koo Byoungsam, a spokesperson for South Korea’s Unification Ministry, said he wouldn't make 'premature judgments' but said the government was 'monitoring related trends.' 'We stress once again that arms transfers between Russia and North Korea are a clear violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions and an illegal act that undermines the norms of the international community,' he said. Even with Trump returning to the White House, a quick resumption of diplomacy with North Korea could be unlikely, according to some experts. North Korea's deepening alliance with Russia and the weakening enforcement of sanctions against it are presenting further challenges in the push to resolve the nuclear standoff with Kim, who also has a greater perception of his bargaining power following the rapid expansion of his arsenal in recent years.	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-kim-jong-un-trump-7fd79863780bc95871f5fdb5410df214	2024-11-21T16:02:16-08:00	
UN nuclear agency’s board condemns Iran for the 2nd time this year for failing to fully cooperate	VIENNA (AP) — The U.N. nuclear watchdog’s board on Thursday condemned Iran for failing to cooperate fully with the agency, the second time it has done so in just five months. The International Atomic Energy Agency also called on Tehran to provide answers in a long-running investigation into uranium particles found at two locations that Tehran has failed to declare as nuclear sites. Nineteen members of the IAEA board voted for the resolution, while Russia, China and Burkina Faso opposed it, and 12 abstained and one did not vote, according to diplomats who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the outcome of the closed-doors vote. The resolution was put forward by France, Germany and Britain, supported by the United States. It comes at a critical time, ahead of Donald Trump’s return to the White House. Trump’s first term in office was marked by a particularly tense period with Iran, when the U.S. president pursued a policy of 'maximum pressure' against Tehran. In 2018, Trump unilaterally withdrew America from Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers, and imposed even harsher sanctions that have since hobbled Iran's economy further. The resolution comes on the heels of a confidential report earlier this week in which the IAEA said Iran has defied international demands to rein in its nuclear program and has increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels. That report, seen by the AP on Tuesday, said that as of Oct. 26, Iran has accumulated 182.3 kilograms (401.9 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60%, an increase of 17.6 kilograms (38.8 pounds) since the last IAEA report in August. Uranium enriched at 60% purity is just a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. The resolution approved on Thursday requires the IAEA to now produce a 'comprehensive and updated assessment' of Iran’s nuclear activities, which could eventually trigger a referral to the U.N. Security Council to consider more sanctions on Tehran. In a joint statement issued after the approval of the resolution, the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran and the Iranian foreign ministry condemned the passing of the resolution, saying that Iran’s nuclear chief Mohammad Eslami has issued orders to launch new and advanced centrifuges, powerful machines that spin rapidly to enrich uranium. In the past, the IAEA has named two locations near Tehran — Varamin and Turquzabad — where there have been traces of processed uranium, according to IAEA inspectors. Thursday’s resolution honed in on those locations, asking Tehran to provide 'technically credible explanations' for the presence of the uranium particles at the sites.' The IAEA has urged Iran to also provide answers about the origin and current location of that nuclear material in order for it 'to be in a position to provide assurance that Iran’s nuclear program is exclusively peaceful.' Western officials suspect that the uranium traces discovered by the IAEA could provide evidence that Iran had a secret nuclear weapons program until at least 2003. Tehran insists its program is peaceful. One of the sites became known publicly in 2018 after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu revealed it at the United Nations and called it a clandestine nuclear warehouse hidden at a rug-cleaning plant. Iran denied that, though IAEA inspectors later found the man-made uranium particles there. While the number of sites about which the IAEA has questions has been reduced from four to two since 2019, lingering questions have been a persistent source of tensions. On the subject of Varamin, the IAEA said that inspectors believe Iran used the site from 1999 until 2003 as a pilot project to process uranium ore and convert it into a gas form, which then can be enriched through spinning in a centrifuge. The IAEA said buildings at the site had been demolished in 2004. Turquzabad, the second location, is where the IAEA believes Iran brought some of the material from Varamin amid the demolition, though it said that alone cannot 'explain the presence of the multiple types of isotopically altered particles' found there. Thursday’s resolution before the 35-member board at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna, called on Tehran to explain the presence of the uranium particles at Varamin and Turquzabad, inform the U.N. nuclear watchdog about the current whereabouts of that nuclear material, and grant access to IAEA inspectors to all Iranian nuclear locations. A draft of the resolution was seen by the AP. Tehran continues to maintain that its nuclear program is solely for peaceful purposes and has told the IAEA that it has declared all of the nuclear material, activities and locations required under a so-called Safeguard Agreement it has with the IAEA. Iranian officials have vowed to retaliate immediately if a resolution is passed. In the past, Tehran has responded to IAEA resolutions by stepping up its nuclear activities. The resolution also requires IAEA director general Rafael Grossi to provide an updated assessment of Iran’s nuclear program — including the possible presence of undeclared nuclear material at the two locations — by spring 2025 at the latest. The assessment could be a basis for possible further steps by European nations, diplomats said, leading to potential escalation in tensions between Iran and the West. It could also provide a basis for European countries to trigger sanctions against Iran ahead of October 2025, when the original 2015 Iran nuclear deal expires, the diplomats said.	https://apnews.com/article/un-nuclear-watchdog-iaea-iran-4706276a489b1a4cce2ca6260d0b3182	2024-11-21T12:00:13-08:00	
Canada's Trudeau to cut sales tax and send checks to millions of Canadians as election looms	HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) — Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau 's government announced plans Thursday to temporarily lift the federal sales tax off a number of items and send checks to millions of Canadians who are dealing with rising costs and as a federal election looms. The measures come as a cost of living crisis has left voters unhappy with Trudeau and ahead of an election that could come anytime between this fall and next October. 'Our government can’t set prices at the checkout, but we can put more money in people’s pockets,' Trudeau said at a press conference in Toronto. Under the plan, Canadians who worked in 2023 and earned up to 150,000 Canadian dollars (US$ 107,440) will receive a check for 250 Canadian dollars. Trudeau noted that even those earning at the high end of that amount have been struggling to get by. An estimated 18.7 million Canadians will receive the one-time check. The federal goods and services tax break would begin Dec. 14 and end Feb. 15. The government said the tax break will apply to a number of items including children’s clothing and shoes, toys, diapers, restaurant meals, beer and wine. It also applies to Christmas trees, a variety of snack foods and beverages and video game consoles. Opposition Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre called the announcement a 'two month temporary tax trick' that won’t make up for carbon taxes that are set to go up. Trudeau has said he will lead his Liberal Party into the next election. No Canadian prime minister in more than a century has won four straight terms. Trudeau channeled the star power of his father in 2015 when he reasserted the country’s liberal identity in 2015 after almost 10 years of Conservative rule. But the son of late Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau is now in trouble. Canadians have been frustrated by the cost of living coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Liberals trail the opposition Conservatives 39% to 26% in the latest Nanos poll. The poll of 1,047 respondents has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points. 'Politically, it’s probably too little too late and it feels like a desperate move on the part of an unpopular government,' said Daniel Béland, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal. 'It’s also bad public policy, at least from a fiscal standpoint.'	https://apnews.com/article/trudeau-canada-tax-break-election-e0f81b12d823a98f225c8b2c6ac28347	2024-11-21T10:12:38-08:00	
Brazilian police indict former President Bolsonaro and dozens of aides in alleged 2022 coup attempt	SAO PAULO (AP) — Brazil’s federal police said Thursday they indicted former President Jair Bolsonaro and 36 other people on charges of attempting a coup to keep him in office after his electoral defeat in the 2022 elections. The findings were to be delivered Thursday to Brazil's Supreme Court to be referred to Prosecutor-General Paulo Gonet, who will either agree with the charges and put the former president on trial or toss the investigation.	https://apnews.com/article/brazil-jair-bolsonaro-indictment-0d62fe0a7399483aee48cf3c845560ea	2024-11-21T09:39:36-08:00	
What you need to know about the proposed measures designed to curb Google's search monopoly	U.S. regulators are proposing aggressive measures to restore competition to the online search market after a federal judge ruled Google maintained an illegal monopoly for the last decade. The sweeping set of recommendations filed late Wednesday by the U.S. Department of Justice could radically alter Google's business, including possibly spinning off the Chrome web browser and syndicating its search data to competitors. Even if the courts adopt the blueprint, Google isn't likely to make any significant changes until 2026 at the earliest, because of the legal system's slow-moving wheels. Here's what it all means: What is the Justice Department's goal? Federal prosecutors are cracking down on Google in a case originally filed during near the end of then-President Donald Trump’s first term. Officials say the main goal of these proposals is to get Google to stop leveraging its dominant search engine to illegally squelch competition and stifle innovation. 'The playing field is not level because of Google’s conduct, and Google’s quality reflects the ill-gotten gains of an advantage illegally acquired,' the Justice Department asserted in its recommendations. 'The remedy must close this gap and deprive Google of these advantages.' Not surprisingly, Google sees things much differently. The Justice Department's 'wildly overbroad proposal goes miles beyond the Court’s decision,' Kent Walker, Google's chief legal officer, asserted in a blog post. 'It would break a range of Google products — even beyond search — that people love and find helpful in their everyday lives.' It’s still possible that the Justice Department could ease off on its attempts to break up Google, especially if President-elect Donald Trump takes the widely expected step of replacing Jonathan Kanter, who was appointed by President Joe Biden to oversee the agency’s antitrust division. Why focus on Chrome? Regulators want Google to sell off its industry-leading Chrome web browser, though the filing did not specify who would ultimately buy the business or how that process would work. Justice lawyers called Chrome a 'gateway to the internet' that provides the search giant with data it then uses for targeted advertising. Regulators believe that asking Google to divest Chrome would create a more equal playing field for search competitors. Chrome also is included in the set of apps bundled with Android on phones as part of a mobile device ecosystem that regulators say gives Google a big edge. Chrome is the world’s most popular mobile web browser, with about 67% adoption globally, according to StatCounter. Apple’s Safari browser has the next highest adoption at 18%. Although it could be years before we see any practical effects of this case on the market, it could mean users would see more search engine options when selecting a default one to use on their favored devices. Does any of this affect Android? While federal regulators aren't going as far as to demand Google spin off Android, they are leaving the door open. The government asked the judge to impose behavioral limitations that would essentially blunt Android from favoring Google’s own general search services. Regulators asserted U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta should make it clear that Google could still be required to divest its smartphone operating system if the other proposed measures prove ineffective at restoring competition to the search market. Android is the world's most popular smartphone operating system, found on 71% of mobile phones, Statcounter says. It’s free to use, so many devices by Samsung and many other tech companies — aside from Apple — have it pre-installed. What else? The Justice Department outlined a range of behavioral measures to give rival search engines a better chance at competing with Google. The core remedy is a ban on Google from cutting deals worth billions of dollars to lock in its search engine as the default option on Apple’s iPhone and other popular devices. This could potentially impact the bottom line at companies receiving such packages. Other key recommendations: 1. Prohibiting Google from using search results to favor its own services, such as YouTube or its recently-launched artificial intelligence platform, Gemini. 2. Forcing Google to license the search index data to its rivals. 3. Requiring Google to be more transparent about how it sets the prices advertisers pay to be listed near the top of some targeted search results. 4. Giving publishers, websites and content creators the right to opt out of having their data indexed for Google's search results or to train its artificial intelligence models. What comes next? Google has the chance to submit its own list of proposed fixes in December, and federal regulators will file a revised version of their proposals in early March. Court hearings on these proposed measures are scheduled to begin in April and Mehta is expected to issue a final decision before Labor Day. The remedies trial will take place after the Trump administration takes over from Biden in January and assumes oversight of the Department of Justice, which could impact the punishments it ultimately pursues. Although Trump has made comments suggesting a breakup of Google isn't in the U.S. national interest, recent nominations put forward by his transition team have favored those who have been critical of Big Tech companies. And the case was originally filed during Trump's first term, which suggests Google won’t be entirely off the hook. Google is expected to appeal the case after the remedy hearings, which means the case could drag on for years in the courts.	https://apnews.com/article/google-android-chrome-antitrust-f4b73387d152a1c14c9df65bf0149a69	2024-11-21T08:29:53-08:00	
Wisconsin kayaker who faked his own death has told investigators how he did it, sheriff says	GREEN LAKE, Wis. (AP) — A Wisconsin man who faked his own drowning this summer so he could abandon his wife and three children has been communicating daily from Eastern Europe with police, even telling them how he did it, but has not committed to returning home, a sheriff said Thursday. Ryan Borgwardt has been talking with police since Nov. 11, Green Lake County Sheriff Mark Podoll said at a news conference. The sheriff showed a video that Borgwardt sent police that day. Police don't know exactly where he is, Podoll said, but it was somewhere in Eastern Europe. Borgwardt, wearing an orange T-shirt and not smiling, looked directly into the camera in the video, which appears to have been taken on his phone. Borgwardt said he was in his apartment and briefly panned the camera to show the inside, but mostly showed just a door and bare walls. 'I’m safe and secure, no problem,' Borgwardt said. 'I hope this works.' Borgwardt gave police details about how he faked his death and fled, Podoll said. He told police that he overturned his kayak and dumped his phone in Green Lake, paddled an inflatable boat to shore, and rode an electric bike through the night to Madison, the sheriff said. That's a distance of about 70 miles (110 kilometers). From there he took a bus to Detroit, then boarded a bus to Canada and got on a plane there, the sheriff said. Police were still verifying Borgwardt’s description of what happened, Podoll said. 'The great news is we know that he is alive and well,' Podoll said. 'The bad news is we don’t know where Ryan exactly is, and he has not yet decided to return home.' Podoll suggested Borgwardt could be charged with obstructing the investigation into his disappearance, but so far no counts have been filed. The sheriff said authorities 'keep pulling at his heartstrings' to return home. 'Christmas is coming,' Podoll said. 'And what better gift could your kids get than to be there for Christmas?' But whether Podoll returns, the sheriff said, is 'on his own free will.' Borgwardt’s disappearance was first investigated as a possible drowning after he went kayaking on Green Lake, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) northwest of Milwaukee. But subsequent clues — including that he obtained a new passport three months before he disappeared — led investigators to speculate that he faked his death to meet up with a woman he had been communicating with in Uzbekistan, a former Soviet republic in Central Asia. The sheriff declined to comment when asked what he knew about the woman, but he said police contacted Borgwardt 'through a female that spoke Russian.' Prior to police speaking with Borgwardt last week, he had not been heard from in three months. On the night of Aug. 11, Borgwardt texted his wife in Watertown shortly before 11 p.m., saying he was headed to shore after kayaking. Deputies located his vehicle and trailer near the lake. They also found his overturned kayak with a life jacket attached to it in an area where the lake’s waters run more than 200 feet (60 meters) deep. An angler later discovered Borgwardt’s fishing rod. Investigators initially speculated that Borgwardt’s kayak capsized and he didn’t have a life jacket. The search for his body went on for more than 50 days, with divers on several occasions exploring the lake. In early October, the sheriff’s department learned that Canadian law enforcement authorities had run Borgwardt’s name through their databases the day after he was reported missing. Further investigation revealed that he had reported his passport lost or stolen and had obtained a new one in May. Police said the analysis of a laptop revealed a digital trail that showed Borgwardt planned to head to Europe and tried to mislead investigators. Police said the laptop’s hard drive had been replaced and the browsers had been cleared the day Borgwardt disappeared. Investigators found passport photos, inquiries about moving money to foreign banks, and communication with a woman from Uzbekistan. They also discovered that he took out a $375,000 life insurance policy in January, although the policy was for his family and not him, the sheriff said. Authorities tried every phone number and email address on the laptop in 'a blitz fashion,' Podoll said. They eventually reached a Russian-speaking woman who connected them with Borgwardt. It's unclear whether she is the woman in Uzbekistan. Podell said Borgwardt has an apartment wherever he is, but the sheriff wasn't sure how he was supporting himself.	https://apnews.com/article/kayaker-fakes-death-fd6317cdb24bfae7c92f7933bcf47066	2024-11-21T08:26:56-08:00	
The biggest remaining unsanctioned Russian bank hit with U.S. sanctions, nearly three years into war	WASHINGTON (AP) — Russia's third largest bank, Gazprombank and its six foreign subsidiaries were hit with U.S. sanctions on Thursday — in a move intended to curtail Russia's ability to evade the thousands of sanctions imposed on the nation since the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the sanctions targeting Russia’s largest remaining non-sanctioned bank would further diminish Russia's military effort and 'will make it harder for the Kremlin to evade U.S. sanctions and fund and equip its military.' In addition, more than 50 internationally connected Russian banks, 40 Russian securities registrars, and 15 Russian finance officials were hit with sanctions. The move comes after President Joe Biden this weekend authorized Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied missiles to strike deeper inside Russia, easing limitations on the longer range weapons as Russia deploys thousands of North Korean troops to reinforce its war. In addition, on Wednesday the Pentagon announced that it will send Ukraine at least $275 million in new weapons, including an undisclosed number of antipersonnel land mines, as the Biden administration rushes to do as much as it can to help Kyiv fight back against Russia before President-elect Donald Trump takes office. White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the U.S. 'remains committed to putting Ukraine in the strongest possible position, and we will continue to take all available steps to do so from surging security assistance to imposing and fully enforcing sanctions and other restrictions on Russia’s war machine.' Among other things, the sanctions deny the people and firms access to any property or financial assets held in the U.S. and prevent U.S. companies and citizens from doing business with them. Canada and the United Kingdom have previously sanctioned Gazprombank. Treasury states that Gazprombank is a means for Russia to fund its military to continue its war effort against Ukraine, using the bank to pay soldiers and compensate families of Russian soldiers killed in the fighting. Gazprombank played a role in remaining Russian natural gas supplies to Europe by handling payments from foreign customers. Earlier rounds of sanctions spared Russian gas because Europe’s economy was so dependent on it but Europe is now far less reliant on Russian gas, which is down to about 18% of imports. Russia cut off of most supplies in 2022, plunging the continent into an energy crisis. European governments and utilities have now lined up alternative supplies, much of it liquefied gas brought by ship from the U.S. and Qatar. Ukraine says it will halt flows of Russian gas through a pipeline across Ukraine to Europe - about 4% of Europe’s gas imports - at the end of the year. Gazprom recently cut off shipments through that pipeline to Austria’s OMV in a commercial dispute; OMV has said it has plenty of reserves and can find alternative supply elsewhere. The EU has set a nonbinding goal of ending all Russian gas imports by 2027. ___ McHugh reported from Frankfurt, Germany.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-sanctions-treasury-5b5852a47a143be972f8afd4f8ee89cd	2024-11-21T06:36:23-08:00	
Fashion designer describes invitation to work on Notre Dame cathedral's reopening as 'a calling'	PARIS (AP) — When Jean-Charles de Castelbajac watched as Notre Dame cathedral burned in April 2019, he felt compelled to act somehow. Returning home, the French fashion designer began sketching ideas, imagining the monument’s reconstruction. So, when the Paris Archbishop’s emissary approached him to design the liturgical garments for the cathedral's reopening next month, Castelbajac — a believer with personal roots with the church — felt the moment transcended mere coincidence. 'It’s bigger than a job. It’s a bit mysterious … mysterious,' Castelbajac said, his eyes brimming with wonder as he previewed some of the 2,000 colorful pieces for 700 celebrants at his Paris home. 'It's a calling. To be called like that is synchronicity.' This duty, as he calls it, led to a collection of work crafted in collaboration with the esteemed artisans of 19M studio. The garments, often in thick off-white Scottish wool gabardine, blend his signature eye-popping pop-art aesthetic with a reverence for the cathedral’s centuries-old legacy with medieval touches. The unorthodox designs are fun, modern — and perhaps shockingly minimalist. They undoubtedly break with the richly embellished styles associated with the cathedral's near-900-year-old liturgical garb. At their center is a large gold cross, accented by debris fragments of vivid color-blocked red, blue, yellow, and green velvet. 'It’s something that is exploded that reconstructs itself,' Castelbajac said, likening the dissipated shards coming together to the cathedral’s own rebirth. The commission was not subject to an open call. Instead, Castelbajac was handpicked by the Catholic leadership, due to his history of designing for the church. In 1997, he created the rainbow-colored robes worn by Pope John Paul II for World Youth Day in Paris, garments later enshrined in Notre Dame’s treasury as a relic. That connection carried a special weight during the fire. 'As I watched the fire, I was thinking, ‘Are the relics burning? Are the relics safe?’ So my link was not just material. It’s really a strong spiritual link,' he said. For Castelbajac, 74, the memory of those two hours in 2019 spent watching the fire with his wife amid people praying on their knees still evokes both grief and determination. 'It was not Notre Dame burning. It was hope burning. It was spirituality burning. It was such an intense moment … I was thinking, what can I do?' he said. The vestments, which will be worn in liturgies permanently — forever, as Castelbajac put it — carry a sense of continuity with his past work. The designs are a variation on the pontiff’s robes, infused with Castelbajac’s signature aesthetic: bright, almost childlike hues that evoke optimism. Castelbajac’s fascination with color began as a child in a military boarding school in Normandy, an experience he recalled as stifling and gray. 'It was the absolute loneliness. It was colorless,' he said. For the young boy, color became a lifeline. 'Color was like my teddy bear, my transitional element in a world of conflict. Each morning, there was the stained glass in the church and the coats of arms in the refectory that filled my world with primary colors,' he explained. This obsession would define his career, earning him a reputation as a provocateur in the fashion world. Castelbajac’s creations have dressed pop culture royalty for decades: Madonna in her teddy bear coat, Beyoncé in sequins, Rihanna in a Donald Duck costume. Collaborating with Andy Warhol, Keith Haring, and Jean-Michel Basquiat, he fused art and fashion into a playground of exuberance. While his designs have graced runways and music icons, Castelbajac’s work for Notre Dame strikes a different, more personal chord. The playful vestments might raise eyebrows among traditional Catholics, but he has no doubt about the faith Notre Dame’s leadership placed in him. 'Maybe I have the trust of the archbishop,' he mused, reflecting on the 'carte blanche' he said he received for his designs. This combination produced a modern-looking body of work that reflects the unity, hope, and rebirth symbolized by Notre Dame itself—just like the phoenix-like rooster gleaming like fire atop the newly constructed spire. When the cathedral reopens on the weekend of Dec. 7-8, Castelbajac hopes the vestments will be viewed by the world as a testament to renewal and the 'power of color' to heal and inspire.	https://apnews.com/article/notre-dame-designer-castelbajac-fashion-ab4fcfe8638c0250fab550e21970138f	2024-11-21T04:30:57-08:00	
Jannik Sinner leads Italy back to the Davis Cup semifinals and a rematch against Australia	MALAGA, Spain (AP) — No. 1-ranked Jannik Sinner won matches in singles and doubles to lead defending champion Italy to a 2-1 comeback victory over Argentina on Thursday, earning a return trip to the Davis Cup semifinals. 'I’m here trying to do the best I can in the singles,' Sinner said. 'If they put me on the court in doubles, I’ll also try my best.' On Saturday, Italy will face Australia in a rematch of last year's final, but this time it will only be for a chance to play for the championship. Australia eliminated the U.S. 2-1 earlier Thursday to reach the final four at the team competition for the third consecutive year. The other semifinal, to be contested Friday, is the Netherlands against Germany. The Dutch got past Rafael Nadal and Spain in the quarterfinals earlier in the week, sending the 22-time Grand Slam champion into retirement. Italy fell behind 1-0 in the quarterfinals when Argentina’s Francisco Cerúndolo defeated Lorenzo Musetti 6-4, 6-1 on an indoor hard court at the Palacio de Deportes Jose Maria Martina Carpena in southern Spain. But then in stepped Sinner, whose season already includes two Grand Slam trophies — at the Australian Open and U.S. Open — plus the title at the ATP Finals last weekend in Turin, Italy. First he overwhelmed Sebastián Báez 6-2, 6-1. Then Sinner teamed with 2021 Wimbledon runner-up Matteo Berrettini in the deciding doubles match to win 6-4, 7-5 against Andres Molteni and Maximo Gonzalez. 'He carried me today,' Sinner said about Berrettini. After arriving late to Malaga from Turin, Sinner did not get a chance to practice on the Davis Cup competition court before taking on Báez and stretching his streak to 22 sets won in a row. 'In three minutes, he was perfectly comfortable on court,' Italy captain Filippo Volandri said. 'He’s a special one.' Volandri swapped out his original doubles team, Simone Bolelli and Andrea Vavassori, for Sinner and Berrettini, and the change paid dividends. Australia, the Davis Cup runner-up the last two years, advanced when Matt Ebden and Jordan Thompson beat the surprise, last-minute American pairing of Ben Shelton and Tommy Paul 6-4, 6-4 in that quarterfinal's deciding doubles match. The Shelton-Paul substitution for Paris Olympics silver medalists Austin Krajicek and Rajeev Ram was announced about 15 minutes before the doubles match began. Ebden and John Peers beat Krajicek and Ram in the Summer Games final in August. The Australians broke once in each set of the doubles. In the second, they stole one of Shelton’s service games on the fourth break opportunity when Ebden’s overhead smash made it 5-4. Thompson then served out the victory, closing it with a service winner before chest-bumping Ebden. The 21st-ranked Shelton made his Davis Cup debut earlier Thursday in singles against 77th-ranked Thanasi Kokkinakis, who emerged from a tight-as-can-be tiebreaker by saving four match points and eventually converting his seventh to win 6-1, 4-6, 7-6 (14). No. 4 Taylor Fritz, the U.S. Open runner-up, then pulled the Americans even with a far more straightforward victory over No. 9 Alex de Minaur, 6-3, 6-4. When their match finally ended, on a backhand by Shelton that landed long, Kokkinakis dropped onto his back and pounded his chest. After he rose, he threw a ball into the stands, then walked over to Australia’s sideline, spiked his racket and yelled, before hugging captain Lleyton Hewitt. 'I don’t know if I’ve been that pumped up in my life. I wanted that for my team,' said Kokkinakis, who won the 2022 Australian Open men’s doubles title with Nick Kyrgios. 'It could have gone either way, but I kept my nerve.' ___ AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis	https://apnews.com/article/davis-cup-score-us-australia-italy-argentina-12664dd8497122489d49d345a6f22792	2024-11-21T03:17:14-08:00	
Top war-crimes court issues arrest warrants for Netanyahu, ex-defense minister and a Hamas leader	THE HAGUE (AP) — The world’s top war-crimes court issued arrest warrants Thursday for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his former defense minister and Hamas’ military chief, accusing them of crimes against humanity in connection with the 13-month war in Gaza. The warrants said there was reason to believe Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant have used 'starvation as a method of warfare' by restricting humanitarian aid and have intentionally targeted civilians in Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza — charges Israeli officials deny. The action by the International Criminal Court came as the death toll from Israel’s campaign in Gaza passed 44,000 people, according to local health authorities, who say more than half of those killed were women and children. Their count does not differentiate between civilians and combatants. Experts say hunger has become widespread across Gaza and may have reached famine levels in the north of the territory, which is under siege by Israeli troops. Netanyahu condemned the warrant against him, saying Israel 'rejects with disgust the absurd and false actions' by the court. In a statement released by his office, he said: 'There is nothing more just than the war that Israel has been waging in Gaza.' Gallant, in a statement, said the decision 'sets a dangerous precedent against the right to self-defense and moral warfare and encourages murderous terrorism.' The decision turns Netanyahu and the others into internationally wanted suspects and could further isolate them, putting them at risk of arrest when they travel abroad. Its practical implications could be limited since Israel and its major ally, the United States, are not members of the court. Still, the warrant marked the first time that a sitting leader of a major Western ally has been accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity by a global court of justice. It put Israel's allies, including some of its closest European friends, in an awkward position. Several leaders, including France, welcomed the court's decision and signaled they might arrest Netanyahu if he visited. The move 'represents the most dramatic step yet in the court’s involvement in the conflict between Israel and Hamas,' said Anthony Dworkin, senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. Israeli leaders, politicians and officials across the spectrum denounced the warrants and the ICC. The new defense minister, Israel Katz, who replaced Gallant earlier this month, said Thursday’s decision is 'a moral disgrace, entirely tainted by antisemitism, and drags the international judicial system to an unprecedented low.' Human rights groups applauded the move. The warrants against both sides 'break through the perception that certain individuals are beyond the reach of the law,' the associate international justice director at Human Rights Watch, Balkees Jarrah, said in a statement. The decision came six months after ICC Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan requested the warrants. The court issued a warrant for Mohammed Deif, head of Hamas’ armed wing, over the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks that triggered Israel’s offensive in Gaza. It said it found reasonable grounds to believe Deif was involved in murder, rape, torture and the taking of hostages amounting to war crimes and crimes against humanity. In the Hamas-led attack, militants stormed into southern Israel, killing 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and taking some 250 others hostage. Around 100 Israelis remain captive in Gaza, around a third of them believed to be dead. Khan withdrew requests for warrants for two other senior Hamas figures, Yahya Sinwar and Ismail Haniyeh, who have both since been killed. Israel says it also killed Deif in an airstrike, but Hamas has never confirmed his death. The warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant were issued by a three-judge panel in a unanimous decision. The panel said there were reasonable grounds to believe that both men bear responsibility for the war crime of starvation and the crimes against humanity of murder, persecution and other inhumane acts. The judges said the lack of food, water, electricity, fuel and specific medical supplies created conditions 'calculated to bring about the destruction of part of the civilian population in Gaza,' including the deaths of children due to malnutrition and dehydration. They also found that by preventing hospital supplies and medicine from getting into Gaza, doctors were forced to operate, including performing amputations, without anesthesia or with unsafe means of sedation that led to 'great suffering.' The judges also rejected an Israeli petition challenging the court’s jurisdiction on the grounds that Israel is not a member state in the tribunal. Despite the warrants, none of the suspects is likely to face judges in The Hague anytime soon. Member countries are required to detain suspects facing a warrant if they set foot on their soil, but the court has no way to enforce that. For example, Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is wanted on an ICC warrant for alleged war crimes in Ukraine, recently visited Mongolia, a member state in the court but also a Russian ally. He was not arrested. Still, the threat of arrest now complicates any travel abroad by Netanyahu and Gallant — including to close allies of Israel. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the warrants are binding on all 27 members countries of the European Union. France signaled it could arrest Netanyahu if he came to its territory. Foreign Ministry spokesman Christophe Lemoine called it a 'complex legal issue' but said France supports the court’s actions. 'Combating impunity is our priority,' he said. 'Our response will align with these principles.' Hamas in a statement welcomed the warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant but made no mention of the one against Deif. Israel’s opposition leaders fiercely criticized the ICC’s move. Benny Gantz, a retired general and political rival to Netanyahu, said it showed 'moral blindness' and was a 'shameful stain of historic proportion that will never be forgotten.' Yair Lapid, another opposition leader, called it a 'prize for terror.' Israel’s campaign has caused heavy destruction across Gaza, decimated parts of the territory and driven almost the entire population of 2.3 million people from their homes, leaving most dependent on aid to survive. Two days after Hamas’ attack on southern Israel, Gallant announced a total seal on Gaza, vowing not to let in food, fuel or other supplies. Under U.S. pressure, Israel began allowing a trickle of humanitarian aid to enter a few weeks later. Israel now says it puts no limit on the amount of supplies into Gaza. Still, the flow of food and other goods is at nearly the lowest levels of the war, and the U.N. and other groups have said Israeli military restrictions are largely to blame, along with widespread lawlessness that has led to theft of aid shipments. The case at the ICC is separate from another legal battle Israel is waging at the top U.N. court, the International Court of Justice, in which South Africa accuses Israel of genocide, an allegation Israeli leaders staunchly deny. Lawyers for Israel argued in court that the war in Gaza was a legitimate defense of its people and that it was Hamas militants who were guilty of genocide. ___ Associated Press journalists Raf Casert in Brussels, Mike Corder in The Hague and Josef Federman in Jerusalem contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/icc-israel-hamas-warrants-netanyahu-palestinian-arrest-73c854d072e0a1a41b19b2cb2cdd07fa	2024-11-21T03:02:05-08:00	
Middle East latest: Netanyahu denounces international court arrest warrant against him	The International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants on Thursday for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his former defense minister and Hamas officials, accusing them of war crimes and crimes against humanity. The announcement came as health officials in the Gaza Strip said the death toll from the 13-month-old war between Israel and Hamas has surpassed 44,000. Netanyahu condemned the arrest warrant against him, saying Israel 'rejects with disgust the absurd and false actions.' In a statement released by his office, he said: 'There is nothing more just than the war that Israel has been waging in Gaza.' On Thursday, the Health Ministry in Gaza said 44,056 people have been killed and 104,268 wounded since the start of the war. It has said the real toll is higher because thousands of bodies are buried under rubble or in areas that medics cannot access. The Gaza Health Ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count, but it has said that more than half of the fatalities are women and children. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. Israel launched its war against Hamas after Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. The Israeli offensive has caused heavy destruction across wide areas of the coastal territory and displaced 90% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million people. Israel has also launched airstrikes against Lebanon after the Hezbollah militant group began firing rockets, drones and missiles into Israel the day after Hamas' attack last October. A full-blown war erupted in September after nearly a year of lower-level conflict. More than 3,500 people have been killed in Lebanon, according to the country’s Health Ministry, and over 1 million people have been displaced. It is not known how many of those killed were Hezbollah fighters and how many were civilians. On the Israeli side, Hezbollah’s aerial attacks have killed more than 70 people and driven some 60,000 from their homes. ___ Here’s the Latest: Israeli military opens probe into death of a man in Hezbollah ambush JERUSALEM -- The Israeli military has launched an investigation into the death of a 70-year-old Israeli man who entered Lebanon with Israeli forces and was killed in a Hezbollah ambush. Investigators are trying to determine, among other things, who allowed Zeev Erlich into the combat zone with the forces and why he was permitted to enter. According to Israeli media reports, Erlich was not on active duty when he was shot, but was wearing a military uniform and had a weapon. The army said he was a reservist with the rank of major and identified him as a 'fallen soldier' when it announced his death. Erlich was a well-known West Bank settler and researcher of Jewish history. Media reports said Erlich was permitted to enter Lebanon to explore a local archaeological site. The army said a 20-year-old soldier was killed in the same incident, while an officer was badly wounded. The army announced Thursday that the chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, has appointed a team of experts 'to examine and strengthen operational discipline and military culture' following the incident. It said its commander for northern Israel, Maj. Gen. Ori Gordin, would launch a separate 'command inquiry,' while Israeli military police conduct a separate probe. Such investigations can lead to criminal charges. At least 29 killed by Israeli strikes across Lebanon, state media reports BEIRUT — At least 29 people were killed Thursday in Israeli strikes on different towns and villages across Lebanon, according to Lebanon’s Health Ministry and state-run media. In eastern Lebanon, Israeli airstrikes killed 26 people in six different towns in Baalbek province, the health ministry and the National News Agency said. In Tyre province, southern Lebanon, three people were killed in an Israeli strike, the health ministry said. The health ministry Wednesday said that over 3,550 people have been killed in the 13-month war between Hezbollah and Israel, the majority following Israel’s escalation in late September. EU foreign policy chief says ICC arrest warrants are binding on all bloc members The European Union's foreign policy chief has underlined that the arrest warrants issued by the International Criminal Court against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Hamas officials are a legal and not political matter, and that they are binding on all 27 EU member countries and other signatories to the ICC to implement. 'The tragedy in Gaza has to stop,' Josep Borrell told reporters during a visit to Jordan. 'It is not a political decision. It is the decision of an international court of justice, and the decision of the court has to be respected, and implemented.' 'This decision is a binding decision on all state parties of the court, which include all members of the European Union,' he added. Turkey's ruling party welcomes warrant against Netanyahu ANKARA — Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s ruling partyhas welcomed the decision by the International Criminal Court to issue arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamn Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, calling it a judgement made for the sake of 'humanity.' Omer Celik, spokesman for the Erdogan’s party, said on the social media platform X that Netanyahu and Gallant would 'eventually be held accountable for genocide.' Celik also criticised Israeli officials who described the ICC decision as antisemitic. Turkey is among the most vocal critics of Israel’s military actions in Gaza and has submitted a formal request to join a genocide case that South Africa has filed against Israel at the U.N.’s International Court of Justice. Dutch minister says his country would arrest Netanyahu if he visits Dutch foreign minister Caspar Veldkamp, whose country hosts the International Criminal Court, has confirmed The Netherlands would arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if he arrived on Dutch soil. 'The line from the government is clear. We are obliged to cooperate with the ICC ... we abide 100% by the Rome Statute,' he said in response to a question in parliament Thursday. Other European officials were more cautious. In France, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry said he supported the International Criminal Court's prosecutor but declined to comment when asked more specifically if France would arrest Netanyahu if he were to step on French soil. 'Today, combating impunity is our priority. We ratified the ICC Statute in 2000 and have consistently supported the court’s actions. Our response will align with these principles,' Christophe Lemoine told reporters at a press conference. Lemoine added that the warrants were 'a complex legal issue ... It’s a situation that requires a lot of legal precautions.' In Italy, the foreign and justice ministries didn’t immediately respond to emails seeking comment about whether Italy, an ICC member which hosted the Rome conference that gave birth to the court, would honor the arrest warrant. Premier Giorgia Meloni hosted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in March 2023 and has strongly supported Israel since Oct. 7, while providing humanitarian aid for Palestinians in Gaza. Israeli president says arrest warrants signal 'dark day for justice' JERUSALEM — Israel’s mostly ceremonial president, Isaac Herzog, has called the International Criminal Court's arrest warrants against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 'a dark day for justice. A dark day for humanity.' In a post on X, he said the international court 'has chosen the side of terror and evil over democracy and freedom, and turned the very system of justice into a human shield for Hamas’ crimes against humanity.' Israel Katz, Israel’s new defense minister, said the decision was 'a moral disgrace, entirely tainted by antisemitism, and drags the international judicial system to an unprecedented low.' He said it 'serves Iran, the head of the snake, and its proxies.' Benny Gantz, a retired general and political rival to Netanyahu, also condemned the decision, saying it showed 'moral blindness' and was a 'shameful stain of historic proportion that will never be forgotten.' Hamas welcomes warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant Hamas has welcomed the decision by the International Criminal Court to issue warrants against Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister Yoav Gallant, calling it an 'important and historic precedent' after what it said was decades of injustice at the hands of a 'fascist occupation.' The statement did not refer to the warrants issued for the militant group’s own leaders. Hamas called on all nations to 'cooperate with the court in bringing the Zionist war criminals, Netanyahu and Gallant, to justice, and to work immediately to stop the crimes of genocide against innocent civilians in the Gaza Strip.' Bakeries reopen in central Gaza after flour shortages DEIR AL-BALAH, The Gaza Strip — Bakeries have reopened in the central Gaza Strip after being closed for several days because of flour shortages. The shortages appear to have been linked to the looting of nearly 100 truckloads of aid by armed men in southern Gaza last weekend. Associated Press footage showed a crowd of hundreds pushing and shouting outside a bakery in the central city of Deir al-Balah on Thursday. The day before the reopening, the price of a bag of 15 loaves of pita bread had climbed above $13. 'In my house, there is not a morsel of bread, and the children are hungry,' said Sultan Abu Sultan, who was displaced from northern Gaza during the war. The amount of aid entering Gaza plunged in October as Israel launched a major offensive in the isolated north, where experts say famine may be underway. Hunger is widespread across the territory, even in central Gaza where aid groups have more access. Humanitarian organizations say Israeli restrictions, ongoing fighting and the breakdown of law and order make it difficult to deliver assistance. Israel’s offensive, launched after Hamas’ October 2023 attack, has displaced around 90% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million people. Hundreds of thousands are crammed into tent camps with little in the way of public services and are reliant on international food aid. Cyprus says EU must no longer stand by as an observer to the MidEast NICOSIA — The president of Cyprus says the European Union must play a bigger role in the Middle East as it can no longer stand by as an observer. President Nikos Christodoulides said the 27-member bloc needs to establish closer ties with countries that bolster regional stability like Egypt, Jordan and the Gulf states. 'The conflict in the Middle East is taking place on the EU’s doorstep, in an area of vital interest to the bloc’s interests, where any escalation or regional spillover will have significant consequences on its security and stability,' Christodoulides told an Economist conference in the Cypriot capital. Christodoulides said EU member Cyprus for years has tried to get this message across to Brussels. The island nation earlier this year was the staging ground for a maritime corridor delivering some 20,000 tons of humanitarian aid to Gaza. The EU is wracked by members’ divisions over how peace should come about in the Middle East International Criminal Court issues arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Hamas officials THE HAGUE — The International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants on Thursday for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his former defense minister and Hamas officials, accusing them of war crimes and crimes against humanity over the war in Gaza and the October 2023 attacks that triggered Israel’s offensive in the Palestinian territory. The decision turns Netanyahu and the others into internationally wanted suspects and is likely to further isolate them and complicate efforts to negotiate a cease-fire to end the 13-month conflict. But its practical implications could be limited since Israel and its major ally, the United States, are not members of the court and several of the Hamas officials have been subsequently killed in the conflict. Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders have previously condemned ICC Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan’s request for the warrants as disgraceful and antisemitic. U.S. President Joe Biden also blasted the prosecutor and expressed support for Israel’s right to defend itself against Hamas. Hamas also slammed the request.

Around 90% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million people have been displaced, often multiple times, and hundreds of thousands are living in squalid tent camps with little food, water or basic services. Israel says it tries to avoid harming civilians and blames their deaths on Hamas because the militants operate in residential areas, where they have built tunnels, rocket launchers and other military infrastructure. Rocket from Lebanon kills 1, wounds 2 others in northern Israel JERUSALEM — A rocket fired from Lebanon killed a man and wounded two others in northern Israel on Thursday, according to the Magen David Adom rescue service. The service said paramedics found the body of the man in his 30s near a playground in the town of Nahariya, near the border with Lebanon, after a rocket attack on Thursday. Israel meanwhile struck targets in southern Lebanon and several buildings south of Beirut, the Lebanese capital, after warning people to evacuate.	https://apnews.com/article/mideast-wars-israel-gaza-lebanon-5dbfc18c7311a6b3eb16c89981bd3dfb	2024-11-21T03:00:32-08:00	
Death toll in Gaza from Israel-Hamas war passes 44,000, Palestinian officials say	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — The death toll in the Gaza Strip from the 13-month-old war between Israel and Hamas has surpassed 44,000, local health officials said Thursday.

The Israeli offensive has caused heavy destruction across wide areas of the coastal territory, leading many to wonder when or how it will ever be rebuilt. Around 90% of the population of 2.3 million people have been displaced, often multiple times, and hundreds of thousands are living in squalid tent camps with little food, water or basic services. Israel says it tries to avoid harming civilians and blames their deaths on Hamas because the militants operate in residential areas, where they have built tunnels, rocket launchers and other military infrastructure. Palestinian officials and rights groups accuse Israeli forces of war crimes and crimes against humanity, and the United Nations’ top court is considering allegations of genocide brought by South Africa. The Israeli government adamantly denies the allegations, accusing critics of being biased against it. In recent weeks, the amount of humanitarian aid entering Gaza has plummeted, prompting the United States to threaten to reduce its military support for Israel before backing down, citing limited progress. Experts have warned that isolated, war-ravaged northern Gaza could already be experiencing famine. The United States, Egypt and Qatar spent months trying to broker a cease-fire agreement in which Hamas would release the remaining hostages in exchange for an end to the war. Those talks ground to a halt over the summer, with Israel and Hamas each accusing the other of making unacceptable demands. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to end the wars in the Middle East without saying how. His previous administration gave unprecedented support to Israel and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s hard-line policies toward the Palestinians. ___ Khaled reported from Cairo. ___ Find more of AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-lebanon-hezbollah-iran-news-11-20-2024-5da3ce43df8662fe9eeab4ad804bdc0f	2024-11-21T02:39:23-08:00	
At least 38 killed as gunmen open fire on vehicles carrying Shiites in northwest Pakistan	PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) — Gunmen opened fire on vehicles carrying Shiite Muslims in Pakistan's restive northwest on Thursday, killing at least 38 people, including six women, and wounding 20 others in one of the region's deadliest such attacks in recent years, police said. The attack happened in Kurram, a district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province where sectarian clashes between majority Sunni Muslims and minority Shiites have killed dozens of people in recent months. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the latest attack. It came a week after authorities reopened a key highway in the region that had been closed for weeks following deadly clashes. Local police official Azmat Ali said several vehicles were traveling in a convoy from the city of Parachinar to Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, when gunmen opened fire. He said at least 10 passengers were in critical condition at a hospital. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said at least 38 people were killed in the 'terrorist attack.' Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the attack, and Sharif said those behind the killing of innocent civilians will not go unpunished. A witness, 35-year-old Mir Hussain, said he saw four gunmen emerge from a vehicle and open fire on buses and cars. 'I think other people were also firing at the convoy of vehicles from nearby open farm field,' he said. 'The firing continued for about 40 minutes.' He said he hid until the attackers fled. 'I heard cries of women, and people were shouting for the help,' he said. Ibne Ali Bangash, a relative of one of the victims, described the convoy attack as the saddest day in Kurram's history. 'More than 40 people from our community have been martyred,' he said. 'It’s a shameful matter for the government.' Baqir Haideri, a local Shiite leader, denounced the assault and said the death toll was likely to rise. He accused local authorities of not providing adequate security for the convoy of more than 100 vehicles despite fears of possible attacks by militants who had recently threatened to target Shiites in Kurram. Shop owners in Parachinar announced a strike on Friday to protest the attack. Shiite Muslims make up about 15% of the 240 million population of Sunni-majority Pakistan, which has a history of sectarian animosity between the communities. Although they live together largely peacefully, tensions have existed for decades in some areas, especially in parts of Kurram, where Shiites are the majority. Nearly 50 people from both sides were killed over a land dispute in July when clashes between Sunni and Shiites erupted in Kurram. Initially, the clashes between between Sunni Muslims and Shiites began over a dispute on land in July, but then the lingering dispute turned into a sectarian violence, resulting into killing of dozens of people from both sides. Pakistan is tackling violence in the northwest and southwest, where militants and separatists often target police, troops and civilians. Most of the violence in these areas has been blamed on the Pakistani Taliban, a separate militant group but closely allied with Afghanistan's Taliban rulers, and the separatists in southwestern Balochestan province who are mainly members of the outlawed Baloch Liberation Army. ___ Associated Press writers Asim Tanveer, Rasool Dawar and Ishtiaq Mahsud in Multan, Peshawar, and Dera Ismail Khan in Pakistan contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-gunmen-opened-fire-convoy-vehicles-northwest-42c8fb3cf1f720de49efebd306d76fa1	2024-11-21T01:26:35-08:00	
UK watchdog slams family of fundraiser Capt. Tom Moore for making personal gains from charity	LONDON (AP) — Britain’s charity regulator on Thursday sanctioned the daughter and son-in-law of Capt. Tom Moore, saying they personally benefited from a charity set up in the name of the World War II veteran who raised millions of pounds by walking laps of his garden during the coronavirus pandemic. Moore, who died in 2021 at 100 years old, raised almost 39 million pounds ($49 million) through his daily walks, inspiring people across the U.K. who followed his exploits in daily TV updates during the early weeks of the pandemic. All of that money was donated to Britain’s National Health Service. The problems began after Moore’s family established the Captain Tom Foundation to continue his fundraising efforts. The Charity Commission for England and Wales slammed his daughter and son-in-law in a damning report that found they made almost 1.5 million pounds ($1.9 million) from activities linked to the charity, including a book deal and an 18,000-pound fee to attend an awards ceremony. The foundation has urged the family to rectify matters by returning the funds due to the charity. The regulator has barred Moore's daughter, Hannah Ingram-Moore, from serving as a trustee for any charity for 10 years and her husband, Colin, for a period of eight years. The Ingram-Moores said the report treated them unfairly and that the charity watchdog had a 'predetermined agenda.' 'True accountability demands transparency, not selective storytelling,’’ the family said in a statement. 'We remain dedicated to upholding Captain Sir Tom’s legacy and want the public to know, that there has never been any misappropriation of funds or unauthorized payments from the charity’s bank account, by any member of our family.'	https://apnews.com/article/capt-tom-covid-19-pandemic-charity-138e7825dacafa23c00df2361ac01e6c	2024-11-21T00:36:46-08:00	
Ukraine says Russia has launched an ICBM in an attack for the first time in the war	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine says Russia launched an intercontinental ballistic missile overnight targeting Dnipro city in the central-east of the country, which, if confirmed, would be the first time Moscow has used such a missile in the war. In a statement Thursday on the Telegram messaging app, Ukraine's air force did not specify the exact type of missile, but said it was launched from Russia’s Astrakhan region, which borders the Caspian Sea. It said an intercontinental ballistic missile was fired at Dnipro city along with eight other missiles, and that the Ukrainian military shot down six of them. Two people were wounded as a result of the attack, and an industrial facility and a rehabilitation center for people with disabilities were damaged, according to local officials. While the range of an ICBM would seem excessive for use against Ukraine, such missiles are designed to carry nuclear warheads, and the use of one would serve as a chilling reminder of Russia’s nuclear capability and a powerful message of potential escalation. The development comes as the war has taken on a growing international dimension with the arrival of North Korean troops to help Russia on the battlefield — a development that U.S. officials said prompted U.S. President Joe Biden’s policy shift on allowing Ukraine to fire longer-range U.S. missiles into Russia. The Kremlin responded with threats to escalate further. The attack comes two days after Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a revised nuclear doctrine that formally lowers the threshold for the country's use of nuclear weapons. Ukraine on Tuesday fired several American-supplied longer-range missiles and reportedly fired U.K.-made Storm Shadows on Wednesday into Russia. Putin has previously warned the U.S. and other NATO allies that allowing Ukraine to use Western-supplied longer-range weapons to hit Russian territory would mean that Russia and NATO are at war. The new doctrine allows for a potential nuclear response by Moscow even to a conventional attack on Russia by any nation that is supported by a nuclear power. While the doctrine envisions a possible nuclear response by Russia to a conventional strike, it is formulated broadly to avoid a firm commitment to use nuclear weapons and keep Putin’s options open.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-icbm-attackddnipro-38b0faf6eed2cef98bdbc9be18f58244	2024-11-21T00:12:40-08:00	
One Tech Tip: How to get started with Bluesky	LONDON (AP) — Looking for a new social media platform because X, Threads and Mastodon just aren't cutting it? You could try Bluesky. People seeking to avoid chaos, noise and political bluster in the aftermath of the U.S. elections are noticing a different mood on the Bluesky social platform, where the vibe is seemingly welcoming and there are noticeably fewer trolls. The site announced it had rapidly added more than a million new users in the week after Election Day, and has emerged as one of the fastest growing rivals to Elon Musk’s X and similar platforms. If you're tempted to check out the new space, here's a guide on how Bluesky works: Getting started Maybe you're not ready to commit to adding yet another social media account. No problem — you can still look around on Bluesky without signing up because all posts and profiles are public. You might get a sense of deja vu because the platform's look and feel are very similar to X. That should be no surprise because Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey was an early Bluesky champion. (Dorsey's no longer involved with Bluesky, which is owned and run by its executive team as a public benefit corporation.) If you take the plunge and get an account, you'll need a username. You'll notice Bluesky handles are a little bit different because they end by default in the site's domain, .bsky.social. You can personalize your handle to make it more memorable, by using your own website's domain or buying a custom one through Bluesky. But it might not be something most newbie users need or want to do right away. How do I find interesting people? Bluesky boasts that it gives users 'algorithmic choice' to tailor the content they're shown instead of leaving it up to the whims of a centralized system. 'Our online experience doesn’t have to depend on billionaires unilaterally making decisions over what we see,' it says. What it means is that you can follow custom feeds set up by other users, or design your own. If you tap #Feeds in the menu on the left, you'll see some default offerings like Cat Pics and Gardening. My Bangers is a list of your most popular posts by likes and Catch Up shows the site's most popular posts from the past 24 hours. You can find more by doing a search and tapping the Feeds button. There's also the usual 'Discover' feed of suggested posts and a chronological feed of accounts that you follow. To help new users settle in, Bluesky has starter packs of recommended feeds and accounts to follow, which anyone can create and share. They don’t show up in Bluesky's search results but can be found in directories online. Or someone might share one with you. After I signed up, a colleague pointed me to one for major news outlets. There are tens of thousands of starter packs, ranging from broadly appealing topics like Taylor Swift to niche interests like cargo bikes or U.K. comedians. You can follow the whole pack or scroll down the list to choose individual accounts. What about people you followed on X? There's a browser extension tool called Sky Follower Bridge that will help you find X users who've migrated to Bluesky.

You can write posts or reply to others but keep it short because there's a limit of 300 characters — 20 more than on X. You can also upload photos and videos, though videos can't be longer than 60 seconds. GIFs and emojis are, of course, available too. You can still @ people by typing in their username, like posts by tapping a heart icon or use hashtags to highlight a theme. Bluesky has added a menu to hashtags, so when you click on one you'll get different options for seeing, or muting, posts on that topic. What about trolls? Bluesky's decentralization ethos extends to the content control options it offers. For starters, users can choose in their settings menu whether to see replies, reposts or quote posts in their feed. Specific words or tags can be muted temporarily, or forever, while accounts can be muted or blocked individually, or in bulk by adding them a moderation list. You can even fine tune the level of adult content that shows up in your feed. Bluesky has a team of content moderators to police the site for material that's illegal or breaks the rules. But it's also taking a different approach by open sourcing its content moderation system in an attempt to resolve problems with traditional moderation services which it says 'lack transparency and user control.' So, individuals or groups can set up their own content filters, or labelers, that go beyond what Bluesky offers. These labelers can be used to categorize content or users, which can then be blocked or hidden. But they could also be used for informational or creative purposes, like curating or verifying content. There are labelers to identify images generated by artificial intelligence or to fact check news posts. You can find lists of labelers online. After I subscribed to a U.S. politics labeler, some posts in my feeds were flagged '!Donald Trump' or '!Democrat politician' and hidden unless I click Show. ___ Follow Kelvin Chan on Bluesky ___ Is there a tech challenge you need help figuring out?

Former UK Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott dies at age 86	LONDON (AP) — British politician John Prescott, a former merchant seaman who rose to the post of deputy prime minister, has died at age 86. Prescott’s family announced his death on Thursday. They said the politician, who had been suffering from Alzheimer’s disease, died peacefully in a care home on Wednesday with his loved ones around him. The family said Prescott had 'spent his life trying to improve the lives of others, fighting for social justice and protecting the environment.' For a decade, Prescott brought grit, humor and working-class authenticity to the government of the young, polished Tony Blair, who became prime minister in 1997. 'He was one of the most talented people I ever encountered in politics, one of the most committed and loyal, and definitely the most unusual,' Blair said. An amateur boxer in his youth, Prescott was a pugnacious politician who memorably punched a man who threw an egg at him during the 2001 general election. The uproar briefly looked like it might harm the party, and Prescott’s career. But Blair’s response -– 'John is John' -– cemented his folksy status. Prescott entered politics through the trade union movement — a once-common route that became less frequent after Blair rebranded the left-leaning party 'New Labour' and shifted its politics toward the center, He was a proud working-class figure in a country that still has few from that background at the top of politics. He unapologetically liked the finer things in life and was nicknamed 'Two Jags' by the press because he had two Jaguar luxury cars. The egg-thrower punching incident earned him another nickname: 'Two Jabs' Prescott served as Blair’s deputy between 1997 and 2007. One of his proudest achievements was working with then-U.S. Vice President Al Gore on the landmark Kyoto Protocol climate change agreement in 1997. Gore said he had 'never worked with anyone in politics — on my side of the pond or his — quite like John Prescott.' 'He fought like hell to negotiate the Kyoto Protocol and was an unwavering champion of climate action for decades to come. I’m forever grateful to John for that commitment to solving the climate crisis and will miss him as a dear friend,' Gore said in a statement. Prescott represented his home city of Hull in northern England for four decades. After Labour lost power in 2010 he was made a member of Parliament’s unelected upper chamber, the House of Lords. Former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown said Prescott was a true working-class hero. 'He wanted the good things in life for everyone and not just himself,' Brown said. 'And he showed that Britain can be a country where if you work hard you can fill your potential.' He is survived by his wife Pauline and sons Johnathan and David.	https://apnews.com/article/uk-labour-john-prescott-dies-f21a518359c106fbd86df1cc2d8a3084	2024-11-20T23:54:29-08:00	
Shares in India's Adani Group plunge 20% after US bribery, fraud indictments	NEW DELHI (AP) — Asia’s controversial richest man, Indian tycoon Gautam Adani, is again in the spotlight. His companies’ stocks plunged up to 20% on Thursday after he was indicted by U.S. prosecutors on charges he duped investors in a massive solar energy project in India by concealing that it was being facilitated by an alleged bribery scheme. In an indictment unsealed by federal prosecutors in New York on Wednesday, Adani, 62, was charged with securities fraud and conspiracy to commit securities and wire fraud. One result of the U.S. legal action is that the Adani group decided not to proceed with a proposed U.S. dollar-denominated bond offering. Adani Renewables announced the decision in letters to the Bombay Stock Exchange and the National Stock Exchange of India. Who is Gautam Adani? Adani is the son of a middle-class family in Ahmedabad in western India’s Gujarat state. Adani quit college to become a diamond trader in Mumbai, India’s financial capital. In the 1980s, he started importing plastics before establishing Adani Enterprises, which traded in everything from shoes to buckets and remains his flagship company. India opened up its economy in the 1990s and a new middle class emerged as tens of millions of people escaped poverty and the economy boomed, prompting Adani to bet on infrastructure and coal. Adani’s first big project, the Mundra port in Gujarat, opened in 1998 and is now India’s largest. Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd. is India’s biggest private port operator. Within a decade, Adani became India’s largest developer and operator of coal mines. According to Adani Power’s website, it has expanded to Australia and Indonesia and is on track to be 'one of the largest mining groups in the world.' Adani companies, India's second-largest conglomerate, operate airports in major cities, build roads, generate electricity, manufacture defense equipment, develop agricultural drones, sell cooking oil and run a media outlet. Despite his fossil fuel roots, the billionaire Adani Green aims to become the world’s largest renewable energy player by 2030. Why is Adani controversial? Adani is considered close to the Hindu nationalist government, and the political opposition has long accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of having close ties with the tycoon. They both hail from the western state of Gujarat. The businessman's critics say much of his success stems from his close ties to the government and Modi. For example, they have accused the government of adjusting bidding rules to make it easier for Adani to win contracts to operate airports. The company denies this, saying contracts were won relatively transparently. India’s main opposition immediately demanded a parliamentary committee probe into Adani Group dealings, which Jairam Ramesh, a leader of the Congress Party, said are causing 'growing monopolization in key sectors of the Indian economy, fueling inflation, and posing huge foreign policy challenges as well.' Ramesh said his party has been ``bringing out the various dimensions of these scams and the intimate nexus between the PM (Prime Minister Modi) and his favorite businessman. These questions have remained unanswered.' Last year, the Adani companies lost $68 billion in market value after short-selling firm Hindenburg Research accused Adani of 'pulling the largest con in corporate history,' triggering a massive sell-off of the group's stocks. U.S.-based Hindenburg accused Adani companies of stock price manipulation and fraud just as the group began a share offering meant to raise $2.5 billion. The Adani group dismissed Hindenburg’s allegations, saying none were 'based on independent or journalistic fact finding.' Adani’s response included documents and data tables and it said the group had made all necessary regulatory disclosures and has abided by local laws. How Adani became Asia's richest man Adani’s net worth shot up about 2,000% in recent years as share prices for his listed companies soared. Before Modi took office, Adani was friendly with the rival Congress Party, which governed Gujarat state when many of his early projects began. Adani has been 'close to every politician in power,' R N Bhaskar, a journalist who wrote a biography on Adani, told The Associated Press. Adani’s supporters say he has cleverly aligned the group’s priorities with those of the government by investing in key industries like renewable energy, defense, and agriculture. His projects overseas, in strategically important countries like neighboring Sri Lanka, help New Delhi compete with rival Beijing in the region.	https://apnews.com/article/adani-india-bribery-tycoon-modi-cd1ee53edee0df1bf00de01b044366b4	2024-11-20T23:08:50-08:00	
Southeast Asian defense chiefs discuss regional security with US, China and other partner nations	VIENTIANE, Laos (AP) — Southeast Asian defense chiefs met Thursday with China, the United States and other partner nations in Laos for security talks, which come as Beijing’s increasingly assertive stance in its claim to most of the South China Sea is leading to more confrontations. The closed-door talks put U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and Chinese Defense Minister Dong Jun in the same room a day after Dong refused a request to meet with Austin one-on-one on the sidelines of the ASEAN Defense Ministers Meetings. The U.S. and China have been working to improve frayed military-to-military communications and Austin said he regretted Dong's decision, calling it 'a setback for the whole region.' The ASEAN meetings come as member nations are looking warily toward the change in American administrations at a time of increasing maritime disputes with China. The U.S. has firmly pushed a 'free and open Indo-Pacific' policy under outgoing President Joe Biden and it is not yet clear how the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump will address the South China Sea situation. In addition to the United States and China, other nations attending the ASEAN meeting from outside Southeast Asia include Japan, South Korea, India, Russia, Australia and New Zealand. The meetings with the ASEAN dialogue partners were also expected address tensions in the Korean Peninsula, the Russia-Ukraine war, and wars in the Middle East. Before heading to Laos, Austin concluded meetings in Australia with officials there and with Japan’s defense minister. They pledged to support ASEAN and expressed their 'serious concern about destabilizing actions in the East and South China Seas, including dangerous conduct by the People’s Republic of China against Philippines and other coastal state vessels.' Along with the Philippines, ASEAN members Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei have competing claims with China in the South China Sea, which Beijing claims almost entirely as its own territory. Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos are the other ASEAN members. As China has grown more assertive in pushing its territorial claims in recent years, it and ASEAN have been negotiating a code of conduct to govern behavior in the sea, but progress has been slow. Officials have agreed to try to complete the code by 2026, but talks have been hampered by thorny issues, including disagreements over whether the pact should be binding. Chinese and Philippine vessels have clashed repeatedly this year, and Vietnam in October charged that Chinese forces assaulted its fishermen in disputed areas in the South China Sea. China has also sent patrol vessels to areas that Indonesia and Malaysia claim as their exclusive economic zones. Another thorny regional issue is the civil war and humanitarian crisis in ASEAN member Myanmar. The group’s credibility has been severely tested by the war in Myanmar, where the army ousted an elected government in 2021, and fighting has continued with pro-democracy guerillas and ethnic rebels. More than a year into an offensive initiated by three militias and joined by other resistance groups, observers estimate the military controls less than half the country. Myanmar military rulers have been barred from ASEAN meetings since late 2021, but this year the country has been represented by high-level bureaucrats, including at the summit in October. At the defense meetings, the country is represented by Zaw Naing Win, director of the Defense Ministry’s International Affairs Department. Meetings on Wednesday also discussed military cooperation, transnational haze, disinformation, border security and transnational crimes such as drugs, cyberscams and human trafficking, Thai Defense Ministry spokesperson Thanathip Sawangsang said.	https://apnews.com/article/laos-asean-defense-admm-south-china-sea-0fff658a80f81d2745c1234f5912a6c2	2024-11-20T20:28:29-08:00	
At UN climate talks, a draft of the deal gives little clarity on climate cash for developing nations	BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) — A new draft text released early Thursday which will form the basis of any deal reached at United Nations climate talks on money for developing countries to transition to clean energy and adapt to climate change left out a crucial sticking point: how much wealthy nations will pay. Negotiators at the talks — known as COP29 — in Baku, Azerbaijan, are trying to close the gap between the $1.3 trillion the developing world says is needed in climate finance and the few hundred billion that negotiators say richer nations have been prepared to give. But the EU's climate envoy Wopke Hoekstra told a meeting of negotiators set up by the COP29 Presidency on Thursday that 'the text we now have in front of us, in our view, is imbalanced, unworkable, and not acceptable.' Independent experts say that at least $1 trillion is needed in finance to help transition away from planet-warming fossil fuels and toward clean energy like solar and wind, better adapt to the effects of climate change and pay for losses and damages caused by extreme weather. No figure for climate cash leaves many disappointed Mohamed Adow, director of the think tank Power Shift Africa, also disappointment at the lack of a figure. 'We came here to talk about money. The way you measure money is with numbers. We need a cheque but all we have right now is a blank piece of paper,' he said. Iskander Erzini Vernoit, director of Moroccan climate think-tank Imal Initiative for Climate and Development, said he was 'at a loss for words at how disappointed we are at this stage to have come this far without serious numbers on the table and serious engagement from the developed countries.' He said that some developed nations 'are slowly waking up' to the fact that keeping warming to below 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times will require over a trillion dollars in finance. 'But many are still asleep at the wheel,' he said. Mariana Paoli, of Christian Aid, also laid the blame at the feet of developed nations. 'Rich countries had one job to do: lay out how much finance they are going to provide, but there’s no actual numbers in the latest text,' she said. 'It’s like developed countries are saying the dog ate their homework. A draft deal of two extremes Li Shuo, Asia Society Policy Institute Director, said the draft text on money 'presents two extreme ends of the aisle without much in between.' The talks' presidency — that puts the drafts together based on the negotiations — 'has not delivered as we had expected,' said German climate envoy Jennifer Morgan. 'We are confronted with a text on finance that is laid out to divide us, exactly at a time when the presidency should be working to unite us,' she said. 'Instead of bridging divides we see extreme positions.' In a statement, the COP29 Presidency stressed that the drafts 'are not final.' 'The COP29 Presidency’s door is always open, and we welcome any bridging proposals that the parties wish to present,' the Presidency said in a statement. It added that possible numbers for a finance goal will be released in the next iteration of the draft. There's some progress, but a lot of work left to do There are three big parts of the issue where negotiators need to find agreement: How big the numbers are, how much is grants or loans, and who contributes. Official observers of the talks from the International Institute of Sustainable Development who are allowed to sit in on the closed meetings reported that negotiators have now agreed on not expanding the list of countries that will contribute to global climate funds — at least at these talks. Linda Kalcher, of the think tank Strategic Partnerships, said on the question of grants or loans, the draft text suggests 'the need for grants and better access to finance.' She added that the lack of numbers in the draft text could be a 'bluff.' The COP29 presidency, which prepares the texts 'should know more ... than what they put on the table,' she said. Other areas that are being negotiated include commitments to slash planet-warming fossil fuels and how to adapt to climate change. But they’ve also seen little movement despite new draft deals on those issues also being published overnight, observers say. Harry Camilleri, a researcher at E3G, said the draft text on slashing fossil fuels 'is light on substance.' To move forward, countries will need to pledge ambitious updates to their national climate goals, he said. But David Tong, a campaign manager at climate advocacy group Oil Change International said 'ambition has gone missing' from that draft deal. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Why people are protesting over a deadly roof collapse in Serbia	BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — The deadly collapse of a concrete roof at a rail station in Serbia has raised tensions across the Balkan county, fueling widespread anger toward the government and protests after the failure claimed 15 lives in the northern city of Novi Sad. The station, a major hub, was recently renovated as part of a Serbian-Chinese partnership. Critics allege that corruption, poor oversight and inadequate construction work contributed to the Nov. 1 tragedy. Officials have offered conflicting information about whether the roof was part of the renovation, and its maintenance is under scrutiny. The collapse became a flashpoint for broader dissatisfaction with Serbia's authoritarian rule, reflecting growing public demands for transparency while the country undertakes large infrastructure projects, mostly with Chinese state companies. What do we know about the collapse? Very little. The rail station was built in 1964 and renovated twice in recent years as part of a wider deal between China, Serbia and Hungary to establish a fast rail connection between Belgrade and Budapest. Initially, authorities said the outer roof was not renovated during the work on the station, but they gave no explanation for why. Later, experts denied that, and images emerged that suggested at least some roof work was done after all. One of the protesters' demands has been to make public all documentation in connection with the reconstruction project. Has there been an investigation? Authorities opened a probe immediately after the collapse, promising it would be thorough and would not spare anyone regardless of position. On Thursday, 11 people were detained. The suspects, who have not been identified, face charges 'of committing criminal acts against public security, causing public danger and irregular conducting of construction work,' the Higher Prosecutor’s Office in Novi Sad said in a statement. Serbian media reported that Goran Vesic, who resigned as construction minister after the collapse, was among those detained. Prosecutors said earlier that several dozen people have been questioned. The only information about the investigation so far has come from Serbian media, which published unconfirmed reports about the companies involved in the reconstruction. Why are people protesting? In the first days after the tragedy, Serbians protested mostly in silence, holding vigils for the victims. But as time passed, grief gave way to anger, leading to a wave of demonstrations at various locations and by different groups. Most recently, protesters blocked a courthouse in Novi Sad, demanding that judicial authorities 'do their jobs.' Riot police pushed them away from the entrance, which led to scuffles and a two-day standoff this week. Chants such as 'corruption kills' also marked the protests that demanded the dissolution of the entire government over the tragedy. Protesters left symbolic handprints in red paint on government buildings, accusing authorities of having 'blood on their hands.' How did authorities react to the protests? Analysts say the government has sought to cushion the damage to its image by prolonging the investigation and apparently hoping that public anger will ease as time goes by. Serbia’s authoritarian president, Aleksandar Vucic, has repeatedly urged calm and called on people to trust institutions. He has said the investigation is complicated and takes time. But Vucic also said that 'responsibility cannot be avoided.' At the same time, police detained several activists who took part in recent protests and warned that they would not tolerate any disruptions of public order, which is widely seen as an attempt to discourage people from protesting. Why are Serbia and China teaming up on construction projects? By building roads, railways and other infrastructure, Serbia seeks to enhance its transportation links with neighboring states, while China seeks to strengthen its economic footprint in Europe. Serbia and China negotiate agreements mostly on a governmental level without the participation of outside bidders. Chinese state banks frequently provide loans to fund those projects. The loans may come with strings attached, such as the mandatory involvement of Chinese companies and their workers. Although such partnerships have brought billions of dollars in investments into the developing Balkan economy, questions surrounding quality, safety and financial sustainability often remain, as highlighted by the roof collapse. The Chinese companies that took part in the reconstruction said the concrete canopy that collapsed was not part of their work. ___ Associated Press writer Jovana Gec contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/serbia-roof-collapse-china-protests-3cfa282938b1ddec12c4795b9ecb3e95	2024-11-20T20:09:44-08:00	
At UN climate talks, 'sewage' beer from Singapore highlights water scarcity and innovations	BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) — In the sprawling pavilion section of the United Nations climate talks, where countries, nonprofits and tech companies use big, flashy signs to get the attention of the thousands of people walking through, small aqua and purple beverage cans sit conspicuously on a counter at the Singapore display. Those who approach learn that the cans are beer — a brand call NEWBrew — and free for anybody who asks. But there is something not everybody who cracks one open finds out right away, if at all: the beer is made with treated wastewater. 'I didn’t know. I was really surprised,' said Ignace Urchil Lokouako Mbouamboua, an international relations student from Congo, who recently sipped one while taking a break from the conference. 'I can even suggest that they make more and more of this kind of beer,' added Mbouamboua with a smile, sharing it was his third day in a row he stopped for a can. NEWBrew is made in Singapore with NEWater, the name of treated wastewater that's part of a national campaign to conserve every drop in one of the world’s most water-starved places. The drink, which some attendees jokingly call 'sewage beer,' is one of many examples of climate- and environment-related innovations on display during this year's climate talks, COP29, taking place in Azerbaijan. Highlighting the use of treated wastewater underscores one of the world's most pressing problems as climate change accelerates: providing drinking water to a growing population. For years, Singapore has been a leader in water management and innovations. The city-state island of 6 million people in Southeast Asia, one of the most densely populated countries, has no natural water sources. In addition to water imports from Malaysia, the other pillars of its national strategy are catchment, desalination and recycling. Authorities have said they need to ramp up all water sources, as demand is expected to double by 2065. While drinking treated wastewater is a novelty for many at the climate conference, for Singaporeans it's nothing new. National campaigns — from water conservation pleas to showing the wastewater recycling process — go back decades. In 2002, then-Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong was famously photographed drinking a bottle of NEWater after a tennis match, done to normalize its use. Ong Tze-Ch’in, chief executive of the Public Utilities Board, Singapore's national water agency, said NEWBrew was developed by a local brewery in 2018. The idea was to showcase treated wastewater at the country's biennial International Water Week. The beer was next produced in 2022, 2023, then again this year. 'It's part of the acceptance of the use of recycled water, which in general is a difficult topic,' said Ong. 'We did many things to drive it.' And is he happy with how it turned out? 'I chose this flavor,' said Ong, adding that he was part of the group that worked with the brewery for this year's version, a 'modern pilsner.' 'You know, beer is always very subjective,' he added with a laugh. After attending a panel on water management at the Singapore pavilion, Peter Rummel, director of infrastructure policy advancement at Bentley Systems, which creates infrastructure engineering software, stepped up to the counter and got a beer. Rummel told onlookers he was in a good position to judge beer, as he hailed from Munich, Germany, home to the Oktoberfest beer festival. 'It’s fresh, light, cool. It has a nice flavor,' said Rummel, while looking at the can. Wee-Tuck Tan, managing director of the local brewery, The Brewerkz Group, said they have made about 5,000 liters, or roughly 15,000 cans, for each edition of NewBrew. He said they use the same process as with other beers, and the cost is also similar, about 7 Singaporean dollars (around $5 U.S.) per can when bought in a supermarket. Wee-Tuck said he believes the beer has shifted how some in Singapore view NEWater. 'They think it tastes funny,' he said. 'When put into a beer, it changes the mindset. Most people can't tell the difference.' As problems with water scarcity grow, there is increasing embrace of the use of treated wastewater, said Saroj Kumar Jha, the World Bank Group's global water department director, who participated in the water management panel in the Singapore pavilion. Traveling to over 50 countries in the last two years, he said leaders have frequently told him it's important not to use the term 'wastewater,' and instead call it 'used water.' After the panel concluded, Jha and the other panelists opened NEWBrews and toasted. 'It's really good,' said Jha. 'It's the fourth time I've had it.' 'This year,' he added with a laugh. 'Not today.' ___ This story corrects the date of the photograph of then Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong drinking NEWater to 2002. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Sierra Leone loves rice and wants to free itself from imports. But how to do it?	FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) — Rice borders on the sacred in Sierra Leone. Unless a meal includes rice, people say, you haven’t eaten at all. But as prices soar, consumers in the West African nation are giving up other food to buy it. That's a major reason why 83% of the population is food insecure, according to the U.N.’s World Food Program. In the capital, Freetown, 28-year-old nail technician Anima Mangola dug into rice with stewed cassava leaves. 'I’d eat rice five times a day if I had me the money,' she said — even as its price has more than doubled this year. Not everyone can keep up, and 'people are suffering,' she said. Experts blame soaring prices on a heavy reliance on imports, which supply 35% of Sierra Leone's rice and eat up $200 million annually in foreign currency. Even though West Africa has a long tradition of growing rice and often excellent places to do it, experts said the import dependency is due to a lack of investment in agriculture, booming population growth and cheap rice imports from Asia. Sierra Leone's agriculture minister, Henry Kpaka Musa, accused the International Monetary Fund of pressuring Sierra Leone in the 1980s to stop investing in agriculture and open its markets to imports as a condition for receiving loans. 'We used to export rice,' Kpaka said in an interview. Now he and President Julius Bio plan to do it again. The government has raised over $620 million from global development banks this year to work towards food self-sufficiency, notably in rice, although Kpaka estimated the plan will cost $1.8 billion in all. Experts from the Ivory Coast-based research center Africa Rice have commended the plan as 'ambitious and forward-looking.' But NGOs and academics warn it will favor international agribusiness and large-scale farms, to the detriment of the nation’s 5 million smallholder farms. They point to similar, failed attempts at food self-sufficiency in places such as Burkina Faso and Ghana. Self-sufficiency challenges and potential West Africa has an ancient rice tradition dating back an estimated back 3,500 years. Historian Judith Carney said its farmers were taken as slaves to work plantations in the U.S. South, giving birth to a booming rice economy. Sierra Leone has the region's best climate and land for growing rice, with abundant annual rainfall in coastal regions. But Kpaka, the minister, highlighted obstacles to rice self-sufficiency: poor roads to connect rice-growing areas with markets, unreliable electricity for processing, climate change and poor access to finance. With the financial backing from development banks, he has approved plans to improve roads to the country's three main 'rice bowls,' create large areas of irrigated land and provide fertilizers, seeds and pesticides to smallholder farms. 'The plan starts with the infrastructure to attract the private sector to come,' he said. He has promoted the plan to unspecified international investors, offering them thousands of hectares of irrigated land. But some believe smallholders, who make up 70% of the country’s population of 8 million, will be an afterthought. The view from the field Aboubacar Kowa, a farming leader in Bo district, gathered others to discuss their rice challenges, which also included access to land and a lack of storage, training and processing capacity. They were united in their lack of optimism about government help. They’ve heard these ambitious plans before. 'We don’t get support from the government,' said one smallholder and village chief, Eric Amara Manyeh. The most common concern was the lack of labor to create irrigated fields. Eliminating vegetation and digging channels is laborious, and an exodus of young people to urban areas means farmers have to employ laborers — a cost out of reach for many. Although unemployment is high in towns, Manyeh said young people prefer easier jobs such as driving motorbike taxis. Some farmers have formed collectives to share labor, but poor tools slow progress. In one government-backed project in Bo, digging 60 hectares (148 acres) of channels took three months by 82 people. A cautionary tale Sierra Leone's goal to get chemical fertilizer, seeds and pesticides into the hands of smallholders is meant to replicate the Green Revolution in Asia, which increased rice production by over 100% in two decades. But Klara Fischer, a rural development professor at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences specializing in sub-Saharan Africa, warned that the approach exposes farmers to agribusiness giants such as Bayer Crop Science and Syngenta. An initiative called A Green Revolution for Africa. backed by the Gates Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation and others, has spent over $1 billion since 2006 to increase access to fertilizers and seeds for smallholders, but its own evaluation in 2022 said it hasn’t increased food security. The initiative is supporting Sierra Leone's efforts. One recent assessment by the German development ministry in Ghana and Burkina Faso found no evidence that providing fertilizer and seeds increased yield or profit for smallholders, and found that 41% of rice farmers struggled to pay off their debts. 'These fertilizer and seed packages are entangled with private interests,' Fischer said. She also highlighted differences between Asia in the 1970s and the current situation in Africa. One is the cheap and available family labor in Asia compared to the rural exodus in Sierra Leone. Kpaka, a former employee in the Gates Foundation's agricultural department, acknowledged concerns but was convinced his plan has the missing ingredient to unlock growth: the critical infrastructure to help farmers process and sell their rice, incentivizing them to grow more. 'If we don’t make the road, (farmers) will forever remain subsistence,' he said. A different way Others believe that Sierra Leone should spend its funding on measures that empower smallholder farms rather than big business. Joseph Randall, director of an environmental NGO in Sierra Leone, Green Scenery, said the government should support sustainable practices such as organic compost instead of becoming dependent on imported chemical fertilizer, usually from Europe or North America, which contributes heavily to global warming. Randall opposes the distribution of modern seeds, even though they are higher yielding. The hybrid varieties of rice can't be saved and replanted each year because they are bred by agribusinesses and have patents. Meanwhile, in Manyeh’s village, thunder echoed through the chief’s rice fields. He pointed to a swamp that might be cultivated as part of the self-sufficiency goal. 'The willingness is there, the potential is there,' he said. But he knows it takes more than potential to feed a nation. ___ The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

New Zealand police begin arrests for gang symbol ban as new law takes effect	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — A ban on New Zealanders wearing or displaying symbols of gang affiliation in public took effect on Thursday, with police officers making their first arrest for a breach of the law three minutes later. The man was driving with gang insignia displayed on the dashboard of his car and was among more than a dozen people arrested or summoned to appear in court for exhibiting such symbols since the law took force, New Zealand’s police said Friday. The prohibition on displaying gang insignia anywhere outside private homes, including on clothing or in vehicles, is among a suite of new measures intended to bolster police powers to disrupt the groups. Wearing or displaying the insignia of 35 listed gangs will now prompt a fine of up to 5,000 New Zealand dollars ($2,940) or up to six months in jail. New Zealand’s center-right government, which pledged ahead of last October’s election to tackle gang crime, says the measures will reduce the membership of groups responsible for violence and drug offenses. But detractors say the law breaches civil liberties and could drive gang activities underground. 'Gangs aren’t community groups. They’re not a Rotary club,' Prime Minister Christopher Luxon wrote on social media Thursday. 'They thrive on destroying the lives of other New Zealanders, whether that’s by peddling drugs or through brutal acts of violence that leave communities in fear.' Under the new law, officers can also disperse public gatherings of three or more members, bar some gang affiliates from associating with each other, and enter homes of those who keep breaking the law to search for banned items. Gang membership will now be considered by the courts when sentencing offenders. Police Minister Mark Mitchell told reporters Thursday that two people were arrested hours after the law took effect for wearing gang 'patches,' which are large insignia often worn by gang members on the backs of leather jackets or vests. The government says the patches are intimidating because members are required to earn them through violent acts. The measures shift New Zealand's response to gangs closer to that of neighboring Australia, which also uses a law to suppress the public visibility of gangs, and away from jurisdictions like the U.S. and Britain, which use criminal law to respond to specific activities carried out by organized crime groups, according to a report published by Treasury officials in February. Facial tattoos that display gang insignia are exempt from the ban, as is the wearing of gang colors. The government was criticized by some for not including white supremacist groups in its list of 35 organizations targeted by the new law. That means displaying swastikas and making Nazi salutes remains legal in New Zealand -– unlike in Australia, which banned both in a law that took effect in January. There are nearly 9,400 people on a New Zealand police list of known gang members. New Zealand’s population is 5 million. Successive governments have vowed to tackle criminal gangs, which often are linked to poverty and other deprivation. The previous center-left government was decried by Luxon’s administration for working with gangs on social initiatives, including COVID-19 vaccination efforts, while the current government has been denounced for advancing policies that are likely to ensnare some of New Zealand’s most marginalized groups, including Indigenous Māori. Official reports say three-quarters of those on the national gang list are Māori, who make up less than 20% of New Zealanders, and that 80% to 90% of those in two of the most notorious gangs are former wards of the state. Luxon made a formal apology this month for the widespread abuse of children and vulnerable adults in state care over the past seven decades.	https://apnews.com/article/gang-insignia-ban-zealand-criminal-03cdf4f97656171658da0798aa4adfe2	2024-11-20T19:40:05-08:00	
American and Australian tourists die, raising toll to 4 in Laos alcohol poisoning incident	VIENTIANE, Laos (AP) — An Australian teenager has died after drinking tainted alcohol in Vang Vieng, Laos, in what Australia's prime minister on Thursday called every parent's nightmare, and the U.S. State Department confirmed an American also died in the same party town, bringing the death toll to four. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told Parliament that 19-year-old Bianca Jones had died after being evacuated from Laos for treatment in a Thai hospital. Her friend, also 19, remains hospitalized in Thailand. 'This is every parent’s very worst fear and a nightmare that no one should have to endure,' Albanese said. 'We also take this moment to say that we’re thinking of Bianca’s friend Holly Bowles who is fighting for her life.' Shaun Bowles told reporters outside Bangkok Hospital the day before that his daughter was in critical condition and on life support. 'We just like to thank everyone from back home for all of the support and love that we’re receiving,' he said. 'But we’d also like the people to appreciate right now, we just need privacy so we can spend as much time as we can with Holly.' In a statement to the Melbourne Herald Sun newspaper, Jones' family asked for privacy in their grief. 'She was surrounded by love, and we are comforted by the knowledge that her incredible spirit touched so many lives during her time with us,' the family wrote. 'We want to express our deepest gratitude for the overwhelming support, love, and prayers we’ve received from across Australia.' The State Department confirmed to The Associated Press in an emailed statement that an American tourist had also died but said it had no further comment out of respect to the family. It said local authorities were investigating and that the U.S. was providing consular assistance. 'We offer our sincerest condolences to the family on their loss,' the State Department said. Telephone numbers listed for Laos' Health Ministry did not work and police refused to comment. Landlocked Laos is one of Southeast Asia's poorest nations and a popular tourist destination. Vang Vieng is particularly popular among backpackers seeking partying and adventure sports. Details on the alcohol poisoning began trickling out about a week after the two Australian women fell ill on Nov. 13 following a night out drinking with a group in the remote town. They are believed to have consumed drinks tainted with methanol, which is sometimes used as the alcohol in mixed drinks at disreputable bars and can cause severe poisoning or death. Thai authorities confirmed that Jones had died by 'brain swelling due to high levels of methanol found in her system.' 'Drink spiking and methanol poisoning are far too common in many parts of the world,' Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said after receiving news of Jones' death. 'At this time I would say to parents, to young people, please have a conversation about risks, please inform yourselves, please let’s work together to ensure this tragedy doesn’t happen again.' New Zealand's Foreign Ministry said Thursday that one of its citizens was also unwell in Laos and could be a victim of methanol poisoning. Denmark's Foreign Ministry, when asked about the poisoning incident, said Wednesday that two of its citizens had died in Laos but would not provide further details. 'We have updated our travel advisory for Laos to note that there have been several cases of suspected methanol poisoning after consuming alcoholic drinks,' New Zealand's Foreign Ministry said. 'Travelers are advised to be cautious about consuming alcoholic beverages, particularly cocktails and drinks made with spirits that may have been adulterated with harmful substances.' Australia also updated its travel advice, cautioning that several foreign nationals had been victims of suspected methanol poisoning in Laos this month. The U.S. did not immediately issue an updated travel advisory. On Tuesday, Duong Duc Toan, manager of the Nana Backpacker Hostel where the two Australian women stayed in Vang Vieng, told the AP that staff were told by other guests that the two women were unwell after they failed to check out as planned on Nov. 13, and they arranged transport to a hospital for them. The women were then transported to Thailand for emergency medical treatment and their parents flew in to be with them. 'All Australians offer them our deepest sympathy in this time of heartbreak,' Albanese said. 'Bianca’s trip should have been a joyous time and a source of fond memories in years to come,' he said. 'It is beyond sad that this was not to be.' ___ Rising reported from Bangkok.

Stock market today: Wall Street climbs as Nvidia swings, bitcoin rises and Alphabet sinks	NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are rising Thursday after more companies said they’re making fatter profits than expected. Market superstar Nvidia also topped forecasts, but Wall Street’s ambivalence about whether the heavyweight's report was impressive enough is keeping indexes in check. The S&amp;P 500 was 0.6% higher, as of 1:02 p.m. Eastern time, following many flips between modest gains and losses through the morning. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 543 points, or 1.3%, and the Nasdaq composite rose 0.1%. The moves were part of a busy day for financial markets, as bitcoin briefly broke above $98,000 and crude oil prices continued to rise. Nvidia was a big reason for the stock market's meandering after yet again beating analysts’ estimates for profit and revenue. It also gave a forecast for revenue in the current quarter that topped most analysts’ expectations thanks to voracious demand for its chips used in artificial-intelligence technology. Its stock initially sank in afterhours trading late on Wednesday following the release of the results. Some investors said that might have been because the market was looking for Nvidia's revenue forecast to surpass expectations by even more. But its stock then recovered in premarket trading Thursday, and Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said it was another 'flawless' profit report provided by Nvidia and CEO Jensen Huang, whom Ives calls 'the Godfather of AI.' How Nvidia’s stock performs has tremendous impact because it’s quickly grown into Wall Street’s most valuable company at nearly $3.6 trillion. That means a 1% move for it packs more weight on the S&amp;P 500 than the same move for any other stock. Nvidia's stock on Thursday quickly went from an early jump of 4.8% to a loss of 3.6% before settling at a drop of 1.3%. It was one of the heaviest weights on the S&amp;P 500. The frenzy around AI is sweeping up other stocks, and Snowflake jumped 34.2% after reporting stronger results for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The company, whose platform helps customers get a better view of all their silos of data and use AI, also reported stronger revenue growth than expected. BJ’S Wholesale Club rose 9.6% after likewise delivering a bigger profit than expected. That may help calm worries about how resilient U.S. shoppers can remain, given high prices across the economy and still-high interest rates. A day earlier, Target tumbled after reporting sluggish sales in the latest quarter and giving a dour forecast for the holiday shopping season. It followed Walmart, which gave a much more encouraging outlook. Roughly 90% of the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 were also rising, and the gains were even bigger among smaller companies. The Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks climbed a market-leading 1.8%. But Google’s parent company, Alphabet, was helping to drag on indexes. It fell 5.7% after U.S. regulators asked a judge to break up the tech giant by forcing it to sell its industry-leading Chrome web browser. In a 23-page document filed late Wednesday, the U.S. Department of Justice called for sweeping punishments that would include restrictions preventing Android from favoring its own search engine. Regulators stopped short of demanding Google sell Android but left the door open to it if the company’s oversight committee continues to see evidence of misconduct. Drops for other Big Tech stocks also weighed on the market, including slides of 1.7% for Amazon and 0.7% for Meta Platforms. In stock markets abroad, shares of India’s Adani Enterprises plunged 22.6% Thursday after the U.S. charged founder Gautam Adani, 62, in a federal indictment with securities fraud and conspiracy to commit securities and wire fraud. The businessman and one of the world’s richest people is accused of duping investors by concealing that his company’s huge solar energy project on the subcontinent was being facilitated by an alleged bribery scheme. Indexes elsewhere in Asia and Europe were mixed. In the crypto market, bitcoin is trading around $97,800 after eclipsing $98,000 for the first time. It’s more than doubled so far this year, and its climb has accelerated since Election Day. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to make the country 'the crypto capital of the planet' and create a 'strategic reserve' of bitcoin. Bitcoin and related investments, of course, have a notorious history of big price swings in both directions. MicroStrategy, a company that's been raising cash expressly to buy bitcoin, saw an early gain of 14.6% for its stock on Thursday quickly disappear. It was most recently down 1.6%. In the oil market, a barrel of benchmark U.S. crude rose 1.2% to bring its gain for the week to 3.8%. Brent crude, the international standard, climbed 1.2%. Oil has been rising amid escalations in the Russia-Ukraine war. In the bond market, Treasury yields held relatively steady following some mixed reports on the U.S. economy. The yield on the 10-year Treasury remained at 4.41% from late Wednesday. One report said fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week in the latest signal that the job market remains solid. Another report, though, said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic region unexpectedly shrank. Sales of previously occupied homes, meanwhile, strengthened last month by more than expected. ___ AP Business Writers Matt Ott and Yuri Kageyama contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/stock-markets-nvidia-rates-earnings-e42f068e3259f9d6c5d1c6e79e3a2b3a	2024-11-20T19:32:45-08:00	
Russia and China oppose changing the Kenya-led force in Haiti to a UN peacekeeping mission	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Russia and China on Wednesday opposed a U.S.-led campaign to transform the Kenya-led multinational force in Haiti helping police to tackle escalating gang violence into a U.N. peacekeeping mission. The two allies called a U.N. Security Council meeting as gangs have intensified attacks, shooting at four aircraft which has shut the airport in the capital Port-au-Prince, and a ttacking its upscale neighborhood Petionville on Tuesday. The U.N. estimates the gangs control 85% of the capital and have spread into surrounding areas. The United States proposed a U.N. peacekeeping mission in early September as one way to secure regular financing for the U.N.-backed multinational force, which faces a serious funding crisis. The U.S. tried to get the 15-member U.N. Security Council to sign off on a draft resolution last week to start the transformation. But Russia and China refused to discuss the resolution and instead called for Wednesday’s council meeting where they made their opposition clear. China’s Deputy U.N. Ambassador Geng Shuang said the council extended the mandate of the multinational force only a month ago, and discussing its transformation to a peacekeeping operation now 'will only interfere' and make it harder to tackle its funding shortfall and get all the police pledged to Haiti. Peacekeepers should only be deployed when there is peace to keep, and there is no peace in Haiti, Geng stressed. 'Deploying a peacekeeping operation at this time is nothing more than putting peacekeepers into the front line of the battles with gangs.' The multinational force was supposed to have 2,500 international police but the head of the U.N.’s political mission in Haiti, Maria Isabel Salvador, told the council late last month that only around 430 are deployed — some 400 from Kenya and the rest from the Bahamas, Belize and Jamaica. She said the U.N. trust fund that finances the multinational force and relies on voluntary contributions, 'remains critically under-resourced.' By last week, the trust fund had received $85.3 million of the $96.8 million pledged. The U.S. agreed to contribute $300 million to the force, but that total is still far below the $600 million cost to deploy a 2,500-strong force for a year. Russia’s Deputy U.N. Ambassador Dmitry Polyansky, expressing 'shock and horror' at what’s happening on the streets of Port-au-Prince, accused the U.S. and other countries that initially supported the multinational force of failing to fund it. 'Conditions on the ground in Haiti are not appropriate for U.N. peacekeepers,' he said. 'Their role is to maintain peace and not to fight crime in urban areas or to save a dysfunctional state that has been plunged into domestic conflict.' Whatever the future international presence in Haiti, Polyansky said Haitians need urgent assistance immediately which means providing the multinational force with the necessary materiel, funding and technical expertise. 'Otherwise, quite simply, there will be just nobody left to host any future peacekeepers,' he said. Haiti’s leaders have asked for a U.N. peacekeeping force, and the permanent council of the Organization of American States adopted a resolution on Nov. 13 entitled 'In Support of Haiti’s Request for a United States Peacekeeping Operation.' At the council meeting, there was also strong support for the transformation. Monica Juma, national security adviser to Kenya’s president, told the council that joint operations by the multinational force and the Haitian police have secured critical infrastructure including the police academy, national palace, national hospital and port. But it's evident the multinational force urgently needs 'a surge,' she said, and Kenya looks forward to additional deployments in the shortest possible time along with contributions of equipment and logistical support. At the same time, Juma said, Kenya 'strongly supports' the Haitian government’s appeal to the Security Council to authorize planning for the transformation of the multinational force to a U.N. peacekeeping force. U.S. deputy ambassador Dorothy Shea told the council that with Haitian, regional and Kenyan support, 'it is time for the Security Council to act to take the initial steps to realize Haiti’s request to help reestablish security for the people of Haiti.' Transitioning to a U.N. peacekeeping mission, she said, would facilitate the multinational force and the countries supporting it 'to take advantage of existing U.N. financial, personnel, and logistical support structures as well as predictable and sustainable financing.' The most poignant appeal for a peacekeeping force came from Haitian Dr. Bill Pape, who left Port-au-Prince about two weeks ago where he works to combat infectious and chronic diseases. He is also a professor at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York. Pape said he came with a message to the Security Council: The Haitian police and multinational force 'are outgunned and outnumbered.' He said he recognized the controversies of previous peacekeeping missions in Haiti. The most recent, from 2004-2017, was marred by allegations of sexual assault and the introduction of cholera, which killed nearly 10,000 people. But Pape stressed that during previous foreign interventions, which date to the early 1900s, 'insecurity did not exist at this scale.' 'I trust that seeking your support to restore security in my country is not asking too much,' he told council members. 'It is a difficult task for any Haitian to request foreign troops on our soil. But there is no alternative.'	https://apnews.com/article/un-haiti-gangs-kenya-force-peacekeeping-violence-d9ebed4a6a809d080511009b39b1b1ac	2024-11-20T19:32:00-08:00	
US regulators seek to break up Google, forcing Chrome sale as part of monopoly punishment	U.S. regulators want a federal judge to break up Google to prevent the company from continuing to squash competition through its dominant search engine after a court found it had maintained an abusive monopoly over the past decade. The proposed breakup floated in a 23-page document filed late Wednesday by the U.S. Department of Justice calls for sweeping punishments that would include a sale of Google's industry-leading Chrome web browser and impose restrictions to prevent Android from favoring its own search engine. A sale of Chrome 'will permanently stop Google’s control of this critical search access point and allow rival search engines the ability to access the browser that for many users is a gateway to the internet,' Justice Department lawyers argued in their filing. Although regulators stopped short of demanding Google sell Android too, they asserted the judge should make it clear the company could still be required to divest its smartphone operating system if its oversight committee continues to see evidence of misconduct. The broad scope of the recommended penalties underscores how severely regulators operating under President Joe Biden's administration believe Google should be punished following an August ruling by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta that branded the company as a monopolist. The Justice Department decision-makers who will inherit the case after President-elect Donald Trump takes office next year might not be as strident. The Washington, D.C. court hearings on Google's punishment are scheduled to begin in April and Mehta is aiming to issue his final decision before Labor Day. If Mehta embraces the government's recommendations, Google would be forced to sell its 16-year-old Chrome browser within six months of the final ruling. But the company certainly would appeal any punishment, potentially prolonging a legal tussle that has dragged on for more than four years. Besides seeking a Chrome spinoff and a corralling of the Android software, the Justice Department wants the judge to ban Google from forging multibillion-dollar deals to lock in its dominant search engine as the default option on Apple’s iPhone and other devices. It would also ban Google from favoring its own services, such as YouTube or its recently-launched artificial intelligence platform, Gemini. Regulators also want Google to license the search index data it collects from people’s queries to its rivals, giving them a better chance at competing with the tech giant. On the commercial side of its search engine, Google would be required to provide more transparency into how it sets the prices that advertisers pay to be listed near the top of some targeted search results. Kent Walker, Google’s chief legal officer, lashed out at the Justice Department for pursuing 'a radical interventionist agenda that would harm Americans and America’s global technology.' In a blog post, Walker warned the 'overly broad proposal' would threaten personal privacy while undermining Google’s early leadership in artificial intelligence, 'perhaps the most important innovation of our time.' Wary of Google’s increasing use of artificial intelligence in its search results, regulators also advised Mehta to ensure websites will be able to shield their content from Google’s AI training techniques. The measures, if they are ordered, threaten to upend a business expected to generate more than $300 billion in revenue this year. 'The playing field is not level because of Google’s conduct, and Google’s quality reflects the ill-gotten gains of an advantage illegally acquired,' the Justice Department asserted in its recommendations. 'The remedy must close this gap and deprive Google of these advantages.' It’s still possible that the Justice Department could ease off attempts to break up Google, especially if Trump takes the widely expected step of replacing Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter, who was appointed by Biden to oversee the agency's antitrust division. Although the case targeting Google was originally filed during the final months of Trump’s first term in office, Kanter oversaw the high-profile trial that culminated in Mehta's ruling against Google. Working in tandem with Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, Kanter took a get-tough stance against Big Tech that triggered other attempted crackdowns on industry powerhouses such as Apple and discouraged many business deals from getting done during the past four years. Trump recently expressed concerns that a breakup might destroy Google but didn’t elaborate on alternative penalties he might have in mind. 'What you can do without breaking it up is make sure it’s more fair,' Trump said last month. Matt Gaetz, the former Republican congressman that Trump nominated to be the next U.S. Attorney General, has previously called for the breakup of Big Tech companies. Gaetz faces a tough confirmation hearing. This latest filing gave Kanter and his team a final chance to spell out measures that they believe are needed to restore competition in search. It comes six weeks after Justice first floated the idea of a breakup in a preliminary outline of potential penalties. But Kanter's proposal is already raising questions about whether regulators seek to impose controls that extend beyond the issues covered in last year’s trial, and — by extension — Mehta’s ruling. Banning the default search deals that Google now pays more than $26 billion annually to maintain was one of the main practices that troubled Mehta in his ruling. It's less clear whether the judge will embrace the Justice Department’s contention that Chrome needs to be spun out of Google and or Android should be completely walled off from its search engine. 'It is probably going a little beyond,' Syracuse University law professor Shubha Ghosh said of the Chrome breakup. 'The remedies should match the harm, it should match the transgression. This does seem a little beyond that pale.' Google rival DuckDuckGo, whose executives testified during last year's trial, asserted the Justice Department is simply doing what needs to be done to rein in a brazen monopolist. 'Undoing Google’s overlapping and widespread illegal conduct over more than a decade requires more than contract restrictions: it requires a range of remedies to create enduring competition,' Kamyl Bazbaz, DuckDuckGo's senior vice president of public affairs, said in a statement. Trying to break up Google harks back to a similar punishment initially imposed on Microsoft a quarter century ago following another major antitrust trial that culminated in a federal judge deciding the software maker had illegally used his Windows operating system for PCs to stifle competition. However, an appeals court overturned an order that would have broken up Microsoft, a precedent many experts believe will make Mehta reluctant to go down a similar road with the Google case.	https://apnews.com/article/google-search-monopoly-penalty-justice-department-84e07fec51c5c59751d846118cb900a7	2024-11-20T19:01:31-08:00	
Australia's parliament considers legislation banning social media for under 16s	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Australia’s communications minister introduced a world-first law into Parliament on Thursday that would ban children under 16 from social media, saying online safety was one of parents’ toughest challenges. Michelle Rowland said TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram were among the platforms that would face fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for systemic failures to prevent young children from holding accounts. 'This bill seeks to set a new normative value in society that accessing social media is not the defining feature of growing up in Australia,' Rowland told Parliament. 'There is wide acknowledgement that something must be done in the immediate term to help prevent young teens and children from being exposed to streams of content unfiltered and infinite,' she added. X owner Elon Musk warned that Australia intended to go further, posting on his platform: 'Seems like a backdoor way to control access to the Internet by all Australians.' The bill has wide political support. After it becomes law, the platforms would have one year to work out how to implement the age restriction. 'For too many young Australians, social media can be harmful,' Rowland said. 'Almost two-thirds of 14- to 17-years-old Australians have viewed extremely harmful content online including drug abuse, suicide or self-harm as well as violent material. One quarter have been exposed to content promoting unsafe eating habits.' Government research found that 95% of Australian care-givers find online safety to be one of their 'toughest parenting challenges,' she said. Social media had a social responsibility and could do better in addressing harms on their platforms, she added. 'This is about protecting young people, not punishing or isolating them, and letting parents know that we’re in their corner when it comes to supporting their children’s health and wellbeing,' Rowland said. Child welfare and internet experts have raised concerns about the ban, including isolating 14- and 15-year-olds from their already established online social networks. Rowland said there would not be age restrictions placed on messaging services, online games or platforms that substantially support the health and education of users. 'We are not saying risks don’t exist on messaging apps or online gaming. While users can still be exposed to harmful content by other users, they do not face the same algorithmic curation of content and psychological manipulation to encourage near-endless engagement,' she said. The government announced last week that a consortium led by British company Age Check Certification Scheme has been contracted to examine various technologies to estimate and verify ages. In addition to removing children under 16 from social media, Australia is also looking for ways to prevent children under 18 from accessing online pornography, a government statement said. Age Check Certification Scheme’s chief executive Tony Allen said Monday the technologies being considered included age estimation and age inference. Inference involves establishing a series of facts about individuals that point to them being at least a certain age. Rowland said the platforms would also face fines of up to AU$50 million ($33 million) if they misused personal information of users gained for age-assurance purposes. Information used for age assurances must be destroyed after serving that purpose unless the user consents to it being kept, she said. Digital Industry Group Inc., an advocate for the digital industry in Australia, said with Parliament expected to vote on the bill next week, there might not be time for 'meaningful consultation on the details of the globally unprecedented legislation.' 'Mainstream digital platforms have strict measures in place to keep young people safe, and a ban could push young people on to darker, less safe online spaces that don't have safety guardrails,' DIGI managing director Sunita Bose said in a statement. 'A blunt ban doesn't encourage companies to continually improve safety because the focus is on keeping teenagers off the service, rather than keeping them safe when they're on it.'	https://apnews.com/article/australia-social-media-children-ban-e02305486cb44aa07dcaf2964bec4e3d	2024-11-20T16:01:29-08:00	
Human smuggling trial witness says he was separated from a family hours before they froze to death	FERGUS FALLS, Minn. (AP) — An Indian national who survived a treacherous trek across the U.S.-Canada border in blizzard conditions testified Wednesday that he got separated from a family of four shortly before they froze to death. Yash Patel took the stand on the third day of the trial of Indian national Harshkumar Ramanlal Patel, 29, and Steve Shand, 50, of Florida. Prosecutors say they put financial profit over human life when they attempted to smuggle Indian migrants across the border into Minnesota over a five-week period in December 2021 and January 2022. They say Patel ran part of the smuggling scheme and recruited Shand as a driver. Both men have pleaded not guilty to four counts related to human smuggling. Federal prosecutors say a family of four — 39-year-old Jagdish Patel; his wife, Vaishaliben, who was in her mid-30s; their 11-year-old daughter, Vihangi; and 3-year-old son, Dharmik — froze to death Jan. 19, 2022. Patel is a common Indian surname and the victims were not related to Harshkumar Patel or Yash Patel. Yash Patel, 23, testified through an interpreter that he got separated from the Patel family and walked alone for five or six hours until he found a van waiting for him, The Canadian Press reported. Prosecutors say that van was driven by Steve Shand. Witnesses called by the prosecution said conditions were brutal when the victims trudged through vast, snow-filled fields and high winds the night they tried to cross from Canada into the U.S. Windchills dropped into the minus 30s Fahrenheit that January morning and the rural area near the border offers little shelter from the brutal weather. 'It was snowing and it was very windy,' Patel said on the witness stand. 'I was very scared. I wanted to have help from someone, but there was no one.' Shand’s attorneys have said their client and the migrants were duped by Harshkumar Patel and the smuggling network. Shand believed he was hired by Patel to do legal work as a taxi driver, they said, pointing out that human smuggling rings often outsource some of their work to unwitting participants. Patel’s attorneys have argued that Shand’s defense is antagonistic and prejudicial against his client. They have also said Patel came to America to escape poverty and build a better life for himself before being unjustly accused of crimes he didn’t commit. Yash Patel said his journey to enter the U.S. illegally began when he arrived in Toronto, Canada, in December 2021 and was sent to Vancouver, then back to Toronto, then to a house in Winnipeg, The Canadian Press reported. He and a group of other Indian nationals, including a couple and two children, were loaded into a van at the house and taken to the border. But the van got stuck, and the migrants were told to get out and walk in a straight line until they came across another vehicle, he added. At some point, he got separated from the group and braved the conditions alone. After hours of walking, he made it to a van that prosecutors said was driven by Shand. A U.S. Border Patrol agent later spotted the van, pulled it over, identified Shand as the driver and arrested him along with Yash Patel and another passenger. Federal prosecutors say Harshkumar Patel and Steve Shand tried to smuggle migrants across the border as part of a sprawling international smuggling ring. Rajinder Singh, a man who has already been convicted of human smuggling, was part of same smuggling ring as Patel and Shand, they have argued. Singh testified on Tuesday that he shuttled more than 500 Indian migrants across the U.S.-Canada border over four years and made over $400,000 in the scheme.	https://apnews.com/article/immigration-canada-india-smuggling-deaths-trial-minnesota-d6b7b063853dff746bd47f145f0ffeed	2024-11-20T14:54:06-08:00	
Nicaragua's Ortega proposes reform to make him and his wife 'copresidents'	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Nicaragua's President Daniel Ortega on Wednesday proposed a constitutional reform that would officially make him and his wife, current Vice President Rosario Murillo, 'copresidents' of the Central American nation. While the initiative has to pass through the country's legislature, Ortega and Murillo's Sandinista party control the congress and all government institutions, so it is likely to be approved. The proposal also looks to expand the presidential term to six years from five. Ortega put forward another bill Wednesday that would make it illegal for anyone to enforce sanctions from the United States or other foreign bodies 'within Nicaraguan territory.' The Organization of American States general secretary's office condemned the proposed constitutional reforms Wednesday. 'The ‘reform’ document is illegitimate in form and content, it merely constitutes an aberrant form of institutionalization of the matrimonial dictatorship in the Central American country and is a definitive attack on the democratic rule of law,' it said in a statement. The proposals come amid an ongoing crackdown by the Ortega government since mass social protests in 2018 that the government violently repressed. Nicaragua's government has imprisoned adversaries, religious leaders, journalists and more, then exiled them, stripping hundreds of their Nicaraguan citizenship and possessions. Since 2018, it has shuttered more than 5,000 organizations, largely religious, and forced thousands to flee the country. Dissident groups including the Nicaraguan University Alliance quickly railed against the measures, calling them an extension of that clampdown. 'They are institutionalizing nepotism and repression, destroying the rule of law. Democracy faces its greatest threat,' the organization wrote on the social media platform X on Wednesday. Manuel Orozco, director of the migration, remittances, and development program at the Inter-American Dialogue, called Ortega's proposed reforms 'nothing but a rubber stamping formalization of a decision to guarantee presidential succession' for Murillo and their family. Ortega has referred to Murillo previously in recent years as his copresident. While rejection of international sanctions would have no immediate impact, Orozco said it could put the country at 'high financial risk' and risk further penalties from the U.S. Treasury Department. Orozco said the constitutional reform to the presidency is part of a long-term plan for the administration to stay in power, and was pushed forward Wednesday as a way to avoid provoking the incoming administration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. The analyst said Trump may not prioritize crackdowns on democratic freedoms in places like Nicaragua, but also isn't likely to 'tolerate provocations.' 'The procedure, apart from circumventing the popular will, the rule of law, creates the pathway to give Ortega extra time to stay in power,' Orozco said. Ortega was reelected to a fourth consecutive five-year term in November 2021. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/nicaragua-daniel-ortega-wife-murillo-copresidents-ea9ad1e1c89c72b04ebd0ede46d0b3d5	2024-11-20T14:41:08-08:00	
Senate rejects effort from Bernie Sanders to block some weapons for Israel over Gaza deaths	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate on Wednesday rejected an attempt by Sen. Bernie Sanders Wednesday to block sales of offensive weapons to Israel for its war in Gaza over mounting civilian deaths there. The Vermont lawmaker and a small group of Democrats sought to put legislation up for a Senate vote that would block the sale of some tank and mortar rounds and smart-bomb kits to Israel. The first attempt to block the sales was rejected overwhelmingly, and two more were expected to go down to defeat. Sanders, in making the case for stopping the sales, said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government 'has not simply waged war against Hamas. It has waged an all-out war against the Palestinian people.' Known as joint resolutions of disapproval, the measures would have had to pass both houses of Congress and withstand any presidential veto to become binding. Congress has never succeeded in blocking any arms sales with the joint resolutions. But the vote served as a test of broader frustration among Democrats at the war and President Joe Biden's handling of relations with Israel. Lawmakers' move comes after a 30-day Biden administration deadline came and went earlier this month for Netanyahu to meet specific U.S. targets to improve its treatment of Palestinian civilians in Gaza trapped in the war. U.S. demands included that Israel lift a near-total ban on delivery of aid to hard-hit north Gaza for starving civilians there. Leading global aid organizations say Israel — which is heavily dependent on U.S. arms and military aid — fell far short of meeting the U.S. demand to allow in an adequate number of aid trucks, and in some other ways worsened conditions for civilians. That includes Israeli lawmakers newly banning the main U.N. agency that provides aid to Palestinians. U.N. officials said as the end of the U.S. deadline neared that the entire population of north Gaza is now at imminent risk of dying from famine, airstrikes or other threats. 'We would expect that there be some consequences when things get even worse,' Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland said in the run-up to the vote on the measures. Fellow Democratic Sens. Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Peter Welch of Vermont also joined Sanders in the appeal. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor that he will 'strongly oppose' the measures. 'Israel needs to protect itself not just today, but also tomorrow and next year and beyond,' Schumer said. 'It has been a cornerstone of American policy to give Israel the resources it needs to defend against its enemies. We should not stray from that policy today.' Sen. Ben Cardin, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, read what he said was a message from the White House urging lawmakers to defeat the measures. The move to block arms to the U.S. ally came at a delicate time in Middle East cease-fire negotiations and would 'put wind in the sails of Iran, Hezbollah and Hamas at the worst possible moment,' Cardin quoted the White House as warning. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham also argued for defeat of the bills. 'This signal will be seen by the enemies of Israel, and the enemies of peace, that if they just stick with it they will win,' he said. Centrist and progressive Democratic lawmakers and Sanders have made repeated runs during the more than 1-year-old war at convincing the White House and Congress to condition U.S. arms shipments to Israel on improved treatment of Palestinian civilians in the offensive. The Biden administration has increased its warnings and appeals to Netanyahu to do more to spare civilians in airstrikes and other attacks, and to allow more aid to reach Gaza. The Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attacks that started the war killed about 1,200. The death toll of Gazans killed since then was nearing 44,000 on Wednesday. Health officials in Gaza do not distinguish between civilians and combatants in tracking deaths. Other than pausing one planned shipment of 2,000-pound bombs, Biden — at 82, a stalwart supporter of Israel since its modern founding — has rejected calls to limit military support to Israel. Sanders, on the Senate floor, said the continuing flow of U.S. arms to Israel for the war violated U.S. law and undermined U.S. standing in the world. Other governments will say to Americans, ''Don’t give us advice, don’t criticize us, when you have supported the mass starvation of children with your tax dollars,' he said. Republicans have stood firmly behind Netanyahu and will control both chambers of Congress next year as President-elect Donald Trump takes office. The U.S.'s roughly $18 billion in military support for Israel during the war was a politically divisive issue in the U.S. presidential campaign, with Republicans vowing to keep up undiminished backing for Israel. Trump has vowed strong support for Israel and has called on Netanyahu to bring the Gaza war to a quick close. He has offered few specifics on his plans on that. ___	https://apnews.com/article/israel-gaza-weapons-war-hamas-49f84cda2d17c4422cda362d1b8ea5de	2024-11-20T14:24:56-08:00	
The US is sending antipersonnel land mines to Ukraine. Here's what it means	WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. decision to provide Ukraine with antipersonnel land mines expands the use of a weapon that the international community has long condemned because of its danger to innocent civilians. And it reflects another in a long line of American policy shifts on the controversial issue in the past 30 years. U.S. officials say the mines are needed to help Ukraine stall Russian progress on the battlefield, where Moscow's forces are moving in smaller ground units on the front lines rather than in more heavily protected armored vehicles. The Defense Department has been providing Ukraine with anti-tank mines throughout the war. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the new policy will give Ukraine 'nonpersistent antipersonnel land mines' that are safer because they lose the ability to detonate over time. The change shows the Biden administration 'has clearly and belatedly become less risk averse as it eyes troubling battlefield developments in Ukraine and worries how U.S. policy toward Ukraine and Russia may change on January 20,' when President-elect Donald Trump takes office, according to Bradley Bowman, senior director of the Center on Military and Political Power at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. Trump has criticized U.S. support for Ukraine and vowed to quickly end the war. As Ukraine has gotten more effective in drone warfare, Russian troops moving in armored vehicles are at greater risk of being hit by the drones, so have been moving by foot, making them harder to target, Bowman said. Here is where the U.S. stands on antipersonnel mines and what it means: TYPES OF MINES Mines range from larger, destructive ones that can take out a tank to smaller, antipersonnel variants that are hidden just beneath the surface of the ground and explode by a person's weight. The Biden administration is sending Ukraine antipersonnel mines that have a limited capacity. The so-called nonpersistent mines are electrically fused and powered by batteries. Once the battery runs out, they won’t detonate, and they can become inert in anywhere from four hours to two weeks. The U.S. has sought commitments from the Ukrainians to limit harm to civilians, according to a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Ukraine would use the mines in its own country but wouldn't put them in civilian populated areas. Throughout the war, the U.S. has given Ukraine larger, anti-tank mines, which are also battery-powered, so will become inert over time. The Remote Anti-Armor Mine System, or RAAM, is an artillery shell that contains the anti-tank mines. When fired, it scatters the mines, which can damage armored vehicles. The mines can also be set to self-detonate in four hours or 48 hours. AN OUTLIER ON LAND MINES The U.S. is one of just a small number of major nations that have not signed on to the 1997 Ottawa Convention, which prohibited the use, production and transfer of antipersonnel mines. As of 2022, 164 countries had ratified or agreed to the treaty. But several major powers, which are also past and current manufacturers of land mines, did not sign on, including the United States, China and Russia. South Korea, India and Pakistan also did not join the treaty. A key issue is that the mines are widely used in North and South Korea, particularly along the demilitarized zone, and are part of the U.S. campaign to protect the South from invasion by Pyongyang. Humanitarian groups for years have pushed the U.S. to join the ban treaty. According to NATO, nearly 70 countries and territories are still affected by the presence of 110 million land mines, which can 'remain dormant, concealed beneath the earth, for many years before being triggered.' Earlier this year, NATO said Russia's invasion of Ukraine has turned the nation into one of the most mine-laden countries in the world. Human Rights Watch has said that 11 of Ukraine’s 27 regions are now scattered with mines. The Russian mines are more deadly, as they largely are not those that become inert over time. Biden's decision was immediately condemned by Amnesty International, which said that even those type of mines are a threat to civilians. 'This is a reckless decision and a deeply disappointing setback for a President who once agreed that land mines put more civilians at increased risk of harm,' said Ben Linden, an advocacy director for Amnesty International USA. 'It is devastating, and frankly shocking, that President Biden made such a consequential and dangerous decision just before his public service legacy is sealed for the history books.' THE EVOLVING U.S. POLICY President Bill Clinton had a goal of limiting mine use and joining the treaty, but under President George W. Bush, the administration pulled back due to wide objections from military leaders. The policy under Bush was that the U.S. would use persistent mines — ones that do not automatically become inert — until 2010, and then not use them anymore. President Barack Obama ordered up a review of the U.S. policy and eventually prohibited the military from using any land mines anywhere in the world except in defense of South Korea. In January 2020, President Donald Trump canceled the Obama-era prohibition and eliminated geographic limits on the use of land mines that would become inert over time. Then-Defense Secretary Mark Esper wrote at the time that commanders 'may authorize the use of nonpersistent land mines when necessary for mission success in major contingencies or other exceptional circumstances.' The term 'major contingency' was not explicitly defined. When President Joe Biden took office, the Trump policy was rolled back, and use of the antipersonnel mines was prohibited outside of the Korean Peninsula. The administration decision, announced in June 2022, said all mines not required for the defense of South Korea would be destroyed. At that time, there were an estimated 3 million antipersonnel mines in the U.S. stockpile, but officials would not say how many of those would be considered necessary to defend South Korea. ___ Associated Press writer Tara Copp contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-russia-war-land-mines-civilians-biden-76fb21ce12f70aa965d3d7fbccb35c9c	2024-11-20T09:43:07-08:00	
Yaks, bears and cockatoos are among the animals Russia is sending to North Korean zoo	Russia has sent a gift of more than 70 animals to North Korea for the Pyongyang Zoo, including bears, yaks, ducks and cockatoos. In another sign of the growing cooperation between the countries, the animals were flown to Pyongyang aboard a government plane, escorted by officials and experts from the Moscow Zoo, according to a government statement released Wednesday. 'Historically, animals always have played a special role in relations between states. They have been given as a sign of support, kindness and care,' Russia’s Natural Resources Minister Alexander Kozlov, who traveled with the animals, said in televised remarks. The delivery included an African lion, two bears, two domestic yaks, 25 pheasants, 40 mandarin ducks and five white cockatoos, the statement said. In June, President Vladimir Putin traveled to North Korea, where he met with its leader, Kim Jong Un. They signed a 'comprehensive strategic partnership treaty' that was the strongest link between Moscow and Pyongyang since the end of the Cold War. Both countries have been targeted by Western sanctions. Since then, U.S., South Korean and Ukrainian intelligence assessments say up to 12,000 North Korean troops have been sent to Russia to fight against Ukraine.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-north-korea-pyongyang-zoo-putin-aeec989bcfa735ad477e5d0903686fdb	2024-11-20T09:01:11-08:00	
Trump chooses former acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker as NATO ambassador	WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump says he has chosen former acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker to serve as U.S. ambassador to NATO, the bedrock Western alliance that the president-elect has repeatedly expressed skepticism about. Trump, in a statement, said Whitaker was 'a strong warrior and loyal Patriot' who 'will ensure the United States’ interests are advanced and defended' and 'strengthen relationships with our NATO Allies, and stand firm in the face of threats to Peace and Stability.' The choice of Whitaker as the nation's representative to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is an unusual one, given his background is as a lawyer and not in foreign policy. Whitaker, a former U.S. attorney in Iowa, served as acting attorney general between November 2018 and February 2019, as special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian election interference was drawing to a close. Before then, he was chief of staff to Trump’s first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, before being picked to replace his boss after Sessions was fired amid lingering outrage over his decision to withdraw from the Russia investigation. Whitaker held the position for several months, on an acting basis and without Senate confirmation, until William Barr was confirmed as attorney general in February 2019. Whitaker has been a relentless critic of the federal criminal cases against Trump, which appear set to evaporate after Trump’s election win. Whitaker has used regular appearances on Fox News to join other Republicans in decrying what they contend is the politicization of the Justice Department over the past four years. Trump has repeatedly threatened not to defend NATO members that fail to meet the transatlantic alliance’s defense spending targets. NATO’s Article 5 mutual defense clause states that an armed attack against one or more of its members shall be considered an attack against all members Earlier this year, Trump said that, when he was president, he warned NATO allies that he 'would encourage' Russia 'to do whatever the hell they want' to countries that are 'delinquent' as he ramped up his attacks on foreign aid and long-standing international alliances. ___ Colvin reported from New York.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-whitaker-transition-appointment-nato-attorney-general-a09b1214770b86aff85d5ecffaf63a52	2024-11-20T07:05:38-08:00

He’s an incredible role model for anyone to look at — and not try to be him, because that is very difficult, but try to take some of the things.' — Yannick Hanfmann, a German once ranked 45th. ___ 'The way he competes, he could maybe be down 6-0, 5-0, 40-Love, and still have a chance to win. He’s one of those guys you never think is out of it, one of those almost-perfect competitors. For me to meet him for the first time was pretty crazy. I got to practice with him a few times, which was an amazing experience for me. Obviously, I never got to play him.

US vetoes UN resolution demanding a cease-fire in Gaza because there's no link to a hostage release	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The United States vetoed a U.N. resolution demanding an immediate cease-fire in the war in Gaza on Wednesday because it is not linked to an immediate release of hostages taken captive by Hamas in Israel in October 2023. The U.N. Security Council voted 14-1 in favor of the resolution sponsored by the 10 elected members on the 15-member council, but it was not adopted because of the U.S. veto. The resolution that was put to a vote 'demands an immediate, unconditional and permanent cease-fire to be respected by all parties, and further reiterates its demand for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages.' The resolution had been sponsored by the 10 elected members on the 15-member council. Unlike the five permanent members – the U.S., Russia, China, Britain and France – the elected members have no veto power. The Security Council in June had adopted its first resolution on a cease-fire plan aimed at ending the war between Israel and Hamas. The U.S.-sponsored resolution welcomed a cease-fire proposal announced by President Joe Biden that the United States said Israel had accepted. It called on the militant Palestinian group Hamas to accept the three-phase plan – but the war goes on.	https://apnews.com/article/un-gaza-resolution-veto-hamas-israel-hostages-b5281432fc2acdc1860adb3015392c0b	2024-11-20T06:26:14-08:00	
Israeli officials demand the right to strike Hezbollah under any cease-fire deal for Lebanon	JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli officials demanded Wednesday the freedom to strike Lebanon's Hezbollah as part of any cease-fire deal, raising a potential complication as a top U.S. envoy was in the region attempting to clinch an agreement. The development came as an airstrike hit the historic Syrian town of Palmyra, killing 36 people, according to Syrian state-run media, which blamed the attack on Israel. The Israeli military declined to comment. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz and Foreign Minister Gideon Saar each said Israel sought to reserve the right to respond to any violations by Hezbollah under an emerging proposal, which would push the militant group’s fighters and Israeli ground forces out of a U.N. buffer zone in southern Lebanon. There have been signs of progress on the cease-fire deal, with Hezbollah’s allies in the Lebanese government saying the militant group had responded positively to the proposal. 'In any agreement we will reach, we will have to maintain our freedom to act if there will be violations,' Saar told dozens of foreign ambassadors in Jerusalem. 'We will have to be able to act in time, before the problem will grow.' Katz, in a meeting with intelligence corps officers, said 'the condition for any political settlement in Lebanon' was the right for the Israeli military 'to act and protect the citizens of Israel from Hezbollah.' Amos Hochstein, the Biden administration’s point man on Israel and Lebanon, has been working in recent days to push the sides toward agreement. He has been meeting this week with officials in Lebanon and said Wednesday he would travel to Israel in an attempt to 'try to bring this to a close if we can.' On Tuesday, Hochstein said an agreement to end the Israel-Hezbollah war is 'within our grasp.' The emerging cease-fire deal would push Hezbollah and Israel out of southern Lebanon Hezbollah began firing into Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, in solidarity with Hamas after its attack on southern Israel that sparked the war in the Gaza Strip. Israel has been responding with strikes in Lebanon, and dramatically escalated its bombardment in late September by launching a ground invasion just inside the border. In the more than a year of exchanges, more than 3,500 people have been killed in Lebanon, most in the past month, the Health Ministry reported, and over 1 million people have been displaced. It's unknown how many of the dead were Hezbollah fighters. In Israel, more than 70 people have been killed by Hezbollah fire, and tens of thousands have fled their homes. Hochstein’s proposal is based on U.N. resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 war between Hezbollah and Israel. The resolution stipulates that only the Lebanese army and U.N. peacekeepers should operate in southern Lebanon. Still, after 2006, Hezbollah never fully ended its presence in the south. Lebanon accuses Israel of also violating the resolution by maintaining hold of a small, disputed border area and conducting frequent military flights over Lebanon. Israel says that since then, Hezbollah build up a military infrastructure throughout villages and towns in southern Lebanon. The proposal currently being discussed would include an implementation plan and a monitoring system to ensure each side follows its obligations to fully withdraw from the south. That could involve the U.S. and France, but details are still unclear. There’s been progress, but the deal isn’t done yet The Israeli ministers did not outline what Israel’s demand to maintain freedom of operation would entail. Since the 2006 war, Israel has struck Hezbollah on the few occasions when border violence did flare up, but any larger scale response could push the region back into turmoil. It is also unlikely that Lebanon would agree to a deal that permits Israeli violations of its sovereignty. And although the proposal attempts to nail down an implementation mechanism, the failure to fully implement the U.N. resolution after the 2006 war could point to the difficulties in getting the sides to uphold a sustainable cease-fire that would bring long-term quiet. Israel has continued to pound Hezbollah throughout the cease-fire attempts, and rockets have continued to rain down on northern Israel. Any perceived escalation could derail the talks. The war in Gaza would grind on even if Israel and Hezbollah cease fire Even if a cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah is reached, the war in Gaza grinds on into its 14th month. Israel is still battling Hamas there, sending the death toll soaring to nearly 44,000 dead — over half of them women and children, according to local health officials, who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants in their count. While Hezbollah throughout the war in Gaza said it wouldn’t stop firing at Israel until the fighting in the Palestinian territory ends, that condition was dropped in September after Israel intensified its offensive on the militant group, killing its top leadership and degrading its military capabilities. That leaves Gaza waiting for a cease-fire of its own, as people there continue to endure a humanitarian crisis that has displaced much of the territory’s 2.3 million people and prompted widespread hunger, especially in the north, where the U.N. says virtually no food or humanitarian aid has been delivered to for more than 40 days because of the Israeli military’s siege there. International mediation efforts have stalled repeatedly over disagreement between Israel and Hamas over whether the war should end as part of a cease-fire deal, with Israel insisting it wants to maintain troop presence in certain areas. Hamas ignited the war in Gaza when its fighters stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of them believed to be dead. Other tumultuous areas of the Middle East won't likely be affected by a Hezbollah-Israel cease-fire, including Syria. Israel frequently targets military sites and facilities associated with Iran-linked groups in Syria but rarely acknowledges the strikes. The death toll from Wednesday’s strike in Palmyra was unusually high. The Syrian news agency SANA said that along wit the 36 killed, the strike on Palmyra also wounded more than 50 people and caused 'significant material damage to the targeted buildings' and the surrounding area.

Fate of man accused of killing Georgia student Laken Riley is now in judge's hands	ATHENS, Ga. (AP) — The fate of the man accused of killing Georgia nursing student Laken Riley was in the hands of a judge after prosecutors and defense attorneys delivered their closing statements Wednesday in the case that fueled the national debate over immigration during this year’s presidential race. Jose Ibarra, 26, is charged with murder and other crimes in Riley’s February death. He waived his right to a jury trial, meaning the case will be decided by Athens-Clarke County Superior Court Judge H. Patrick Haggard. The Feb. 22 killing on the University of Georgia campus added fuel to the national debate over immigration when federal authorities said Ibarra illegally entered the U.S. in 2022 and was allowed to stay in the country while he pursued his immigration case. Riley, 22, was a student at Augusta University College of Nursing, which also has a campus in Athens, about 70 miles (115 kilometers) east of Atlanta. The trial began last Friday and the prosecution rested its case on Tuesday after calling more than a dozen law enforcement officers, Riley's roommates and a woman who lived in the same apartment as Ibarra. Defense attorneys called a police officer, a jogger and one of Ibarra's neighbors on Tuesday and rested their case Wednesday morning. Riley's parents, roommates and other friends and family members packed the courtroom each day, many of them getting emotional as they listened to witness testimony. Ibarra, dressed each day in a collared shirt and dark slacks with his feet chained, appeared attentive throughout the trial.	https://apnews.com/article/georgia-nursing-student-laken-riley-immigrant-d8d75ccc6d81e7a88eb7890829d9fc9c	2024-11-20T05:20:57-08:00	
Spain to grant residency, work permits to hundreds of thousands of migrants in the country illegally	MADRID (AP) — Spain will grant residency and work permits to about 300,000 migrants living in the country illegally each year for the next three years, the country's migration minister said Wednesday. The policy will take effect next May and aims to expand the country's aging workforce. Spain has remained largely open to receiving migrants even as other European nations seek to tighten their borders to illegal crossings and asylum seekers. Spain needs around 250,000 registered foreign workers a year to maintain its welfare state, Migration Minister Elma Saiz said in an interview on Wednesday. She contended that the legalization policy is not aimed solely at 'cultural wealth and respect for human rights, it’s also prosperity.' 'Today, we can say Spain is a better country,' Saiz told national broadcaster Radio Nacional de España. Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has often described his government's migration policies as a means to combat the country's low birthrate. The new policy, approved Tuesday by Sánchez's leftist minority coalition government, simplifies administrative procedures for short and long-term visas and provides migrants with additional labor protections. It extends a visa previously offered to job-seekers for three months to one year. In August, Sánchez visited three West African nations in an effort to address irregular migration to Spain’s Canary Islands. The archipelago off the coast of Africa is seen by many as a step toward continental Europe with young men from Mali, Senegal, Mauritania and elsewhere embarking on dangerous sea voyages there seeking better job opportunities abroad or fleeing violence and political instability at home. By mid-November, some 54,000 migrants had reached Spain this year by sea or land, according to the country's Interior Ministry. The exact number of foreigners living in Spain illegally is not clear. Many such migrants make a living in Spain's underground economy as fruit pickers, caretakers, delivery drivers, or other low-paid but essential jobs often passed over by Spaniards. Without legal protections, they can be vulnerable to exploitation and abuse. Saiz said the new policy would help prevent such abuse and 'serve to combat mafias, fraud and the violation of rights.' Spain's economy is among the fastest-growing in the European Union this year, boosted in part by a strong rebound in tourism after the pandemic. In 2023, Spain issued 1.3 million visas to foreigners, according to the government. ___ Follow AP coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/migration	https://apnews.com/article/spain-migrants-foreign-workers-europe-ce2ac68649bc1cb0603f1e810885e0cf	2024-11-20T04:43:55-08:00	
Pope approves new papal funeral rites to simplify ritual, allow for burial outside the Vatican	ROME (AP) — Pope Francis has revised the funeral rites that will be used when he dies, simplifying the rituals to emphasize his role as a mere bishop and allowing for burial outside the Vatican in keeping with his wishes. The Vatican newspaper L’Osservatore Romano on Wednesday published details of the updated liturgical book, which Francis approved April 29 and which replaces the previous edition that was last published in 2000. Francis turns 88 in December and, despite some health and mobility problems, appears in fine form. On Wednesday, he presided over a spirited general audience that featured children who spontaneously rushed the stage. While popes often tinker with the rules regulating the conclave that will elect their successor, a revision of the papal funeral rites became necessary after Emeritus Pope Benedict XVI died on Dec. 31, 2022. The Vatican had to work out a funeral for the first retired pope in 600 years, and a few months later Francis revealed he was working with the Vatican’s master of liturgical ceremonies, Monsignor Diego Ravelli, to overhaul the papal funeral rites to simplify them. In that 2023 interview with Mexican Televisa broadcaster N+, Francis also revealed that he had decided he would be buried in Santa Maria Maggiore basilica in Rome, not in the grottoes underneath St. Peter’s Basilica where most popes are buried. Ravelli told L’Osservatore Romano that the new reform simplifies the funeral rites, including eliminating the requirement that the pope be placed on an elevated bier in St. Peter’s Basilica for public viewing. Rather, he will be on view in a simple coffin, and the burial no longer requires the traditional three coffins of cyprus, lead and oak. The simplification, Ravelli told the newspaper, is meant 'to emphasize even more that the Roman Pontiff’s funeral is that of a shepherd and disciple of Christ and not of a powerful man of this world.' Since his 2013 election, Francis has eschewed the pomp often associated with the papacy to emphasize his role as the bishop of Rome and a servant of the 'church of the poor.' The Argentine Jesuit lives in the Vatican hotel, not the Apostolic Palace, and travels in small Fords or Fiats, not fancy SUVs. His desire to be buried at Santa Maria Maggiore reflects his veneration of an icon of the Virgin Mary that is located there, the Salus populi Romani (Salvation of the people of Rome). After every trip, Francis goes to the basilica to pray before the Byzantine-style painting that features an image of Mary, draped in a blue robe, holding the infant Jesus who in turn holds a jeweled golden book. 'It’s my great devotion,' Francis told N+ in revealing his future burial plans. 'The place is already prepared.' ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Middle East latest: Israel insists on right to act against Hezbollah in any deal to end fighting	Israel’s defense minister says his country insists on the right to act militarily against Hezbollah in any agreement to end the fighting in Lebanon. Lebanon’s government is likely to view any such demand as an infringement on its sovereignty, complicating efforts to end more than a year of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah that erupted into all-out war in September. Defense Minister Israel Katz said in a statement Wednesday that 'the condition for any political settlement in Lebanon is the preservation of the intelligence capability and the preservation of the (Israeli military’s) right to act and protect the citizens of Israel from Hezbollah.' Lebanese officials mediating between Israel and Hezbollah have called for a return to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 war between the sides. It calls for Hezbollah militants and Israeli forces to withdraw from a buffer zone in southern Lebanon patrolled by U.N. peacekeepers and Lebanese troops. U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein, who has spent months trying to broker a cease-fire, held a second round of talks on Wednesday with Lebanon’s parliament speaker, Nabih Berri, an ally of Hezbollah who has been mediating on their behalf. Hochstein told reporters the talks had made 'additional progress,' and that he would be heading to Israel 'to try to bring this to a close, if we can.' He declined to say what the sticking points are. Israeli strikes and combat in Lebanon have killed more than 3,500 people and wounded 15,000, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. The war has displaced nearly 1.2 million people, or a quarter of Lebanon’s population. On the Israeli side, 87 soldiers and 50 civilians, including some foreign farmworkers, have been killed by attacks involving rockets, drones and missiles. Hezbollah began firing on Israel the day after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack triggered the war in Gaza. That attack killed some 1,200 people in Israel, mostly civilians, and another 250 were abducted. Around 100 hostages remain inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed nearly 44,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities. ___ Here’s the Latest: Israel explores options for delivering aid to war-ravaged Gaza JERUSALEM — Israel’s government spokesperson has indicated that it is exploring the option of hiring a private contractor to deliver aid to war-ravaged Gaza. Israel has come under heavy international criticism for a growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The U.N. and international aid agencies say Israel is failing to ensure safe conditions allowing them to work, while Israel accuses the U.N. of logistical failures. Israel also claims Hamas has stolen much of the aid. Israeli media reported Tuesday that the government is now looking into hiring private companies to deliver aid. Asked about the government’s plans, spokesman David Mencer said: 'Israel is looking at many creative solutions to ensure a better future for Gaza.' The army and COGAT, the military body responsible for Palestinian humanitarian affairs, declined comment. Aid distribution is largely coordinated by UNRWA, the U.N. Agency for Palestinian refugees. Israel accuses the agency of cooperating with Hamas and has banned it from operating on Israeli soil. UNRWA denies the accusations. 'Certainly UNRWA has provided a failed past and we are ensuring that doesn’t continue into a failed future,' Mencer said. With the war in its 14th month, Israel has still not laid out a postwar plan for the territory. Aid groups say the already grave humanitarian situation in Gaza has deteriorated in recent weeks. Their efforts suffered another blow this week when armed gangs looted nearly 100 trucks loaded with food and other supplies. Hezbollah says it supports cease-fire negotiations but has some reservations BEIRUT — Hezbollah leader Naim Kassem said in a televised speech Wednesday that the Lebanese militant group supports the ongoing negotiation process for a cease-fire with Israel after more than 13 months of fighting but had given some 'remarks' on the proposal. He added that the outcome depends on Israel’s response. Kassem’s speech coincided with a two-day visit to Lebanon by U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein aimed at clinching a deal to halt the war that has killed more than 3,500 people in Lebanon and more than 130 Israelis. Speaking from an undisclosed location in a pre-recorded address, Kassem said, 'We agree to the current negotiation process.' Kassem also said that Hezbollah has 'some reservations' on the cease-fire proposal, which it gave to the U.S. envoy. 'The cessation of fighting depends on Israel’s response and Netanyahu’s seriousness,' he added, referring to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 'No one can guarantee' whether this will lead to an actual cease-fire, Kassem said. He said that any cease-fire between Hezbollah and Israel must include 'a complete and comprehensive end to the aggression,' preserving Lebanon’s sovereignty and ruling out any freedom of movement for Israel in Lebanese territory. Kassem said that before his predecessor, longtime Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli strike on Sept. 27, the militant group had given its 'approval of the Biden-Macron proposal' for a 21-day truce, which was under discussion at the time. Israeli airstrike on Palmyra kills 36 people and causes damage, Syrian media say DAMASCUS — An Israeli airstrike on the Syrian town of Palmyra, known for the historic Roman temple complex nearby, killed 36 people and wounded more than 50 Wednesday, Syrian state-run media said. The SANA news agency said the strikes also led to 'significant material damage to the targeted buildings and the surrounding area.' The Israeli military declined to comment on the reported strike in Syria. Israel frequently targets military sites and facilities associated with Iran-linked groups in Syria but rarely acknowledges the strikes. The death toll from Wednesday’s strike was unusually high. It was not immediately clear if the ruins were damaged. The temple complex already suffered significant damage years ago during the Islamic State group’s rampage across Syria. In 2015, the world watched in horror as the militants blew up an iconic arch and temple in Palmyra. Since IS lost its hold on the area, restoration work on the site has been held up by security issues, leftover IS landmines and lack of funding. The strike in Syria comes as negotiations are underway for a potential cease-fire between Israel and the Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon, but it is unclear if the ceasefire would include Syria. Israeli bill targets families of minors convicted of security offenses JERUSALEM — The Israeli parliament has passed a bill stripping some insurance benefits from families of minors convicted of security offenses. A rights group denounced the legislation as a form of collective punishment of Palestinians. The bill, which passed 29-8 late Monday, bans direct family members of minors convicted of security offenses from receiving a child allowance, study grants, or other welfare benefits under Israel’s National Insurance program while the minor is imprisoned. It was passed to 'cause parents to supervise their children and make sure that they do not engage in terrorist activity,' according to a press release on the website of the Knesset, Israel’s parliament. Legal group Adalah, which called on Israel’s attorney general to withdraw the law, said the true aim of the legislation was 'to impose punitive measures under the pretext of counterterrorism by denying welfare benefits.' Adalah said that because the legislation only applies to those convicted of security offenses, who are overwhelmingly Palestinian, it 'creates a distinction on the basis of nationality.' It’s the latest in a series of measures passed by the Knesset that have been denounced by rights groups as draconian. A law passed earlier this month would allow Israel to deport family members of Palestinian attackers to Gaza or other locations. In late October, the Knesset passed two laws banning UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, from operating on Israeli soil. Lebanese army says one of its soldiers was killed by an Israeli airstrike BEIRUT — A Lebanese army soldier was killed Wednesday by an Israeli airstrike that hit his vehicle on the road linking Burj al-Muluk and Qalaa in southern Lebanon, the army said in a statement. The Israeli military said it was looking into reports. A day earlier, three soldiers were killed by an airstrike that targeted an army post in the town of Sarafand, near the coastal city of Saida. Wissam Khalifa, a resident of Sarafand who lives next to the army post and was injured in the strike, said he was shocked that it was targeted. 'It’s a safe residential neighborhood. There is nothing here at all' that would present a target, he said. 'Regarding the martyred soldiers, I don’t even know if there was a gun in the center. Why did this strike happen? We have no idea.' The Lebanese army has not been an active participant in the fighting between Israeli forces and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah over the past 13 months, but more than 40 soldiers have been killed in the conflict. Altogether, more than 3,500 people have been killed in Lebanon since Oct. 8, 2023, the vast majority of them in the past two months. Wounded Al Jazeera reporter to be evacuated to Jordan for treatment AMMAN, Jordan: Israel has allowed an Al Jazeera journalist wounded in an airstrike in Gaza last month to be evacuated to Jordan for medical treatment. Jordan’s Foreign Ministry said Wednesday that Ali al-Attar had been transferred to the kingdom with his sister in coordination with the World Health Organization. There was no immediate comment from Israel. Al-Attar was wounded by shrapnel when Israeli forces struck makeshift points used by Hamas-run police outside a hospital in central Gaza early on Oct. 7. There were no police present at the time. Israel banned Al-Jazeera earlier this year, accusing it of serving as a mouthpiece of Hamas. It has also accused six Al Jazeera journalists in Gaza of being current or former fighters for Hamas and another armed group. Al Jazeera has denied the allegations and accused Israel of trying to silence critical coverage. The Qatar-based network has reported round-the-clock from Gaza since the start of the war, with its field correspondents focusing on the killing of civilians in Israeli strikes. Several Al Jazeera reporters have themselves been killed or wounded. Al Jazeera has also regularly broadcast videos released by militant groups in their entirety, including some that show Israeli hostages speaking under duress.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-hezbollah-latest-20-november-2024-621bf47de03e7992d6ba3855a200abbc	2024-11-20T04:07:01-08:00	
UN authorizes first mpox vaccine for children in an attempt to control Congo outbreak	GENEVA (AP) — The World Health Organization has authorized the first mpox vaccine for children, a decision experts hope will help make immunizations more widely available to one of the hardest-hit populations during the ongoing outbreaks of the disease in Congo and elsewhere in Africa. In a statement late Tuesday, the U.N. health agency said it had approved the mpox vaccine made by Japanese company KM Biologics for use in children over 1 year of age as a single dose. Earlier this month, the charity Save the Children said that cases among children younger than 18 had increased by more than 130% in Congo, noting there were now more than 25,000 suspect cases. The charity said that children were almost four times more likely than adults to die from the newest form of mpox first detected in eastern Congo earlier this year. Mpox, related to smallpox, mostly causes symptoms including fever, rash, lesions and fatigue. 'Children are especially vulnerable to mpox,' Save The Children's Dr. Katia Vieira de Moraes LaCasse said in a statement. 'They explore by touch and taste, don't always understand health guidance and have weaker immune systems than adults.' Scientists have previously noted that mpox appears to be disproportionately affecting children in Congo and Burundi, which account for more than 90% of all mpox cases in Africa's current outbreak. WHO had previously approved the mpox vaccine made by Bavarian Nordic for people 18 and over, but said that the shot could be used in younger populations, if doctors thought the benefits might outweigh potential risks, given the lack of data in children and other groups including pregnant women. Last week, WHO said cases of mpox in the Congolese region where the new, more infectious form was first identified appeared to be ' plateauing,' even as cases were rising elsewhere, including Burundi and Uganda. So far, about 50,000 people in Congo have been immunized against mpox with the vaccine made by Bavarian Nordic. WHO said Japan had announced it would donate about 3 million doses of the shot made by KM Biologics to Congo. It wasn't clear whether any of the doses had arrived. On Friday, WHO is convening its expert committee to determine whether the outbreaks in Congo and elsewhere in Africa is still a global emergency, a declaration that the U.N. agency first made in August. To date, Africa has reported more than 46,000 suspected mpox cases in the current outbreak, including 1,081 deaths. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

Climate change goosed hurricane wind strength by 18 mph since 2019, study says	BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) — Human-caused climate change made Atlantic hurricanes about 18 miles per hour (29 kilometers per hour) stronger in the last six years, a new scientific study found Wednesday. For most of the storms — 40 of them — the extra oomph from warmer oceans made the storms jump an entire hurricane category, according to the study published in the journal, Environmental Research: Climate. A Category 5 storm causes more than 400 times the damage of a minimal Category 1 hurricane, more than 140 times the damage of a minimal Category 3 hurricane and more than five times the damage of a minimal Category 4 storm, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration For three storms, including this month's Rafael, the climate change factor goosed wind speed so much that the winds increased by two storm categories. This isn't about more storms, but increasing power from the worst ones, authors said. 'We know that the intensity of these storms is causing a lot more catastrophic damage in general,' lead study author Daniel Gilford, a climate scientist at Climate Central, which does research on global warming. 'Damages do scale (up) with the intensity.' The effect was especially noticeable in stronger storms, including those that made it to the top of the Saffir-Simpson scale of storm intensity: Category Five, study authors said. The study looked at 2019 to 2023, but the authors then did a quick addition for the named storms this year, all of which had a bump up due to climate change. 'We had two Category Five storms here in 2024,' Gilford said. 'Our analysis shows that we would have had zero Category Five storms without human-caused climate change.' This year’s three most devastating storms — Beryl, Helene and Milton — increased by 18 mph (29 kph), 16 mph (26 kph) and 24 mph (39 mph) respectively because of climate change, the authors said. A different study by World Weather Attribution had deadly Helene’s wind speed increase by about 13 mph, which is close, said Imperial College London climate scientist Friederike Otto, who coordinates the WWA team and praised the Climate Central work. 'It absolutely makes sense from a fundamental standpoint that what’s going on is we’ve added more energy to the system,' National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration chief Rick Spinrad said at United Nations climate talks in Baku, Azerbaijan. 'The change is going to manifest in terms of what we’re already seeing. You look at Hurricane Helene which was massive, 500 miles across. We’re going to see changes in terms of the velocity of these storms. We're going to see changes in terms of Hurricane Milton spawning so many tornadoes.' Since 2019, eight storms — 2019’s Humberto, 2020’s Zeta, 2021’s Sam and Larry, 2022’s Earl, 2023’s Franklin and 2024’s Isaac and Rafael — increased by at least 25 mph (40 kph) in wind speed. Humberto and Zeta gained the most: 31 miles per hour (50 kph). In 85% of the storms studied in the last six years, the authors saw a fingerprint of climate change in storm strength, Gilford said. Warm water is the main fuel of hurricanes. The warmer the Atlantic, Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico get, the more potential energy goes into storms. Other factors — such as high level crosswinds and dry air — can act to weaken hurricanes. The waters in the hurricane area have increased by 2 to 3 degrees Fahrenheit (1.1 to 1.6 Celsius) in general and as much as 4 degrees (2.2 C) due to climate change, Gilford said. They know this because Climate Central has used scientifically accepted techniques to regularly track how much warmer oceans are because of the burning of coal, oil and natural gas. That technique basically uses computer simulations to create a fictional world with no human-caused warming and then compares it to current reality, with the difference being caused by greenhouse gases. They account for other factors, such as the lessening amount of sulfate pollution from marine shipping which had been counteracting a bit of the warming before the skies cleared up more. To go from warmer waters to stronger storms, the authors looked at a calculation called potential intensity, which is essentially the speed limit for any given storm based on the environmental conditions around it, Gilford said. MIT hurricane expert and meteorology professor Kerry Emanuel, who pioneered potential intensity measurements, wasn't part of the study but said it makes sense. It shows the increase in storm strength that he predicted would happen 37 years ago, he said. Past studies have shown that climate change has made hurricanes intensify quicker, and slower moving, which causes even more rain to be dumped. ___ This story has corrected the spelling of Daniel Gilford's last name throughout. ___ Read more of AP’s climate coverage at http://www.apnews.com/climate-and-environment ___ Follow Seth Borenstein on X at @borenbears ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Russian lawmakers endorse bill to ban adoptions by gender-transition countries	MOSCOW (AP) — Russia’s upper house of parliament on Wednesday endorsed a bill banning adoption of Russian children by citizens of countries where gender transitioning is legal. The Federation Council also approved bills that outlaw the spread of material that encourages people not to have children. The bills, which have previously been approved by the lower house, will now go to President Vladimir Putin for signing into law. They follow a series of laws that have suppressed sexual minorities and bolstered longstanding conventional values. Lower house speaker Vyacheslav Volodin, who was among the new bill's authors, noted that 'it is extremely important to eliminate possible dangers in the form of gender reassignment that adopted children may face in these countries.' The adoption ban would apply to at least 15 countries, most of them in Europe as well as in Australia, Argentina and Canada. Adoption of Russian children by U.S. citizens was banned in 2012. Other bills approved by lawmakers on Wednesday outlaw what is described as propaganda for remaining child-free and impose fines of up to 5 million rubles (about $50,000). Its proponents contended that public arguments against having children are part of purported Western efforts to weaken Russia by encouraging population decline. Putin and other top officials in recent years have increasingly called for observing so-called traditional values as a counter to Western liberalism. As Russia’s population declines, Putin has made statements advocating large families and last year urged women to have as many as eight children. Russia last year banned gender-transition medical procedures and its Supreme Court declared the LGBTQ+ 'movement' to be extremist. In 2022, Putin signed a law prohibiting the distribution of LGBTQ+ information to people of all ages, expanding a ban issued in 2013 on disseminating the material to minors. Since he sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022, the Kremlin leader has repeatedly characterized the West as 'satanic' and accused it of trying to undermine Russia by exporting liberal ideologies. Independent journalists, critics, activists and opposition figures in Russia have come under increasing pressure from the government in recent years, intensifying significantly amid the conflict in Ukraine. Hundreds of nongovernmental groups and individuals have been designated as a 'foreign agent' — a label that implies additional government scrutiny and carries strong pejorative connotations. On Wednesday, the lower house of parliament, the State Duma, gave preliminary approval to a bill that would ban those who have been designated 'foreign agents' from accessing their incomes. The measure would freeze all their Russia-generated income on special accounts and would only allow them access to the funds if their 'foreign agent' status is revoked. Volodin, the lower house speaker, has said that the proposed legislation was aimed at preventing 'the enrichment of traitors to the motherland at citizens' expense.'	https://apnews.com/article/russia-lgbtq-adoption-86694922365a09e3ac27dd9893b6a334	2024-11-20T00:26:27-08:00	
Higher energy bills push UK inflation to 6-month high in October	LONDON (AP) — Inflation in the U.K. rose sharply to a six-month high in October and back above the rate targeted by rate-setters at the Bank of England, official figures showed Wednesday, an increase that is set to cement market expectations that there will be no further cuts in borrowing rates this year. The Office for National Statistics said higher domestic energy bills pushed consumer price inflation up to 2.3% in the year to October from the three-year low of 1.7% recorded the previous month. The increase, which was above forecasts for a more modest increase, took inflation above the bank's target rate of 2%. Earlier this month, the bank increased its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.75% — the second in three months — after inflation fell to its lowest level since April 2021. However, Bank Gov. Andrew Bailey cautioned that rates wouldn't be falling too fast over the coming months, partly because last week’s budget measures from the new Labour government would likely see prices rise by more than they would otherwise have done. Rate-setters will meet once more this year, on Dec. 19, by which time they will be armed with more monthly inflation reading. Central banks worldwide dramatically increased borrowing costs from near zero during the coronavirus pandemic when prices started to shoot up, first as a result of supply chain issues and then because of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine which pushed up energy costs. As inflation rates have recently fallen from multidecade highs, the central banks have started cutting interest rates.	https://apnews.com/article/uk-inflation-economy-interest-rates-f369072fc3a25285ba28d1af9de50b0e	2024-11-19T22:39:48-08:00	
Iraq launches its first national census in nearly four decades	BAGHDAD (AP) — Iraq began its first nationwide population census in decades Wednesday, a step aimed at modernizing data collection and planning in a country long impacted by conflict and political divisions. The act of counting the population is also contentious. The census is expected to have profound implications for Iraq’s resource distribution, budget allocations and development planning. Minority groups fear that a documented decline in their numbers will bring decreased political influence and fewer economic benefits in the country’s sectarian power-sharing system. The count in territories such as Kirkuk, Diyala and Mosul -- where control is disputed between the central government in Baghdad and the semi-autonomous Kurdish regional government in the north -- has drawn intense scrutiny. Ali Arian Saleh, the executive director of the census at the Ministry of Planning, said agreements on how to conduct the count in the disputed areas were reached in meetings involving Iraq’s prime minister, president and senior officials from the Kurdish region. 'Researchers from all major ethnic groups — Kurds, Arabs, Turkmen, and Christians — will conduct the census in these areas to ensure fairness,' he said. The last nationwide census in Iraq was held in 1987. Another one held in 1997 excluded the Kurdish region. The new census 'charts a developmental map for the future and sends a message of stability,' Planning Minister Mohammed Tamim said in a televised address. The census will be the first to employ advanced technologies for gathering and analyzing data, providing a comprehensive picture of Iraq’s demographic, social, and economic landscape, offiials say. Some 120,000 census workers will survey households across the country, covering approximately 160 housing units each over two days. The Interior Ministry announced a nationwide curfew during the census period, restricting movement of citizens, vehicles and trains between cities, districts and rural areas, with exceptions for humanitarian cases. The count will be carried out using the 'de jure' method, in which people are counted in their usual area of residence, Saleh said. That means that people internally displaced by years of war will be counted in the areas where they have since settled, not in their original communities. The census will not include Iraqis residing abroad or those forcibly displaced to other countries. Saleh estimated Iraq’s population at 44.5 million and said the Kurdish region’s share of the national budget — currently 12% — is based on an estimated population of 6 million. The census will also clarify the number of public employees in the region. By order of Iraq’s federal court, the census excluded questions about ethnicity and sectarian affiliation, focusing solely on broad religious categories such as Muslim and Christian. 'This approach is intended to prevent tensions and ensure the census serves developmental rather than divisive goals,' Saleh said. The census will be monitored by international observers who will travel across Iraq’s provinces to assess the data quality, he said. Hogr Chato, director of the Irbil-based Public Aid Organization, said the census will reshape the map of political thinking and future decision making. 'Even though some leaders deny it, the data will inevitably have political and economic implications,' he said. 'It’s also fair to allocate budgets based on population numbers, as areas with larger populations or those impacted by war need more resources.' Chato said he believes the delays in conducting the census were not only due to security concerns but also political considerations. 'There was data they didn’t want to make public, such as poverty levels in each governorate,' he said. Ahead of the census, leaders in Iraq’s various communities urged people to be counted. In Baghdad’s Adhamiyah district, Abdul Wahhab al-Samarrai, preacher at Imam Abu Hanifa Mosque, urged citizens to cooperate with the census. 'This is a duty for every Muslim to ensure the rights of future generations,' he said in a Friday sermon the week before the count. ___ Martany reported from Irbil, Iraq.	https://apnews.com/article/iraq-census-kurds-kirkuk-1d315225c4ccaf21355afe2af8076a9b	2024-11-19T21:34:16-08:00	
Ukraine has seen success in building clean energy, which is harder for Russia to destroy	BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) — Maxim Timchenko, CEO of DTEK, the largest private energy company in Ukraine, pulls out a piece of paper with bar charts showing how much new electricity his company has brought online this year in the country versus how much Russian bombs have destroyed. Total electricity goes up, then down, then up, then down — capturing the company's constant rebuilding each time Russian missile attacks take out a facility, which include wind and solar farms and thermal (coal or gas-fired) generating stations. The Russian strikes are part of a campaign to target energy infrastructure to reduce power in Ukraine as winter looms. 'What other choice do we have?' said Timchenko during an interview on the sidelines of this year's U.N. climate talks, taking place in Azerbaijan. 'Sit and wait and pray that they don't hit us, or do our job and bring lights back to our people?' The nearly three-year-long Russia-Ukraine war, which has left large swaths of Ukraine destroyed, has accelerated a transition to clean energy. At Ukraine's pavilion at COP29, on display is a large smashed solar panel, destroyed in an attack this year. Russian forces continue to make small but steady gains in capturing Ukrainian territory at a time when there are questions about how much the United States, which has been providing weapons and money, will continue to support the country once President-elect Donald Trump assumes office in January. During the campaign, Trump repeatedly said he could quickly end the war if elected, although he hasn't said how. Whatever the future, the decentralized nature of some clean energies, in particular wind and solar, has allowed Ukraine to quickly restore power in ways that would be impossible with Ukraine's more traditional energy sources, such as coal-fired power plants. In centralized systems, all power is generated and sent to the grid over transmission lines from the same area. That means if the plant goes down, say in an attack, a large section of grid, or even the entire grid, comes to a halt. By contrast, wind and solar installations are usually more scattered, so less of the system goes down with one hit, and if the solar is on rooftops, the impact can be even more limited. Attacks on two DTEK solar farms last spring is a good example. They destroyed many solar panels and some of the transformers, which step up voltage for long distances or step it down for use in homes. Replacing the transformers and swapping out destroyed panels allowed the farms, which generate 400 megawatts, to be back up in seven days. Timchenko said an attack on a thermal generating station, which experienced a similar amount of damage, took three to four months to rebuild. 'That's the difference between centralized and so-called decentralized generation. It's much more resistant and difficult to destroy,' said Timchenko. Geoffrey Pyatt, assistant secretary of the U.S. State Department's Bureau of Energy Resources, said that Russian attacks on energy infrastructure have evolved. In 2022 and 2023, they focused on transformers. 'The Ukrainians were incredibly efficient in working around those attacks. So Putin changed his tactics beginning in March to go after generation capacity,' said Pyatt, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Since then, about 50% of Ukraine's total power generation has been knocked out, leaving mostly nuclear, some hydropower and large new renewable projects, like a wind farm being built by DTEK, he added. Renewable and other infrastructure projects are financed by partnerships between governments and businesses, spreading out the risk, since there is no guarantee that something built isn't destroyed by missiles. In June, turbine maker GE Vernova and manufacturer Honeywell announced plans to partner with DTEK for major wind and battery storage projects in Ukraine. Roger Martella, chief sustainability officer for GE Vernova, said that developing public-private partnerships was key to lowering risk and making investment more attractive. Ukraine's resistance was also an inspiration, Martella told a panel on Ukrainian renewables at COP29. 'We’re humbled by the fact that Ukraine has done something no one has ever done before, which is to maintain the grid in a war-torn environment,' said Martella. Pyatt, a former ambassador in Ukraine, said he has seen widespread support for Ukraine's energy systems in the G7, a group of leading industrialized nations. While making clear he couldn't speak for the incoming Trump administration, Pyatt said he believed support for Ukraine in the energy sector would 'continue in any scenario.' 'If you start to get big American companies like GE and Fluxus and Honeywell involved in energy reconstruction, and there’s going to be billions of dollars of energy reconstruction,' he said. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Southern China suspends ferry services as storm brings winds, high waters to coastal regions	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Parts of coastal southern China suspended ferry services as a major storm passed into the South China Sea, bringing high winds and heavy waves to much of the region. The storm was downgraded Wednesday from Typhoon Man-yi, which left seven dead in the Philippines and worsened the crisis caused by back-to-back storms that battered the disaster-prone nation. It is now categorized as a low-pressure area lingering south of China’s Hainan Island, according to the Hong Kong Observatory, which said its maximum sustained winds were a relatively mild 40 kilometers (25 miles) per hour. Climatologists have predicted a greater frequency of such storms, but better preparedness and early warning systems in the Asia Pacific nations most affected have helped mitigate some of the most dire consequences. Higher sea temperatures caused by a warming climate are increasing the amount of moisture in the air and extending the typhoon season from its usual annual end point of September. Europe, particularly Spain, and the southeastern United States have also experienced devastating storms in recent weeks.	https://apnews.com/article/storm-typhoon-asia-china-manyi-a57d2f4e40638a81c880b49feb9466a0	2024-11-19T20:30:58-08:00	
Health advocates in Africa worry Trump will reimpose abortion 'gag rule' governing US aid	EPWORTH, Zimbabwe (AP) — Carrying her infant daughter, 19-year-old Sithulisiwe Moyo waited two hours to get birth-control pills from a tent pitched in a poor settlement on the outskirts of Zimbabwe’s capital, Harare. The outreach clinic in Epworth provides Moyo with her best shot at achieving her dream of returning to school. 'I am too young to be a baby-making machine,' she said. 'At least this clinic helps me avoid another pregnancy.' But the free service funded by the U.S. government, the world’s largest health donor, might soon be unavailable. As he did in his first term, U.S President-elect Donald Trump is likely in January to invoke the so-called global gag rule, a policy that bars U.S. foreign aid from being used to perform abortions or provide abortion information. The policy cuts off American government funding for services that women around the world rely on to avoid pregnancy or to space out their children, as well as for heath care unrelated to abortion. Four decades of on-again, off-again restrictions The gag rule has a 40-year history of being applied by Republican presidents and rescinded by Democratic presidents. Every GOP president since the mid-1980s has invoked the rule, which is known as the Mexico City Policy for the city where it was first announced. As one of his first acts as president in 2017, Trump expanded the rule to the extent that foreign NGOs were cut off from about $600 million in U.S. family planning funds and more than $11 billion in U.S. global health aid between 2017 and 2018 alone, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress. The money — much of it intended for Africa — covered efforts such as preventing malaria and tuberculosis, providing water and sanitation, and distributing health information and contraception, which might also have repercussions for HIV prevention. Women’s health advocates are 'uneasy' following Trump’s victory, said Pester Siraha, director of Population Services Zimbabwe, an affiliate of MSI Reproductive Choices, an NGO that supports abortion rights in 36 countries. The policy stipulates that foreign NGOs that receive U.S government funding must agree to stop abortion-related activities, including discussing it as a family planning option — even when they are using non-U.S. government funds for such activities. During Trump's first term, MSI did not agree to those conditions, effectively making it ineligible for U.S government funding. Siraha said that a blueprint offered to Trump by the conservative-leaning Heritage Foundation in its plan known as Project 2025 indicates that the new administration could enact 'a more comprehensive global gag rule.' Even NGOs in countries that outlaw abortion, such as Zimbabwe, are affected. Population Services Zimbabwe, for instance, closed its outreach clinics during Trump’s first term after losing funding due to its association with MSI Reproductive Choices. Such outreach clinics are often the only health care option for rural people with limited access to hospitals due to poverty or distance. 'It leaves women with no place to turn for help, even for information,' said Whitney Chinogwenya, global marketing manager at MSI Reproductive Choices. Some NGOs in other African countries such as Uganda, Ghana, Ethiopia, Kenya and South Africa rolled back services, including clinics, contraception, training and support for government and community health workers, as well as programs for young people, sex workers and LGBTIQ+ communities. Other services shut down entirely. The risk of unplanned pregnancies, unsafe abortions and related deaths increased in many of the affected countries, according to the U.S.-based Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights. Chinogwenya, the MSI Reproductive Choices marketing manager, said her organization’s donor income dropped by $120 million during Trump’s first term. The money would have provided 8 million women globally with family planning help, preventing 6 million unintended pregnancies, 1.8 million unsafe abortions and 20,000 pregnancy-related deaths, she said. The gag-rule policy 'leads to more unintended, unwanted, unsupportable pregnancies and therefore an increase in abortion,' said Catriona Macleod, a professor of psychology at South Africa’s Rhodes University. 'This legislation does not protect life … it’s been called America’s deadly export,' said Macleod, who heads the university’s studies in sexuality and reproduction. Trump's transition team did not respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press. Damage isn’t always easy to repair President Joe Biden rescinded the gag-rule policy in 2021, resulting in Population Services Zimbabwe receiving $9 million, about 50% of its donor funding, from USAID in 2023. 'But we haven’t regained all the loss we suffered,' said Siraha, the organization’s director. 'You need a minimum of five years to have an impact. If we then have another gap of five years, it means we are reversing all the gains,' she said. Her organization estimates that 1.3 million women could lose out on the care they need in Zimbabwe, leading to an additional 461,000 unintended pregnancies and 1,400 maternal deaths if the gag rule is reinstated. Overseas aid budget cuts by other Western governments will make it harder to find alternative funding, Siraha said. Forced into difficult choices MSI Reproductive Choices is lobbying world leaders and alternative donors to fight for abortion rights. 'Trump’s reelection may embolden the anti-choice movement, but the fight for women’s reproductive rights is nonnegotiable,' Chinogwenya said. However, agencies that rely heavily or entirely on U.S funding might have little choice but 'to quiet their guidelines on access to abortion' to qualify for funding, said Denise Horn, an international relations and civil society expert at Bryant University in Rhode Island. In South Africa, where abortion is mostly legal, some NGOs, especially those without alternative funding, stopped openly discussing abortion as an option or changed their guidelines and the information they share publicly, according to an assessment by South Africa’s Rhodes University and the International Women’s Health Coalition, a New York-based NGO. 'Organizations thus have to evaluate what is most important: the non-abortion work they will still be able to do or the principle of pro-choice,' read part of the 2019 assessment report. 'Ultimately, these organizations will have to make this difficult decision.' The long lines of women at the outreach clinic in Zimbabwe’s Epworth settlement underline the dire need for family planning services in impoverished communities. Engeline Mukanya, 30, said she is already struggling to support her three children with the $100 she earns monthly from plaiting women’s hair. Nurses inserted a birth-control implant in her left arm to protect her from pregnancy for the next five years. Like many here, she cannot afford private providers who charge $20 to $60. 'It’s unfortunate that we are so far away from America yet we are being caught in the crossfire of its politics,' she said. 'All we want is the freedom to space our births.'	https://apnews.com/article/trump-victory-gag-rule-women-abortion-a462faf01e298a105be8d7f4ff46db68	2024-11-19T20:00:06-08:00	
Stock market today: Asian markets mostly lower as worries over Russia-Ukraine war loom	HONG KONG (AP) — Asian stocks were mostly lower on Tuesday, despite gains on Wall Street, as worries mounted over escalations in the Russia-Ukraine war. U.S. futures edged higher while oil prices were little changed. On Tuesday, Ukraine fired several American-supplied longer-range missiles into Russia, according to the official, marking the first such use in nearly 1,000 days of war. On the same day, Russian President Vladimir Putin formally lowered the threshold for Russia’s use of its nuclear weapons. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 slipped 0.2% to 38,352.34 after the Finance Ministry reported the country recorded a trade deficit in October, for a fourth straight month. Exports rose 3.1% from a year earlier as a weak yen and the rising price of energy kept import costs high. A trade deficit occurs when the country is importing more goods and services than it is exporting. Shares of Seven &amp; i Holdings Co., the company that owns over 80,000 7-Eleven convenience stores worldwide, soared 8.4% on Wednesday after local media reported that the founding family plans to raise over 8 trillion yen ($51.66 billion) to take the company private within this financial year. China's central bank announced it will keep its benchmark lending rates unchanged after it cut its one-year lending rate to 3.1% in October. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng edged 0.1% higher to 19,687.10, and the Shanghai Composite gained 0.1% to 3,979.15. Australia’s S&amp;P/ASX 200 dipped 0.6% to 8,326.30. South Korea’s Kospi added 0.4% to 2,482.29. On Tuesday, the S&amp;P 500 rose 0.4% to 5,916.98 after erasing an early drop of 0.7%. The Nasdaq composite also shook off an early loss to turn 1% higher to 18,987.47, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.3% to 43,268.94. Nvidia’s 4.9% climb accounted for most of the index’s gain. The chip company’s stock rallied ahead of its profit report for the latest quarter, which is coming later Wednesday, and vaulted its gain for the year to nearly 197% thanks to the craze around artificial-intelligence technology. The worries on the Ukraine-Russia conflict sent investors into U.S. Treasury bonds, which are seen as some of the world’s safest investments. The rise in their prices in turn lowered their yields, and the 10-year Treasury yield fell to 4.39% from 4.41% late Monday. Gold also rose 0.6% and recovered some of the losses it sustained following Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. presidential election, as investors herded into places traditionally considered safer during times of trouble. Walmart climbed 3% after topping forecasts for both profit and revenue. The nation’s biggest retailer said it saw broad-based strength across its categories, including sales made both online and in stores. It also said it served more upper-income households, while raising its forecasts for sales and profit for the full year. Lowe’s likewise delivered bigger profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected, but its stock nevertheless dropped 4.6%. A report in the morning said construction crews broke ground on fewer new homes last month than economists expected, and rival Home Depot slipped 0.9%. Other big companies set to report their latest quarterly results this week include Target on Wednesday and Deere &amp; Co. on Thursday. In other dealings early Wednesday, benchmark U.S. crude oil edged 15 cents higher to $69.39 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard, added 10 cents to $73.41 per barrel. The dollar rose to 155.47 Japanese yen from 154.54 yen. The euro slipped to $1.0588 from $1.0598.	https://apnews.com/article/stock-markets-japan-china-3a2ce8be3c3743199782c3453053afaf	2024-11-19T19:50:59-08:00	
Argentina's Milei pivots to pragmatism in first talks with China's Xi after shaking up the G20	LA PAZ, Boliva (AP) — Last year, then-presidential candidate Javier Milei declared Argentina would not 'make deals with communists' in China or Brazil, calling their leaders 'murderers' and 'thieves' in a bid to channel the populist energies of Donald Trump and other global far-right icons into a winning political message. But Tuesday, President Milei found himself at the Group of 20 summit in Rio de Janeiro shaking hands with Chinese President Xi Jinping and vowing to boost trade with the Asian powerhouse, a day after his economy minister signed a preliminary agreement to export Argentine natural gas to Brazil. Milei even acquiesced to a joint declaration endorsed by world leaders late Monday despite his earlier attempts to play spoiler to the G20 host, Brazil’s left-wing president Luiz Inácio 'Lula' da Silva who was once called by Milei a 'corrupt communist.' The final moments of the summit revealed Milei's more pragmatic streak, coming as a surprise after the irascible president sought to undercut various international initiatives — withdrawing Argentine negotiators from the U.N. climate summit, casting the only 'no' votes on two U.N. resolutions, one supporting Indigenous rights and another advocating for an end to violence against women, and roiling negotiations at the G20 summit. Argentina has also dramatically reshaped its foreign policy in line with its hard-right allies in Italy — with Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni headed to Buenos Aires on Tuesday to spend more time with Milei — and in Israel. On Tuesday, Andrea Tenenti, a spokesperson for the U.N. peacekeeping mission operating along Lebanon's southern border, told reporters in Geneva that Argentina had decided to withdraw its peacekeepers from the force, known as UNIFIL. He did not say why, but Israel has repeatedly requested that peacekeepers leave the area since the military's Oct. 1 invasion of southern Lebanon. Despite Israeli attacks on peacekeepers, UNIFIL has vowed to stay put and none of the other 47 troop-contributing countries has pulled out. In the past few days, Argentine resistance to the joint G20 communiqué focused on clauses related to the taxation of the super-rich and regulation of online speech, diplomats said. Argentine delegates also sought to block language about gender equality and references to the U.N. 2030 agenda on sustainable development, which Milei has decried as socialist. Critics in Rio saw the Argentine president as a saboteur. Supporters back home cheered Milei as a leader of the 'new world disorder.' Fresh off a trip to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida where he ranted against socialism and rubbed shoulders with the president-elect and tech billionaire Elon Musk, Milei initially seemed immune to such concerns in Rio. Milei's office issued a harsh statement citing his objections to the G20 declaration. But the president ultimately signed onto it under enormous international pressure. 'Argentina is not a great power and it is in a very difficult situation economically,' said Roberto Goulart Menezes, a professor of international relations at the University of Brasilia. That pressure, he added, was 'enough for Argentina to finally reduce its opposition.' During Milei's first-ever meeting with Xi on Tuesday, the leaders discussed their 'current trade and financial ties' and 'desire to continue exploring new opportunities to expand and improve,' the Argentine presidency said in a statement, along with a photo of the presidents sharing a warm handshake. It said the leaders had invited each other to visit. With Argentina highly reliant on China as a market for its soybeans and other crops, the cordial tone made clear that the crisis-stricken South American nation has no desire for relations with its second-largest trading partner and crucial source of financing to further deteriorate. A statement from China's foreign ministry said Xi expressed his appreciation for Milei's 'willingness to continue deepening bilateral cooperation.' China has maintained strategic assets in Argentina, including stakes in lithium mines and a space station in Patagonia. Earlier this year, former Foreign Minister Diana Mondino, whom Milei recently fired, led a successful visit to China to patch up relations strained by Milei's colorful insults ('Would you trade with an assassin?' he asked on the campaign trail last August, accusing China of killing dissidents). After Mondino's trip, Beijing in June resumed a currency swap deal worth billions of dollars that boosted Argentina’s depleted reserves. On Monday, as negotiations over the G20 draft grew increasingly tense, Argentine Economy Minister Luis Caputo and Brazilian Energy Minister Alexandre Silveira signed a memorandum of understanding that offered a new and important source of income to cash-strapped Argentina. The agreement to work toward shipping 30 million cubic meters of natural gas to Brazil from Argentina’s Vaca Muerta, a vast shale oil and gas field in Patagonia, over the next five years, 'might have helped' Milei sign the joint G20 statement, Silveira told reporters. But it did nothing to dispel the chill between the leaders of South America's largest economies, who have opposite views on climate change, social issues and the role of governments. A set of official photographs that splashed across the front pages of local newspapers Tuesday showed Lula and other government leaders clasping hands amicably in sharp contrast to the Brazilian leader's photo-op with Milei — both men standing stiffly apart despite protocol demanding they shake hands, looking like they’d rather be anywhere else in the world. Some fear that Trump's election has further emboldened Milei and other far-right political figures to abandon U.N. commitments and ambitious multilateral agreements on issues like climate change. 'Milei has already taken a pro-Trump stance, thinking ... that the G20 could be emptied by President Trump,' said Goulart Menezes, the international relations expert. Yet, he cautioned that 'making Argentina’s foreign policy conditional on the future president of the United States' carries risks. 'Argentina is putting itself in a position of international isolation,' he said. Indeed, at the traditional G20 family photo — taken for a second time Tuesday because U.S. President Joe Biden and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau failed to show up to the first — Milei was the only leader missing from the lineup. There would be no third attempt. ___ Associated Press reporters Debora Rey in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Eléonore Hughes and Mauricio Savarese in Rio de Janeiro contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/milei-xi-president-argentina-economy-g20-lula-trump-biden-brazil-china-bf0598ba508f9d9da24cce52eaa1a82d	2024-11-19T17:11:39-08:00	
Japan records a trade deficit in October for a 4th straight month, despite export recovery	TOKYO (AP) — Japan racked up a trade deficit in October for a fourth straight month as a weak yen and rising energy prices kept import costs high. The trade deficit, which amounts to a nation’s imports subtracted from its exports, totaled 461 billion yen ($3 billion) last month, the Finance Ministry reported Wednesday. Exports grew 3.1% in October from a year earlier, picking up pace over recent months, as shipments of equipment for semiconductor production increased. But imports, up 0.4% from a year earlier, were still bigger than exports. A major uncertainty over trade is looming because of the reelection of Donald Trump as U.S. president, in part because he favors sharp increases in tariffs. Exports are a chief engine of growth for Japan, the home of Toyota Motor Corp., although such manufacturers have moved production and investment abroad. New Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has been busy meeting the leaders of Asian nations, as well as Europe and South America, to forge economic and trade relations, as well as security ties. Ishiba, who has yet to meet Trump, was recently in Brazil for the Group of 20 summit. A weakening currency, which tends to accompany trailing growth, is another worry for Japan. The U.S. dollar has been trading at about 155 Japanese yen recently, up from 140-yen levels a year ago. Inflation and rising energy prices are pushing up import costs, while slowing global demand dampens exports. But the recent fall in overseas demand is believed to be partly due to temporary disruptions like a typhoon, while the drop in exports is related to auto production disruptions in Japan. By region, exports rose to the rest of Asia, including Singapore and Hong Kong. Exports to the U.S. slipped slightly. ___ Yuri Kageyama is on Threads: https://www.threads.net/@yurikageyama	https://apnews.com/article/japan-economy-trade-imports-exports-energy-d186be06dcf195a2a4a05abd551c8a33	2024-11-19T16:38:55-08:00	
Former Hong Kong publisher Jimmy Lai begins to testify in his national security trial	HONG KONG (AP) — Former Hong Kong publisher Jimmy Lai testified he met with then-Vice President Mike Pence and then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo during Hong Kong’s anti-government protests in 2019 but told the court at his landmark national security trial Wednesday that he did not ask the U.S. officials to take action. Lai, founder of the now-shuttered Apple Daily pro-democracy newspaper, was arrested in 2020 in the crackdown that followed the protests. He is accused of colluding with foreign forces to endanger national security and conspiring with others to issue seditious publications. If convicted, he faces up to life in prison. He testified about his meetings with U.S. officials and gave details about his alleged overseas political connections with people in the U.S., Britain and Taiwan, including ex-Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen and Hong Kong’s last British governor, Chris Patten. But the media tycoon who also describes himself as a businessman and social activist said he never tried to influence foreign policy on Hong Kong or China through the people he met overseas or ask them to take action against them. Lai’s case is widely seen as a measure of press freedom and judicial independence in the Asian financial hub. Lai testified in English that he asked Pence to voice his support for Hong Kong but not for the U.S. government to take any action, saying, 'It’s beyond me.' During the same trip to the U.S., Lai also met with Pompeo and discussed the situation in Hong Kong with him, noting it was a similar conversation to the one he had with Pence, he testified. When Lai’s lawyer, Steven Kwan, asked him whether he had requested the U.S. to do something, Lai said not to do something but 'to say something.' Beijing promised to retain the former British colony’s civil liberties for 50 years when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997. But critics say that promise has become threadbare under the rubric of maintaining national security. Authorities have used a Beijing-imposed national security law to prosecute many of Hong Kong’s leading activists, including Lai and 45 democracy advocates who were sentenced to several years in prison on Tuesday. Other pro-democracy figures were forced into self-exile or silenced. Dozens of civil society groups have disbanded under the threat of the law. Beijing and Hong Kong governments insist that the law restored stability to the city following the 2019 protests. Prosecutors have alleged that Lai asked foreign countries, especially the United States, to take actions against Beijing 'under the guise of fighting for freedom and democracy.' They pointed to Lai’s meetings with Pence, Pompeo and U.S. senators in July 2019 to discuss a now-withdrawn extradition bill that sparked the massive anti-government protests. They allege that Lai sought support from the U.S. in sanctioning mainland Chinese and Hong Kong leaders who cracked down on the movement. Dozens of people stood in the rain to secure a seat in the courtroom, including former Apple Daily reader William Wong, who said he wanted to remind Lai that Hong Kongers have not forgotten him. 'I haven’t seen him for a few months. I know he will testify himself, so I want to encourage him,' said Wong, 64. Upon entering the court, Lai waved and smiled at his family members, who sat next to the city’s Roman Catholic Cardinal Joseph Zen. During the hearing, Lai said he had introduced former U.S. officials Paul Wolfowitz and Jack Keane to Taiwan’s former President Tsai Ing-wen — whom he knew before she became the island’s leader. It was because Tsai wanted to know more about the thinking of then-President Donald Trump’s administration back then, he said. Lai said she knew he was 'supportive of Trump' and she thought he knew a lot about the U.S. because of his links with U.S. think tanks. But he never communicated with Trump, he said. He said he wanted to help Taiwan to know how to better deal with the U.S. because the island was the only democracy of Chinese people. But Lai rejected the idea of Hong Kong independence, saying it was a 'crazy' idea and he never allowed his staff or the newspaper to mention it. He said he broke into the media world because 'to participate in delivering freedom' was a very good idea for him. 'The more you know, the more you are free,' he said. He said the core values of Apple Daily were the core values of the people of Hong Kong, including the rule of law, freedom and the pursuit of democracy. In May 2020, a month before the security took effect, Lai took up the role of executive chairman of Next Digital, the parent company of Apple Daily. 'I think it’s right for me to take up the responsibility of the company if anything happens to it as an owner,' he said. The American and British governments and a group of independent United Nations human rights experts have called for Lai’s release. Trump was asked on a podcast before his reelection this month whether he would talk to Chinese President Xi Jinping to seek Lai’s release, and he replied: 'One hundred percent, I will get him out.' Hong Kong leader John Lee said mutual respect is important for the development of trade relations and there should be no interference in local affairs. Beijing also criticized some U.S. lawmakers for supporting Lai. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer also raised concerns over Lai’s detention to Xi in a meeting during the Group of 20 summit in Brazil. Hong Kong’s security minister Chris Tang maintained the prosecution was based on facts. Lai’s son, Sebastien Lai, said on Friday that his father’s treatment in prison is 'inhumane.' 'My father is now 77 and has spent nearly four years in a maximum-security prison in solitary confinement,' he said in the statement released by Britain-based law firm Doughty Street Chambers. On Sunday, the Hong Kong government condemned some members of the law firm for what it called spreading misinformation. It said the separation of Lai from other inmates 'has been made at his own request' and was approved by prison authorities.

Congo accuses rebel group of 'ethnic cleansing' in country's east	KINSHASA, Congo (AP) — Congo's government on Tuesday accused the Rwanda-backed M23 rebel group of 'ethnic cleansing' in the central African nation’s east. The minister of the interior, Jacquemain Shabani, denounced the 'massive arrival of foreign populations' in the territories of Rutshuru and Masisi in North Kivu province, where locals were 'expelled by violence.' 'This is what constitutes ethnic cleansing,' Shabani said. Congo’s accusation comes after M23 last week appointed administrators in the areas it claims to control. More than 100 armed groups have been vying for a foothold in mineral-rich eastern Congo near the border with Rwanda. The violence has escalated as the M23 rebel group has reemerged. The conflict has created one of the world’s largest humanitarian crises, with more than 7 million people displaced, many beyond the reach of aid. M23, or the March 23 Movement, is a rebel military group mainly made up of ethnic Tutsis who broke away from the Congolese army just over a decade ago. The group rose to prominence in 2012 when its fighters seized Goma, eastern Congo’s largest city on the border with Rwanda. Congo alleges that Rwanda has been involved in war crimes in the east, and U.S. and U.N. experts accuse it of giving military backing to M23. Rwanda denies the claim, but in February admitted that it has troops and missile systems in eastern Congo to safeguard its security, pointing to a buildup of Congolese forces near the border. U.N. experts estimate there are up to 4,000 Rwandan forces in Congo. A July truce brokered by the United States and Angola has reduced the fighting between Rwandan and Congolese forces, but fighting between M23 and other militias continues. In August, clashes between the rebels and pro-government militias killed 16 villagers in a violation of the truce to help millions displaced.	https://apnews.com/article/congo-rebel-group-m23-ethnic-cleansing-2b3bfa6357fca88804e865db7912377b	2024-11-19T12:58:48-08:00	
US-Israel panel to look into civilian harm in Gaza is set for first meeting next month	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration says a U.S.-Israel panel to look into reports of civilian harm from the war in Gaza will meet for the first time in early December, missing by more than a month a U.S. call for the channel to be set up by the end of October. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Tuesday that the upcoming meeting had been agreed to after much discussion between U.S. and Israeli officials on specific incidents and reports of civilian casualties involving American-made or -supplied weapons. 'The purpose of this channel is to inform the ongoing work that the State Department has to make assessments about the use of U.S.-provided weapons,' Miller told reporters. 'It’s to gather information about incidents that have been raised that are cause of concern or cause of questions.' He said the information gathered through that channel will inform U.S. policy decisions about any response to potential violations of international humanitarian law in the conflict that has been raging since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel, which led to its retaliatory offensives in Gaza. Experts say famine may already have set in in northern Gaza, where Israel has been waging a weekslong offensive that has killed hundreds of people and driven tens of thousands from their homes. In October, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin sent a letter to top Israeli officials warning them that the Biden administration might limit the provision of some U.S. weapons systems to Israel, a close ally, if action to improve humanitarian conditions was not taken within 30 days. That deadline expired last week with no decisions being made on military aid and officials saying that Israel had taken some positive steps but was still not meeting the criteria for improvements laid out in the letter. Aid groups say the situation in Gaza has actually deteriorated instead of improved and urged the U.S. to respond accordingly. The theft in Gaza over the weekend of nearly 100 trucks loaded with food and other much-needed humanitarian aid sent prices soaring and caused shortages in central Gaza, where most of the population of 2.3 million people have fled and where hundreds of thousands are crammed into squalid tent camps. Miller said reports of such incidents demonstrated a breakdown in law and order in Gaza and underscored the need to end the fighting and restore functioning governance to the territory. 'You are not going to fully, finally solve this problem without an end to the war and the establishment of a new governance and security authority inside Gaza, because ultimately that is the problem,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-gaza-humanitarian-aid-76220814c1772a3f021a5fe596498795	2024-11-19T12:54:14-08:00	
US will send Ukraine at least $275 million in new weapons in push to bolster Kyiv before Trump	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Pentagon will send Ukraine at least $275 million in new weapons, including an undisclosed number of antipersonnel land mines, as the Biden administration rushes to do as much as it can to help Kyiv fight back against Russia before President-elect Donald Trump takes office. The latest tranche of weapons comes as worries grow about an escalation in the conflict, with both sides pushing to gain any advantage they can exploit if Trump demands a quick end to the war — as he has vowed to do. 'We will continue to provide Ukraine the support it needs to succeed on the battlefield and prevail in its defense against Russia’s aggression,' Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement. In rapid succession this week, President Joe Biden gave Ukraine the authority to fire longer-range missiles deeper into Russia and said it would provide the antipersonnel land mines. Russian President Vladimir Putin also formally lowered the threshold for using nuclear weapons. U.S. officials contend that Russia’s change in nuclear doctrine was expected, but Moscow is warning that Ukraine's new use of the Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS, inside Russia on Tuesday could trigger a strong response. One American official said the U.S. is seeing no indications that Russia is preparing to use a nuclear weapon in Ukraine. Asked Tuesday if a Ukrainian attack with longer-range U.S. missiles could potentially trigger use of nuclear weapons, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov answered affirmatively. Another U.S. official said Ukraine fired about eight ATACMS missiles into Russia on Tuesday and just two were intercepted. The official said the U.S. is still assessing the damage but the missiles struck an ammunition supply location in Karachev, in the Bryansk region. The U.S. officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence. The weapons in the new package of aid for Ukraine include, for the first time, antipersonnel land mines that are 'not-persistent' — meaning they are electrically fused and powered by batteries. As a result, once the battery runs out, they will no longer detonate, unlike the ones used by Russia, which do not become inert and remain a threat to civilians for decades. Also in the new aid package will be an infusion of air defense, including munitions for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), as well as 155mm and 105mm artillery rounds, Javelin anti-armor munitions, drones, and other equipment and spare parts. The weapons will be provided through presidential drawdown authority, which allows the Pentagon quickly to pull supplies from its shelves to speed them to Ukraine’s front line. Trump’s upcoming move to the White House has triggered a scramble by the Biden administration to ensure all the congressionally approved funding for Ukraine gets delivered and that Kyiv is in a strong position going into the winter. The Biden administration would have to rush $7.1 billion in weapons from the Pentagon’s stockpiles to spend all of those funds before Trump is sworn in. That includes $4.3 billion from a foreign aid bill passed by Congress earlier this year and $2.8 billion still on the books in savings due to the Pentagon recalculating the value of systems sent. Asked if the department can get that done before Jan. 20, when Trump takes office, Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said officials are working to get Ukraine what it needs. 'We are committed to using that full authority that Congress has allotted to us,' Singh said. 'The only way we can do that also is to make sure that our shelves are fully backfilled and stocked. So as our shelves continue to get stocked with equipment and capabilities that are needed, we draw down from those and send those to Ukraine.' In addition to the weapons in the Pentagon drawdown, the State Department said Tuesday that it had authorized the sale to Ukraine of $100 million in unspecified defense equipment and services, including vehicle refurbishment, technical assistance, training and 'other related elements of logistics and program support.' In contrast to the drawdown, the government of Ukraine will pay for those supplies. As part of the wider effort to boost Ukraine, the administration also is on track to disperse its portion of a $50 billion loan to Ukraine, backed by frozen Russian assets, before Biden leaves the White House, according to two senior administration officials. The officials, who were not authorized to comment publicly, said the U.S. and Ukraine are now in 'advanced stages' in discussing terms of the loan and are looking to complete the process for the $20 billion portion of the mammoth loan that the U.S. is backing. The goal is to get it done before the end of the year, one official said. The remaining $30 billion will come from the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada and Japan, among others. Trump has criticized U.S. support for Ukraine and derided Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a 'salesman' while also praising Putin and touting his good relationship with him. The president-elect has claimed — without explaining how — that he will end the war in in Ukraine before his inauguration on Jan. 20, saying he will 'get it resolved very quickly.' Last week, when he addressed supporters from a golden ballroom at a his Mar-a-Lago resort, Trump returned to that pledge but again offered little information before changing the subject. 'We’re going to work very hard on Russia and Ukraine. It’s got to stop. Russia and Ukraine’s gotta stop,' he said. He has suggested that Ukraine give up at least some of its Russian-occupied territory to settle the war, saying at a rally in late September that 'if they made a bad deal, it would’ve been much better. They would’ve given up a little bit and everybody would be living and every building would be built and every tower would be aging for another 2,000 years.' ____ Associated Press writers Aamer Madhani in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Michelle L.

US recognizes Venezuela's opposition candidate as president-elect months after the disputed election	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — The U.S. government recognized Venezuelan opposition candidate Edmundo González as the 'president-elect' of the South American country on Tuesday, months after President Nicolás Maduro claimed to have won the July election. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken recognized González in a post on X in which he also demanded 'respect for the will' of Venezuelan voters. The administration of U.S. President Joe Biden has said González earned the most votes in the disputed July 28 election but has fallen short of acknowledging him as president-elect. Venezuela’s National Electoral Council, which is stacked with Maduro loyalists, declared Maduro the election winner hours after polls closed. Unlike previous presidential elections, electoral authorities did not provide detailed vote counts. But the opposition coalition collected tally sheets from 80% of the nation’s electronic voting machines and posted them online. González and opposition leader Maria Corina Machado said the voting records showed the former diplomat won the election with twice as many votes as Maduro. 'We deeply appreciate the recognition of the sovereign will of all Venezuelans,' González said in a post on X shortly after Blinken's statement Tuesday. 'This gesture honors the desire for change of our people and the civic feat that we carried out together on July 28.' González left Venezuela in September for exile in Spain after a warrant was issued for his arrest in connection with an investigation into the publishing of the vote tally sheets. Venezuela's Foreign Minister Yván Gil responded to Blinken's comment with personal attacks. 'In the last days of his government, he should dedicate himself to reflecting on his failures, getting rid of imperial and colonial complexes and going to write the memoirs of how the Bolivarian Revolution made him bite the dust of defeat, just like his predecessors,' Gil said of Blinken in a statement, which did not mention election results. Maduro and electoral authorities have rejected repeated calls from the U.S., the European Union, Colombia, Brazil and other nations to show the detailed vote records that back up the president's reelection. Swift condemnation of the lack of post-election transparency prompted Maduro to ask Venezuela’s Supreme Tribunal of Justice, whose members are aligned with the ruling party, to audit the results. The high court reaffirmed his victory. Experts from the United Nations and the U.S.-based Carter Center, which observed the election at the invitation of Maduro’s government, determined the results announced by electoral authorities lacked credibility. The U.N. experts stopped short of validating the opposition’s claim to victory but said the faction’s voting records published online appear to exhibit all of the original security features. Earlier in the week, Colombia’s President Gustavo Petro, who has friendly relations with Maduro, reversed his support for the July elections, calling the vote a 'mistake.' Petro spoke in an interview with Brazilian news outlet Globo News, which released excerpts online that Petro’s office shared Tuesday on social media. Petro told the news outlet Monday while visiting Brazil for the G20 summit that he initially was in favor of Venezuela holding the elections, but that he later decided that the vote was not 'free.' 'I think the elections were a mistake,' Petro said. His office did not immediately respond to a request for him to elaborate on the reasons for his change of heart. Petro, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and then-Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador — all leftists friendly with Maduro — attempted to make peace as the results came under dispute, but the effort went nowhere. Venezuela’s next presidential term begins Jan. 10. Maduro has already received an invitation from the ruling party-controlled National Assembly for a swearing-in ceremony. ___ Garcia Cano reported from Mexico City.

The Kremlin has revised its nuclear policy. Does that make the use of atomic weapons more likely?	The 4-year-old document has a bland, bureaucratic title — 'Basic Principles of State Policy on Nuclear Deterrence' — but its contents are chilling, especially with its newest revisions. Better known as Russia's nuclear doctrine, the revamped version that was signed Tuesday by President Vladimir Putin spells out the circumstances that allow him to use Moscow's atomic arsenal, the world's largest. This new version lowers the bar, giving him that option in response to even a conventional attack backed by a nuclear power. That possibly could include the use of U.S.-supplied ATACMS missiles by Ukraine to hit Russian territory — which Moscow says happened Tuesday when six missiles hit the Bryansk region. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov emphasized that such strikes could potentially be a trigger for a nuclear response under the revised document. What is Russia’s nuclear doctrine? Its first iteration was signed by Putin in 2020, and he approved the latest version Tuesday, according to the Kremlin. It outlines when Russia could dip into its atomic arsenal. Since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, Putin and other Kremlin voices have frequently threatened the West with its nuclear arsenal. But that hasn't deterred Kyiv's allies from giving it billions of dollars of advanced weapons, some of which have hit Russian soil. The revamped document describes nuclear weapons as 'a means of deterrence,' noting their use is an 'extreme and compelled measure.' It declares that Russia 'takes all necessary efforts to reduce the nuclear threat and prevent aggravation of interstate relations that could trigger military conflicts, including nuclear ones.' Such nuclear deterrence is aimed at safeguarding the 'sovereignty and territorial integrity of the state,' deterring a potential aggressor, or, 'in case of a military conflict, preventing an escalation of hostilities and stopping them on conditions acceptable for the Russian Federation,' the document says. 'Nuclear deterrence is aimed to ensure that any potential adversary realizes the inevitability of retribution in case of an aggression against Russia and its allies,' it says. While formulated broadly to avoid a firm commitment of nuclear use and keep the West guessing at Moscow’s response, the modernized version spells out conditions under which Putin could use a nuclear option in response to a conventional strike. Changes in the doctrine have been in the works for months, and it's no coincidence that Tuesday's announcement of a new version follows by two days Washington's decision to allow Ukraine to use such longer-range missiles to hit targets in Russia. For months, U.S. President Joe Biden has been weighing the risks of such an escalation. What triggers a Russian nuclear response? The doctrine says Moscow could use nuclear weapons 'in response to the use of nuclear and other types of weapons of mass destruction' against Russia or its allies, as well as 'in the event of aggression' against Russia and Belarus with conventional weapons that threaten 'their sovereignty and/or territorial integrity.' Any aggression against Russia by a nonnuclear power with the 'participation or support of a nuclear power' will be seen as their 'joint attack' on Russia, the document says. It adds that nuclear weapons could be used in these scenarios: — If reliable information is received about the launch of ballistic missiles targeting the territory of Russia or its allies. — If nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction strike the territory of Russia or its allies, or are used to hit Russian military units or facilities abroad. — If an enemy's impact on critically important Russian government or military facilities could undermine retaliatory nuclear-strike capability. — If aggression against Russia or Belarus involving conventional weapons raises a critical threat to their sovereignty and territorial integrity. — If reliable information is received about the takeoff or launch of strategic and tactical aircraft, cruise missiles, drones, hypersonic or other flying vehicles and their crossing the Russian border. The president can inform military and political leaders of other countries or international organizations 'about the readiness to use nuclear weapons,' or that he has already decided to use them. Is the use of nuclear weapons imminent? Even before signing the revamped doctrine, Putin warned the U.S. and its NATO allies against allowing Ukraine to strike Russia with Western-supplied longer-range missiles, saying it would put Russia and NATO at war. Asked Tuesday if such a Ukrainian attack could potentially trigger a nuclear response, Peskov answered affirmatively. He pointed to the doctrine's provision that opens the door after a conventional strike that raises critical threats for Russia's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Peskov also emphasized the doctrine's new section that describes an attack by any country supported by a nuclear power as their joint aggression against Russia. Tatiana Stanovaya of the Carnegie Russia and Eurasia Center noted that Peskov's comment marked the first time the Kremlin explicitly acknowledged 'the potential use of nuclear weapons as a response to strikes on Russian territory using long-range missiles.' 'Put simply, Peskov openly admits that the Kremlin is currently considering the possibility of a nuclear strike,' she said. While the doctrine envisions a possible nuclear response by Russia, it is formulated broadly to avoid a firm commitment to use nuclear weapons and keep Putin’s options open. The U.S. has seen no change to Russia’s nuclear posture, according to a U.S. National Security Council official who was not authorized to comment publicly and requested anonymity. As a result, the Biden administration has 'not seen any reason to adjust our own nuclear posture or doctrine in response to Russia’s statements today,' the official added. Jack Watling, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute defense and security think tank in the U.K., said the use of Western longer-range missiles 'certainly will not' trigger Moscow's nuclear response as some in the West feared. But he added that 'Russia can escalate in a range of ways to impose costs on the West, from undersea sabotage to the employment of proxies to harass trade in the Bab el-Mandeb,' a strait off the Red Sea where attacks on shipping have been attributed to Yemen's Houthi rebels. Dmitry Medvedev, deputy head of Russia's Security Council that is chaired by Putin, was even more blunt. Ukraine's use of NATO missiles for strikes on Russian territory 'could be classified as an attack by bloc countries on Russia,' he said. 'In such a scenario, Russia reserves the right to retaliate with weapons of mass destruction against Kyiv and key NATO facilities, wherever they may be located,' he said. 'This would amount to World War III.' Stanovaya said 'the current situation offers Putin a significant temptation to escalate' and marks 'an extraordinarily dangerous juncture.' 'Putin may seek to present the West with two stark choices: ‘Do you want a nuclear war? You will have it,’ or ‘Let’s end this war on Russia’s terms,’' she posted on X. That would not interfere with any possible peace initiatives but could reinforce U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's argument for direct dialogue with Putin, she said. 'Simultaneously, it would expose Biden to criticism for being the catalyst of the escalation while potentially discouraging Ukraine from further using long-range missiles,' Stanovaya added. —- Aamer Madhani in Washington and Danica Kirka in London contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-nuclear-doctrine-putin-ukraine-war-b5ee115aa2099fa247f630e16da861d8	2024-11-19T08:04:10-08:00	
Iran defies international pressure, increasing its stockpile of near weapons-grade uranium, UN says	VIENNA (AP) — Iran has defied international demands to rein in its nuclear program and has increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, according to a confidential report by the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog seen Tuesday by The Associated Press. The report by the International Atomic Energy Agency said that as of Oct. 26, Iran has 182.3 kilograms (401.9 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60%, an increase of 17.6 kilograms (38.8 pounds) since the last report in August. Uranium enriched at 60% purity is just a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. The IAEA also estimated in its quarterly report that as of Oct. 26, Iran’s overall stockpile of enriched uranium stands at 6,604.4 kilograms (14,560 pounds), an increase of 852.6 kilograms (1,879.6 pounds) since August. Under the IAEA’s definition, around 42 kilograms (92.5 pounds) of uranium enriched to 60% purity is the amount at which creating one atomic weapon is theoretically possible — if the material is enriched further, to 90%. The reports come at a critical time as Israel and Iran have traded missile attacks in recent months after more than a year of war in Gaza, which is governed by Hamas, a group supported by Iran. Adding to the complexity, Donald Trump’s reelection raises questions about whether and how the incoming administration and Iran may engage. Trump’s first term in office was marked by a particularly troubled period, when he pursued a policy of 'maximum pressure' against Tehran. He unilaterally withdrew America from Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers, leading to sanctions hobbling the economy and ordered the killing of the country’s top general. Western diplomats consider censuring Iran Iran last week offered not to expand its stockpile of uranium enriched up to 60%, during a visit to Tehran by the IAEA chief, Rafael Mariano Grossi. The IAEA said during the meetings that 'the possibility of Iran not further expanding its stockpile of uranium enriched up to 60% U-235 was discussed, including technical verification measures necessary for the Agency to confirm this, if implemented.' The report said that one day after Grossi left Iran, on Nov. 16, IAEA inspectors verified that 'Iran had begun implementation of preparatory measures aimed at stopping the increase of its stockpile of uranium enriched up to 60 % U-235' at its underground nuclear sites in Fordow and Natanz. The reports come ahead of this week’s regular IAEA Board of Governors meeting in Vienna. A senior western diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter, confirmed to the AP that the United Kingdom, France and Germany, with the support from the U.S., are going ahead with a resolution at this week’s IAEA Board of Governors meeting, censuring Iran for its lack of cooperation, leading to potential confrontation with Iran ahead of Trump’s return to the White House. 'We remain tightly coordinated with our E3 partners (France, Germany and UK) in advance of the IAEA Board of Governors meeting. And, we strongly support efforts to hold Iran accountable,' U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters Tuesday in Washington. 'The Iranian regime continues to amass a growing stockpile of highly enriched uranium for which there is no credible civilian purpose and they continue to not cooperate fully with the IAEA,' he added. A senior diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, said it is possible that the commitments made by Iran during the IAEA’s chief visit may not stand in case a resolution is passed. In the past, Iran has responded to resolutions by the IAEA Board of Governors by further enhancing its nuclear program. Iran has maintained its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only, but Grossi has previously warned that Tehran has enough uranium enriched to near-weapons-grade levels to make 'several' nuclear bombs if it chose to do so. He has acknowledged the U.N. agency cannot guarantee that none of Iran’s centrifuges may have been peeled away for clandestine enrichment. Iran’s mission at the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Little progress on improving ties The IAEA also reported that Iran has failed to take concrete steps as of now to improve cooperation, despite pleas by Grossi, who held talks last week with Mohammad Eslami of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and Iran’s reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian. However, Tuesday’s confidential report also said that during Grossi’s visit to Iran on Nov. 14, 'Iran agreed to respond to the Agency’s concerns related to Iran’s withdrawal of the designation of several experienced Agency inspectors by considering the acceptance of the designation of four additional experienced inspectors.' In September 2023, Iran barred some of the Vienna-based agency’s most experienced inspectors. The report also said there was no progress thus far in reinstalling more monitoring equipment, including cameras, removed in June 2022. Since then, the only recorded data comes from IAEA cameras installed at a centrifuge workshop in Isfahan in May 2023 — although Iran has not provided the IAEA with access to this data and inspectors have not been able to service the cameras. Last week, Eslami warned that Iran could retaliate if challenged at the upcoming IAEA board meeting. Grossi acknowledged some nations were considering taking action against Iran. In an effort to ensure Iran could not develop atomic weapons, world powers struck a deal with Tehran in 2015 under which it agreed to limit enrichment of uranium to levels necessary for nuclear power in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. U.N. inspectors were tasked with monitoring the program Under the original 2015 nuclear deal, Iran was allowed to enrich uranium only up to 3.67% purity, can maintain a stockpile of uranium of 300 kilograms and is permitted to use only very basic IR-1 centrifuges, machines that spin uranium gas at high speed for enrichment purposes. A year after the U.S. withdrawal from the deal under Trump, Iran started to gradually abandon all limits the deal put on its program and began enriching uranium to up to 60% purity.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-nuclear-iaea-grossi-enriched-uranium-weapon-0525819542521d5f89bd09008f42cb2f	2024-11-19T06:32:08-08:00	
The mausoleum holding Congo independence hero Lumumba's gold-capped tooth is vandalized	KINSHASA, Congo (AP) — Congo’s government says the mausoleum of assassinated independence leader Patrice Lumumba in the capital, Kinshasa, has been vandalized. It's not immediately clear whether Lumumba’s remains — a single gold-capped tooth — were damaged or stolen. A mausoleum curator told the national press agency that the coffin containing the tooth was broken Monday. The glass doors were smashed and four suspects were arrested, the deputy mayor of the neighborhood where the mausoleum is located told the country's main radio channel. He added that he couldn't confirm whether the tooth was stolen or not. It's not clear who was responsible for the act of vandalism, Congo's ministry of culture said in a statement Tuesday. The return of Lumumba’s tooth from former colonizer Belgium in 2022 had been celebrated around Congo, with the tooth taken around the vast country so people could pay their respects. Lumumba is widely hailed as the nationalist activist who helped to end colonial rule. He became Congo’s first prime minister and was seen as one of Africa’s most promising new leaders, but he was assassinated within a year in 1961. His body was dismembered and dissolved with acid in an apparent effort to keep any grave from becoming a pilgrimage site. For many in Congo, Lumumba is a symbol of the positive developments the country could have achieved after its independence. Instead, it became mired in decades of dictatorship that drained its vast mineral riches. Historians say Lumumba was a victim of the Cold War. He promoted leftist policies, and when he reached out to the Soviet Union for help in putting down a secessionist movement in the mineral-rich Katanga region, he fell out of favor with Belgium and the United States. A military coup toppled Lumumba, and he was arrested, jailed and later killed. His assassination, blamed on separatists, cleared the way for the rise of Mobutu Sese Seko, who ruled the country he later renamed Zaire for decades with support from Western powers until his death in 1997. Even though Lumumba’s killers were Congolese, questions have persisted over the complicity of Belgium and the United States because of his perceived Communist ties. His one remaining tooth was kept by the Belgian police commissioner who oversaw the destruction of his body. In 2016, the tooth was seized by Belgian officials from the police commissioner’s daughter. The tooth was returned to Congo after the visit of Belgium’s King Philippe, who expressed regrets for his nation’s abuses in Congo when it was a Belgian colony.	https://apnews.com/article/congo-lumumba-tooth-mausoleum-vandalized-383a9c9d7099a1f6d83e727667fd6c9e	2024-11-19T05:15:30-08:00	
Brazilian police arrest 5 officers in alleged 2022 coup plot to kill President Lula, others	SAO PAULO (AP) — Brazil ’s federal police arrested Tuesday five officers accused of plotting a coup that included plans to overthrow the government following the 2022 elections and kill then-President-elect Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, authorities said. The five also planned to kill Lula's running mate, Geraldo Alckmin, and Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes. The arrested included four special operations military personnel, one of whom is a retired brigadier general, and a federal police officer. The police said they also carried out three search warrants along with other measures, including seizing the suspects' passports and preventing them from contacting others. It was not clear when charges would be officially raised against the five suspects. 'The objective was to prevent the inauguration of the legitimately elected government and undermine the free exercise of democracy and the authority of Brazil’s judiciary,' de Moraes, who authorized the arrests, said of the plot in his order. 'These actions, peaking between November and December 2022, were part of a broader plan to carry out a coup d’état,' he added. Lula returned as Brazil’s president for a third, non-consecutive term after narrowly defeating far-right incumbent Jair Bolsonaro in October 2022. Bolsonaro, who frequently cast doubt on the election results without providing evidence and never conceded, left for the United States days before Lula’s January 2023 inauguration. In the aftermath of the elections, die-hard Bolsonaro supporters staged nationwide protests challenging the results, closing highways and camping outside military installations. That culminated in a Jan. 8, 2023 uprising, when thousands of demonstrators stormed government buildings in the capital of Brasilia a week after Lula’s inauguration, seeking to oust him from power. Retired Brig. Gen. Mário Fernandes, one of the officers arrested Tuesday, played a key role in linking these pro-Bolsonaro protest camps to Bolsonaro's Cabinet, according to details of the investigation that were included in the judge’s order and that were seen by The Associated Press. Fernandes served as interim general secretary in Bolsonaro’s Cabinet from October 2020 until the end of his term. Police said they found evidence that he outlined a plan to kill de Moraes, Lula and Alckmin and visited the protest camps outside military installations, including at the army headquarters in Brasilia. According to the police, there's evidence that Fernandes gave instructions and financial support to the protesters. Fernandes' plan, according to the document, also considered different scenarios — such as using explosives or poison at an official event — to assassinate the judge. Bolsonaro had long railed against the Supreme Court, focusing his ire on de Moraes. The former president's supporters consider de Moraes their chief enemy. The judge led a five-year probe into fake news and threats against Supreme Court justices, which has led to the ban of some far-right allies and supporters from social media and even some prison terms. De Moraes also presided over the nation’s top electoral court when it ruled Bolsonaro ineligible for office until 2030, finding that he had abused his power and cast unfounded doubts on the validity of the 2022 election result. Bolsonaro is also being investigated for a slew of potential crimes, including whether he was involved in inciting the capital uprising to oust his successor. Fernandes’ plan also described a scenario of poisoning Lula. The federal police officer arrested Tuesday, Wladimir Matos Soares, allegedly provided the other military coup plotters with information about Lula’s security. The document Tuesday contained no indication that any attempt to carry out an assassination on Lula or Alckmin was put into motion. However, investigators found messages and documents indicating that the plotters were monitoring and following de Moraes at the time. According to text messages analyzed by investigators, one of the military officers arrested was involved in an operation that officials believe was likely aimed at capturing the Supreme Court justice. On Dec. 15, 2022, military personnel had even taken positions near de Moraes in a parking lot, but the messages indicated they decided to abort the plan last minute. Sen. Flavio Bolsonaro, the former president’s son, appeared to seize on that, saying no assassination attempt actually took place and claimed that 'as repugnant as it is to think about killing someone, it’s not a crime.' However, Supreme Court Justice Gilmar Mendes told local TV network Globonews on Tuesday afternoon that the alleged actions went beyond just plotting and that they were in the process of implementation. A document that police previously seized from another arrested military officer, Lt. Col. Hélio Ferreira Lima, detailed a plan to overthrow the elected government, including orchestrating a probe into alleged election fraud and calling for new elections with a presidential decree backed by Congress. Investigators had previously found another document outlining a so-called Crisis Cabinet of 11 military personnel and headed by two high-ranking generals from Bolsonaro's administration, who would assume power after an attempted coup. Police have also found evidence that some of these documents were printed inside the presidential palace during Bolsonaro's term and that part of the plan was discussed at the residence of his running mate, former defense minister Gen. Braga Walter Braga Netto. Braga Netto's lawyers told local media they would wait to review the investigation before making any comments. In March, two top Brazilian military leaders told police that Bolsonaro had presented them a plan for him to remain in power after losing the 2022 election. However, both refused to take part in the plan and warned Bolsonaro they would arrest him if he tried it, according to judicial documents released earlier this year. Lula was informed of the arrests on Tuesday morning, according to media reports, as he was hosting the final day of the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro where the Brazilian leader was to meet President Joe Biden and others. Lula made no mention of the arrests during his opening speech on the second day Tuesday of the summit. The army later said none of the arrested suspects were involved in providing security for the G20 but declined further comment the ongoing investigation. Last Wednesday, a man set off an explosion outside the Supreme Court in Brasilia, which de Moraes described as a consequence of frequent far-right attacks and hate speech targeting the country’s institutions. Federal police are investigating the blast as terrorism, according to the force's director, Andrei Passos Rodrigues.	https://apnews.com/article/brazil-president-lula-coup-plot-85a793fcef04c7dbd96746b947129042	2024-11-19T04:50:54-08:00	
Roger Federer tells friend and rival Rafael Nadal that he made him enjoy tennis more	MALAGA, Spain (AP) — Roger Federer says Rafael Nadal made him enjoy tennis 'even more' during a rivalry that spanned 40 matches over 15 years. Writing on social media Tuesday, hours before the start of the Davis Cup Final 8, Nadal's last event before heading into retirement, Federer began his message with the word 'Vamos' and said: 'As you get ready to graduate from tennis, I’ve got a few things to share before I maybe get emotional.' 'Let’s start with the obvious: you beat me — a lot. More than I managed to beat you. You challenged me in ways no one else could,' Federer said. 'On clay, it felt like I was stepping into your backyard, and you made me work harder than I ever thought I could just to hold my ground. You made me reimagine my game — even going so far as to change the size of my racquet head, hoping for any edge.' Federer, now 43, was established at No. 1 in the rankings when Nadal, now 38, came along. Federer started his career with a 7-0 record in Grand Slam finals before his first loss at that stage arrived against Nadal in the 2006 French Open final, the first of their three consecutive title matches in Paris — each with the same result. Nadal also defeated Federer in the 2008 Wimbledon final, ending the Swiss star’s bid for a sixth championship in a row at the All England Club. In all, Nadal led their head-to-head series 26-14, including 10-4 at Grand Slam tournaments and 6-3 in Slam finals. Still, Federer told Nadal in his post, referring to him by the nickname Rafa: 'You made me enjoy the game even more.' They helped form the Big Three of men's tennis along with Novak Djokovic, who is still active at age 37 and has won a men's-record 24 major trophies. Nadal is next on the list with 22, followed by Federer with 20. 'What an incredible run you’ve had,' Federer posted. 'Including 14 French Opens — historic! You made Spain proud ... you made the whole tennis world proud.' When Federer left the sport by playing a doubles match at the Laver Cup in September 2022, his partner was Nadal. The two sat side-by-side afterward, crying. 'It meant everything to me that you were there by my side — not as my rival but as my doubles partner,' Federer wrote Tuesday. 'Sharing the court with you that night, and sharing those tears, will forever be one of the most special moments of my career.' Nadal's Spanish team was scheduled to meet the Netherlands in the Davis Cup quarterfinals Tuesday. Neither Nadal nor Spain's captain, David Ferrer, would say Monday whether Nadal will play singles or doubles, both — or neither. 'Rafa, I know you’re focused on the last stretch of your epic career. We will talk when it’s done,' Federer wrote. 'I want you to know that your old friend is always cheering for you, and will be cheering just as loud for everything you do next.' ___ AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis	https://apnews.com/article/rafael-nadal-federer-davis-cup-retirement-227afcce823e736c3385719e5a36a797	2024-11-19T04:24:33-08:00	
Russia says Ukraine fired 6 US-made ATACMS at the Bryansk region, days after Biden policy shift	Ukraine fired six U.S.-made ATACMS missiles at Russia’s Bryansk region, Russia’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday, days after U.S. President Joe Biden eased restrictions on Ukrainian use of American-made weapons in the war that has reached its 1,000-day milestone. Ukraine claimed it hit a military weapons depot in Bryansk in the middle of the night, though it didn't specify what weapons it used. The Ukrainian General Staff said that multiple explosions and detonation were heard in the targeted area. In a statement carried by Russian news agencies, the Russian Defense Ministry said the military shot down five Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS, and damaged one more. The fragments fell on the territory of an unspecified military facility, the ministry said. The falling debris sparked a fire, but didn’t inflict any damage or casualties, it said. Neither side's claims could be independently verified. The announcement came after Biden authorized Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied missiles to strike deeper inside Russia, easing limitations on the longer range weapons after Russia deployed thousands of North Korean troops in the conflict. Earlier on Tuesday, Ukrainian officials reported a third Russian strike in three days on a civilian residential area in Ukraine killed at least 12 people, including a child. The strike by a Shahed drone in the northern Sumy region late Monday hit a dormitory of an educational facility in the town of Hlukhiv and wounded 11 others, including two children, authorities said, adding that more people could be trapped under the rubble. Ukrainian civilians have repeatedly been clobbered by Russian drones and missiles during the war, while on the battlefield it is under severe Russian pressure at places on the about 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line where its army is stretched thin against a bigger adversary. On Sunday, a Russian ballistic missile with cluster munitions struck a residential area of Sumy in northern Ukraine, killing 11 people and wounding 84 others. On Monday, a Russian missile barrage sparked apartment fires in the southern port of Odesa, killing at least 10 people and wounding 43. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that the series of aerial strikes proved that Russian President Vladimir Putin wasn't interested in ending the war. 'Each new attack by Russia only confirms Putin’s true intentions. He wants the war to continue. Talks about peace are not interesting to him. We must force Russia to a just peace by force,' Zelenskyy said. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-1000-days-attack-06002c8c50bfb2fc622f446a8580bc0e	2024-11-19T02:42:44-08:00	
Germany's defense minister says damage to 2 Baltic data cables appears to be sabotage	BERLIN (AP) — Germany's defense minister said Tuesday officials have to assume damage to two data cables under the Baltic Sea, one of which ends in Germany, was caused by sabotage — though he said they have no proof at present. Damage was detected Monday to the C-Lion1 cable that runs nearly 1.200 kilometers (750 miles) from the Finnish capital, Helsinki, to the German port city of Rostock. Another cable between Lithuania and Sweden was also damaged. Speaking in Brussels, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said that Russia poses not just a military but also a hybrid threat, and that Europe needs to take a broad approach to defense. He said the damage to the two cables was 'a very clear sign that something is afoot.' 'No one believes these cables were severed by mistake, and I also don't want to believe versions that it was anchors that by chance caused damage to these cables,' he said at a regular meeting of European Union defense ministers. 'So we have to state — without knowing in concrete terms who it came from — that this is a hybrid action. And we also have to assume — without already knowing it, obviously — that this is sabotage.' The foreign ministries of Finland and Germany had already said Monday evening that the damage raised suspicion of sabotage. They said in a joint statement that the damage comes at a time that 'our European security is not only under threat from Russia‘s war of aggression against Ukraine, but also from hybrid warfare by malicious actors.' The statement said the countries were investigating the incident, and that it was crucial that such 'critical infrastructure' be safeguarded.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-finland-baltic-data-cables-sabotage-russia-12082dcc129d04e417d15d3f1b24add7	2024-11-19T01:25:03-08:00	
US envoy says a truce in Lebanon is 'within our grasp' as Gaza's food crisis worsens after looting	BEIRUT (AP) — A United States envoy said an agreement to end the Israel-Hezbollah war is 'within our grasp' after talks in Lebanon on Tuesday. There was no such optimism in the Gaza Strip, where the looting of nearly 100 aid trucks by armed men worsened an already severe food crisis. Amos Hochstein, the Biden administration's pointman on Israel and Lebanon, arrived as Hezbollah's allies in the Lebanese government said it had responded positively to the proposal, which would entail both the militants and Israeli ground forces withdrawing from a U.N. buffer zone in southern Lebanon. The buffer zone would be policed by thousands of additional U.N. peacekeepers and Lebanese troops. Israel has called for a stronger enforcement mechanism, potentially including the ability to operate against any Hezbollah threats, something Lebanon is likely to oppose. Hochstein said he held 'very constructive talks' with Lebanon’s Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, an ally of Hezbollah who is mediating on the group’s behalf. 'Specifically today, we have continued to significantly narrow the gaps,' he told reporters after the two-hour meeting. 'I’m here in Beirut to facilitate that decision-making, but it’s ultimately the decisions of the parties to reach a conclusion to this conflict. ... It is now within our grasp.' In Gaza, meanwhile, the theft of nearly 100 trucks loaded with food and other humanitarian aid over the weekend sent prices soaring and caused shortages in central Gaza, where most of the population of 2.3 million people have fled and where hundreds of thousands are crammed into squalid tent camps. An even more severe hunger crisis is underway in the north, where Israel has been waging a weekslong offensive that has killed hundreds of people and driven tens of thousands from their homes. Experts say a famine might already have set in there. Food prices soar in central Gaza after looting On Monday, a crowd of people waited outside a shuttered bakery in the central city of Deir al-Balah. A woman who had been displaced from Gaza City, identifying herself as Umm Shadi, said the price of flour had climbed to 400 shekels (over $100) a bag, if it can even be found. Nora Muhanna, another woman displaced from Gaza City, said she was leaving empty-handed after waiting five hours for a bag of bread for her children. 'From the beginning, there are no goods, and even if they are available, there is no money,' she said. The United Nations said armed men stole food and other aid from 98 trucks over the weekend, the largest single incident of its kind since the start of the war. It did not say who was behind the theft. U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the convoy of 109 trucks was instructed by the Israeli military to take an 'alternative, unfamiliar route' after the aid was brought in through the Kerem Shalom crossing, and that the trucks were stolen near the crossing itself. Israel has long accused Hamas of stealing aid, allegations denied by the militant group. Al-Aqsa TV, a media outlet operated by the militants, said Hamas-run security forces in Gaza had launched an operation against looters, killing 20 of them. Bassem Naim, a senior Hamas official based abroad, said the looters were young men from Bedouin tribes in the area, emphasizing that they do not necessarily represent the tribes. He said they operate east of Rafah near Israeli military positions. The Hamas-run government had a police force of tens of thousands that maintained a high degree of public security before the war, but they have vanished from the streets in many areas after being targeted by Israeli strikes. Hamas says it has taken measures to prevent both looting and price-gouging in local markets. Wars rage on in Biden administration's final months Hamas ignited the war in Gaza when its fighters stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 43,800 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities, who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants in their toll. The war has left much of the territory in ruins and forced around 90% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million to flee, often multiple times. Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel the day after the Hamas attack in what it said was solidarity with the Palestinians and Hamas, a fellow Iran-backed militant group. Israel launched retaliatory airstrikes, and all-out war erupted in September. The fighting has left more than 3,500 dead in Lebanon and almost 15,000 wounded, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. It also displaced nearly 1.2 million, or a quarter of Lebanon’s population. On the Israeli side, 87 soldiers and 50 civilians have been killed by rockets, drones and missiles. The Biden administration has spent several months trying to broker cease-fires on both fronts. It appears to have made some progress in Lebanon, while talks over a cease-fire and the release of hostages held in Gaza stalled over the summer. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to end the wars in the Middle East without saying how he would do it. He was a staunch supporter of Israel and its hawkish government during his first term. ___ Shurafa reported from Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip and Khaled from Cairo. ___ Find more of AP’s coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-lebanon-hezbollah-iran-11-19-2024-a76670f9373598edd964139280eba60c	2024-11-19T00:34:36-08:00	
Putin lowers the threshold for using his nuclear arsenal after Biden's arms decision for Ukraine	President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday formally lowered the threshold for Russia’s use of its nuclear weapons, a move that follows U.S. President Joe Biden’s decision to let Ukraine strike targets inside Russian territory with American-supplied longer-range missiles. The new doctrine allows for a potential nuclear response by Moscow even to a conventional attack on Russia by any nation that is supported by a nuclear power. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Ukraine fired six U.S.-made ATACMS missiles early Tuesday at a military facility in Russia's Bryansk region that borders Ukraine, adding that air defenses shot down five of them and damaged one more. While the doctrine envisions a possible nuclear response by Russia to such a conventional strike, it is formulated broadly to avoid a firm commitment to use nuclear weapons and keep Putin's options open. The approval of the document demonstrates Putin’s readiness to tap his nuclear arsenal to force the West to back down as Moscow presses a slow-moving offensive in Ukraine as the war reached its 1,000th day. Asked Tuesday if a Ukrainian attack with longer-range U.S. missiles could potentially trigger a nuclear response, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov answered affirmatively, pointing to the doctrine’s provision that holds the door open for it after a conventional strike that raises critical threats for the 'sovereignty and territorial integrity: of Russia and its ally, Belarus. Commenting on whether the updated doctrine was deliberately issued to follow Biden’s decision, Peskov said the document was published 'in a timely manner' and that Putin instructed the government to update it earlier this year so that it is 'in line with the current situation.' Putin first announced changes in the nuclear doctrine in September, when he chaired a meeting discussing the proposed revisions. He has previously warned the U.S. and other NATO allies that allowing Ukraine to use Western-supplied longer-range weapons to hit Russian territory would mean that Russia and NATO are at war. Washington has permitted Ukraine to use the longer-range weapons on targets inside Russia after declaring that thousands of North Korean troops were deployed in the Russian region of Kursk to fight an incursion by Kyiv's forces. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer denounced the revised nuclear doctrine as the 'latest example of irresponsibility' from 'the depraved Russian government,' according to spokesperson Camilla Marshall. 'Russia’s the one that continues to escalate this war, and the use of North Korean troops is just one example of that,' Marshall said. 'He could remove his troops, roll back his tanks and end the onslaught and needless bloodshed in both Ukraine and Russia. … We would urge him to do so.' The updated doctrine says an attack against Russia by a nonnuclear power with the 'participation or support of a nuclear power' will be seen as their 'joint attack on the Russian Federation.' It says any massive aerial attack on Russia could trigger a nuclear response but avoids any firm commitment and mentions the 'uncertainty of scale, time and place of possible use of nuclear deterrent' among the key principles of the nuclear deterrence. The document also notes that aggression against Russia by a member of a military bloc or coalition is viewed as 'an aggression by the entire bloc,' a clear reference to NATO. At the same time, it spells out conditions for using nuclear weapons in greater detail compared with previous versions of the doctrine, noting they could be used in case of a massive air attack involving ballistic and cruise missiles, aircraft, drones and other flying vehicles. The formulation appears to significantly broaden the triggers for possible nuclear weapons use compared with the document's previous version, which stated Russia could tap its atomic arsenal if case of an attack with ballistic missiles. President Alexander Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus with an iron hand for more than 30 years and has relied on Russian subsidies and support, has allowed Russia to use his country’s territory to send troops into Ukraine and to deploy some of its tactical nuclear weapons. Since Putin sent troops into Ukraine, he and other Russian voices have frequently threatened the West with Russia’s nuclear arsenal to discourage it from ramping up support for Kyiv. Russian hawks called for toughening the doctrine for months, arguing the previous version failed to deter the West from increasing its aid to Ukraine and created the impression that Moscow would not resort to nuclear weapons.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-nuclear-doctrine-putin-91f20e0c9b0f9e5eaa3ed97c35789898	2024-11-19T00:11:50-08:00	
Leader of Georgia's separatist region of Abkhazia resigns, ending unrest	TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — The separatist leader of Georgia's breakaway region of Abkhazia resigned on Tuesday after days of unrest, in which the opposition and its supporters seized key government buildings and at least 14 people were injured in clashes with police. Demonstrators stormed the buildings on Friday to protest new measures allowing Russians to buy property in the seaside region, and demanded the ouster of self-styled Abkhazian President Aslan Bzhania, who is backed by Moscow. Bzhania said that he was prepared to resign if the protesters cede control of the buildings, but the opposition refused to do so until he stepped down. An agreement to end the unrest was reached on Tuesday, Russian media reported, with Bzhania submitting his resignation after all, and the opposition agreeing to leave the occupied buildings. Russian state media outlet Sputnik quoted Abkhazian Vice President Badra Gunba as saying that the agreement was reached after more than nine hours of negotiations. Bzhania's resignation — which he promised to walk back if the protesters didn't cede control of government buildings — was approved by Abkhazia's parliament on Tuesday afternoon, and Gunba became the province's acting president, Spuntik reported. Most of Abkhazia broke away from Georgia in fighting that ended in 1993, and Georgia lost control of the rest of the territory in a short war with Russia in 2008. Russia recognizes Abkhazia as an independent country, but many Abkhazians are concerned that the region of about 245,000 people is a client state of Moscow. Abkhazia’s mountains and Black Sea beaches make it a popular destination for Russian tourists and the demand for holiday homes could be strong. At least 14 people were injured Friday when opposition protesters clashed with police, Russian state news agencies reported. Lawmakers had gathered at the region’s parliament building to discuss ratifying measures allowing Russian citizens to buy property in the breakaway state. However, the session was postponed as demonstrators broke down the gate to the building’s grounds with a truck and streamed inside. Some threw rocks at police, who responded with tear gas. The arrest of five opposition figures at a similar demonstration last week set off widespread protests the next day in which bridges leading to Sukhumi were blocked.	https://apnews.com/article/georgia-abkhazia-separatist-protest-russia-agreement-759a7d94df9e175d2d56ece5ab30f286	2024-11-18T23:29:58-08:00	
Middle East latest: US envoy arrives in Lebanon to meet with officials about possible cease-fire	A U.S. envoy has arrived in Beirut to meet with Lebanese officials about a possible cease-fire in the Israel-Hezbollah war. Amos Hochstein, a senior advisor to United States President Joe Biden, arrived Tuesday, a day after Hezbollah reportedly gave a positive response to a U.S. draft proposal to end the war, which has been ongoing for more than 13 months. The U.S. has been working on a proposal to end hostilities that would remove Israeli ground forces from Lebanon and push Hezbollah forces away from the Israeli border. More Lebanese troops and U.N. peacekeepers would be sent to the buffer zone in southern Lebanon as part of the deal. Hochstein’s main meeting on Tuesday will be with Lebanon’s Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, a Hezbollah ally who is mediating for the militants. Hochstein’s arrival came hours after an Israeli strike in central Beirut killed five people and wounded others. It was the third Israeli strike in the heart of Beirut in two days. Since late September, Israel has dramatically escalated its bombardment of Lebanon, vowing to severely weaken Hezbollah and end its rocket barrages into Israel. Hezbollah began firing rockets, and drawing Israeli retaliation, on Oct. 8, 2023, a day after Hamas’ attack on southern Israel ignited the war in Gaza. Both groups are supported by Iran. The fighting has left more than 3,500 dead in Lebanon and almost 15,000 wounded, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. It also has displaced nearly 1.2 million, or a quarter of Lebanon’s population. On the Israeli side, 87 soldiers and 50 civilians, including some foreign laborers who work in agriculture, have been killed by attacks involving rockets, drones and missiles. ___ Here's the Latest: Qatar says Hamas leaders have left Doha but denies closure of the group's office BEIRUT — Qatar’s foreign ministry spokesperson says Hamas leaders have left Doha but denied reports that Qatar has ordered a permanent closure of the Palestinian militant group’s political office or expulsion of its previously Doha-based leadership. Qatar, which had served as a mediator in indirect cease-fire negotiations between Israel and Hamas for a cease-fire and hostage exchange deal, has suspended its efforts after growing frustration with the lack of progress on a cease-fire deal for Gaza. The Qatari spokesman, Majed bin Mohammed al-Ansari, told reporters on Tuesday that 'if there is decision to close the office permanently you will hear this news from this platform or in an official statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.' 'The leaders of Hamas that are in the negotiating team are now not in Doha and as you know, they move between the different capitals,' he said. '...The office in Doha was created for the purpose of the mediation process — obviously when there is no mediation process, the office itself doesn’t have any function.' Al-Ansari did not say where the Hamas leaders went nor did he rule out that Doha might return to its mediating role. 'The suspension of negotiation efforts does not in any way mean that there is a Qatari position to withdraw from de-escalation efforts or that there is a change in the position of the State of Qatar on the need to end this war,' he said. Israel's military says it sent 1,000 units of blood to a northern Gaza hospital JERUSALEM — The Israeli military has facilitated the delivery of blood units to a hospital in isolated northern Gaza. Israel has imposed a tight siege on the northernmost part of the territory since launching an offensive there in early October. Aid groups say very little humanitarian assistance has been allowed in and have warned of famine. The military agency in charge of transferring aid to Gaza, COGAT, said it had sent 1,000 units of blood through a northern crossing on Monday. The U.N.’s health cluster said the blood shipment was delivered to Kamal Adwan hospital in Beit Lahiya. Tens of thousands of Palestinians have fled the northernmost reaches of the strip since the offensive began, and hospitals there have struggled to function. Israeli forces kill three militants in the West Bank JERUSALEM — Israeli forces have killed three militants in the occupied West Bank. The military says they were killed during an ongoing raid in Jenin, in the north of the occupied territory, which has been a flashpoint for Israeli-Palestinian violence in recent years, even before the war in Gaza. Hamas identified all three of those killed as its fighters. Since Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack triggered the war in Gaza, Israeli fire has killed at least 784 Palestinians in the West Bank, including 167 children, according to the Palestinian Authority’s Health Ministry. Most appear to have been militants killed during Israeli raids, but the dead also include people killed during violent protests as well as civilian bystanders. There has also been a rise in stabbing, shooting and car-ramming attacks against Israelis. Israel seized the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war, and the Palestinians want it to form the main part of their future state. Israel issues veiled warning to Iranian-backed militias in Iraq JERUSALEM — Israel has issued a veiled threat to strike Iraq in response to recent attacks by Iran-backed militant groups based there. In a letter to the United Nations Security Council posted on X, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said his country has the right to 'take all necessary measures to protect itself and its citizens against the ongoing acts of hostilities by Iranian-backed militias in Iraq.' Militants in Iraq have launched several rocket and drone attacks against both Israel and U.S. forces since Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack triggered the war in Gaza. An Oct. 3 drone attack launched from Iraq on an army base in northern Israel killed two Israeli soldiers and wounded 24, Saar said. Israel is believed to have struck militants in Iraq in 2019, but it has not acknowledged any such strikes since the start of the war in Gaza. Israel has carried out hundreds of strikes on Iran-backed militants in Syria, Lebanon and Yemen. In his letter, Saar called on the U.N. to take 'immediate action' to address the situation. US envoy says a conclusion to the Israel-Hezbollah conflict is ‘within our grasp’ BEIRUT — A U.S. envoy to the Middle East says he had 'very constructive talks' in Lebanon and that reaching an agreement to end the Israel-Hezbollah war 'is now within our grasp.' 'Specifically today, we have continued to significantly narrow the gaps. The meeting was very constructive and very helpful,' Amos Hochstein, the U.S. envoy to Lebanon and Israel, told reporters Tuesday. He spoke after a two-hour meeting with Lebanon’s Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, an ally of Hezbollah who is mediating on the group’s behalf. The emerging agreement would apparently restore a U.N. buffer zone patrolled by international peacekeepers and Lebanese troops in southern Lebanon, with Israel withdrawing its ground forces and Hezbollah militants pulling back to the north. Hochstein, who has been shuttling back and forth for several months, said he came back to the region because 'we have a real opportunity to bring this conflict to an end.' 'I’m here in Beirut to facilitate that decision-making, but it’s ultimately the decisions of the parties to reach a conclusion to this conflict,' he said. 'It is now within our grasp.' Hochstein was scheduled to meet Lebanon’s caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati and other officials. 'I am committed to do everything I can to work with the government here in Lebanon and in Israel to bring this conflict to a close,' he said. UN peacekeeping force says it's maintaining positions in Lebanon GENEVA — The U.N. peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon, under pressure from an Israeli military campaign against militant group Hezbollah in its area of operations, says Argentina has asked three of its officers in the contingent to return home, while all other contributing countries are maintaining their commitments. Spokesman Andrea Tenenti of UNIFIL said its 'operational capabilities have not changed' after the move by Argentina, and U.N. forces have not moved from their positions – despite Israeli Defense Forces asking them to move from positions near the 'blue line' along the Lebanon-Israel border about a month ago. 'The posture of our more than 10,000 peacekeepers from nearly 50 countries remain unchanged,' he told a U.N. briefing in Geneva by video conference from Beirut. The UNIFIL forces have not left the 50 positions across their area of operations, aiming to monitor and report on this situation since Israeli forces began their military campaign in Lebanon in September. He said UNIFIL has limited means to monitor the situation amid the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. While Israeli forces have at times moved deeper into Lebanon, it’s not 'permanently,' and the level of destruction in UNIFIL zones was 'huge' and 'shocking.' Separately, UNICEF spokesman James Elder told the U.N. briefing that more than 200 children have been killed in Lebanon in less than the last two months, saying 'their deaths are being met with inertia from those able to stop this violence.' 'It’s become a silent normalization of horror,' Elder said. Tuesday marks 1-year anniversary of Houthi attacks on shipping in Red Sea DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Tuesday marks the one-year anniversary of Yemen’s Houthi rebels beginning their attacks on shipping in the Red Sea corridor. On Nov. 19, 2023, the Houthis seized the car carrier Galaxy Leader in a helicopter-borne attack in the Red Sea. The ship and its 25 crew remain held until today, something the United Nations Security Council noted in a statement calling on the rebels to release the ship and its crew. The Houthis have attacked over 90 commercial vessels in the time since. They sank two vessels in the campaign, which also killed four sailors.

Foreign governments criticize Hong Kong's sentencing of 45 activists. Beijing defends it	HONG KONG (AP) — Forty-five prominent activists in Hong Kong were sentenced to jail for up to 10 years on Tuesday, sparking criticism from foreign governments and rights groups. Beijing defended the decisions. The democracy advocates were among 47 people charged under a Beijing-imposed national security law in 2021 for their involvement in an unofficial primary election to pick opposition candidates. In the city's biggest national security case to date, they were accused of agreeing to veto government-proposed budgets after potentially securing a legislative majority to force a dissolution of the legislature and the ouster of the city’s leader. The case involved pro-democracy figures. Thirty-one of them pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit subversion. Fourteen others were convicted following a long trial. Two were acquitted. Australia Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said her government is 'gravely concerned' by the sentences for Australian citizen Gordon Ng and the other activists. Wong said Australia has expressed strong objections to authorities in China and Hong Kong over the continuing broad application of national security legislation. Britain Catherine West, minister for the Indo-Pacific in Britain’s Foreign Office, said the sentencing demonstrates how Hong Kong authorities use the security law to criminalize political dissent. 'Those sentenced today were exercising their right to freedom of speech, of assembly and of political participation,' she said. China Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said no one should be allowed to use democracy as a pretext to engage in unlawful activities and escape justice. Lin said certain Western countries ignored that they maintain their own national security through judicial procedures while unreasonably criticizing Hong Kong courts for 'fairly implementing' the security law. 'This severely violates and tramples on the spirit of the rule of law,' he said at a news briefing. He said Beijing firmly opposes what he described as certain Western countries' interference in China's internal affairs and their attempts to smear Hong Kong's rule of law. European Union The European Union called the sentencing 'another unprecedented blow' against the city's fundamental freedoms, democratic participation and pluralism. The bloc said in a statement that its members are deeply concerned about the politically motivated prosecution of people engaging in peaceful political activity. It said such activities should be legitimate in any political system that respects basic democratic principles. Hong Kong Hong Kong leader John Lee said the activists' plan was to undermine, destroy or overthrow the city's political system. The government said the case was handled strictly in accordance with the law. Hong Kong Security Minister Chris Tang said the sentences reflect the severity of the offenses. Tang said national security helps safeguard the city's prosperity, so his government takes any violations of the law seriously. 'Different people may have different judgments about whether the sentencing is appropriate. But I think the important point is the rule of law,' he said in a news briefing. Taiwan Taiwan presidential office spokesperson Karen Kuo said democracy is not a crime and condemned the Chinese government for using what she called unjust procedures to suppress the political participation and freedom of speech of Hong Kong pro-democracy figures. The sentencing 'not only breaks the promises of ‘50 years unchanged’ and ‘high degree of autonomy,’ but further proves that ‘one country, two systems’ is unfeasible,' she said in a statement. When Hong Kong returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997, Beijing promised to retain its Western-style civil liberties for 50 years under the governing principle of 'one country, two systems.' United Nations Jeremy Laurence, spokesperson for the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said he is gravely concerned by the use of the security law to criminalize conduct protected by the human rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and association. 'We will continue to engage with the Chinese authorities as we have done in the past,' he said. United States The State Department said it 'strongly' condemned the sentences and called on Hong Kong authorities to 'immediately and unconditionally release the 45 individuals and similarly detained political prisoners.' 'These harsh sentences erode confidence in Hong Kong’s judicial system and harm the city’s international reputation,' said spokesperson Matthew Miller on Tuesday. The department said it plans to 'impose new visa restrictions on multiple Hong Kong officials responsible for implementing' the security law. The U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong said the defendants were aggressively prosecuted and jailed for participating in normal political activity protected under the city's mini-constitution, and called for their immediate release. In Washington, D.C., the chairs of the bipartisan Congressional-Executive Commission said the sentences violate international law and called for wide condemnation. Rep. Chris Smith, a New Jersey Republican, and Sen. Jeff Merkley, a Democrat from Oregon, asked the Biden administration to sanction judges and prosecutors responsible for 'undermining democracy and human rights in Hong Kong.' 'These politically motivated prosecutions are occurring at the same time that dozens of U.S. CEOs are being wined and dined by Hong Kong officials and urged to invest in Hong Kong,' the lawmakers said. 'Each of these U.S. financial titans should be asked whether the Hong Kong government’s mass detentions of political prisoners and regular bulldozing of the rule of law undermine the city’s attractiveness as an international commercial and financial center.' Hong Kong's last British governor Hong Kong's last British governor, Chris Patten, said in a statement the sentencing was 'not only an affront to the people of Hong Kong, but those who value rights and freedoms around the world.' He condemned the 'sham' sentences and urged the British government not to allow the results of the case to go unnoticed. He said the activists were an integral part of the city's pro-democracy movement. Amnesty International Amnesty International China director Sarah Brooks said the people convicted in the 'politically motivated' case should not spend even a day in jail. 'None of the 45 people sentenced have committed an internationally recognized crime; they have been jailed only for exercising their human rights,' she said. Human Rights Watch Maya Wang, associate China director at Human Rights Watch, said, 'Running in an election and trying to win it is now a crime that can lead to a decade in prison in Hong Kong.' Wang said the harsh sentences reflect how fast Hong Kong's civil liberties and judicial independence have nosedived in the past four years since the security law was introduced. ___ Associated Press writer Didi Tang in Washington, D.C., Jamey Keaten in Geneva and Sylvia Hui in London contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/hong-kong-activists-sentencing-reaction-8072c53b68ed770fb1926f31f40a6a97	2024-11-18T22:20:41-08:00	
Australian tourists hospitalized after apparent severe alcohol poisoning in Laos party town	VANG VIENG, Laos (AP) — Two Australian tourists are being treated in Thailand for suspected severe alcohol poisoning after consuming tainted drinks in neighboring Laos, Australian media reported Tuesday. The two 19-year-old women were on a backpacking vacation in Laos when they became ill in the tourist town of Vang Vieng, The Age newspaper in the women’s hometown of Melbourne reported. Duong Duc Toan, manager of the Nana Backpacker Hostel, said staff were told by other guests that the women were unwell after they failed to check out as planned on Nov. 13, and they arranged transport to a hospital for them. He said that two days earlier the women had joined more than 100 other guests for free shots of Lao vodka offered by the hostel as a gesture of hospitality. He said no other guest reported any issue, adding that the women had then gone for a night out, returning in the early hours of the morning. Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade confirmed that it was providing consular assistance to two Australians and their families in Thailand but could not provide further information for privacy reasons. 'Our thoughts are with them at this deeply distressing time,' the office said. They were then transported to Thailand and are being treated at hospitals in Bangkok and Udon Thani, The Age reported. Their parents have flown in to be with them. It was not clear what the two drank, but methanol is sometimes used as the alcohol in mixed drinks at disreputable bars and can cause severe poisoning or death. It was not immediately possible to verify reports that other tourists were also poisoned in the same incident. Toan, the hostel manager, said he hoped the investigation would clear its name but for now the hostel has stopped giving free shots to its guests.	https://apnews.com/article/australian-laos-thailand-alcohol-poisoning-a5a4035fff9ac6e0960c0ffa4a2ef576	2024-11-18T21:39:34-08:00	
Stock market today: Wall Street points toward more losses as big US retailers report latest results	Wall Street was poised to open with losses early Tuesday as more prominent U.S. retailers report their latest financial results. Futures for the S&amp;P 500 declined 0.3% before the bell, while futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average were down 0.5%. The declines come as tensions flare between Ukraine and Russia with the war reaching 1,000 days. Walmart jumped 3.6% in premarket after it beat Wall Street's sales and profit targets and raised its outlook for the year. Walmart is among the first major U.S. retailers to report quarterly results and provides a peek into how Americans are feeling as they head into the holiday shopping season. Home improvement chain Lowe's also beat analyst estimates and raised guidance but its shares were down 1.4% before the bell. Super Micro Computer soared 26% after the server company announced it had hired BDO to be its independent auditor and submitted a compliance plan to the Nasdaq Stock Market to remain listed. Super Micro had lost more than half its value since its previous accounting firm, Ernst &amp; Young, resigned on Oct. 30, saying it could 'no longer be able to rely' on representations from the company’s management and audit committee. Other big companies set to report this week include chipmaker Nvidia and Target on Wednesday and Deere on Thursday. Nvidia, with a total market value of nearly $3.5 trillion, will need to hit analysts’ high expectations for growth during the latest quarter to justify its big stock price, which has surged 183% this year. In Europe at midday, Germany's DAX lost 1.3%, while the CAC 40 in Paris sank 1.5%. Britain's FTSE 100 shed 0.5%. In Asian trading, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 rose 0.5% to 38,414.43 and the Kospi in Seoul picked up 0.1% to 2,471.95. Chinese shares rebounded from early losses. They have wavered under concern over potential tariff hikes on by President-elect Donald Trump’s future administration and worries that recently announced stimulus policies won't have enough impact to break the economy out of the doldrums. The Shanghai Composite index rose 0.7% to 3,346.01, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng dipped and then recovered, adding 0.4% to 19,663.67. India's Sensex jumped gained 0.3%, while the Taiex in Taiwan surged 1.3%. In Bangkok, the SET gained 0.7%.

Money to respond to climate change is key to UN talks in Baku. Nations are finding ways to raise it	BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) — Just as a simple lever can move heavy objects, rich nations are hoping another kind of leverage — the financial sort — can help them come up with the money that poorer nations need to cope with climate change. It involves a complex package of grants, loans and private investment, and it's becoming the major currency at annual United Nations climate talks known as COP29. But poorer nations worry they’ll get the short end of the lever: not much money and plenty of debt. Meanwhile, half a world away in Brazil, leaders of the 20 most powerful economies issued a statement that among other things gave support to strong financial aid for climate for poor nations and the use of leverage financial mechanisms. That was cheered by climate analysts and advocates. Money is the key issue in Baku, where negotiators are working on a new amount of cash for developing nations to transition to clean energy, adapt to climate change and deal with weather disasters. It’ll replace the current goal of $100 billion annually — a goal set in 2009. Looking for the first domino to fall Negotiators are fighting over three big parts of the issue: How big the numbers are, how much is grants or loans, and who pays. The how big question is the toughest to negotiate and will likely be resolved only after the first two are solved, COP29 lead negotiator Yalchin Rafiyev told The Associated Press in an interview Tuesday. 'There are interlinkages of the elements. That’s why having one of them agreed could unlock the other one,' Rafiyev said. It's like the first domino falling leading to another, he said. In these negotiations, rich potential donor nations have been reluctant to offer a starting figure to negotiate from. So Rafiyev said the conference presidency is putting the pressure on them, telling 'the developed countries that the figure should be fair and ambitious, corresponding to the needs and priorities of the world.' Money could be in the form of loans, grants or private investment Experts put the need closer to $1 trillion, while developing nations have said they'll need $1.3 trillion in climate finance. But negotiators are talking about different types of money as well as amounts. So far rich nations have not quite offered a number for the core of money they could provide. But the European Union is expected to finally do that and it will likely be in the $200 to $300 billion a year range, Linda Kalcher, executive director of the think tank Strategic Perspectives, said Tuesday. It might be even as much as four times the original $100 billion, said Luca Bergamaschi, co-founding director of the Italian ECCO think tank. But there's a big difference between $200 billion and $1.3 trillion. That can be bridged with 'the power of leverage,' said Avinash Persaud, climate adviser for the Inter-American Development Bank. When a country gives a multilateral development bank like his $1, it could be used with loans and private investment to get as much as $16 in spending for transitioning away from dirty energy, Persaud said. When it comes to spending to adapt to climate change, the bang for the buck, is a bit less, about $6 for every dollar, he said. But when it comes to compensating poor nations already damaged by climate change — such as Caribbean nations devastated by repeated hurricanes — leverage doesn't work because there's no investment and loans. That's where straight-out grants could help, Persaud said. Whatever the form of the finance, Ireland’s environment minister Eamon Ryan said it would be 'unforgivable' for developed countries to walk away from negotiations in without making a firm commitment toward developing ones. 'We have to make an agreement here,' he said. 'We do have to provide the finance, particularly for the developing countries, and to give confidence that they will not be excluded, that they will be center stage.' For developing nations, the talk of loans brings fear of debt If climate finance comes mostly in the form of loans, it means more debt for nations that are already drowning in it, said Michai Robertson, climate finance negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States. 'All of these things are just nice ways of saying more debt,' Robertson said. His organization argues that most of the $1.3 trillion it seeks should be in grants and very low-interest and long-term loans that are easier to pay back. Only about $400 billion should be in leveraged loans, Robertson said. Leverage from loans 'will be a critical part of the solution,' said United Nations Environment Programme Director Inger Andersen. But so must grants and so must debt relief, she added. Rohey John, Gambia's environment minister, said the absence of a financial commitment from rich nations suggests 'they are not interested in the development of the rest of the mankind.' 'Each and every day we wake up to a crisis that will wipe out a whole community or even a whole country, to a crime that we never committed,' she said. Ministers giving their national statements also came out with fighting words. 'Our children, our elderly, our women, our girls, our Indigenous people, our youth deserve better,' said St. Kitts and Nevis Climate Minister Joyelle Clarke. 'Let us be seized by a desire for better.' Cuban environment minister Armando Rodriguez Batista urged countries not to 'favor death over life.' Praise and worry about G20 statement The G20's mention of the need for strong climate finance and especially the replenishment of the International Development Association gives a boost to negotiators in Baku, ECCO's Bergamaschi said. 'G20 Leaders have sent a clear message to their negotiators at COP29: do not leave Baku without a successful new finance goal,' United Nations climate secretary Simon Stiell said. 'This is an essential signal, in a world plagued by debt crises and spiraling climate impacts, wrecking lives, slamming supply chains and fanning inflation in every economy.' Analysts and activists said they were also worried because the G20 statement did not repeat the call for a transition away from fossil fuels, a hard-fought concession at last year's climate talks. Veteran climate talks analyst Alden Meyer of the European think tank E3G said the watering down of the G20 statement on fossil fuel transition is because of pressure by Russia and Saudi Arabia. He said it is 'just the latest reflection of the Saudi wrecking ball strategy' at climate meetings. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

1,000 days of war in Ukraine, distilled in a single 24-hour span of violence and resilience	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The clock on her wall stopped almost as soon as the day began, its hands frozen by the Russian bomb that hit the dormitory serving as home for Ukrainians displaced by war. It was 1:45 a.m. in an upstairs room in the eastern city of Zaporizhzhia, Natalia Panasenko’s home for just shy of a year after the town she thinks of as her real home came under Russian occupation. The explosion blasted a door on top of her, smashed her refrigerator and television and shredded the flowers she’d just received for her 63rd birthday. 'The house was full of people and flowers. People were congratulating me ... and then there was nothing. Everything was mixed in the rubble,' she said. 'I come from a place where the war is going on every day. We only just left there, and it seemed to be quieter here. And the war caught up with us again.' Nov. 11 was a typical day of violence and resilience in Ukraine. The Associated Press fanned out across Ukraine to chronicle 24 hours of life just as the country prepared to mark a grim milestone Tuesday: 1,000 days since Russia’s full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022. The day opened with two Russian bombings — one that hit Panasenko’s apartment and another that killed six in Mykolaiv, including a woman and her three children. Before the day was even halfway done, a Russian ballistic missile shattered yet another apartment building, this time in the city of Kryvyi Rih. Swimmers braved the Black Sea waters off Odesa, steelworkers kept the economy limping along, a baby was born. Soldiers died and were buried. The lucky ones found a measure of healing for their missing limbs and broken faces. About a fifth of Ukraine’s internationally recognized territory is now controlled by Russia. Those invisible geographical lines shift constantly, and the closer a person is to them the more dangerous life is. In the no-man’s-land between Russian and Ukrainian forces, there’s hardly any life at all. It’s called the Gray Zone for good reason. Ashen homes, charred trees and blackened pits left by shells exploding over 1,000 days of war stretch as far as the eye can see. Odesa, 6:50 a.m. The waters of the Black Sea hover around 13 degrees Celsius (55 Fahrenheit) in late fall. The coastline is mined. Dmytro's city is regularly targeted by drones and missiles. But Dmytro — who insisted on being identified only by his first name because he was worried for the safety of his family — was undaunted as he plunged into the waves with a handful of friends for their regular swim. Before the war, the group numbered a couple of dozen. Many fled the country. Men were mobilized to fight. Some returned with disabilities that keep them out of the water. His 33-year-old stepson is missing in action after a battle in the Donetsk region. For Dmytro and fellow swimmers, the ritual grounds them and makes the grimness of war more bearable. He said the risks of his hobby are well worth the reward: 'If you’re afraid of wolves, don’t go into the forest.' Zaporizhzhia, noon Managing the Zaporizhstal steel mill during wartime means days filled with calculations for Serhii Saphonov. The staff of 420 is less than half its pre-war levels. Power cuts from Russian attacks on electricity infrastructure require an 'algorithm of actions' to maintain operations. Russian forces are closing in on the coke mine in Pokrovsk that supplies the plant with coal. And the city is under increasing attack by Russia’s unstoppable glide bombs. Right outside his office, a bulletin board displays the names of 92 former steelworkers who have joined the army. Below are photos of the dead. Staff hold fundraisers for supplies for colleagues on the front, including two bulletproof vests sitting in the corner near his desk. 'The old workers, they carry everything on their shoulders. They are hardened. They know their job,' Saphonov said. 'Everyone knows that we have to endure, hold out, hoping that things will get better ahead.' Chernihiv, 1 p.m. Dr. Vladyslava Friz has performed more reconstructive surgeries in the past 1,000 days than she did in the previous decade of her career. And the injuries are like nothing she had ever seen before. Her days start early and end late. In the first months of the war, she said, the hospital was admitting 60 people per hour, and eight surgeons worked nonstop. They’re still catching up, because so many of the injured need multiple surgeries. On Nov. 11, she was rebuilding the cheek and jaw of a patient injured in a mine explosion. 'Appearance is a person’s visual identity,' she said. 'There is work to be done; we are doing it. We have no other options. There are medicines, equipment and personnel, but there are no metal structures for reconstruction. There is no state funding for implants.' She said she will not abandon her patients but worries that the world will abandon Ukraine as the war approaches its fourth year. 'The global community continues to lose interest in the events in Ukraine while we lose people every day,' she said. 'The world seems to have forgotten about us.' Odesa, 6 p.m. Yulia Ponomarenko has brought two babies into the world in the past 1,000 days, including Mariana on Nov. 11. Her husband, Denys, is fighting at the front. Their hometown, Oleshky, was submerged by flooding after the explosion of the Kakhovka Dam. But by then, she’d long since fled the occupying Russian forces, who target the families of Ukrainian soldiers. Mariana, born healthy at 3.8 kilograms and 55 centimeters (8 pounds, 6 ounces and 21 inches), will grow up with an older brother and sister and a menagerie of two cats and two dogs. 'This child is very expected, very wanted. We now have another princess,' Ponomarenko said. Kyiv, 9 p.m. The actors can't perform in their home theater in Kharkiv — too many bombs, too few people willing to gather in one place. So they've moved to the Ukrainian capital, where they played to a nearly full house on Nov. 11 as guests of the Franko Theater. 'Because of the war, the Kharkiv theater cannot play on its stage. We play underground. It is literally underground art. There are only two to three places in Kharkiv where we can play, and that's it,' said Mykhailo Tereshchenko, one of the principal actors of the Taras Shevchenko Academic Ukrainian Drama Theatre, named for Ukraine's most famous writer. Yevhen Nyshchuk, director of the Franko, said the theater paused production for a few months after the war started. Now, it's packed nearly every night there is a play, and the lengthy applause when curtains close is deafening. The reason goes beyond the quality of a performance at this point, he believes, and expresses 'this inner realization that in spite of everything, we will create, we will live, we will come, we will meet, we will applaud each other.' ___ Volodymyr Yurchuk and Anton Shtuka contributed from Kyiv.	https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-russia-war-1000-days-ade5a60cf2345d694871f85df162d08a	2024-11-18T20:09:58-08:00	
G20 summit calls for more aid to Gaza and an end to the war in Ukraine	RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Leaders of the world's 20 major economies called for a global pact to combat hunger, more aid for war-torn Gaza and an end to hostilities in the Mideast and Ukraine, issuing a joint declaration Monday that was heavy on generalities but short of details on how to accomplish those goals. The joint statement was endorsed by group members but fell short of complete unanimity. It also called for a future global tax on billionaires and for reforms allowing the eventual expansion of the United Nation Security Council beyond its five current permanent members. At the start of the three-day meeting which formally ends Wednesday, experts doubted Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva could convince the assembled leaders to hammer out any agreement at all in a gathering rife with uncertainty over the incoming administration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, and heightened global tensions over wars in the Mideast and Ukraine. Argentina challenged some of the language in initial drafts and was the one country that did not endorse the complete document. 'Although generic, it is a positive surprise for Brazil,' said Thomas Traumann, an independent political consultant and former Brazilian minister. 'There was a moment when there was a risk of no declaration at all. Despite the caveats, it is a good result for Lula.' Condemnation of wars, calls for peace, but without casting blame Taking place just over a year after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, the declaration referred to the 'catastrophic humanitarian situation in the Gaza and the escalation in Lebanon,' stressing the urgent need to expand humanitarian assistance and better protect civilians. 'Affirming the Palestinian right to self-determination, we reiterate our unwavering commitment to the vision of the two-State solution where Israel and a Palestinian State live side by side in peace,' it said. It did not mention Israel’s suffering or of the 100 or so hostages still held by Hamas. Israel isn’t a G20 member. The war has so far killed more than 43,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to local health officials, and more than 3,500 people in Lebanon following Israel’s offensive against Hezbollah, according to Lebanon’s Health Ministry. The omitted acknowledgment of Israel's distress appeared to run contrary to U.S. President Joe Biden’s consistent backing of Israel's right to defend itself. It's something Biden always notes in public, even when speaking about the deprivation of Palestinians. During a meeting with G20 leaders before the declaration was hammered home, Biden expressed his view that Hamas is solely to blame for the war and called on fellow leaders to 'increase the pressure on Hamas' to accept a cease-fire deal. Biden's decision to ease restrictions on Ukraine’s use of longer-range U.S. missiles to allow that country to strike more deeply inside Russia also played into the meetings, 'The United States strongly supports Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Everyone around this table in my view should, as well,' Biden said during the summit. Russian President Vladimir Putin did not attend the meeting , and instead sent his foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov. Putin has avoided such summits after the International Criminal Court issued a warrant that obliges member states to arrest him. The G20 declaration highlighted the human suffering in Ukraine while calling for peace, without naming Russia. 'The declaration avoids pointing the finger at the culprits,' said Paulo Velasco, an international relations professor at the State University of Rio de Janeiro. 'That is, it doesn’t make any critical mention of Israel or Russia, but it highlights the dramatic humanitarian situations in both cases.' The entire declaration lacks specificity, Velasco added. 'It is very much in line with what Brazil hoped for ... but if we really analyze it carefully, it is very much a declaration of intent. It is a declaration of good will on various issues, but we have very few concrete, tangible measures.' Fraught push to tax global billionaires The declaration did call for a possible tax on global billionaires, which Lula supports. Such a tax would affect about 3,000 people around the world, including about 100 in Latin América. The clause was included despite opposition from Argentina. So was another promoting gender equality, said Brazilian and other officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly. Argentina signed the G20 declaration, bit also had issues with references to the U.N.’s 2030 sustainable development agenda. Its right-wing president, Javier Milei, has referred to the agenda as 'a supranational program of a socialist nature.' It also objected to calls for regulating hate speech on social media, which Milei says infringes on national sovereignty, and to the idea that governments should do more to fight hunger. Milei has often adopted a Trump-like role as a spoiler in multilateral talks hosted by his outspoken critic, Lula. Concrete steps for fighting global hunger Much of the declaration focuses on eradicating hunger — a priority for Lula. Brazil’s government stressed that Lula’s launch of the global alliance against hunger and poverty on Monday was as important as the final G20 declaration. As of Monday, 82 nations had signed onto the plan, Brazil’s government said. It is also backed by organizations including the Rockefeller Foundation and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. A demonstration Sunday on Rio’s Copacabana beach featured 733 empty plates spread across the sand to represent the 733 million people who went hungry in 2023, according to United Nations data. Viviana Santiago, a director at the anti-poverty nonprofit Oxfam, praised Brazil for using its G20 presidency 'to respond to people’s demands worldwide to tackle extreme inequality, hunger and climate breakdown, and particularly for rallying action on taxing the super-rich.' 'Brazil has lit a path toward a more just and resilient world, challenging others to meet them at this critical juncture,' she said in a statement. Long-awaited reform of the United Nations Leaders pledged to work for 'transformative reform' of the U.N. Security Council so that it aligns 'with the realities and demands of the 21st century, makes it more representative, inclusive, efficient, effective, democratic and accountable.' Lula has been calling for reform of Security Council since his first two terms in power, from 2003 to 2010, without gaining much traction. Charged with maintaining international peace and security, its original 1945 structure has not changed. Five dominant powers at the end of World War II have veto power — the U.S., Russia, China, Britain and France — while 10 countries from different regions serve rotating two-year terms. Virtually all countries agree that nearly eight decades after the United Nations was established, the Security Council should be expanded to reflect the 21st century world and include more voices. The central quandary and biggest disagreement remains how to do that. The G20 declaration doesn’t answer that question. 'We call for an enlarged Security Council composition that improves the representation of the underrepresented and unrepresented regions and groups, such as Africa, Asia-Pacific and Latin America and the Caribbean,' the declaration said. The United States announced shortly before a U.N. summit in September that it supports two new permanent seats for African countries, without veto power, and a first-ever non-permanent seat for a small island developing nation. But the Group of Four – Brazil, Germany, India and Japan – support each other’s bids for permanent seats. And the larger Uniting for Consensus group of a dozen countries including Pakistan, Italy, Turkey and Mexico wants additional non-permanent seats with longer terms. ___ Associated Press writers Aamer Madhani in Rio de Janeiro, Edith M.

Toronto author Anne Michaels wins Giller Prize for novel 'Held'	TORONTO (AP) — Poet-novelist Anne Michaels has won the Giller Prize for her novel 'Held,' a multi-generational examination of war and trauma. The 100,000 Canadian dollar ($71,000) Giller prize honors the best in Canadian fiction. Past winners have included Margaret Atwood, Mordecai Richler and Alice Munro. Michaels appealed for 'unity' among 'all the arts' during her speech Monday night at the Toronto ceremony, held under the shadow of anti-war protests by other members of the literary community. Outside the Park Hyatt hotel, protesters renewed demands for the Giller Foundation to cut ties with several corporate sponsors, including Scotiabank over its stake in Israeli arms manufacturer Elbit Systems. Inside, the gala went off without any disruptions after last year’s ceremony was beset by pro-Palestinian demonstrators. 'Held' moves backwards and forwards through time as it follows a photographer-turned-First World War solider, his descendants, their spouses and their spouses’ parents. The Giller jury cited 'Held' as an impactful and hypnotic exploration of mortality, resilience and desires. The Giller was created in 1994 by late businessman Jack Rabinovitch in memory of his late wife, literary journalist Doris Giller.	https://apnews.com/article/giller-prize-canadian-book-award-954017970112ab815cbe6c0a1d6603d2	2024-11-18T18:46:18-08:00	
42,000 crowd New Zealand's Parliament grounds in support of Māori rights	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — As tens of thousands of marchers crowded the streets in New Zealand’s capital Wellington on Tuesday, the throng of people, flags aloft, had the air of a festival or a parade rather than a protest. They arrived to oppose a law that would reshape the county’s founding treaty between Indigenous Māori and the British Crown. But for many, it was about something more: a celebration of a resurging Indigenous language and identity that colonization had once almost destroyed. 'Just fighting for the rights that our tūpuna, our ancestors, fought for,' Shanell Bob said as she waited for the march to begin. 'We’re fighting for our tamariki, for our mokopuna, so they can have what we haven’t been able to have,' she added, using the Māori words for children and grandchildren. What was likely the country’s largest-ever protest in support of Māori rights — a subject that has preoccupied modern New Zealand for much of its young history — followed a long tradition of peaceful marches the length of the country that have marked turning points in the history of modern New Zealand. 'We’re going for a walk!' One organizer proclaimed from the stage as crowds gathered at the opposite end of the city from the nation’s Parliament. Some had traveled the length of the country over the past nine days. For many, the turnout reflected growing solidarity on Indigenous rights from non-Māori. At bus stops during the usual morning commute, people of all ages and races waited with Māori sovereignty flags. Some local schools said they would not register students as absent. The city’s mayor joined the protest. The bill that marchers were opposing is unpopular and unlikely to become law. But opposition to it has exploded, which marchers said indicated rising knowledge of the Treaty of Waitangi’s promises to Māori among New Zealanders — and a small but vocal backlash from those who are angered by attempts by courts and lawmakers to keep them. Māori marching for their rights as outlined in the treaty is not new. But the crowds were larger than at treaty marches before and mood was changed, Indigenous people said. 'It’s different to when I was a child,' Bob said. 'We’re stronger now, our tamariki are stronger now, they know who they are, they’re proud of who they are.' As the marchers moved through the streets of Wellington with ringing Māori haka — rhythmic chants — and waiata, or songs, thousands more holding signs lined the pavement in support. Some placards bore jokes or insults about the lawmakers responsible for the bill, which would change the meaning of the principles of the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi and prevent them from applying only to Māori — whose chiefs signed the document when New Zealand was colonized. But others read 'proud to be Māori' or acknowledged the bearer’s heritage as a non-Māori person endorsing the protest. Some denounced the widespread expropriation of Māori land during colonization, one of the main grievances arising from the treaty. 'The treaty is a document that lets us be here in Aotearoa so holding it up and respecting it is really important,' said Ben Ogilvie, who is of Pākehā or New Zealand European descent, using the Māori name for the country. 'I hate what this government is doing to tear it down.' Police said 42,000 people tried to crowd into Parliament’s grounds, with some spilling into the surrounding streets. People crammed themselves onto the children's slide on the lawn for a vantage point; others perched in trees. The tone was almost joyful; as people waited to leave the cramped area, some struck up Māori songs that most New Zealanders learn at school. A sea of Māori sovereignty flags in red, black and white stretched down the lawn and into the streets. But marchers bore Samoan, Tongan, Indigenous Australian, U.S., Palestinian and Israeli flags, too. At Parliament, speeches from political leaders drew attention to the reason for the protest — a proposed law that would change the meaning of words in the country’s founding treaty, cement them in law and extend them to everyone. Its author, libertarian lawmaker David Seymour — who is Māori — says the process of redress for decades of Crown breaches of its treaty with Māori has created special treatment for Indigenous people, which he opposes. The bill’s detractors say it would spell constitutional upheaval, dilute Indigenous rights, and has provoked divisive rhetoric about Māori — who are still disadvantaged on almost every social and economic metric, despite attempts by the courts and lawmakers in recent decades to rectify inequities caused in large part by breaches of the treaty. It is not expected to ever become law, but Seymour made a political deal that saw it shepherded through a first vote last Thursday. In a statement Tuesday, he said the public could now make submissions on the bill — which he hopes will reverse in popularity and experience a swell of support. Seymour briefly walked out onto Parliament’s forecourt to observe the protest, although he was not among the lawmakers invited to speak. Some in the crowd booed him. The protest was 'a long time coming,' said Papa Heta, one of the marchers, who said Māori sought acknowledgement and respect. 'We hope that we can unite with our Pākehā friends, Europeans,' he added. 'Unfortunately there are those that make decisions that put us in a difficult place.'	https://apnews.com/article/maori-protest-hikoi-treaty-waitangi-principles-54d5a5345815bed2c2a12687d4f6b625	2024-11-18T18:30:48-08:00	
Numerous children injured by a vehicle at a school gate in central China	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Numerous children were injured by a vehicle at the gate of an elementary school in central China’s Hunan province on Tuesday morning, reports said. Students were arriving for classes around 8 a.m. at Yong'an Elementary School in the city of Changde when the incident occurred. Few details were immediately available, and it wasn’t clear whether the vehicle had lost control or whether it was a deliberate attack. The official Xinhua News Agency said several adults were also injured and identified the vehicle as a small white SUV. It said the driver was subdued by parents and security guards, and some of the injured were sent to the hospital immediately, with the total casualty count still unknown. Footage posted on Chinese social media showed the injured lying on the road while terrified students ran past the gate and inside the schoolhouse. Comments on Chinese internet sites reflected anger and frustration with recurring incidents of violence against citizens by those venting anger at society. 'No matter what the reason is, innocent children should not be harmed,' said one comment on the popular Weibo social media site. 'Timely resolve conflicts, prevent such incidents and severely punish the perpetrators,' said another. While China has much lower rates of violence than many countries — personal gun ownership there is illegal — knifings and the use of homemade explosives still occur. Chinese schools have been subject to numerous attacks by people armed with knives or using vehicles as weapons. A stabbing attack at a vocational school in the eastern Chinese city of Wuxi on Saturday left eight people dead and 17 others injured. That came shortly after a man drove his car into people at a sports facility in the southern city of Zhuhai, leaving 35 people dead and 43 others injured. In September, three people were killed in a knife attack in a Shanghai supermarket, and 15 others were injured. Police said at the time that the suspect had personal financial disputes and came to Shanghai to 'vent his anger.' The same month, a Japanese schoolboy died after being stabbed on his way to school in the southern city of Shenzhen. The Chinese government generally censors internet content it deems overly sensitive or political, and some images of the school incident were quickly taken down. Most Western social media sites and search engines like Google are blocked in China, limiting available content even while some people use tools like VPNs and send news through Chinese social media before the censors have time to catch it.	https://apnews.com/article/china-school-children-injured-3a2cfec62629de089dab285cf38d54b8	2024-11-18T17:27:54-08:00	
45 lawmakers and activists get 4 to 10 years in prison in Hong Kong's biggest national security case	HONG KONG (AP) — Forty-five lawmakers and activists were sentenced to four to 10 years in prison Tuesday in Hong Kong’s biggest national security case under a Beijing-imposed law that crushed a once-thriving pro-democracy movement. The were tried under the 2020 national security law for their roles in an unofficial primary election. Prosecutors said their aim was to paralyze Hong Kong’s government and force the city’s leader to resign by aiming to win a legislative majority and using it to block government budgets indiscriminately. Legal scholar Benny Tai, who was widely seen as the organizer of the unofficial primary, received the longest sentence of 10 years. The judges said the sentences had been reduced for defendants who said they were unaware the plan to secure a majority in the legislature and stall governance was unlawful. However, the court said the penalties were not reduced for Tai and Alvin Yeung, as they are lawyers who were 'absolutely adamant in pushing for the implementation of the Scheme.' In the judgment posted online, the judges wrote that Tai essentially 'advocated for a revolution' by publishing a series of articles over a period of months that traced his thinking, even though in his mitigation letter Tai said the steps were 'never intended to be used as blueprint for any political action.' Two of the 47 original defendants had been acquitted earlier this year. The rest either pleaded guilty to or were found guilty of conspiracy to commit subversion. The judges said in the verdict that the activists’ plans to effect change through the unofficial primary would have undermined the government’s authority and created a constitutional crisis. The judges rejected the reasoning from some defendants that the scheme would never have materialized, stating that 'all the participants had put in every endeavor to make it a success.' In the judgment, the judges highlighted that a great deal of time, resources and money had been put into the organization of the primary election. 'When the Primary Election took place on the 10 and 11 July, no one had remotely mentioned the fact that Primary Election was no more than an academic exercise and that the Scheme was absolutely unattainable,' the judgment read. 'In order to succeed, the organisers and participants might have hurdles to overcome, that however was expected in every subversion case where efforts were made to overthrow or paralyse a government.' Some of the defendants waved at their relatives in the courtroom after they were sentenced. Chan Po-ying, wife of defendant Leung Kwok-hung, told reporters she wasn’t shocked when she learned her husband received a jail term of six years and nine months. She said they were trying to use some of the rights granted by the city’s mini-constitution to pressure those who are in power to address the will of the people. 'This is an unjust imprisonment. They shouldn’t be kept in jail for one day,' said Chan, also the chair of the League of Social Democrats, one of the city’s remaining pro-democracy parties. Emilia Wong, the girlfriend of Ventus Lau, felt calm because Lau’s jail term was within her expectations. Wong said the sentencing was a 'middle phase' of history and she could not see the end point at this moment, but she pledged to support Lau as best as she could. Philip Bowring, the husband of Claudia Mo, was relieved that the sentences finally were handed down. Observers said the trial illustrated how authorities suppressed dissent following huge anti-government protests in 2019, alongside media crackdowns and reduced public choice in elections. The drastic changes reflect how Beijing’s promise to retain the former British colony’s civil liberties for 50 years when it returned to China in 1997 is increasingly threadbare, they said. Beijing and Hong Kong governments insisted the national security law was necessary for the city's stability. The sentencing drew criticism from foreign governments and human rights organizations globally. The U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong said the U.S. strongly condemned the sentences against the 45 pro-democracy advocates and former lawmakers. 'The defendants were aggressively prosecuted and jailed for peacefully participating in normal political activity protected under Hong Kong’s Basic Law,' the statement said. 'We call on (Beijing) and Hong Kong authorities to cease politically motivated prosecutions of Hong Kong citizens and to immediately release all political prisoners and individuals jailed for their peaceful advocacy for rights and freedoms.' Australia's Foreign Minister Penny Wong said its government was 'gravely concerned' by the sentences for Australian citizen Gordon Ng and the other activists. Wong said Australia has expressed strong objections to the Chinese and Hong Kong authorities on the continuing broad application of national security legislation. The subversion case involved pro-democracy activists across the spectrum. They include Tai, former student leader Joshua Wong and former lawmakers. Most of them have already been detained for more than three and a half years before the sentencing. The separations pained them and their families. More than 200 people stood in line in moderate rain and winds Tuesday morning for a seat in the court, including one of the acquitted defendants Lee Yue-shun. Lee said he hoped members of the public would show they care about the development of the court case. 'The public's interpretation and understanding has a far-reaching impact on our society's future development,' he said. A supporter locally known as 'Grandpa Wong,' who did not know the English spelling of his name, said he wanted to see the convicted activists again. He is about 100 years old and feared he wouldn't be able to see them when they are released from prison. Wei Siu-lik, a friend of convicted activist Clarisse Yeung, said she arrived at 4 a.m. even though her leg was injured. 'I wanted to let them know there are still many here coming here for them,' she said. Thirty-one of the activists entered a guilty plea and had better chances of getting reduced sentences. The law authorizes a range of sentences depending on the seriousness of the offense and the defendant’s role in it, going from under three years for the least serious to 10 years to life for people convicted of 'grave' offenses. The unofficial primary held in July 2020 drew 610,000 voters, and its winners would have advanced to the official election. Authorities canceled the official legislative election, however, citing public health risks during the COVID-19 pandemic.	https://apnews.com/article/hong-kong-activists-sentencing-unofficial-primary-1ed13be76fa4918d83f7d3e498f2f543	2024-11-18T16:23:49-08:00	
Greece to repay chunk of bailout debt early and touts recovery during anger over cost of living	ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Greece will make an early repayment of 5 billion euros ($5.3 billion) in bailout-era debt in 2025, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis told a banking conference in Athens on Monday, describing the move as a signal of the country's fiscal recovery. 'This ... underscores our confidence in public finances and reflects our commitment to fiscal discipline,' Mitsotakis said. Finance Ministry officials say they plan to reduce debt through primary surpluses, loan repayments and combating tax evasion. Greece has rebounded from a 10-year financial crisis that forced it to borrow tens of billions of euros from its European Union partners and the International Monetary Fund. But Mitsotakis' center-right government, elected for a second term in 2023, is struggling to address a cost of living crisis that has sapped Greeks' spending power. Despite the lack of any substantial challenge from opposition parties, the high cost of living has nibbled away at the government's approval ratings and triggered union anger. The country's two main private and public sector unions have called a general strike for Wednesday that will keep island ferries in port and disrupt other forms of transport and public services. A protest march will be held in central Athens on Wednesday morning. The GSEE main private sector union on Monday accused the government of 'refusing to take any meaningful measures that would secure workers dignified living conditions.' 'The cost of living is sky-high and our salaries rock-bottom, (while) high housing costs have left young people in a tragic position,' GSEE chairman Yiannis Panagopoulos said. According to EU forecasts, Greece's economy is expected to grow 2.1% in 2024 and maintain a broadly similar course over the following two years. Unemployment, now below 10%, is expected to keep declining, while inflation is projected at 3% this year.	https://apnews.com/article/greece-debt-strike-cost-of-living-f0bd69f12df0a1a34e93008d10789af2	2024-11-18T11:01:32-08:00	
UK hits Iran with new sanctions for supplying missiles to Russia	LONDON (AP) — The U.K. government hit Iran with new sanctions Monday for sending ballistic missiles and other weapons to Russia to support the war against Ukraine. The Foreign Office said it will freeze assets for Iran’s national airline and its state-owned shipping company that helped transfer weapons. It will also sanction the Russian cargo ship Port Olya-3 that delivered the missiles from Iran. 'Iran’s attempts to undermine global security are dangerous and unacceptable,' Foreign Secretary David Lammy said in a statement in advance of announcing the sanctions at the U.N. Security Council. 'Alongside our international partners, we were clear that any transfer of ballistic missiles from Iran to Russia would face a significant response.' The announcement comes on the eve of the 1,000th day of the war in Ukraine and the day after U.S. President Joe Biden authorized Ukraine to use missiles supplied by Washington to strike deeper inside Russia. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said at the G20 summit in Brazil that 'we need to double down' to support Ukraine as long as necessary. The asset freezes will restrict Iran Air’s ability to operate direct services to and from the United Kingdom and will prevent U.K. citizens or businesses from financial dealings with those entities, the office said. The actions follow a previous round of sanctions against Iran and Russia that it announced in September alongside Germany and France.	https://apnews.com/article/uk-iran-sanctions-supplying-russia-missiles-2a4b06b76b1157678e7b12b02c6ad2c3	2024-11-18T09:52:30-08:00	
US sanctions group that builds illegal West Bank settlements, with close ties to Israeli government	WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. on Monday imposed sanctions on organizations and firms involved in illegal settlement development in the occupied West Bank, including a well-established decades-old group that has close ties with Israeli leadership. Treasury sanctioned Amana, the largest organization involved in illegal settlement development in the West Bank, and its subsidiary Binyanei Bar Amana Ltd. Already sanctioned by Britain and Canada, Amana is one of the major funders and supporters of unauthorized settlements in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Peace Now, a settlement tracking group, says its assets are valued at around 600 million Israeli shekels, or about $160 million, and that it has a yearly budget stretching into tens of millions of shekels. Amana, which is based in the West Bank and has no known connection to the U.S. appliance maker, over the past few years has underwritten loans, signed contracts, bought equipment and funded infrastructure projects for new settlements, according to Peace Now. The settlements, small farming outposts, have become some of the primary drivers of violence and displacement of Palestinians living in the West Bank. Additionally, the State Department imposed diplomatic sanctions on Eyal Hari Yehuda Co., which provides construction logistics to sanctioned groups, as well as company owner Itamar Yehuda Levi. The co-founder of the already sanctioned nonprofit group Hashomer Yosh, Shabtai Koshlevsky, and Israeli citizen Zohar Sabah, who has perpetrated acts of violence on Palestinians, also were hit with sanctions. The penalties come as settlers in the territory celebrate the incoming Trump administration, believing it will likely take a more favorable approach to the settlements. During his first term, Trump took unprecedented steps to support Israel’s territorial claims, including recognizing Jerusalem as its capital and moving the U.S. Embassy there, and recognizing Israel’s annexation of the Golan Heights. Treasury’s Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo said the U.S. 'remains committed to holding accountable those who seek to facilitate these destabilizing activities, which threaten the stability of the West Bank, Israel, and the wider region.' Among other things, the sanctions deny the people and firms access to any property or financial assets held in the U.S. and prevent U.S. companies and citizens from doing business with them. In February, President Joe Biden issued an executive order that targets Israeli settlers in the West Bank who have been accused of attacking Palestinians and Israeli peace activists in the occupied territory. That order is used to justify the financial penalties against the companies and men. In response, Texans for Israel, a Christian nonprofit, Israeli nonprofit Regavim and others in August sued the Biden administration in Amarillo, Texas, over its sanctions against Israeli extremists in the West Bank. Eitay Mack, a human rights lawyer who has spent years campaigning for the sanctions on violent West Bank settlers, said the sanctions on Amana were 'an earthquake for the settlement project and especially the shepherds farms.' He called on the U.S. to extend the sanctions now to firebrand Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, also a far-right settler in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Cabinet. Amana’s leadership has appeared at pro-settlement events alongside Cabinet members. Peace Now says the group’s secretary-general, Zeev Hever, was greeted by Smotrich at a June conference where Smotrich laid out his plans for the West Bank. Violence against Palestinians and their displacement have only picked up since the Israel-Hamas war began on Oct. 7, 2023. Around 8,000 Palestinians have been displaced in the West Bank during that time and over 700 killed, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and Palestinian health officials. The Associated Press previously reported that the sanctions measures have had minimal impact, instead emboldening settlers as attacks and land-grabs escalate, according to Palestinians in the West Bank, local rights groups and sanctioned Israelis who spoke to AP. Additionally, Smotrich has previously vowed to intervene on sanctioned settlers’ behalf. Israel captured the West Bank along with east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want those territories for their hoped-for future state. Settlement growth and construction have been promoted by successive Israeli governments stretching back decades, but it has exploded under Netanyahu’s far-right coalition, which has settlers in key Cabinet posts. There are now well over 100 settlements and 500,000 Israeli settlers sprawling across the territory from north to south — a reality, rights groups say, dimming any hopes for an eventual two-state solution. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said 'we once again call on the Government of Israel to take action and hold accountable those responsible for or complicit in violence, forced displacement, and the dispossession of private land. The United States will continue to promote accountability for those who further destabilize conditions in the West Bank and support extremist violence in the region.' __ Frankel reported from Jerusalem.	https://apnews.com/article/treasury-sanctions-israel-hamas-gaza-war-8f652c7d2a5e53e5ca52d0c08a9a27cb	2024-11-18T09:30:34-08:00

Interior Chinatown': Its cast has faced Hollywood struggles uncannily like its characters	Jimmy O. Yang once played 'Chinese Teenager #1.' He's now No. 1 on the call sheet in 'Interior Chinatown' — despite playing downtrodden background actor Willis Wu in the new Hulu series. There’s no escaping the layers of meta around 'Interior Chinatown,' an adaptation of Charles Yu’s award-winning satirical novel that jabs at how Asian American men have been treated by Hollywood — and in life — one trope at a time. 'I feel like I have gone through every single number on the call sheet now,' Yang told The Associated Press. 'And I’ve learned from a lot of other great No. 1s, you know? To carry yourself a certain way. It’s not just about showing up when you work, but it’s also about leading by example.' The dramedy, premiering Tuesday, is told from the view of Willis, a Chinatown restaurant server stuck in a police procedural show whose perspective starts to shift as he looks into the yearslong disappearance of his older brother. The 10-episode season has a mostly Asian cast including Ronny Chieng, Chloe Bennet, Archie Kao and Tzi Ma. There is also plenty of Asian talent behind the scenes, led by Yu, who serves as creator and executive producer. The episodes are full of nods to cop dramas such as 'Law &amp; Order.' They also evoke scenes from '80s and '90s U.S. action-comedies structured around one of the co-leads being Asian and knowing martial arts — think 'Rush Hour' and 'Martial Law.' But it wasn't a youth spent watching these movies and shows that inspired Yu's book, which is structured like a screenplay. 'More what informed the book was the experiences of my parents, who are immigrants, and of their community and seeing how they and their friends had built lives here, were trying to be Americans, were succeeding at it in a lot of ways, but still were feeling like outsiders — and wanting to just tell their story,' Yu said. Taika Waititi, the director of 'Jojo Rabbit' and two 'Thor' movies and the first person of Māori descent to win an Academy Award, also produces. He's no stranger to promoting underrepresented voices on television, co-creating the Emmy-nominated 'Reservation Dogs,' the first series where every role on and off-screen was held by someone Indigenous. Growing up in New Zealand, he saw similarities in 'Interior Chinatown' with how Indigenous Māori like him were treated even in daily interactions. 'I remember working in a convenience store and I was always out the back of the convenience store. There were people who got to come in — and I’d been working there for six months — and they went straight to work on the till,' Waititi told The Associated Press. 'One of the big draws to me was to be able to be involved in something that highlights those issues.' The series' episode titles reference different archetypes that have shadowed Asian American actors for decades. These include 'delivery guy,' 'tech guy,' 'kung fu guy' and 'Chinatown expert.' There has been a reclaiming in recent years of 'kung fu guy,' particularly. Marvel’s 'Shang-Chi,' the CW’s 'Kung Fu,' and 'Warrior' on Max all have protagonists with martial arts prowess who also deal with personal baggage. All three stories happen to take place in San Francisco’s Chinatown. The show's commentary on stereotyping seems more relevant in a post-coronavirus pandemic era, Ma said. 'In every major city, you know, the Chinatowns are going through hard times particularly after the pandemic,' Ma said. 'I hope that people who come to Chinatown realize that Chinatown isn't just a place for you to eat food. It’s a community.' Chieng, who plays curmudgeonly restaurant server Fatty Choi, memorably stuck up for Chinatowns everywhere in 2016 when he used his 'Daily Show' gig to put Fox News’ Jesse Watters on blast for a racist segment about Manhattan’s Chinatown. (The Malaysian-born comedian says that takedown helped get him his part in 'Crazy Rich Asians,' alongside Yang. Unlike the characters in 'Interior Chinatown,' he says, he has since been very fortunate. In fact, he didn’t even have to read for Yu and other producers.) A third of 'Interior Chinatown's' main cast has been in projects set in a Chinatown, which Yu says affirms the story's examination of how Hollywood limits the range of roles available to Asian Americans. 'You don’t have to look too far down the IMDb listings of some of our cast who are really successful actors, but a few years ago could have easily been — you know, Jimmy likes to still tell the story of how he was ‘Chinese Teenager (#1)’ on Chloe’s show, ‘Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,’ which is 10 years ago,' Yu said. Bennet, who is half Chinese and half white, has spoken out before about struggling to be considered for roles when she used her actual surname, Wang. For so long, Bennet felt like her whiteness was what people saw at work and her '‘Asian-ness’ was always reserved for home,' the former 'Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.' star told the AP. So, just walking onto the 'Interior Chinatown' set was emotional. 'I’m viewed as white and so I’ve never really been a part of something where being Asian was so much at the forefront on and off-screen,' Bennet said. 'And so being surrounded by our incredible crew, who was also very diverse, was something I didn’t realize I’d seen and that it was the immediate power of representation. I felt so much more comfortable.' Yang, though, was too embarrassed to tell his frequent scene partner about his nameless part on her show. 'The journey that Willis was going through was the journey that I went through. I just have to zoom back 10 years,' said Yang, who also has his own production company. 'I had a phase where I was fighting for the same kind of roles. ... Even I had to fight to get Chinese Teenager #1.'	https://apnews.com/article/interior-chinatown-jimmy-o-yang-hulu-show-945dc249a00d138544acf98d210da5e6	2024-11-18T09:12:22-08:00	
Hungarian official criticizes Biden decision allowing Ukraine to use US weapons to strike Russia	BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — Hungary's foreign minister lashed out on Monday at U.S. President Joe Biden's decision to authorize Ukraine to use missiles supplied by Washington to strike deeper inside Russia, saying the move could serve to escalate the war and threaten the outbreak of a global conflict. The decision allowing Kyiv to use the Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMs, for attacks farther inside Russia comes as President Vladimir Putin positions North Korean troops along Ukraine’s northern border to try to reclaim hundreds of miles of territory seized by Ukrainian forces. The Kremlin has decried the move, warning that it would add 'fuel to the fire' and further heighten international tensions. On Monday, Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó, a fervent critic of Ukraine with close ties to Putin's government, said that Biden's decision was in contradiction to the will of voters who elected Donald Trump to the presidency earlier this month. Szijjártó also slammed European Union leaders that continue to make efforts to provide support to Kyiv. 'One has the feeling that the pro-war political elites on both sides of the ocean are launching one last desperate, scalding attack on the new realities and the will of the people,' Szijjártó said. Hungary's government under Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has been the most hostile in the EU to Ukraine's ambitions to join the 27-nation bloc, and eventually the NATO military alliance. Orbán, the Kremlin's closest EU partner, has consistently opposed aid for Ukraine and threatened to block sanctions against Moscow for its war. Szijjártó called Biden's authorization of Ukraine to use U.S. weapons 'incredibly dangerous,' and warned that it carried the risk of the war, which marks 1,000 days on Tuesday, spreading further. 'Then there is the demand of Ukrainians and the permissive opinion of some NATO member countries regarding the invitation of Ukraine to NATO,' Szijjártó said. Such membership for Ukraine 'would bring the real threat of World War III very close,' he said. President-elect Trump, who takes office in about two months, has raised uncertainty about whether his administration would continue vital military support to Ukraine. He has also vowed to quickly end the war, but hasn't detailed how. Hungary's government has long advocated for an immediate cease-fire in the conflict but avoids commenting on what such a move would mean for Ukraine's territorial integrity or the broader security implications for Europe. ___ Follow the AP’s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/hungary-criticizes-biden-ukraine-weapons-russia-f928f4c245a1cc977f21136548a8a2f8	2024-11-18T09:05:53-08:00	
Israeli airstrike hits central Beirut near key government buildings and embassies	BEIRUT (AP) — An Israeli airstrike slammed into a densely populated residential area in Lebanon’s capital near key government and diplomatic buildings late Monday, killing at least five people as the U.S. pressed ahead with cease-fire efforts. Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency said two missiles hit the area of Zoqaq al-Blat neighborhood – where local U.N. headquarters and Lebanon’s parliament and prime minister’s office are located. Since late September, Israel has dramatically escalated its bombardment of Lebanon, vowing to severely weaken the Iranian-backed Hezbollah militant group and end its barrages in Israel that the militants have said are in solidarity with Palestinians during the war in Gaza. The U.S. has been working on a cease-fire proposal that would remove Israeli ground forces from Lebanon and push Hezbollah forces far from the Israeli border. Lebanon’s Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, a Hezbollah ally who is mediating for the militants, is expected to meet with U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein in the Lebanese capital on Tuesday. The White House has not confirmed Hochstein's visit. Labor Minister Mostafa Bayram, who met with Berri on Monday, said Lebanon would convey its 'positive position' to the latest U.S. proposal. The Israeli military had no immediate comment on the strike, which also wounded 24 people, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. Many areas in central Beirut, including Zoqaq al-Blat, have become a refuge for many of the roughly 1 million people displaced by the ongoing conflict in southern Lebanon and the southern suburbs of Beirut. The strike also occurred near a Hussainiye, a Shia mosque. The target of the airstrike remained unclear, and the Israeli army did not issue a prior warning. Ambulance sirens echoed through the streets as an Associated Press photographer on the scene saw significant casualties on the street. It was the second consecutive day of Israeli strikes on central Beirut after more than a monthlong pause. On Sunday, a strike in the area of Ras el-Nabaa killed Hezbollah media spokesperson Mohammed Afif, along with six other people, including a woman. Later that day, four people were killed in a separate strike in the commercial district of Mar Elias. The Israeli military has not said what the target of that strike was. Minutes after Monday's strike, Lebanon’s caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati said in a post on X, 'All countries and decision-makers are required to end the bloody and destructive Israeli aggression on Lebanon and implement international resolutions, most notably Resolution 1701.' UN Security Council Resolution 1701, adopted in 2006, ended a monthlong war between Israel and Hezbollah and was intended to create a buffer zone in southern Lebanon. However, the resolution’s full implementation has faced challenges from both sides. The resolution is again on the table as part of an American proposal for a cease-fire deal, aiming to end 13 months of exchanges of fire between Israel and Hezbollah. Israeli ground forces, who invaded southern Lebanon on Oct. 1, would fully withdraw from Lebanon, where the Lebanese army and the U.N. peacekeeping force UNIFIL would be the exclusive armed presence south of Lebanon’s Litani River. Hezbollah would withdraws from the area. A Western diplomat familiar with the talks told The Associated Press there is a sense of 'cautious optimism.' The diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss behind-the-scenes negotiations, said a final deal, however, was 'still in the hands' of the warring players. Israel is said to be pushing for guarantees it can continue to act militarily against Hezbollah if needed, a demand the Lebanese are unlikely to accept. Israeli government spokesperson David Mencer said Israel would continue attacking Hezbollah infrastructure while the US and other countries led negotiations for the ceasefire. 'The military campaign will continue until the immediate threat from Lebanon is removed,' he said. Also on Monday, Hezbollah launched dozens of projectiles against Israel. A rocket that hit the northern Israeli city of Shfaram killed one woman and injured 10, according to Israel’s Magen David Adom rescue services. More then 3,500 people have been killed by Israeli fire, according to Lebanon’s Health Ministry. In Israel, 77 people, including 31 soldiers, have been killed by Hezbollah projectiles, while over 50 soldiers have been killed in the Israeli ground offensive. Israel has said it is targeting Hezbollah in order to ensure that thousands of Israelis can return to their homes near the border. ___ Associated Press writer Melanie Lidman contributed from Tel Aviv, Israel.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-gaza-palestinians-hezbollah-news-nov-18-2024-e97ba8991d02530306d10b1962b1c6e1	2024-11-18T08:11:23-08:00	
Starmer calls for strong UK-China relationship as he meets with Xi in Brazil	LONDON (AP) — U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that he wanted a strong and durable relationship with China Monday as he met with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 summit in Brazil. It was the first time a British leader has met with Xi in recent years as ties between the two countries deteriorated over security and human rights concerns and China’s support for Russia in the war in Ukraine. Starmer, who became prime minister in July after his Labour Party won a landslide election victory, is seeking to repair relations with Beijing. The last time a U.K. leader met with Xi was in 2018. 'We want our relations to be consistent, durable, respectful, as we have agreed (and) avoid surprises where possible,' Starmer told Xi during a meeting on the fringes of the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro. Downing Street said that Starmer wanted a 'pragmatic' approach to working with Beijing on global stability, boosting economic ties and especially climate change and the transition to clean energy. Starmer also raised more thorny issues including concerns over the detention of Hong Kong pro-democracy publisher and activist Jimmy Lai, a U.K. citizen who has been in custody since December 2020. Lai, 76, could face up to life in prison if he is convicted under a sweeping national security law that Beijing has imposed on the former British colony. Journalists were ushered out of the room at the start of Monday's bilateral meeting around the time Starmer raised Lai's case, Britain's Press Association agency reported. Starmer 'wanted to engage honestly and frankly on those areas where we have different perspectives, including on Hong Kong, human rights and Russia’s war in Ukraine,' his office said in a statement after the meeting. Xi told Starmer that the U.K. and China have potential for more cooperation despite their differences and should deepen political trust for mutual benefit, according to China's Xinhua state news agency. Monday's meeting came after U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy paid a visit to Beijing last month for talks with his counterpart, Wang Yi.	https://apnews.com/article/uk-china-starmer-xi-g20-brazil-b1314c8aabf33db8fbf8e2af58d54ac9	2024-11-18T06:29:35-08:00	
What does Biden's decision to allow Ukraine to use longer-range US weapons mean?	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The U.S. will allow Ukraine to use American-supplied longer-range weapons to conduct strikes inside Russian territory, a long-sought request by Kyiv. It was not clear if there would be limits on Ukraine's use of the Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMS, as there have been on other U.S. missile systems. Their deployment could — at least initially — be limited to Russia's Kursk region, where Ukrainian troops seized territory earlier this year. Since the first year of the war, Ukrainian leaders have lobbied Western allies to allow them to use advanced weapons to strike key targets inside Russia — a move they hope would erode Moscow’s capabilities before their troops reach the eastern front line and could make it more difficult for them to strike Ukrainian territory. It could also serve as a deterrent force in the event of future cease-fire negotiations. The U.S. has long opposed the move, with President Joe Biden determined to avoid any escalation that he felt could draw the U.S. and other NATO members into direct conflict with nuclear-armed Russia. The Kremlin warned Monday that the decision adds 'fuel to the fire.' The decision comes in the waning days of Joe Biden’s presidency, before President-elect Donald Trump, who has said he would bring about a swift end to the war that many fear could force unpalatable concessions from Kyiv, assumes office. What are ATACMS? The ballistic missiles, developed by U.S. aerospace and defense company Lockheed Martin, have nearly double the striking distance — up to 300 kilometers (190 miles) — of most of the weapons in Ukraine's possession. They can carry out pinpoint attacks on air fields, ammunition stores and strategic infrastructure. The United States supplied Ukraine with ATACMS last year and they have been used to destroy military targets in Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine — but not on Russian soil. What is Biden allowing Ukraine to do? Biden authorized Ukraine to use the ATACMS to strike deeper inside Russia, according to a U.S. official and three other people familiar with the matter. The longer-range missiles are likely to be used in response to North Korea’s decision to send troops to support Kremlin forces, according to one of the people familiar with the development. Pyongyang’s troops are apparently being deployed to help the Russian army drive Ukrainian forces out of Russia’s Kursk border region, where they launched an incursion in August. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the U.S. decision publicly. It marks the second time that Washington has permitted Ukraine to use its weapons systems inside Russian territory. In May, after Russia’s offensive into the Kharkiv region threatened to stretch Ukrainian forces thin, Biden permitted the use of HIMARS systems — with a range of 80 kilometers (50 miles) — to quell that advance. That decision helped Ukrainian soldiers stabilize the fight for a time by forcing Russian forces to pull back military assets. Why does Ukraine need longer-range weapons? Ukraine has been asking its Western allies for longer-range weapons in order to alter the balance of power in the war where Russia is better resourced, and strike with precision air bases, supply depots and communication centers hundreds of kilometers (miles) over the border. It hopes the weapons would help blunt Russia’s air power and weaken the supply lines it needs to launch daily strikes against Ukraine and to sustain its military ground offensive into Ukraine. If used in Kursk, the weapons would likely require Russian forces preparing for counterattacks to push back valuable equipment and manpower and complicate battle plans. In lieu of Western weapons, Ukraine has been regularly striking Russia with domestically produced weapons, with some capable of traveling up to 1,000 kilometers (620 miles), but still lacks sufficient quantities to do serious long-term harm. Will the decision change the course of the war? The effect depends on the rules set for the weapons' use. If strikes are allowed across all of Russia, they could significantly complicate Moscow's ability to respond to battlefield demands. If strikes are limited to the Kursk region, Russia could relocate its command centers and air units to nearby regions, blunting the effect of those logistical challenges. That would also mean many of the valuable targets Ukrainian officials have expressed desire to hit may still be beyond reach. Ukrainian leaders are being cautious about the announcement. 'Today, many in the media are talking about the fact that we have received permission to take appropriate actions. But blows are not inflicted with words. Such things are not announced. The rockets will speak for themselves,' said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of the announcement. Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Charlie Dietz has noted the ATACMS wouldn’t be the answer to the main threat Ukraine faces from Russian-fired glide bombs, which are being fired from more than 300 kilometers (180 miles) away, beyond the ATACMS' reach. Ukrainian leaders have also said that Russian forces have had time to pull back assets beyond the range of the missiles in the time it has taken the U.S. to make the decision. 'The decision came far too late. Had it been made at the beginning of the fall, it might have disrupted Russia’s counteroffensive in the Kursk region. And if it had been made even earlier, it could have derailed the offensive in the Pokrovsk direction,' said Glib Voloskyi, an analyst at the CBA Initiatives Center, a think tank. In addition, the overall supply of ATACMS is short, so U.S. officials in the past have questioned whether they could give Ukraine enough to make a difference. Some supporters of Ukraine say that even a few strikes deeper inside Russia would force its military to change deployments and expend more of its resources. And the decision may also encourage Britain and France to allow Ukraine to use Storm Shadow missiles, also known as SCALP missiles, with a range of 250 kilometers (155 miles). ___ Associated Press writers Hanna Arhirova in Kyiv, Ukraine, Aamer Madhani in Manaus, Brazil, and Colleen Long, Zeke Miller, Matthew Lee and Ellen Knickmeyer in Washington contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-russia-war-biden-what-are-atacms-missiles-8d8621321af8c673bd42a5693c2ad1f4	2024-11-18T05:29:51-08:00	
Abuse survivors urge the Vatican to globalize the zero-tolerance policy it approved in the US	ROME (AP) — Survivors of clergy sexual abuse urged the Vatican on Monday to expand its zero-tolerance policy that it approved for the U.S. Catholic Church in 2002 to the rest of the world, arguing that children everywhere should be protected from predator priests. The U.S. norms, adopted at the height of the abuse scandal there, say a priest will be permanently removed from church ministry based on even a single act of sexual abuse that is either admitted to or established under church law. That 'one strike and you’re out' policy in the U.S. has long stood out as the toughest in the church. It is held up by some as the gold standard, by others as excessive and by still others as imperfect but better than most. It was adopted by U.S. bishops as they scrambled to try to regain credibility following the revelations of abuse and cover-up in Boston documented by the Boston Globe’s 'Spotlight' series. Since then, the church abuse scandal has erupted globally, and survivors from around the world said Monday there’s no reason why the U.S. norms couldn’t and shouldn’t be applied universally. They called for changes in the church’s in-house canon law and reasoned they could be approved since the Holy See already approved the norms for the U.S. church. 'Despite Pope Francis’ repeated calls for zero tolerance on abuse, his words have yet to lead to any real action,' said Gemma Hickey, a transgender survivor of abuse and the president of the global survivor network Ending Clergy Abuse. The proposal launched at a press conference was hammered out during an unusual meeting in June in Rome between survivors and some of the Catholic hierarchy's top priestly experts on preventing abuse. It was described by participants at the time as a 'historic collaboration' between two groups that often talk past one another, given victims' deep distrust of the Catholic hierarchy. The priestly participants in that meeting included the Rev. Hans Zollner, who heads the church’s main academic think tank on safeguarding; the No. 2 at the Vatican’s child protection advisory board, Bishop Luis Manuel Ali Herrera; and the Gregorian University’s canon law dean, the Rev. Ulrich Rhode as well as diplomats from the U.S., Australian and other embassies. However, there was apparently no one from the Vatican legal office, secretariat of state or the discipline section of the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith, which processes all abuse cases worldwide and largely sets policy on applying the church’s canon law — albeit in secret since its cases are never published. As a result, it was unclear what would become of the proposed policy changes, given the U.S. norms only came about because U.S. bishops pushed the Vatican to approve them, driven by their outraged flocks and insurance companies. Nicholas Cafardi, a U.S. canon lawyer who was an original member of the U.S. National Review Board that provided input to the 2002 U.S. norms, said globalizing that policy into universal church law 'would be one of the logical next steps' for Francis to take to continue the fight against abuse. But Cafardi, author of 'Before Dallas,' about the lead-up to the 2002 Dallas bishops' meeting that approved the norms, said that some bishops today bristle at how the policy limits their authority and freedom. And in a telephone interview, he noted that even in the U.S., the norms are only still in place because the U.S. bishops keep formally asking to keep them, which he acknowledged was a 'weakness' in the system. 'It seems to me that a good protection would be ‘Let’s just make it universal law,’' said Cafardi. 'Once you have that law, you don’t have to worry about the bishops asking for it in country after country. It’s just the law.' However, the proposal faces an uphill battle since the Vatican in recent years has repeatedly insisted on 'proportionality' in its sentences for abuse, refusing to apply a one-size-fits-all approach and taking into account cultural differences in countries where abuse isn't as openly discussed as it is in the West. That has resulted in seemingly light punishments for even confirmed cases of abuse which, in the U.S., would have resulted in a priest being permanently removed from ministry. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Germany and Finland investigate a severed data cable through the Baltic Sea	HELSINKI (AP) — German and Finland expressed deep concern over the discovery Monday of a severed undersea data cable between the countries through the Baltic Sea, saying it raised suspicions of sabotage and that an investigation was underway. The foreign ministries of the two countries said in a joint statement that the damage comes at a time that 'our European security is not only under threat from Russia‘s war of aggression against Ukraine, but also from hybrid warfare by malicious actors.' The statement said the countries were investigating the incident, and that it was crucial that such 'critical infrastructure' be safeguarded. 'The fact that such an incident immediately raises suspicions of intentional damage speaks volumes about the volatility of our times,' the two countries said. The Finnish state-controlled data services provider Cinia said the severed data cable was detected Monday in the C-Lion1 cable that runs nearly 1.200 kilometers (750 miles) from the Finnish capital, Helsinki, to the German port city of Rostock. Cinia said Finland’s international data and telecommunications connections are secured by running them through several redundant lines, and the effects of a single cable failure would depend on the security level of service providers’ connections. The C-Lion1, commissioned in 2016, is Finland’s only data communications cable that runs from the Nordic country directly to central Europe, according to Finnish public broadcaster YLE. Finnish media outlets noted that the cable's route to Germany runs in the vicinity of the two NordStream gas pipelines between Russia and Germany that aren’t currently functioning.	https://apnews.com/article/finland-germany-data-communications-cable-9b231aa47501545690a26a442fe106a5	2024-11-18T04:32:15-08:00	
Today he is a high school football player. Soon he'll be a Buddhist lama in the Himalayas	ISANTI, Minn. (AP) — The young Buddhist lama sat on a throne near an altar decorated with flowers, fruits and golden statues of the Buddha, watching the celebrations of his 18th birthday in silence, with a faint smile. Jalue Dorje knew it would be the last big party before he joins a monastery in the Himalayan foothills -- thousands of miles from his home in a Minneapolis suburb, where he grew up like a typical American teen playing football and listening to rap music. But this was not an ordinary coming-of-age celebration. It was an enthronement ceremony for an aspiring spiritual leader who from an early age was recognized by the Dalai Lama and other Tibetan Buddhist leaders as a reincarnated lama. From the stage, he saw it all: The young women in white long bearded masks who danced, jumping acrobatically and twirling colorful sticks to wish him luck in a tradition reserved for dignitaries. The banging of drums. The procession of hundreds – from children to elderly -- who lined up to bow to him and present him with a 'khata' -- the white Tibetan ceremonial scarves that symbolize auspiciousness. From a throne reserved for lamas, he smelled the aroma of Tibetan dishes prepared by his mother over sleepless nights. He heard the monks with shaved heads, in maroon and gold robes like his own, chant sacred mantras. Behind them, his shaggy-haired high school football teammates sang 'Happy Birthday' before he cut the first slice of cake. One of his buddies gave him shaker bottles for hydrating during training at the gym; another, a gift card to eat at Chipotle Mexican Grill. 'I was in awe!' Dorje recalled later. 'Usually, I’d be at the monk section looking up to whomever was celebrating. But that night it was for me.' Watching Monday Night Football and memorizing ancient Buddhist prayers Since the Dalai Lama’s recognition, Dorje has spent much of his life training to become a monk, memorizing sacred scriptures, practicing calligraphy and learning the teachings of Buddha. After graduation in 2025, he’ll head to northern India to join the Mindrolling Monastery, more than 7,200 miles (11,500 kilometers) from his home in Columbia Heights. Following several years of contemplation and ascetism, he hopes to return to America to teach in the Minnesota Buddhist community. His goal is 'to become a leader of peace,' following the example of the Dalai Lama, Nelson Mandela and Gandhi 'There’s going to be a lot of sacrifice involved,' Dorje said. But he’s not new to sacrifices. He remembered all the early mornings reciting ancient prayers and memorizing Buddhist scriptures, often rewarded by his dad with Pokémon cards. 'As a child, even on the weekend, you’re like: ‘Why don’t I get to sleep more? Why can’t I get up and watch cartoons like other kids.’ But my dad always told me that it’s like planting a seed,' he said, 'and one day it’s going to sprout.' It all began with the process of identifying a lama, which is based on spiritual signs and visions. Dorje was about 4 months old when he was identified by Kyabje Trulshik Rinpoche, a venerated master of Tibetan Buddhism and leader of the Nyingma lineage. He was later confirmed by several lamas as the eighth Terchen Taksham Rinpoche — the first one was born in 1655. After the Dalai Lama recognized him at age 2, Dorje’s parents took him to meet the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism when he visited Wisconsin in 2010. The Dalai Lama cut a lock of Dorje’s hair in a ceremony and advised his parents to let their son stay in the U.S. to perfect his English before sending him to a monastery. Dorje is fluent in English and Tibetan. He grew up reading the manga graphic novel series ″Buddha,' and is an avid sports fan. He roots for the Timberwolves in basketball, Real Madrid in soccer, and the Atlanta Falcons in football. He even keeps a rookie card of wide receiver Drake Londo pasted to the back of his phone, which he carried wrapped in his robes during his party. On the football field, playing as a left guard, his teammates praised his positivity, often reminding them to have fun and keep losses in perspective. 'It’s someone to look up to,' said Griffin Hogg, 20, a former player who took Dorje under his wing. He said they learned from each other and credits Dorje with helping him find his spirituality. 'I’m more of a relaxed person after getting to know him and understanding his own journey.' While Dorje tries to never miss Monday Night Football, he’s always there to help with any event hosted by the local Tibetan community, one of the largest in the United States. 'He has one foot in the normal high school life. And he has one foot in this amazing Tibetan culture that we have in the state of Minnesota,' said Kate Thomas, one of his tutors and the teachings coordinator at Minneapolis’ Bodhicitta Sangha Heart of Enlightenment Institute. 'You can see that he’s comfortable playing a role of sitting on a throne, of participating and being honored as a respected person in his community, as a religious figure. And yet, as soon as he has the opportunity, he wants to go and hang out with his high school buddies,' she said. 'That’s testimony to his flexibility, his openness of mind.' Listening to rap and making Tibetans proud For years, he has followed the same routine. He wakes up to recite sacred texts and then attends school, followed by football practice. He returns home for tutoring about Tibetan history and Buddhism. Then he might practice calligraphy or run on a treadmill while listening to BossMan Dlow, Rod Wave and other rappers. Although he was officially enthroned in 2019 in India, an estimated 1,000 people gathered at the Tibetan American Foundation of Minnesota for his recent ceremony. 'He unites us – Jalue is always here for us,' said Zenden Ugen, 21, a family friend and neighbor who performed Tibetan dances at the event. 'I wish him the best in life because being born and not being able to choose your life must be very hard,' Ugen said. 'But he has a responsibility and him being able to take on that responsibility, I’m very inspired by him. I just hope he keeps being who he is.' Dorje's proud uncle, Tashi Lama, saw him grow up and become a Buddhist master. 'He’s somebody who’s going to be a leader, who’s going to teach compassion and peace and love and harmony among living beings,' he said about his nephew, often referred to as 'Rinpoche' -- a Tibetan word that means 'precious one.' __ Associated Press video journalist Jessie Wardarski contributed to this report. __ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Protesters in Georgia's capital set up a tent camp and demand new elections, wary of Russia	TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — Demonstrators in Georgia's capital have set up tents on a central thoroughfare and vowed Monday to stay around the clock to demand new parliamentary elections in the country. The Oct. 26 election kept the governing Georgian Dream party in power, but opponents say the vote was rigged with Russia's assistance. Many Georgians viewed the election as a referendum on the country’s effort to join the European Union. Several large protests have been held since then. President Salome Zourabichvili, who has rejected the official results, declared on Monday that she would appeal the vote results to the Constitutional Court. Zourabichvili, who holds a mostly ceremonial position, has said Georgia has fallen victim to pressure from Moscow against joining the EU. Critics have accused Georgian Dream, established by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia, of becoming increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow. The party recently pushed through laws similar to those used by the Kremlin to crack down on freedom of speech and LGBTQ+ rights. On Sunday, demonstrators closed an avenue leading into the center of Tbilisi. Nika Melia, leader of Coalition for Change, one of the opposition groups, voiced hope that the protests around the clock will mark 'the beginning of the intense, strong protest movement that will finish with the fall of Ivanishvili’s regime.' The EU suspended Georgia’s membership application process indefinitely in June after the country’s parliament passed a law requiring organizations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as 'pursuing the interest of a foreign power,' similar to a Russian law used to discredit organizations critical of the government. The Central Election Commission said Georgian Dream won about 54% of the vote in October. Its leaders have rejected opposition claims of vote fraud. European election observers said the election took place in a 'divisive' atmosphere marked by instances of bribery, double voting and physical violence.	https://apnews.com/article/georgia-protest-lgbtq-election-russia-cc8169abe7d03205e8cf2c032891b6a9	2024-11-18T02:41:33-08:00	
Senegal's governing party poised for parliamentary majority in boost for reform agenda	DAKAR, Senegal (AP) — Senegal's governing party is poised to win a parliamentary majority as main opposition leaders conceded defeat Monday in an election determining whether newly elected President Bassirou Diomaye Faye can carry out ambitious reforms he promised during his campaign. PASTEF is projected to win around 131 out of the 165 seats in the National Assembly, according to local media and citizen vote counting platforms, giving Faye’s party an absolute majority. The official results and number of seats won by each party will be announced later this week. Former President Macky Sall, leader of the main opposition Takku Wallu coalition, congratulated PASTEF in a post on X. Two other major opposition leaders had already conceded defeat hours after the polls closed on Sunday. PASTEF only held 56 seats in the National Assembly before Sunday’s legislative election, while Sall's coalition had a slim majority of 83 seats. Faye, who was elected in March on an anti-establishment platform, said the lack of a majority had prevented him from executing reforms he pledged during his presidential campaign, including fighting corruption, reviewing fishing permits for foreign companies and securing a bigger share from the country’s natural resources for the population. In September, he dissolved the opposition-led parliament, paving the way for an early legislative election. Voting in the West African nation known for its stability was calm and peaceful despite an electoral campaign that was marked by sporadic clashes between rival supporters. Faye, 44, became Africa’s youngest elected leader in March, less than two weeks after he was released from prison. The former tax inspector's rise has reflected widespread frustration among Senegal’s youth with the country’s direction — a common sentiment across Africa, which has the world’s youngest population and a number of leaders accused of clinging to power for decades. More than 60% of Senegalese are under age 25, and 90% work in informal jobs. Senegal has been hit by skyrocketing inflation in recent years, making life difficult for much of the population. The country is also a major source of irregular migration to Europe, with thousands leaving every year on rickety, artisanal fishing boats in search of economic opportunities.	https://apnews.com/article/senegal-legislative-election-president-reforms-edaa944a674a9dc5dff57e88a2b2029a	2024-11-18T02:20:46-08:00	
Uniqlo's chief says fast fashion must change with the times	TOKYO (AP) — Forty years after its founding, Japanese clothing retailer Uniqlo has more than 2,500 stores worldwide. Sales at its parent company, Fast Retailing Co., recently topped 3 trillion yen ($20 billion) annually for the first time. The name Uniqlo comes from joining the words for 'unique' and 'clothing.' The chain’s basic concept is 'LifeWear,' or everyday clothing. Uniqlo parent Fast Retailing Co. Chief Executive Tadashi Yanai, ranked by Forbes as Japan’s richest man and estimated to be worth $48 billion, spoke recently to The Associated Press at the company’s Tokyo headquarters. The interview has been edited for length and clarity. Q: What were the biggest challenges over the past 40 years? A: Actually 40 years, upon reflection, went by so fast they feel more like three years. You know what they say in Japan: Time flies like an arrow. I started a regional business, then expanded nationwide. When we became No. 2 or No. 3 in Japan’s casual wear, and being No. 1 was right within reach, we became a listed company in 1994. That was followed by our fleece boom, which doubled our revenue in one year to 400 billion yen ($2.6 billion). I’d been thinking about going global when our revenue reached 300 billion yen ($2 billion) so we opened 50 stores in Great Britain, hoping to be a winner there just like we had conquered Japan. Instead, we got totally knocked out. We opened 21 outlets in a year and a half, but had to close 16 of them, leaving just five. We didn’t succeed as we had hoped. This is not an easy job. It’s very tough. But these days, our sales are strongest in London, and also Paris. We made progress gradually. Q: What are some of the sustainability and other key issues you have faced over the years? A: We make clothes that last a long time. Not just clothes that last for one season. The cashmere sweater I’m wearing today is $99. But please don’t say 'cheap.' Please call it 'reasonable.' We sell quality products at reasonable prices. We’ve done various sustainability efforts, and we talk only about what we have really achieved. Sustainability is crucial to our operations. And we’ve done just about everything — recycling, employing the disabled, support for refugees. The prices may be cheaper at Wal-Mart, but our products offer real quality for the price. We take the greatest care and time, and involve a lot of people. Our rivals are more careless. Q: What is behind Uniqlo’s success and what resonated with global buyers? A: When we say Uniqlo is 'made for all,' one might imagine products for the masses, like what’s at a Wal-Mart or a Target. But what we mean is a high-quality product that appeals to all people, including the extremely rich, not only those with sophisticated taste and intelligence, but also people who don’t know that much about clothes, and the design is fine-tuned, the material fine quality, and sustainability concerns have been addressed. We were first a retailer, then a manufacturer-cum-retailer. Now we are a digital consumer retailer. That is why we are successful. If we had stayed the same, then we can’t hope to succeed. Being a digital consumer retail company means we utilize information at a high level to shape the way we do our work. We gain information about our customers, the workers at the store, the market, all that information. Changing daily is the only way we can hope for stable growth. The world is changing every day. Q: Are you confident you can keep it up another 40 years? A: Of course. We’ve been preparing to reach 3 trillion yen ($20 billion) revenue all these years. And we are finally starting to be known. But we still have a long way to go. We are just getting started, and we are going to keep growing. There is more potential for growth in Europe and the U.S., as well as China and India, given the 1.4 billion population in each country.

Tanzanian government says rescue efforts will continue at collapsed building where 13 died	DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) — Rescue efforts at a building that collapsed, killing at least 13 people, in Tanzania’s commercial capital entered a third day Monday with the government saying they will continue until all those trapped inside are saved. The number of people trapped was unclear, but several people have told local media that they have lost contact with relatives who they believe were inside the building. More than 80 people have been rescued from the four-story building, which housed dozens of shops and collapsed Saturday morning. Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu said on Sunday that more than 20 people were receiving medical treatment and the government would cover the costs. She ordered an audit of all buildings in Dar Es Salaam's Kariakoo area, which is popular among traders, and asked police to obtain the ownership and construction permits for the collapsed building. Some of those who died were being buried on Monday. It is currently the rainy season, when building collapses are common in the east African country. Buildings that collapse are often found to have violated construction regulations.	https://apnews.com/article/tanzania-building-collapse-rescue-8c0813965bc06cfb6b27b7ff69bb5265	2024-11-18T01:25:48-08:00	
A Russian ballistic missile with cluster munitions kills 11 people and injures 84 in Ukraine's north	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A Russian ballistic missile with cluster munitions struck a residential area of a northern Ukraine city, killing 11 people including two children and injuring 84 others, officials said Monday. The two children killed in the strike on Sumy late Sunday were a 9-year-old boy and a 14-year-old girl, the regional prosecutor’s office said. Six injured children are in critical condition, it said. The attack damaged 15 buildings, including two educational facilities, the prosecutor’s office said. A search and rescue operation continued Monday, on the eve of the war’s 1,000-day milestone. Sumy lies 40 kilometers (24 miles) from the Russian border. Also Sunday, U.S. President Joe Biden authorized for the first time the use of U.S.-supplied longer-range missiles by Ukraine to strike inside Russia, after extensive lobbying by Ukrainian officials. The weapons are likely to be used in response to North Korea’s decision to send thousands of troops to support Russia in the Kursk region where Ukraine mounted a military incursion over the summer. It is the second time the U.S. has permitted the use of Western weapons inside Russian territory within limits after permitting the use of HIMARS systems, a shorter-range weapon, to stem Russia’s advance in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region in May. The first reaction from Ukraine to the long-awaited decision from the U.S. was notably restrained. 'Today, much is being said in the media about us receiving permission for the relevant actions. But strikes are not made with words. Such things are not announced. The missiles will speak for themselves,' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address. Earlier, Zelenskyy said that Russia had launched a total of 120 missiles and 90 drones in a large-scale attack across Ukraine, including Sumy. Russia deployed various types of drones, he said, including Iranian-made Shaheds, as well as cruise, ballistic and aircraft-launched ballistic missiles. The attack, which targeted Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, came as fears are mounting about Moscow’s intentions to devastate Ukraine’s power generation capacity ahead of the winter. Ukrainian defenses shot down 144 out of a total of 210 air targets, Ukraine’s air force reported. 'The enemy’s target was our energy infrastructure throughout Ukraine. Unfortunately, there is damage to objects from hits and falling debris. In Mykolaiv, as a result of a drone attack, two people were killed and six others were injured, including two children,' Zelenskyy said. Two more people were killed in the Odesa region, where the attack damaged energy infrastructure and disrupted power and water supplies, said local Gov. Oleh Kiper. Both victims were employees of Ukraine’s state-owned power grid operator, Ukrenergo, the company said hours later. The combined drone and missile attack was the most powerful in three months, according to the head of Kyiv’s City Military Administration, Serhii Popko. One person was injured after the roof of a five-story residential building caught fire in Kyiv’s historic center, according to Popko. A thermal power plant operated by private energy company DTEK was 'seriously damaged,' the company said. Russian strikes have hammered Ukraine’s power infrastructure since Moscow’s all-out invasion of its neighbor in February 2022, prompting repeated emergency power shutdowns and nationwide rolling blackouts. Ukrainian officials have routinely urged Western allies to bolster the country’s air defenses to counter assaults and allow for repairs. Russia’s Defense Ministry on Sunday acknowledged carrying out a 'mass' missile and drone attack on 'critical energy infrastructure' in Ukraine, but claimed all targeted facilities were tied to Kyiv’s military industry. Although Ukraine’s nuclear plants were not directly impacted, several electrical substations on which they depend suffered further damage, the U.N.’s nuclear energy watchdog said in a statement Sunday. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, only two of Ukraine’s nine operational reactors continue to generate power at full capacity. The Russian military said Monday it intercepted and destroyed 59 Ukrainian drones overnight over several Russian regions. Two were downed over the Moscow region that surrounds the Russian capital, and three others over the neighboring Tula region. A total of 54 drones were destroyed over the Bryansk, Kursk and Belgorod regions on the border with Ukraine, according to a statement by the Russian Defense Ministry. Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said the drones shot down outside of Moscow were heading toward the capital. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-missile-attack-sumy-5cd4f9fe2cee1ae8aed67d63c22b0703	2024-11-18T00:39:19-08:00	
New Zealand's founding treaty is at a flashpoint. Why are thousands protesting for Māori rights?	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — A proposed law that would redefine New Zealand’s founding treaty between the British Crown and Māori chiefs has triggered political turmoil and a march by thousands of people the length of the country to Parliament to protest it. The bill is never expected to become law. But it has become a flashpoint on race relations and a critical moment in the fraught 180-year-old conversation about how New Zealand should honor its promises to Indigenous people when the country was colonized -– and what those promises are. Tens of thousands are expected to throng the capital, Wellington, for the final stretch of the weeklong protest march on Tuesday. It follows a Māori tradition of hīkoi, or walking, to bring attention to breaches of the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi. Why is a 180-year-old treaty being debated? Considered New Zealand’s founding document, the treaty was signed between representatives of the British Crown and 500 Māori chiefs during colonization. It laid out principles guiding the relationship between the Crown and Māori, in two versions -– one in English and the other in Māori. It promised Māori the rights and privileges of British citizens, but the English and Māori versions differed on what power the chiefs were ceding over their affairs, lands and autonomy. Over decades, the Crown breached both versions. By the mid-20th century, Māori language and culture had dwindled -– Indigenous people were often barred from practicing it -- tribal land was confiscated and Māori were disadvantaged in many metrics. How were treaty rights revived? Prompted by a surging Māori protest movement, for the past 50 years the courts of New Zealand, lawmakers and the Waitangi Tribunal -– a permanent body set up to adjudicate treaty matters -– have navigated the differences in the treaty’s versions and tried to redress breaches by constructing the meaning of the treaty's principles in their decisions. Those principles are intended to be flexible but are commonly described as partnership with the Crown, protection of Māori interests and participation in decision-making. While Māori remain disenfranchised in many ways, the weaving of treaty recognition through law and attempts at redress have changed the fabric of society since then. Māori language has experienced a renaissance, and everyday words are now commonplace -– even among non-Māori. Policies have been enacted to target disparities Māori commonly face. Billions of dollars in settlements have been negotiated between the Crown and tribes for breaches of the treaty, particularly the widespread expropriation of Māori land and natural resources. Why is there fresh debate? Some New Zealanders, however, are unhappy with redress. They have found a champion in lawmaker David Seymour, the leader of a minor libertarian political party which won less than 9% of the vote in last year’s election -– but scored outsized influence for its agenda as part of a governing agreement. Seymour‘s proposed law would set specific definitions of the treaty’s principles, and would apply them to all New Zealanders, not only to Māori. He says piecemeal construction of the treaty’s meaning has left a vacuum and has given Māori special treatment. His bill is widely opposed — by left- and right-wing former prime ministers, 40 of the country’s most senior lawyers, and thousands of Māori and non-Māori New Zealanders who are walking the length of the country in protest. Seymour’s bill is not expected to pass its final reading. It cleared a first vote on Thursday due to a political deal, but most of those who endorsed it are not expected to do so again. Detractors say the bill threatens constitutional upheaval and would remove rights promised in the treaty that are now enshrined in law. Critics have also lambasted Seymour -– who is Māori -– for provoking backlash against Indigenous people. Why are protesters marching? Peaceful walking protests are a Māori tradition and have occurred before at crucial times during the national conversation about treaty rights. Police in the country of 5 million people say they expect 30,000 to march across Wellington to Parliament on Tuesday. Crowds of up to 10,000 people have joined the march in cities en route to Wellington. Many are marching to oppose Seymour’s bill. But others are protesting a range of policies from the center-right government on Māori affairs -– including an order, prompted by Seymour, that public agencies should no longer target policies to specifically redress Māori inequities.	https://apnews.com/article/treaty-waitangi-zealand-protest-principles-parliament-623dbb403ca78ad35cd96d9392e12778	2024-11-18T00:22:58-08:00	
Middle East latest: 2 young children and parents killed in an Israeli strike in Gaza, officials say	An Israeli strike hit a tent sheltering displaced people in the Gaza Strip, killing two children aged 7 and 9 and their parents, Palestinian officials said Monday. A third child, 10 years old, was wounded in the strike overnight in the southern city of Khan Younis, according to the Civil Defense, first responders who operate under the Hamas-run government. An Associated Press reporter saw the bodies at the nearby Nasser Hospital. The two children were beheaded by the blast and their remains were placed in one body bag. The Israeli military blames civilian deaths on Hamas, accusing militants of hiding among civilians and fighting from residential areas. It rarely comments on individual strikes, which often kill women and children. The war began when Hamas stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed over 43,800 Palestinians, according to local health authorities. They do not distinguish between militants and civilians but say most of those killed are women and children. The fighting has left some 76 people dead in Israel, including 31 soldiers. ___ Here's the Latest: 2 young children and their parents killed in an Israeli strike in Gaza, officials say KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip — An Israeli strike hit a tent sheltering displaced people in the Gaza Strip, killing two children aged 7 and 9 and their parents, Palestinian officials said.

US and Philippines sign a pact to secure shared military intelligence and weapons technology	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The United States and the Philippines signed an agreement on Monday to secure the exchange of highly confidential military intelligence and technology in key weapons the U.S. would provide to Manila. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and his Philippine counterpart, Gilberto Teodoro, signed the legally binding General Security of Military Information Agreement in Manila at a time when the longtime treaty allies have boosted their defense and military engagements, including large-scale joint combat drills, largely in response to China’s increasingly aggressive actions in Asia. The outgoing Biden administration has taken steps to strengthen an arc of military alliances across the Indo-Pacific region to better counter China, including in any future confrontation over Taiwan or in the disputed South China Sea, which Beijing has claimed almost in its entirety. That has dovetailed with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s thrust to strengthen his country’s external defenses given an alarming escalation of territorial confrontations between Chinese and Filipinos forces in the South China Sea. The Department of National Defense in Manila said the agreement aims to ensure the security of classified military information that would be exchanged between the U.S. and the Philippines. It will 'allow the Philippines access to higher capabilities and big-ticket items from the United States,' the Philippine defense department said. Neither side provided more details or released a copy of the agreement. Two Philippine security officials, however, have told The Associated Press that such an agreement, similar to ones Washington has signed with other allied countries, would allow the U.S. to provide the Philippines with higher-level intelligence and more sophisticated weapons, including missile systems. It would also provide the Philippine military access to U.S. satellite and drone surveillance systems with an assurance that such intelligence and details about sophisticated weapons would be kept highly secure to prevent possible leaks, the two Philippine officials said on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the sensitive issue publicly. Philippine efforts to obtain sophisticated weapons from the U.S. military in the past have been hampered by a lack of such an intelligence deal, including when Filipino forces were scrambling to fight a 2017 siege by Filipino and foreign militants aligned with the Islamic State group in southern Marawi city. Philippine forces, backed by U.S. and Australian spy planes, quelled the uprising after five months. Austin and Teodoro also attended a groundbreaking ceremony for a center where the U.S. and Philippine militaries would coordinate future joint operations, including the exchange of information. Austin said the center 'will be a place where our forces can work side-by-side to respond to regional challenges.' Austin renewed the U.S. commitment to the Philippines as an ally and told Teodoro that 'we are more than allies. We are family.' The coordinating center, Teodoro said, would provide 'a unified picture of the shared areas of responsibility and common approaches to threats against both our securities.' 'I’m sure it will benefit future generations of both our peoples to come because although we may change people, the values don’t change,' Teodoro said. The Philippine defense chief reiterated the crucial need for the U.S. security presence in the region, citing Marcos’s repeated statements that such a presence 'is essential for maintaining peace and stability in this region.' ___ Associated Press journalist Aaron Favila contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/philippines-us-general-security-of-military-information-agreement-4622f461bde4599a08be8c51d5f4db09	2024-11-17T23:38:51-08:00	
Climate talks in Azerbaijan head into their second week, coinciding with G20 in Rio	BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) — United Nations talks on getting money to curb and adapt to climate change resumed Monday with tempered hope that negotiators and ministers can work through disagreements and hammer out a deal after slow progress last week. That hope comes from the arrival of the climate and environment ministers from around the world this week in Baku, Azerbaijan, for the COP29 talks. They’ll give their teams instructions on ways forward. 'We are in a difficult place,' said Melanie Robinson, economics and finance program director of global climate at the World Resources Institute. 'The discussion has not yet moved to the political level — when it does I think ministers will do what they can to make a deal.' Talks in Baku are focused on getting more climate cash for developing countries to transition away from fossil fuels, adapt to climate change and pay for damages caused by extreme weather. But countries are far apart on how much money that will require. Several experts put the sum needed at around $1 trillion. 'One trillion is going to look like a bargain five, 10 years from now,' said Rachel Cleetus from the Union of Concerned Scientists, citing a multitude of costly recent extreme weather events from flooding in Spain to hurricanes Helene and Milton in the United States. 'We’re going to wonder why we didn’t take that and run with it.' Also on Monday, the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has been mulling a proposal to cut public spending for foreign fossil fuel projects. The OECD — made up of 38 member countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Japan and Germany — are discussing a deal that could prevent up to $40 billion worth of carbon-polluting projects. At COP29, activists are protesting the U.S., South Korea, Japan, and Turkey who they say are the key holdouts preventing the agreement in Paris from being finalized. 'It’s of critical importance that President Biden comes out in support. We know it’s really important that he lands a deal that Trump cannot undo. This can be really important for Biden’s legacy,' said Lauri van der Burg, Global Public Finance Lead at Oil Change international. 'If he comes around, this will help mount pressure on other laggards including Korea, Turkey and Japan.' Meanwhile, the world’s biggest decision makers are halfway around the world as another major summit convenes. Brazil is hosting the Group of 20 summit, which runs Nov. 18-19, bringing together many of the world's largest economies. Climate change — among other major topics like rising global tensions and poverty — will be on the agenda. Harjeet Singh, global engagement director for the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative, said G20 nations 'cannot turn their backs on the reality of their historical emissions and the responsibility that comes with it.' 'They must commit to trillions in public finance,' he said. In a written statement on Friday, United Nations Climate Change's executive secretary Simon Stiell said 'the global climate crisis should be order of business Number One' at the G20 meetings. Stiell noted that progress on stopping more warming should happen both in and out of climate talks, calling the G20's role 'mission-critical.' ___ Associated Press journalist Ahmed Hatem in Baku contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Young people, whose futures are at stake in UN climate talks, push through anger to fight for hope	BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) — Young people who attend the United Nations climate talks have a lot to be angry about. They've lost loved ones and months of school. They've lost homes and family farms and connections to their families' native lands. They haven't lost hope, though. Not yet. 'It has become so tiring for me to be just a poster child,' said Marinel Ubaldo, who by age 16 had watched two back-to-back supersized typhoons destroy entire communities in her native Philippines. Missing a chunk of high school in the aftermath, because there was no school to go back to, was a wake-up call. Now 27, COP29 will be her sixth time attending the summit where leaders negotiate the future she will inherit. 'I guess I'm very pessimistic, but I’m going to be positive that this COP could actually bring more clarity,' she said. Her pessimism isn't unwarranted. Fewer leaders were in attendance this year, with a backdrop of uncertainty as political will on climate unravels in major countries like the U.S. and Germany. While many passionate youth want to protest, this will be the third straight COP in an authoritarian country with tighter controls on protests and speech. And for many of the young people hardest hit by climate extremes, it's simply difficult and expensive to get to the conference. 'We have this constant challenge of having sometimes the youth forums with spaces at the margins of the decision maker spaces,' said Felipe Paullier, assistant secretary general for youth affairs in the United Nations youth office. That's why the U.N. has been working to institutionalize the role of youth in the climate talks, he said. And climate change has a disproportionate impact on children around the world. Their growing bodies have a harder time handling extreme heat, which also causes an uptick in premature births and childhood malnutrition, said UNICEF assistant secretary-general Kitty van der Heijden. 'We are simply not doing good enough for children in this world. We are failing children,' she said. All of that means young people are feeling the burden of speaking up about climate change more than ever. And many of those who come to COP, and even some of the ones who don't, said they feel tired — weighed down by the knowledge that year after year, they show up to speak and don't have a lot to show for it. This was the third year in a row that Earth's projected warming hasn't improved. 'I think for a lot of young people from extremely climate vulnerable nations, it actually it doesn’t feel like much of a choice' to speak out about climate change, said 20-year-old Fathimath Raaia Shareef, from the Maldives. Shareef's grandmother migrated south to the small island nation's capital, so she has never had the opportunity to see what her family's home island was like. Growing up, after she found out about sea level rise, she had recurring nightmares about her island sinking. She would wake up crying. 'How am I supposed to focus on anything else when when my island, when my home country is at risk?' she asked. It's that focus that brings many young people to the table even as they question their faith in the possibility that international negotiations can achieve real change. Here at his fourth COP, 15-year-old Francisco Vera Manzanares of Colombia called the U.N. summit a necessary but 'very difficult space' to be in. He thinks slow pace of change from countries around the world creates a 'credibility crisis' in the institutions that are most needed to keep the goals that require global cooperation within reach. 'People listen to children. But, let's say, it’s different (to) listen than hear,' he said. That's why he hopes more adults will help children meaningfully advocate for themselves in a crisis where they have the most to lose — and the most to save. 'It's our rights. It's our future. It's our present,' he said. ___ Follow Melina Walling on X, formerly Twitter, @MelinaWalling. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Typhoon Man-yi leaves 7 dead in landslide in Philippines and worsens crisis from back-to-back storms	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Typhoon Man-yi left at least seven people dead in a landslide, destroyed scores of houses and displaced large numbers of villagers before blowing away from the northern Philippines, worsening the crisis wreaked by multiple back-to-back storms, officials said Monday. Man-yi was one of the strongest of the six major storms to hit the northern Philippines in less than a month and had sustained winds of up to 195 kilometers (125 miles) per hour when it slammed into the eastern island province of Catanduanes on Saturday night. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. In Manila and offered his prayers, announcing an additional $1 million in humanitarian aid for typhoon victims. He told Marcos he has authorized U.S. troops to help Filipino forces provide lifesaving aid. Torrential rains and fierce wind unleashed by Man-yi set off a landslide early Monday in the northern town of Ambaguio in Nueva Vizcaya province that buried a house and killed seven people, including children, and injured three others inside, regional police chief Brig. Gen. Antonio P. Marallag Jr. said. Army troops, police and villagers were scrambling to search for three other people who were believed to have been entombed in the avalanche of mud, boulders and uprooted trees, Marallag said. Disaster response officials said they were checking if the deaths of two villagers in a motorcycle accident and an electrocution were directly related to Man-yi’s onslaught so they could be added to the overall death toll. They said a separate search was underway for a couple and their child after their shanty was swept away in rampaging rivers in northern Nueva Ecija province. More than a million people were affected by the typhoon and two previous storms, including nearly 700,000 who fled their homes and moved to emergency shelters or relatives' homes, according to the Official of Civil Defense. Nearly 8,000 houses were damaged or destroyed and more than 100 cities and towns were hit by power outages due to toppled electric posts, it said. In the worst-hit province of Camarines, officials pleaded for additional help after fierce winds and rain damaged more houses and cut off electricity and water supplies in the entire province, along with cellphone connections in many areas, provincial information officer Camille Gianan said. Welfare officials transported food aid, drinking water and other help but more is needed over the coming months, Gianan said. Many villagers will need construction materials to rebuild their houses, she said. 'They have not recovered from the previous storms when the super typhoon hit,' Gianan told The Associated Press. 'It’s been one calamity after another.' The rare number of back-to-back storms and typhoons that lashed Luzon — the country's largest and most populous island — in just three weeks left more than 160 people dead, affected 9 million people and caused such extensive damage to communities, infrastructure and farmlands that the Philippines may have to import more rice, a staple food. In an emergency meeting as Man-yi approached, Marcos asked his Cabinet and provincial officials to brace for 'the worst-case scenario.' At least 26 domestic airports and two international airports were briefly shut and inter-island ferry and cargo services were suspended due to rough seas, stranding thousands of passengers and commuters. Most transport services have now resumed, according to the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippine and the coast guard. The U.S., Manila’s treaty ally, along with Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei provided cargo aircraft and other storm aid to help the government’s overwhelmed disaster-response agencies. Last month, the first major storm, Trami, left scores of people dead after dumping one to two months’ worth of rain in just 24 hours in several towns. The Philippines is battered by about 20 typhoons and storms each year. It’s often hit by earthquakes and has more than a dozen active volcanoes, making it one of the world’s most disaster-prone countries.	https://apnews.com/article/philippines-typhoon-manyi-04db73a5ee97fed4fbf12c342c4e7bb8	2024-11-17T20:48:47-08:00	
New Delhi closes schools, bans construction as air pollution shoots up to worst level this season	NEW DELHI (AP) — Authorities in India’s capital shut schools, halted construction and banned non-essential trucks from entering the city on Monday after air pollution shot up to its worst level this season. Residents of New Delhi woke up to thick, toxic smog enveloping the city of some 33 million as the air quality became increasingly hazardous. It rose further into the severe category, according to SAFAR, the country’s main environmental agency, which measures tiny particulate matter in the air that can enter deep into the lungs. The deadly haze covered monuments and high-rise buildings in the capital, with visibility so low that airlines warned of delays. In several areas of the city, pollution levels were more than 50 times higher than the World Health Organization’s recommended safe limit. Forecasts say the poor air quality will continue into the week. Air pollution in northern India rises every year, particularly in winter, as farmers burn crop residue in agricultural areas. The burning coincides with colder temperatures, which trap the smoke in the air. The smoke is then blown into cities, where auto emissions add to the pollution. Emissions from industries and the burning of coal to produce electricity are also linked to the pollution, which has been steadily ticking up in recent weeks. Starting Monday, authorities began enforcing stage 4 of a graded response action plan, or GRAP 4, based on the severity of the air pollution. Earlier stages of the plan were already in place, and stage 4 includes stricter curbs. Classes for all grades except 10 and 12 will be held online and no trucks will be allowed to enter the city except for those carrying essential items. Some older, diesel guzzling vehicles have been banned inside the city, and all construction activities have been halted. Authorities also urged children, the elderly and others with chronic diseases or respiratory issues to avoid going outside as much as possible. Over the weekend, farmers in neighboring Uttar Pradesh state burned their fields, releasing plumes of gray smoke that winds likely carried into New Delhi and other nearby areas. Despite the poisonous air, many in the capital continued their usual routines, including morning walks in the city’s beloved Lodhi Garden. 'Everyone has a sore throat,' said Sanjay Goel, a 51-year-old shopkeeper in New Delhi. 'They should ban crop residue burning ... it's just smoke everywhere.' The worsening air quality in the capital also sparked outrage from residents on social media. Many complained of headaches and hacking coughs, describing the city as 'apocalyptic' and a 'gas chamber.' Others urged officials to solve the public health crisis once and for all. Several studies have estimated more than a million Indians die each year from pollution-related diseases. Authorities have invoked similar measures in the past and have at times deployed water sprinklers and anti-smog guns in an attempt to control the haze. But critics say there needs to be a long-term solution that drastically reduces pollution itself, instead of actions that aim to mitigate the effects after it has already plagued the region.	https://apnews.com/article/new-delhi-air-pollution-india-ae1ec1e6292009db198f18b113047cd5	2024-11-17T20:32:16-08:00	
As China cracks down on bookstores at home, Chinese-language booksellers are flourishing overseas	WASHINGTON (AP) — Yu Miao smiles as he stands among the 10,000 books crowded on rows of bamboo shelves in his newly reopened bookstore. It’s in Washington’s vibrant Dupont Circle neighborhood, far from its last location in Shanghai, where the Chinese government forced him out of business six years ago. 'There is no pressure from the authorities here,' said Yu, the owner of JF Books, Washington’s only Chinese bookseller. 'I want to live without fear.' Independent bookstores have become a new battleground in China, swept up in the ruling Communist Party’s crackdown on dissent and free expression. The Associated Press found that at least a dozen bookstores in the world’s second-largest economy have been shuttered or targeted for closure in the last few months alone, squeezing the already tight space for press freedom. One bookstore owner was arrested over four months ago. The crackdown has had a chilling effect on China’s publishing industry. Bookstores are common in China, but many are state-owned. Independent bookstores are governed by an intricate set of rules with strict controls now being more aggressively policed, according to bookstore owners. Printing shops and street vendors are also facing more rigorous government inspections by the National Office Against Pornography and Illegal Publication. The office did not respond to interview requests from The Associated Press. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in a statement to AP, said it was not aware of a crackdown on bookstores. Yu isn't alone in taking his business out of the country. Chinese bookstores have popped up in Japan, France, Netherlands and elsewhere in the U.S. in recent years, as a result of both stricter controls in China and growing Chinese communities abroad. It’s not just the books' contents that are making Chinese authorities wary. In many communities, bookstores are cultural centers where critical thinking is encouraged, and conversations can veer into politics and other topics not welcomed by the authorities. The bookstore owner who was arrested was Yuan Di, also called Yanyou, the founder of Jiazazhi, an artistic bookstore in Shanghai and Ningbo on China’s eastern coast. He was taken away by police in June, according to Zhou Youlieguo, who closed his own bookstore in Shanghai in September. Yuan's arrest was also confirmed by two other people who declined to be named for fear of retribution. The charge against Yuan is unclear. An official in Ningbo's Bureau of Culture, Radio Television and Tourism, which oversees bookstores, declined comment, noting the case is under investigation. The Ningbo police didn’t respond to an interview request. Michael Berry, director of UCLA's Center for Chinese Studies, said a sluggish Chinese economy may be driving the government to exert greater control. 'The government might be feeling that this is a time to be more cautious and control this kind of discourse in terms of what people are consuming and reading to try to put a damper on any potential unrest and kind of nip it in the bud,' Berry said. These bookstore owners face dual pressures, Berry added. One is the political clampdown; the other is the global movement, especially among young people, toward digital media and away from print publications. Wang Yingxing sold secondhand books in Ningbo for almost two decades before being ordered to close in August. Local officials informed Wang he lacked a publication business license even though he wasn’t eligible to obtain one as a second-hand seller. Faded outlines marked the spot where a sign for Fatty Wang’s Bookstore once hung. Spray-painted black letters on the bookstore’s window read: 'Temporarily closed'. 'We’re promoting culture, I’m not doing anything wrong, right? I’m just selling some books and promoting culture,' Wang said, tying a bundle of books together with brown wrapper and white nylon string. 'Then why won’t you leave me alone?' Wang added. Half a dozen other people heaved boxes of books into the back of a van. The books, Wang said, were being sold to cafe and bar owners who wanted to burnish little libraries for their patrons. Some would be sent to a warehouse in Anhui. The rest, he said, were to be sent to a recycling station to be pulped and destroyed. Bookstores are not the only target. Central authorities have also cracked down on other places such as printing shops, internet bars, gaming rooms and street vendors. Strict inspections have taken place all over the country, according to Chinese authorities. Authorities in Shanghai inspected printing places and bookstores, looking for 'printing, copying or selling illegal publications,' according to a government document. This shows the authorities are not just barring the sale of some publications, but tracing them back to the printing process. They found some printing stores did not 'register the copy content as required' and demanded they fix the problem quickly. In Shaoyang, a city in China’s south, authorities said they will be 'cracking down on harmful publications in accordance with the law.' The Communist Party has various powers to control which books are available. Any publication without a China Standard Book Number is considered illegal, including self-published books and those imported without special licenses. Books can be banned even after they are published if restrictions are later tightened — often for unclear reasons — or if the writers say something upsetting to the Chinese authorities. Yet despite these restrictions and the crackdown on existing booksellers, more bookstores are opening. Recent figures are unavailable, but a survey by Bookdao, a media company that focuses on the book industry, shows more than twice as many bookstores opened than closed in China in 2020. Liu Suli, who has been running All Sages Books in Beijing for over three decades, says there are many idealists in the industry. 'Everyone who reads has a dream of having a bookstore,' Liu says, despite the challenges. In many cases, those dreams are being fulfilled outside China. Yu and other Chinese booksellers around the world stock their shelves with books from Hong Kong, Taiwan and mainland China, as well as books published locally. Zhang Jieping, founder of Nowhere, a bookstore in Taiwan and Thailand, said there's a growing demand for books from migrants who left China after the COVID-19 pandemic. 'They don’t just want to speak fluent English or Japanese to fit in, they want cultural autonomy,' Zhang said. 'They want more community spaces. Not necessarily a bookstore, but in any format — a gallery, or a restaurant.' Li Yijia is a 22-year-old student who arrived in Washington from Beijing in August. One Sunday morning, she wandered through JF Books where she found titles in Chinese and English. She said a Chinese bookstore feels like 'another world in a bubble' which helps her critical thinking by allowing her to read books in both languages. 'It also relieves homesickness, like a Chinese restaurant,' Li added. The closure of the bookstores leads the owners to different paths. Some ended up in jail, some went looking for jobs to feed their families. Some started a journey to leave censorship behind. Since he closed his Shanghai bookstore, Zhou, 39, has moved to Los Angeles, but hasn't decided what his next step will be. He said his fully licensed independent bookstore, which sold art books and self-published works by artists and translators, was fined thousands of dollars and he was interrogated over a dozen times during the past four years. He's seen colleagues jailed for selling 'illegal publications.' All the self-published book artists and editors he worked with asked him to take down their work after warnings by local authorities. Zhou said he could not handle further harassment He said it was as if he were 'smuggling drugs instead of selling books.' The existence of his bookstore, Zhou said, was 'a rebellion and a resistance,' which is not there anymore. ___ Associated Press writer Dake Kang in Ningbo, China, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/china-bookstores-crackdown-shanghai-ba54f48c08c2ed4352534e2183a07ad1	2024-11-17T20:09:11-08:00	
Stock market today: Asian shares are mixed after Wall Street suffers worst loss since Election Day	BANGKOK (AP) — Shares started out the week mixed in Asia after U.S. stocks fell to their worst loss since Election Day. U.S. futures were higher, with the S&amp;P 500 contract up 0.3% and that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.1% as speculation mounted over who President-elect Donald Trump might nominate to be his Treasury secretary. Japan's Nikkei 225 index dropped 1.1% to 38,220.85 as the yen initially regained some strength against the U.S. dollar after the central bank governor, Kazuo Ueda, indicated that the Bank of Japan will continue to raise interest rates as conditions permit. The dollar inched up to 154.58 Japanese yen from 154.54 yen late Friday. It had been trading above 156 yen last week. South Korea's Kospi jumped 2.2% to 2,469.07 after Samsung Electronics, the country's biggest company, announced a share buyback plan. Samsung's shares jumped 6%. Chinese markets were mixed. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong added 0.8% to 19,572.34, while the Shanghai Composite index shed early gains to close down 0.2% at 3,323.55. Elsewhere in Asia, Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 edged 0.2% higher, to 8,300.20. Taiwan's Taiex lost 0.9% and the SET in Bangkok picked up 0.8% as the government announced that Thailand's economy grew more than expected in the last quarter. On Friday, U.S. stocks tumbled Friday with the waning of the 'Trump bump' that Wall Street got from last week’s presidential election, along with a cut to interest rates by the Federal Reserve. The S&amp;P 500 dropped 1.3% to 5,870.62, for its worst day since before Election Day to close out a losing week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.7% to 43,444.99, and the Nasdaq composite sank 2.2% to 18,680.12. Vaccine manufacturers helped drag the market down after President-elect Donald Trump said he wants Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent anti-vaccine activist, to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Moderna tumbled 7.3%, and Pfizer fell 4.7% amid concerns about a possible hit to profits. Kennedy still needs confirmation from the Senate to get the job, and some analysts are skeptical about his chances. Biotech stocks broadly sank to some of the market’s worst losses, but the sharpest drop in the S&amp;P 500 came from Applied Materials. It fell 9.2% as it forecast a range of future revenue below analysts' expectations, even though it reported a stronger-than-anticipated profit for the latest quarter. Companies face pressure to deliver big growth since their stock prices have been rising so much faster than their earnings. That’s made the stock market look pricey by a range of measures. The S&amp;P 500 is still up 23% for the year and not far from its all-time high set on Monday, despite last week’s weakness. Stocks had been broadly roaring since Election Day, when Trump’s victory sent a jolt through financial markets worldwide. Investors immediately began sending up stocks of banks, smaller U.S. companies and cryptocurrencies as they laid bets on the winners coming out of Trump’s preference for higher tariffs, lower tax rates and lighter regulation. But investors are also taking into account some of the potential downsides from Trump’s return to the White House, including worries that his policies could spur bigger U.S. government deficits and faster inflation. That’s forced traders to rethink how much relief the Federal Reserve could give the economy next year through cuts to interest rates. The Fed earlier this month lowered its main interest rate for the second time this year, and past forecasts indicated Fed officials saw more cuts as likely through 2025. On Thursday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell suggested the U.S. central bank may be cautious about future decisions on interest rates. 'The economy is not sending any signals that we need to be in a hurry to lower rates,' Powell said, though he declined to discuss how Trump’s potential policies could alter things. A report Friday showed shoppers spent more at U.S. retailers last month than expected, suggesting consumer spending, the most influential force on the economy, remains solid. In other dealings early Monday, U.S. benchmark crude oil added 13 cents to $67.15 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude climbed 27 cents to $71.31 per barrel. The euro bought $1.0543, up from $1.0534 late Friday.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-trump-fed-samsung-b80ab78cee5382e0d17ea058f123ace7	2024-11-17T20:08:18-08:00	
Brazil hosts a G20 summit overshadowed by wars and Trump's return, aiming for a deal to fight hunger	RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — With Brazil preparing to host the Group of 20 summit, it appears unlikely the leading rich and developing nations will sign on to a meaningful declaration regarding geopolitics: The meeting Monday and Tuesday in Rio de Janeiro is overshadowed by two major wars and Donald Trump's recent election victory. Heightened global tensions and uncertainty about an incoming Trump administration have tempered any expectations for a strongly worded statement addressing the conflicts in the Middle East and between Russia and Ukraine. Experts instead anticipate a final document focused on social issues like the eradication of hunger — one of Brazil's priorities — even if it aims to include at least a mention of the ongoing wars. 'Brazilian diplomacy has been strongly engaged in this task, but to expect a substantively strong and consensual declaration in a year like 2024 with two serious international conflicts is to set the bar very high,' said Cristiane Lucena Carneiro, an international relations professor at the University of Sao Paulo. After Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silvathwarted far-right former President Jair Bolsonaro 's reelection bid in 2022, there was some excitement in the international community at the prospect of the leftist leader and savvy diplomat — who Barack Obama once called 'the most popular politician on Earth' — hosting the G20. Bolsonaro had little personal interest in international summits, let foreign policy be guided by ideology and clashed with several leaders, including France’s Emmanuel Macron. Lula took office and often quoted a catchphrase: 'Brazil is back.' Brazil under Lula has reverted to its decades-old principle of non-alignment to carve out a policy that best safeguards its interests in an increasingly multipolar world. That involves talking to all parties, which experts say gave Brazil a privileged position to host a summit such as the G20. But his administration's foreign policy has at times raised eyebrows. A Brazil-China peace plan for Russia and Ukraine doesn't call for Russia's withdrawal from Ukraine and has been slammed by Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy. And Lula sparked a diplomatic incident with Israel after comparing its actions in Gaza to the Holocaust. Donald Trump’s win in the U.S. presidential election earlier this month and the imminent return of an America First doctrine may also hamper the diplomatic spirit needed for broad agreement on divisive issues. 'If we have one certainty, it is regarding Donald Trump’s skepticism towards multilateralism,' Carneiro said. Two officials from Brazil and one from another G20 nation say Argentine negotiators are standing in the way of a joint declaration. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Two of them said Argentina’s negotiators have raised several objections to the draft. They most vehemently oppose a clause calling for a global tax on the super-rich — which they had previously accepted, in July — and another promoting gender equality. Ambassador Mauricio Lyrio, Brazil’s key negotiator at G20, told journalists on Nov. 8 that the leaders’ final declaration should address the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, but that diplomats were still discussing how to reach universally acceptable language. 'The main message, naturally, is that we need to achieve peace not only regarding these conflicts but all conflicts,' he said in the capital Brasilia, adding that Lula's launch of a global alliance against hunger and poverty on Monday is just as important as the final statement. 'The leaders’ declaration will be the crowning achievement. But, at the same time, as instructed by the president himself, we have a G20 focused on concrete actions, such as the launch of a Global Alliance Against Hunger, with a package of very concrete social programs and innovative mechanisms to meet the resources needed for implementing them.' Lula, a former trade unionist who hails from a humble background, made the fight against hunger a priority during his first two terms as president (2003-2010) both at home and abroad. The number of undernourished Brazilians fell by more than 80% in 10 years, according to a 2014 U.N. report. Lula's hunger alliance is the only one of Brazil’s primary aims for a G20 declaration that will be obtained, according to Thomas Traumann, a former government minister and a political consultant based in Rio. 'Brazil wanted a global deal to fight poverty, a project to finance green transition and some consensus over a global tax for the super rich. Only the first one has survived,' Traumann said. President Joe Biden will attend the summit after a stop in Lima for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum and then travel on to Manaus, a city in Brazil's Amazon rainforest. It will be the first time a sitting American president sets foot in the Amazon, and the trip’s objective is to highlight 'commitment to environmental protection and respect for local cultures,' according to a Nov. 12 statement from the U.S. Embassy in Brazil. White House officials insist that Biden’s visits to APEC and the G20 will be substantive, with talks on climate issues, global infrastructure, counternarcotic efforts and one-on-one meetings with global leaders, including Chinese President Xi Jinping. Those officials say Biden also will use the summits to press allies to keep up support for Ukraine as it tries to fend off Russia’s invasion and not lose sight of finding an end to the wars in Lebanon and Gaza. Any commitments Biden makes may be overturned by the next White House administration, according to Danielle Ayres, an international relations professor at the Federal University of Santa Catarina. 'It would mean Trump would have to be proactive and say the U.S. is not going to do something to which it signed up for internationally,' Ayres said. 'That has a cost. It generates insecurity, a bad perception on behalf of the international community towards Trump.' Trump’s election may also cause other countries to look toward China as a more reliable partner. Xi Jinping's inauguration of the Chancay megaport in Peru on Thursday was perhaps the clearest sign of Latin America’s reorientation. A notable absentee at the G20 will be Russia’s President Vladimir Putin, against whom the International Criminal Court has issued a warrant that obliges member states to arrest him, and Russia’s delegation will be led by Sergey Lavrov. Israel is not a G20 member. 'The latest G20 meetings were somewhat depleted and became just another moment for bilateral meetings of heads of government. As Putin is out, Lula managed Ukraine not to be a topic, just as much as Israel. But Trump’s election takes from Lula the chance of being the star on the stage,' Traumann said. ___ Associated Press writer Gabriela Sá Pessoa contributed from Sao Paulo.	https://apnews.com/article/brazil-g20-rio-de-janeiro-wars-trump-12f7a09b8f79229509de52c92c0a074c	2024-11-17T20:05:14-08:00	
45 pro-democracy activists face sentencing in Hong Kong. Here's who some of them are	HONG KONG (AP) — Dozens of prominent Hong Kong pro-democracy activists are scheduled to be sentenced Tuesday in the largest case under a national security law that critics say crushed political activism in the semi-autonomous Chinese city. The convictions of the 45 activists under the Beijing-imposed law are widely seen as part of a crackdown by China that destroyed hopes for a more democratic Hong Kong. They face sentences of up to life imprisonment. The activists were among 47 people charged with conspiracy to commit subversion in 2021 for their involvement in an unofficial primary election to pick opposition candidates. They were accused of agreeing to veto government-proposed budgets indiscriminately after securing a legislative majority to force a dissolution of the legislature and then the ouster of the city's leader. Three government-approved judges ruled that the plan to achieve political change through the unofficial primary in 2020 would have undermined the government’s authority and created a constitutional crisis. Thirty-one of the activists pleaded guilty and 14 others were found guilty in May following a trial. Two were acquitted. Those who entered guilty pleas have a better chance of shorter prison terms. Some of the convicted activists have sought lesser sentences by expressing remorse and apologizing. Others have remained defiant. Here are profiles of some of the leading activists. Benny Tai Riding on a wave of anti-government protests in 2019, Benny Tai, a former law professor at the University of Hong Kong, co-organized the primary election that drew 610,000 voters — over 13% of the city’s registered electorate. The primary was aimed at selecting pro-democracy candidates who would then run in the official election. The judges said Tai stated that acquiring a legislative majority was a 'constitutional weapon of mass destruction' that would allow the pro-democracy camp to veto government budgets. Under the city’s Basic Law, or mini-constitution, the city leader can dissolve the legislature if a budget cannot be passed. But the leader must step down if the budget is again blocked by the next legislature. The judges said Tai aimed to 'undermine, destroy or overthrow the existing political system and structure' of Hong Kong. Tai pleaded guilty to the charge. In seeking a shorter sentence, his lawyer said Tai always supported non-violence and believed his actions were legal. Tai was not always viewed as a threat by authorities. He was a member of a consultative committee that helped collect views on the drafting of the Basic Law before the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997. In 2001, the government awarded him a medal of honor for promoting civic education, though it was withdrawn in 2022. Tai is perhaps best known as a co-founder of the city’s 2014 Occupy Movement, during which demonstrators occupied streets and brought traffic to a standstill in some areas for nearly 80 days, demanding direct elections for the city’s leader. Joshua Wong Joshua Wong rose to fame in Hong Kong in 2012 as a high school student leading protests against the introduction of national education in the city’s schools. Two years later, he became world famous as a leader of the Occupy Movement. In 2016, Wong co-founded a political party named 'Demosisto' with fellow young activists Nathan Law and Agnes Chow. In the 2019 pro-democracy movement, Wong helped seek overseas support for the protests. His activism led Beijing to label him an advocate of Hong Kong's independence who 'begged for interference' by foreign forces. Demosisto disbanded when Beijing imposed the security law in 2020. Wong won in the primary election, but the government postponed the official election, citing public health risks during the COVID-19 pandemic. Wong has pleaded guilty and asked for a lesser sentence. His lawyer said he hoped 'he could part with his history and would be able to reform himself' after completing it. Wu Chi-wai Wu Chi-wai is the former chair of Hong Kong's biggest pro-democracy party, the Democratic Party, which some activists saw as too moderate. In 2006, the government awarded Wu a medal of honor for community service. Wu entered a guilty plea, with his lawyer saying he has been in public service for over 30 years and that he and his party did not seek indiscriminate vetoing of budgets. Three former government officials wrote letters seeking a reduced sentence for him. Wu's parents passed away during his detention and he could only briefly attend their funerals. Gordon Ng Gordon Ng, a dual citizen of Australia and Hong Kong, was initially named an organizer of the primary by prosecutors, an accusation Ng denied. He pleaded not guilty. The judges acknowledged in their verdict that Ng did not organize the plan and was not a candidate. However, they pointed to his campaign urging voters to support primary winners through social media posts and a front-page advertisement in the now-shuttered pro-democracy Apple Daily newspaper, founded by Jimmy Lai. In seeking a lesser sentence, Ng said his support for the primary was linked to his belief that it could address the differences within the pro-democracy camp, which had long been plagued by infighting. He said he never asked candidates to promise to veto budgets.	https://apnews.com/article/hong-kong-prodemocracy-activists-sentencing-f2c36e5da3e974f54595447050280eee	2024-11-17T18:51:16-08:00	
Suspected attack by Yemen's Houthi rebels targets ship in the Red Sea	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — A suspected attack by Yemen's Houthi rebels targeted a commercial ship late Sunday night traveling through the southern reaches of the Red Sea, though it caused no damage nor injuries, authorities said. The attack comes as the rebels continue their monthslong assault targeting shipping through a waterway that typically sees $1 trillion in goods pass through it a year over the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and Israel’s ground offensive in Lebanon. A ship's captain saw that 'a missile splashed in close proximity to the vessel' as it traveled near the Bab el-Mandeb Strait connecting the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden, the British military's United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center said in an alert. The attack happened some 30 miles (48 kilometers) west of Yemen port city of Mocha. 'The vessel and crew are safe and proceeding to its next port of call,' the UKMTO added. The Houthis did not immediately claim the attack. However, it can take the rebels hours or even days to acknowledge their assaults. The Houthis have targeted more than 90 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started in October 2023. They seized one vessel and sank two in the campaign, which also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have included Western military vessels as well. The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the U.K. to force an end to Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran. The Houthis have shot down multiple American MQ-9 Reaper drones as well. In the rebels' last attack on Nov. 11, two U.S. Navy warships targeted with multiple drones and missiles as they were traveling through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, but the attacks were not successful.	https://apnews.com/article/yemen-red-sea-attack-houthis-mideast-wars-8c86509962cbb3d41fa1ceb2e200c7b8	2024-11-17T16:43:04-08:00	
Poultry infected with bird flu found on commercial farm in England	Poultry on a commercial farm in England have been infected with the bird flu virus, the U.K. government said Sunday. The H5N1 virus was found in kept birds in St. Ives, a seaside town in Cornwall. All the poultry in the infected area will be humanely culled, according to the Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs. It was England's first confirmation of H5N1 in kept birds this season. The virus was also recently found in wild birds in the southwest of England and in continental Europe, the department said. The H5N1 bird flu has been spreading in the U.S. among wild birds, poultry, cows and other animals. Recently, health officials in Canada confirmed that a British Columbia teen had contracted bird flu and said the virus was related to a poultry outbreak in the province.	https://apnews.com/article/bird-flu-outbreak-farm-england-dce7600e0dba5de59b68bf379307ef9c	2024-11-17T14:17:40-08:00	
Gabon votes yes on new constitution a year after the military seized power	LIBREVILLE, Gabon (AP) — Voters in Gabon overwhelmingly approved a new constitution, authorities said Sunday, more than one year after mutinous soldiers overthrew the country’s longtime president and seized power in the oil-rich Central African nation. Over 91% of voters approved the new constitution in a referendum held on Saturday, Gabon's Interior Minister Hermann Immongault said in a statement read on state television. Turnout was an estimated 53.5%, he added. The final results will be announced by the Constitutional Court, the interior minister said. The draft constitution, which proposes sweeping changes that could prevent dynastic rule and transfer of power, needed more than 50% of the votes cast to be adopted. In 2023, soldiers toppled President Ali Bongo Ondimba and put him under house arrest, accusing him of irresponsible governance and massive embezzlement that risked leading the country into chaos. The junta released Ondimba a week later on humanitarian grounds, allowing him travel abroad for medical treatment. The soldiers proclaimed their Republican Guard chief, Gen. Brice Clotaire Oligui Nguema, as president of a transitional committee to lead the country. Oligui is a cousin of Bongo. Bongo had served two terms since coming to power in 2009 after the death of his father, who ruled the country for 41 years. His rule was marked by widespread discontent with his reign. A coup attempt in 2019 failed. The draft constitution imposes a seven-year term, renewable only once, instead of the current charter that allows for five-year terms renewable without limit. It also says family members cannot succeed a president and abolishes the position of prime minister. The former French colony is a member of OPEC but its oil wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few — and nearly 40% of Gabonese aged 15 to 24 were out of work in 2020, according to the World Bank. Its oil export revenue was $6 billion in 2022, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.	https://apnews.com/article/gabon-referendum-constitution-approved-ee9724fb660ca97efd82946a88c4545d	2024-11-17T13:57:19-08:00	
Biden authorizes Ukraine to use US-supplied longer range missiles for deeper strikes inside Russia	MANAUS, Brazil (AP) — President Joe Biden has authorized Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied missiles to strike deeper inside Russia, easing limitations on the longer range weapons as Russia deploys thousands of North Korean troops to reinforce its war, according to a U.S. official and three other people familiar with the matter. The decision allowing Kyiv to use the Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMs, for attacks farther inside Russia comes as President Vladimir Putin positions North Korean troops along Ukraine's northern border to try to reclaim hundreds of miles of territory seized by Ukrainian forces. Biden's move also follows the presidential election victory of Donald Trump, who has said he would bring about a swift end to the war and raised uncertainty about whether his administration would continue the United States' vital military support for Ukraine. The official and the others knowledgeable about the matter were not authorized to discuss the U.S. decision publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's reaction Sunday was notably restrained. 'Strikes are not made with words,' he said during his nightly video address. 'Such things are not announced. The missiles will speak for themselves.' Zelenskyy and many of his Western supporters have been pressing Biden for months to allow Ukraine to strike military targets deeper inside Russia with Western-supplied missiles, saying the U.S. ban had made it impossible for Ukraine to try to stop Russian attacks on its cities and electrical grids. Zelenskyy's statement came shortly after he posted a message of condolence on Telegram following a Russian attack on a nine-story building that killed at least eight people in the northern city of Sumy, 40 kilometers (24 miles) from the border with Russia. Russia also launched a massive drone and missile attack, described by officials as the largest in recent months, targeting energy infrastructure and killing civilians. The attack came as fears are mounting about Moscow’s intentions to devastate Ukraine’s power generation capacity before the winter. 'And this is the answer to everyone who tried to achieve something with Putin through talks, phone calls, hugs and appeasement,' Zelenskyy said. The comment appeared to be a dig at German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who spoke Friday with Putin in the first such call with a sitting head of a major Western power in nearly two years. Some supporters have argued that the limitation and other U.S. constraints could cost Ukraine the war. The debate has become a source of disagreement among Ukraine’s NATO allies. Biden had remained opposed, determined to hold the line against any escalation that he felt could draw the U.S. and other NATO members into direct conflict with nuclear-armed Russia. Putin has warned that Moscow could provide long-range weapons to others to strike Western targets if NATO allies allow Ukraine to use their arms to attack Russian territory. News of Biden's decision followed meetings over the last two days with the leaders of South Korea, Japan and China. The addition of North Korean troops was central to the talks, which took place on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Peru. Biden did not mention the decision during a speech at a stop in the Amazon rainforest in Brazil on his way to the Group of 20 summit. Asked about the decision, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told reporters that the U.N. position is 'to avoid a permanent deterioration of the war in Ukraine.' 'We want peace, we want fair peace,' Guterres said Sunday before the summit in Rio de Janeiro. He didn't elaborate. The longer-range missiles are likely to be used in response to North Korea’s decision to support Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, according to one of the people familiar with the development. The overall supply of ATACMS missiles is short, so U.S. officials in the past have questioned whether they could give Ukraine enough to make a difference. Some supporters of Ukraine say that even a few strikes deeper inside Russia would force its military to change deployments and expend more of its resources. North Korea has provided thousands of troops to Russia to help Moscow try to claw back land in the Kursk border region that Ukraine seized this year. The introduction of North Korean troops to the conflict comes as Moscow has seen a favorable shift in momentum. Trump has signaled that he could push Ukraine to agree to give up some land seized by Russia to find an end to the conflict. As many as 12,000 North Korean troops have been sent to Russia, according to U.S., South Korean and Ukrainian assessments. U.S. and South Korean intelligence officials say North Korea also has provided Russia with significant amounts of munitions to replenish its dwindling weapons stockpiles. Trump, who takes office in January, spoke for months as a candidate about wanting Russia’s war in Ukraine to be over, but he mostly ducked questions about whether he wanted U.S. ally Ukraine to win. He also repeatedly slammed the Biden administration for giving Kyiv tens of billions of dollars in aid. His victory has Ukraine’s international backers worrying that any rushed settlement would mostly benefit Putin. America is Ukraine’s most valuable ally in the war, providing more than $56.2 billion in security assistance since Russian forces invaded in February 2022. Worried about Russia’s response, however, the Biden administration repeatedly has delayed providing some specific advanced weapons sought by Ukraine, agreeing only under pressure from Kyiv, its supporters and in consultation with allies. That includes initially refusing Zelenskyy’s pleas for advanced tanks, Patriot air defense systems and F-16 fighter jets, among other systems. The White House agreed in May to allow Ukraine to use U.S.-provided weaponry for limited strikes just across the border with Russia. ___ Long, Miller, Knickmeyer and Lee reported from Washington.

Protesters in separatist Georgian region occupy government buildings, calling for leader's ouster	TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — Opposition protesters in Georgia’s breakaway province of Abkhazia on Sunday refused to cede control of key government buildings seized during rallies earlier in the week during which at least 14 people were injured in clashes with police. Demonstrators stormed the buildings Friday to protest new measures allowing Russians to buy property in the seaside region. Protesters on Sunday continued to demand the ouster of self-styled Abkhazian President Aslan Bzhania, and one prominent politician vowed that the opposition would form a rival government if he refuses to step down. 'If our demands for the president’s resignation are not met, we will have to form a temporary government to ensure the normal functioning of state bodies,' Temur Gulia told his supporters, according to local agencies. Bzhania, who is backed by Russia, signaled Sunday that he was prepared to step aside temporarily and hold early elections, even as he continued to slam the demonstrations as 'an attempted coup d’etat.' Opponents of the property agreement say it will drive up prices of apartments and boost Moscow’s dominance in the region. On Saturday, Bzhania announced that he would only agree to a snap election if demonstrators vacated the region’s parliament building. But crowds that gathered in the Abkhazian capital, Sukhumi, rejected the deal and opposition leaders said they would only accept Bzhania’s unconditional resignation. Meanwhile, protesters on Sunday began dismantling the security barriers around the government complex in Sukhumi. One prominent opposition figure called the metal barriers a symbol of the authorities being out of touch. 'This barrier shows that the government has decided to fence itself off from its people,' Adgur Ardzinba said, according to local media. Most of Abkhazia broke away from Georgia in fighting that ended in 1993, and Georgia lost control of the rest of the territory in the short war with Russia in 2008. Russia recognizes Abkhazia as an independent country, but many Abkhazians are concerned that the region of about 245,000 people is a client state of Moscow. Abkhazia’s mountains and Black Sea beaches make it a popular destination for Russian tourists and the demand for holiday homes could be strong. At least 14 people were injured Friday when opposition protesters clashed with police, Russian state agencies reported. Lawmakers had gathered at the region’s parliament building to discuss ratifying measures allowing Russian citizens to buy property in the breakaway state. However, the session was postponed as demonstrators broke down the gate to the building’s grounds with a truck and streamed inside. Some threw rocks at police, who responded with tear gas. The arrest of five opposition figures at a similar demonstration Monday set off widespread protests the next day in which bridges leading to Sukhumi were blocked.	https://apnews.com/article/georgia-abkhazia-unrest-protests-parliament-russia-bzhania-668d5b04d44cf59547b3d93e674b304a	2024-11-17T08:34:53-08:00	
Small plane crashes in Slovenia, killing 3 people	LJUBLJANA, Slovenia (AP) — A small plane crashed on Sunday in foggy weather in northeast Slovenia, killing three people on board, police said. Police said they were informed about the accident around noon on Sunday. The Cessna Skyhawk plane was on a panoramic flight in the area of Prekmurje when it fell, police told Slovenia's public broadcaster RTV Slovenia. The report said the plane was initially set to carry four people but one person stayed behind.	https://apnews.com/article/slovenia-small-plane-crash-cessna-prekmurje-f11cebca2e9f871786c0076b6b22e786	2024-11-17T07:43:57-08:00	
Bangladesh will seek extradition of ex-premier Sheikh Hasina from India	DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — Bangladesh’s interim leader and Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus said Sunday that his administration will seek the extradition of ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina from India, where has been in exile since fleeing a mass uprising in August. In a televised address to the nation on his first 100 days in office, Yunus said that the interim government will try those responsible including Hasina for hundreds of deaths during the student-led uprising that ended her 15-year rule. Yunus took the helm on Aug. 8, three days after Hasina fled the country. He said that not only the deaths in the uprising but all other violations of human rights, including alleged enforced disappearances while Hasina was in power, would be investigated. Bangladesh has sought help from the global police organization Interpol in issuing a red notice for the arrest of Hasina and her associates. 'We will seek the return of the fallen autocrat Sheikh Hasina from India,' Yunus said. 'I have already discussed the issue with chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court Karim Khan.' While Hasina and her close associates are facing numerous criminal charges at home, the Yunus-led government is also pushing for the ICC to take up the case. Seeking Hasina's extradition could also pose a challenge for India, which has treated her as a trusted friend. Yunus said his government's most important task was to hold a new election to hand over power to an elected government, but he did not spell out any timeframe. He said his administration would first bring about reforms in various sectors including in the electoral system. He promised that once the electoral reforms are completed, a roadmap for the new election would be unveiled. Yunus has been talking to political parties including the Bangladesh Nationalist Party headed by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, Hasina's main rival, which has sought an election in two to three months. The party believes it will form the next government as Hasina's Awami League party and its allies face a political debacle following her ouster. Yunus said the Election Commission will be reconstituted soon. 'But as we move forward, we need to complete a lot of work. The train will reach its final station depending on how quickly we can lay down the railway tracks, and this will happen through consensus among the political parties,' he said. Yunus also downplayed as 'exaggerated' reports of attacks on minorities, especially Hindus, many of whom complained that hard-line Islamists are becoming increasingly influential since Hasina’s ouster.	https://apnews.com/article/bangladesh-sheikh-hasina-extradition-india-4265a19fe3144af5f7347072e8c64a14	2024-11-17T05:49:29-08:00	
Tropical Storm Sara makes landfall in Belize after drenching Honduras	SAN PEDRO SULA, Honduras (AP) — Tropical Storm Sara on Sunday made landfall in Belize, where forecasters expect heavy rain to cause life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides. The storm moved inland in Belize after drenching the northern coast of Honduras, where it stalled since Friday, swelling rivers and trapping some people at home. The U.S. National Hurricane Center’s tropical storm warning as of Sunday included the Caribbean coast of Guatemala; the coast of Belize; and northward into the coast of Mexico’s state of Quintana Roo, from Chetumal to Puerto Costa Maya. Those areas, along with portions of El Salvador and western Nicaragua, could see up to 5 inches (13 cm), with localized totals reaching 15 inches (38 cm). The conditions 'will result in areas of flash flooding, perhaps significant, along with the potential of mudslides,' according to the Hurricane Center. 'A storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet above ground level near and to the north of where the center of Sara crosses the coast of Belize,' the center said Sunday. 'Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.' Meanwhile, northern Honduras is not in the clear yet. The center expects Sara to drop up to 3 inches (8 cm) of rain there, but some areas could see totals hit 40 inches (1 meter), with 'catastrophic and life-threatening flooding' still possible.	https://apnews.com/article/tropical-storm-sara-belize-honduras-rain-flooding-f107d30b264401bbcc4bd48d240cc86b	2024-11-17T05:21:21-08:00	
Putin critics lead a march in Berlin calling for democracy in Russia and an end to war in Ukraine	BERLIN (AP) — Prominent Russian opposition figures led a march of at least 1,000 people in central Berlin Sunday, criticizing Russian President Vladimir Putin and his war in Ukraine and calling for democracy in Russia. Behind a banner that read 'No Putin. No War,' the protesters were led by Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of top Putin critic Alexei Navalny, as well as Ilya Yashin and Vladimir Kara-Murza, who were freed from Russian detention in a high-profile prisoner exchange this summer. Shouting 'Russia without Putin' and other chants in Russian, the demonstrators held up signs with a wide array of messages on a red background, including 'Putin = War' and 'Putin is a murderer' in German. Some marched with the flags of Russia or Ukraine, as well as a white-blue-white flag used by some Russian opposition groups. Organizers said the march began near Potsdamer Platz and went through the Brandenburg Gate and Checkpoint Charlie and was expected to end outside the Russian Embassy. 'The march demands the immediate withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine, the trial of Vladimir Putin as a war criminal, and the release of all political prisoners in Russia,' the protesters said in a statement. Yashin, in a statement before the demonstration, said demonstrators were 'using the freedom we have here in Berlin to show the world: A peaceful, free, and civilized Russia exists.' Navalnaya, Yashin and Kara-Murza have all billed Sunday’s rally as a show of unity at a time when recent rounds of acrimony have roiled the anti-war camp. Russia’s exiled anti-war opposition has so far largely failed to speak with one voice and present a clear plan of action. The landmark East-West prisoner swap in August freed key dissidents and promised to reinvigorate a movement unmoored by the death in prison of Navalny, a charismatic anti-corruption campaigner and arch-Kremlin foe. Instead, tensions have spiked in recent months, as Navalny’s allies and other prominent dissidents swapped accusations that appeared to dash any hopes of a united anti-Kremlin front. Many opposition-minded Russians have voiced deep frustration with the infighting, and with what some view as efforts by rivaling groups to discredit and wrest influence from one another. ___ Associated Press writer Joanna Kozlowska in London contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/karamurza-yashin-russia-berlin-putin-ukraine-1b0da07d13ed9bc7d9df2ffe282b9527	2024-11-17T05:14:22-08:00	
Rhodes scholarship recipients for 2025 include 32 US students	A group of 32 students from the United States have been selected to attend the University of Oxford as part of the prestigious Rhodes scholar program in the coming year among an international class representing more than 70 nations, scholarship officials announced. Nearly 3,000 U.S. students began the application process for the scholarship covering all expenses at the storied university in Oxford, England, to pursue graduate degrees beginning in October 2025, the Office of the American Secretary of the Rhodes Trust in McLean, Virginia, said in a statement early Sunday. The 32 recipients include students from 19 states and the District of Columbia attending 20 U.S. colleges and universities. During the application process, 865 students were endorsed by 243 colleges and universities. Committees in 16 U.S. districts then selected 238 finalists for interviews. Four of the recipients are from the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, New York, the most selected from the service academy in one year since 1959. Others include the first Rhodes scholars chosen from Eastern Mennonite University in Virginia and California's Pepperdine University. Returning students to the program for the first time in decades, Coe College in Iowa had its first scholarship winner in more than 53 years and North Carolina's Davidson College placed a scholar after 25 years without the recognition. The trust touted the wide-ranging interests of the scholarship winners: a DJ who uses AI in music and medicine, a religious studies major proficient in six languages, an amateur boxer and the youngest elected official in Missouri. Ramona L. Doyle, American secretary of the Rhodes Trust, said in the statement that in addition to academic excellence, 'a Rhodes Scholar should also have great ambition for social impact, and an uncommon ability to work with others to achieve one’s goals.' 'They should be committed to make a strong difference for good in the world, be concerned for the welfare of others, and be acutely conscious of inequities,' Doyle said. The sponsorships were created in 1902 by the will of Cecil Rhodes, a founder of the diamond mining and manufacturing company De Beers. The inaugural class entered Oxford in 1903 and the first U.S. Rhodes scholars arrived the next year. Scholars pursue advanced degrees in subjects ranging from social sciences and humanities to biological and physical sciences, according to the trust. The Rhodes scholarship is 'the oldest and best-known award for international study, and arguably the most famous academic award available to American college graduates,' Doyle said. Sunday's announcement brings the total number of Americans selected for Rhodes scholarships to 3,674 representing 329 colleges and universities, the trust said, noting 675 U.S. women have won the scholarship despite only having been eligbile to apply since 1976. The U.S. scholars chosen for the 2024 class were the first to take part in a screening process in person following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. During the previous three years, the selection process was conducted online. The scholarships are typically for two to three years but may extend to four. The award covers all fees, a living expense stipend and transportion between England and the recipient’s location. The scholarship is valued at about $75,000 annually, reaching to about $250,000 for scholars who remain in their departments for four years.	https://apnews.com/article/rhodes-scholars-united-states-oxford-university-fcb74fb00691e5dda500e1a1c885ff71	2024-11-17T00:20:39-08:00	
Senegal votes in election that will decide if president can carry out the reforms he promised	DAKAR, Senegal (AP) — Polls opened in Senegal on Sunday for a parliamentary election that is set to determine whether the country’s newly elected president can carry out ambitious reforms. More than 7 million registered voters in the West African country are choosing 165 lawmakers in the national assembly, where the party of President Bassirou Diomaye Faye currently does not hold a majority. Faye, who was elected in March on an anti-establishment platform, says that has blocked him from executing the reforms he pledged during his campaign, including fighting corruption, reviewing fishing permits for foreign companies and securing a bigger share from the country’s natural resources for the population. In September, he dissolved the opposition-led parliament, paving the way for a snap legislative election. His party is facing the Takku Wallu opposition platform led by former President Macky Sall, alongside 39 other registered parties and coalitions. Polls will close at 6 p.m (1800 GMT). The first provisional results are expected to be known by Monday morning, but the final count will only be published later in the week. Faye’s political party, PASTEF, needs at least 83 seats in order to gain a majority in the assembly. Analysts say it has a high chance of securing that, given its popularity and Faye's margin of victory in the March presidential election. Faye, 44, was elected with 54% in the first round, becoming Africa’s youngest elected leader, less than two weeks after he was released from prison. His rise has reflected widespread frustration among Senegal’s youth with the country’s direction — a common sentiment across Africa, which has the world’s youngest population and a number of leaders accused of clinging to power for decades. Over 60% of Senegalese are under 25 and 90% work in informal jobs. Senegal has been hit by skyrocketing inflation in recent years, making it difficult for them to get by. The country is also a major source of irregular migration to Europe, with thousands leaving every year on rickety, artisanal fishing boats in search of economic opportunities. The campaign for the legislative election was marked by sporadic clashes between supporters of different parties. The headquarters of an opposition party were set on fire in the capital, Dakar, and clashes have erupted between supporters in central Senegal in recent weeks, the interior ministry said Monday, On Tuesday, Ousmane Sonko, the country’s prime minister who helped catapult Faye to victory, denounced attacks against supporters of PASTEF in Dakar and other cities. 'May each patriot they have attacked and injured be proportionally avenged. We will exercise our legitimate right to respond,' he wrote on X, before back-pedalling and asking his supporters to remain peaceful in a speech later that day. Last month, Sonko’s vehicle was attacked with stones as clashes broke out between his supporters and unidentified attackers while he was campaigning in Koungueul, in the center of the country. The leader of an allied party, former minister Malick Gackou, had his arm broken in the incident, according to local media. Faye called for peace and urged his supporters to respect the results of the election regardless of the outcome. 'There will be winners and losers but in the end, it is the people that win,' Faye said after casting his vote in his native town of Ndiaganiao, more than 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of Dakar. 'We have an obligation to preserve the international community’s view of our democracy. We are an exception and we must continue to protect that,' he added, referring to Senegal’s reputation as a stable democracy in West Africa, a region rocked in recent years by coups and attempted coups. The presidential election in March had tested this reputation. Both Faye and Sonko had been imprisoned on charges that were largely seen as political, leading to months of protests that were unprecedented in Senegal. Rights groups said dozens of people were killed and about 1,000 people were jailed. Opposition supporters also had been concerned that Sall would seek a third term in office despite being prevented from doing so by the constitution. After a bid to delay the election was blocked by the courts, the government released hundreds of political prisoners, including Faye and Sonko, less than two weeks before the vote. Faye was catapulted into the presidency when Sonko — who was barred from running due to a previous conviction — put his backing behind the political novice and Faye easily beat the candidate backed by Sall. —— Associated Press writer Babacar Dione in Dakar contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/senegal-election-bassirou-diomaye-faye-pastef-52d97319ade0efc750ea3bc5f50877f6	2024-11-16T23:45:02-08:00	
Russia launches one of the fiercest missile and drone attacks at Ukraine's infrastructure	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia on Sunday launched a massive drone and missile attack on Ukraine, described by officials as the largest over the past months, targeting energy infrastructure and killing civilians. The attack came as fears are mounting about Moscow’s intentions to devastate Ukraine's power generation capacity ahead of the cold winter. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Russia had launched a total of 120 missiles and 90 drones in a large-scale attack across Ukraine. Various types of drones were deployed, he said, including Iranian-made Shaheds as well as cruise, ballistic and aircraft-launched ballistic missiles. Ukrainian defenses shot down 140 air targets, Zelenskyy said in a statement on the Telegram messaging app. 'The enemy’s target was our energy infrastructure throughout Ukraine. Unfortunately, there is damage to objects from hits and falling debris. In Mykolaiv, as a result of a drone attack, two people were killed and six others were injured, including two children,' Zelenskyy said. Two others were killed in the Odesa region, where the attack damaged energy infrastructure and disrupted power and water supplies, said local Gov. Oleh Kiper. The combined drone and missile attack was the most powerful in three months, according to the head of Kyiv’s City Military Administration Serhii Popko. Russian strikes have hammered Ukraine’s power infrastructure since Moscow’s all-out invasion of its neighbor in February 2022, prompting repeated emergency power shutdowns and nationwide rolling blackouts. Ukrainian officials have routinely urged Western allies to bolster the country’s air defenses to counter assaults and allow for repairs. Explosions were heard across Ukraine on Sunday, including in capital Kyiv, the key southern port of Odesa, as well as the country’s west and central regions, according to local reports. The operational command of Poland’s armed forces wrote on X that Polish and allied aircraft, including fighter jets, have been mobilized in Polish airspace because of the 'massive' Russian attack on neighboring Ukraine. The steps were aimed to provide safety in Poland's border areas, it said. One person was injured after the roof of a five-story residential building caught fire in Kyiv’s historic center, according to Popko. A thermal power plant operated by private energy company DTEK was 'seriously damaged,' the company said. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/zelenskyy-russia-missiles-drones-ukraine-infrastructure-6af214839d9436731e9b960f0d3a7a8a	2024-11-16T23:31:14-08:00	
Israeli police make arrests after flares fired at prime minister's private residence	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli police said Sunday that they have arrested three suspects after flares were fired at the private residence of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the coastal city of Caesarea. Authorities said the prime minister and his family were not at the residence when two flares were fired at it overnight, and there were no injuries. The police did not provide details about the suspects, but officials pointed to domestic political critics of Netanyahu. Israeli President Isaac Herzog condemned the incident and warned against 'an escalation of the violence in the public sphere.' Netanyahu has faced months of mass protests over his handling of the hostage crisis unleashed by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack into Israel, which ignited the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip. Critics blame Netanyahu for the security and intelligence failures that allowed the attack to happen and for not reaching a deal with Hamas to release scores of hostages still held inside Gaza. A drone launched by Lebanon’s Hezbollah militant group struck Netanyahu's Caesarea residence last month, also when he and his family were away. ___ Find more of AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-lebanon-hezbollah-iran-060c45c86b937d255270d272590884a6	2024-11-16T22:05:05-08:00	
Russia grinds deeper into Ukraine after 1,000 days of grueling war	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — When Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine in February 2022, the conventional wisdom was that the capital, Kyiv, would soon fall and the rest of the country wouldn’t last long against a much larger enemy. Instead, it was that narrative that quickly collapsed. The Ukrainian army proved it could slow the advance of Russia’s forces and, if not drive them out completely, then – with enough support from the West – at least forestall defeat. But nearly three years later, the outlook is again grim. Russia is expending huge amounts of weaponry and human life to make small-but-steady territorial gains to the nearly one-fifth of Ukraine it already controls. Ukraine, meanwhile, is struggling to minimize losses, maintain morale and convince allies that, with more military aid, it can turn the tide. As this brutal war of attrition grinds toward its 1,000th day, neither side seems eager to negotiate. President-elect Donald Trump has said he could quickly end the war, though it is unclear how or in whose favor he might tip the scales. This backdrop appears to be driving Russia’s strategy in eastern Ukraine, according to Phillips O’Brien, a professor of strategic studies at the University of St. Andrews, Scotland. Trump could try to force an end to the war by halting the supply of weapons to Ukraine, he said. 'If Trump cuts aid to Ukraine and a cease-fire leads to a frozen conflict, Russia wants to secure as much territory as it can now,' O’Brien said. For Ukraine, the key to any cease-fire would be guarantees from the West that it won't allow Russia to re-invade in the future. Otherwise, O'Brien said, 'a cease-fire is a recipe for constant instability in Europe.' Russia is advancing slowly but steadily in eastern Ukraine In the war's first year, Ukraine lost huge amounts of territory — but it also achieved notable victories. It resisted a much larger adversary with superior air power to survive as an independent country, and it reclaimed some land through gutsy counteroffensives, giving the underdog — and its wealthy allies — the confidence to stay in the fight. In the second year, which was punctuated by Ukraine's devastating loss of Bakhmut and its failed counteroffensive, the armies essentially fought to a standstill along a 1,000 kilometer (620 mile) front line. Toward the end of that year, the U.S. Congress delayed the approval of a $61 billion package of aid for weapons, and economic and humanitarian assistance. With Ukraine's ammunition dwindling, its outlook deteriorated significantly as the war’s third year began. In February 2024, the town of Avdiivka fell after months of airstrikes by Russia, which used highly destructive Soviet-era bombs retrofitted with navigation systems. The fall of Avdiivka created a major breach in Ukraine’s defenses. When Russia later mounted an assault on the northeastern city of Kharkiv, Ukrainian troops were stretched further. A bright spot for Ukraine came in August, when it launched a surprise incursion into Russia. It took — and still holds — hundreds of square kilometers in the Kursk region. While this could be an important chip in any cease-fire negotiations, it hasn't stopped Russian forces from taking more land in Ukraine's east. 'The Russians have paid a very high price to keep advancing, but they’re willing to pay that price in lives to gain a few more meters of territory each day,' said Justin Crump, head of the British strategic advisory firm Sibylline. Tens of thousands of soldiers from both countries have been killed since the start of the war in 2022, according to estimates, and the U.N. says at least 11,700 Ukrainian civilians have been killed. While the amount of land Russia has gained in 2024 — about 2,455 square kilometers (948 square miles)— is equal to less than 1% of Ukraine’s pre-war territory, it is having a psychological impact. With Ukraine in retreat, 'we’ve now returned to a period reminiscent of the (war's) first months,' said Mykola Bielieskov, an analyst at CBA Initiatives Center in Kyiv. 'This strengthens Russia’s position — not so much militarily, but in terms of morale.' A war of attrition requires both sides to seek outside resources To keep its war machine going, Russia — like Ukraine — has turned to allies for help. Iran supplies Russia with drones and possibly missiles, and North Korea has sent ammunition — and even troops, who have been deployed to Russia's Kursk region. Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed this year that 700,000 of his troops are fighting in Ukraine. Analysts say Putin would need a much larger force to accelerate Russia’s advance, but that he is unlikely to mobilize more troops because it could stoke internal discontent. Ukraine’s foothold in Kursk is another complicating factor for Putin, and it could be used as a bargaining chip in any future cease-fire negotiations. Captain Yevhen Karas, a Ukrainian commander in Kursk, said the fighting inside Russia is highly dynamic, but he believes it will prove effective in diverting Russia's attention and resources. 'Even a creeping, retreating front exhausts the enemy significantly,' Karas said. Ukraine has asked the West for longer range missiles and its blessing to fire at air bases deep inside Russia. But its allies have so far resisted, wary of escalating tensions with a nuclear-armed Russia. The U.S. has provided more than $64 billion in military aid to Ukraine since the war began 1,000 days ago. Soldiers worry about what would happen without sustained American support. 'Bravery, heroism, and spirit alone are not enough,' said a Ukrainian soldier in the eastern Donetsk region who spoke on condition of anonymity, in line with military rules. The soldier estimated that where he is stationed Russian infantry outnumber Ukrainian troops 10 to 1. As the war drags on and the death toll rises, it has become increasingly difficult for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to keep replacing troops. The US will play a vital role in determining the war's next direction What direction the war takes next will depend in large part on how the incoming Trump administration plays its hand. Trump, who has touted his good relationship with President Vladimir Putin and called the Russian leader 'pretty smart' for invading Ukraine, has repeatedly criticized American backing of Ukraine. During his only campaign debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump twice refused to directly answer a question about whether he wanted Ukraine to win — raising concerns that Kyiv could be forced to accept unfavorable terms in any negotiations. Without security guarantees from the West, Ukraine could find itself vulnerable to future Russian aggression. Analysts say a cease-fire based on the current state of the battlefield would set a dangerous precedent, implying that Europe's borders are up for grabs through military action — something that hasn’t happened since World War II. 'This would also have a lot of traction in countries like China, India, and elsewhere,' said Richard Connolly, a Russia expert at the Royal United Services Institute in London. 'They could present that as a strategic defeat not only for Ukraine, but also for the West.' As another winter of war approaches, Ukrainian soldiers say they remain resolute. 'We are standing strong, giving it our all, and we won’t surrender,' said a battalion chief of staff in the southern region of Zaporizhzhia. 'The most important thing now is not to lose more land.' ___ Associated Press journalist Volodymyr Yurchuk contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-russia-war-f7f56e494df1dbbcdec1853001796c45	2024-11-16T20:50:39-08:00	
Tea is a way of life in Azerbaijan and center stage at COP29. But it's not immune to climate change	BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) — Agreements might not yet be brewing amongst negotiators at United Nations climate talks, but tea certainly is. It's one of the clearest reminders that the climate summit — COP29 — is hosted by Azerbaijan. Attendees who roam for miles within the indoor venue have ample options to take a pit stop for sugar and caffeine: shops stack high mountains of pastries with sugary, nutty pakhlava and cardamom-tinged, crescent-shaped shekerbura. At Azerbaijan's country pavilion, women in Baku's traditional dress pour the warm drink for visitors. All of it, like daily life in the city outside, revolves around tea — which climate change threatens around the globe. As world leaders descend on the capital city of Baku for climate talks, researchers who study tea report that in some regions around the world, tea cultivation could decrease by over half as rising temperatures, drought, heavy precipitation and erosion batter tea plants and the land they grow on. Scientists are studying ways to improve tea varieties and preparing for a future where some tea production moves north, along with many other crops hard hit by climate change. Tea 'is a source of livelihood for our region; especially for the local people, for tea producers,' said Keziban Yazici, a professor who has been studying the effects of climate change on tea, speaking in Turkish. 'We need to take the necessary precautions against climate change to make this product sustainable.' Her team has been working on developing drought-resistant tea varieties at their university in Rize, Turkey, one of the major tea-producing areas in the Caucasus region. Yazici traveled to Azerbaijan this spring to initiate further cooperation between the countries — which have many similarities in tea culture and growing — on preparing tea crops for the threat of climate change. The perilous future of this beloved drink serves as a reminder that if the world fails to meet the global warming goals set in the Paris Agreement, many places around the world stand to grieve not just lives and livelihoods, but also treasured elements of cultural heritage. 'Culture and the future has to be aligned,' said Fatima Fataliyeva, the senior sustainability manager for the COP29 operation company, who was responsible for the design of the Azerbaijan pavilion at the venue. 'My mom taught me this, so I will (teach) my kids, so it doesn't disappear.' Fataliyeva described the importance for her team of including Azerbaijani culture at the venue. The first thing that comes to your attention, she said, is tea. From an early age, she learned that drinking tea symbolized hospitality and respect. Tea is for drinking with family and friends, in the home and out on dates. It's central in gossiping and matchmaking, for grandpas playing chess, on festivals and in times of mourning. People drink it from pear-shaped glasses called armudu that keep the bottom of the tea warm while cooling the top, sometimes served with a wedge of orange or lemon and a lump of boiled sugar. 'When you are happy, you drink tea. When you are sad, you drink tea,' said Levent Kurnaz, a professor who studies climate change and ways of combatting invasive pests that are likely to cause increasing harm to tea plants. Kurnaz attended COP29 in part because he saw it as an important way to communicate about climate change — a topic he says isn't talked about as widely in Turkey and Azerbaijan but that is already slamming the few subject-matter experts in the region with a vast array of problems, present and future, in fields ranging from agriculture to immigration. 'Climate change will affect this region seriously,' Kurnaz said, especially for farmers, many of them women, who have grown tea all their lives. 'They don’t have a clue what to do when tea production goes sour. But at some point it will.' Azerbaijan is 25th on the list of top crude oil exporting countries and one of the birthplaces of the oil industry, one of leading sources of planet-warming carbon dioxide emissions. The country is planning to hike its fossil fuel production over the next decade to meet demand from Europe, and their oil production has been a point of controversy since the beginning of this COP. But President Ilham Aliyev said earlier this year that the country is an phase of transition toward clean energy, while maintaining the world continues to need fossil fuels to develop in the foreseeable future. For ordinary people as well as producers, climate change and choices about food and drink are intertwined. That's evident to Rauf Shikhaliyev, who owns a vegetarian and vegan restaurant in Baku called De Rama, also included in the COP29 venue food court. He felt it was 'very important to participate' at the climate talks because his project of creating a vegetarian restaurant was 'highly linked to climate change,' he said. He added that after years in the restaurant business, he's seen the tea culture firsthand: before they order food, many locals will first order tea. It's fitting for the U.N.: 'Tea drinking makes people get kind of united,' he said. ___ Frazer reported from Ankara, Turkey. ___ Follow Melina Walling on X, formerly known as Twitter, @MelinaWalling. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Indigenous peoples, impacted by climate change, raise alarm about the planet at COP29	BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) — They share stories of rising seas, burning trees, contaminated water and disease. But they also come ready to discuss solutions, sharing work their communities are doing to help confront a major threat to life on Earth: climate change. For the many Indigenous peoples who attend the annual U.N. climate talks, this year being held in Azerbaijan, it's a chance to make their voices heard. Their communities are often hard hit by weather extremes that are made worse by climate change. At the same time, traditional practices make many such communities vital in efforts to combat global warming. After all, for thousands of years Indigenous peoples around the world have successfully cared for lands, finding a balance with nature. The Associated Press asked 12 Indigenous people attending this year’s negotiations to say one thing about how climate change is impacting their community, or how their community is helping to combat climate change. Here are their reflections: Saina Ekaterina Savvinova, 53 Indigenous community: Yakut Location: Yakutsk, Russia 'When I was a child, we had a lot of snow. We played in it. We made labyrinths with it. Now we don’t have much snow.' Antumalen Ayelen Antillanca Urrutia, 26 Indigenous community: Mapuche Huilliche Location: Huapi Island, Chile 'As a young Mapuche, I denounce the contamination of my home of Ranco Lake in southern Chile. I live on the third largest lake, on an island in the middle of it, and we do not have drinking water.' Sydney Males, 27 Indigenous community: Kichwa Otavalo Location: Otavalo, Ecuador 'We have a connection, like an energy, with the lakes, with the water in general. We have a connection with fire, we have a connection with the the air and other things that you in the Occident don't have a connection with. So, we have solutions for climate change.' Big Wind Carpenter, 31 Indigenous community: Northern Arapaho Location: Wind River Reservation, United States 'We have been in a drought since I was born. We have been in extreme drought the last 30 years and completely surrounded by wildfires.' Flora Vano, 39 Indigenous community: Melenasian Location: Port Vila, Vanuatu 'Sea level rise is eating us up. It threatens our food security, contaminates our water source, infrastructure is destroyed and the increase in gender-based violence goes sky high.' Puyr dos Santos Tembé, 47 Indigenous community: Tembé Location: Belem, Brazil 'Think about the Amazon. You have trees and rivers, and then you see the rivers, which are the mode of transport for many people, drying up.' Mingma Chhiri, 40 Indigenous community: Sherpa Location: Khumbu Pasanglhamu Municipality District, Nepal 'As ethnic people in the area, we don’t destroy any natural beauty. We don’t cut trees. We plant them.' Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim, 41 Indigenous community: Mbororo Location: N’Djamena, Chad 'Right now we are experiencing the biggest floods we have ever had. Two million people have been displaced and thousands are dead.' Ninawa Inu Pereira Nunes, 50 Indigenous community: Huni Kui Location: Feijo, Brazil 'The main work we do is to raise awareness among people to stop deforestation. But we are also restoring degraded areas by planting trees. And we are working very hard to strengthen the spirituality of our people by restoring the sources of the rivers and repopulating the streams and rivers.' Marynne Rimbao, 42 Indigenous community: Tombekin Location: Unda village, Papua New Guinea 'My place is located in one of the remotest places in Papua New Guinea, where there are mining activities. Especially when mining activities are involved, my area is being impacted by climate change when it comes to the environment — the land, the water, the resources, the food and forests — that sustains our livelihood.' Didja Tchari Djibrillah, 30 Indigenous community: Peul Mbororo Location: Mayo-Kebbi East, Chad 'The community (of pastoralists) contributes to combatting the effects of climate change. When moving from one place to another, we leave cow dung that allows the soil to be fertilized and the ecosystem to regenerate.' Jackson Michael, 40 Indigenous community: Iban Location: Borneo, Malaysia 'Heavy rainfall is affecting wildlife. Now the government is making a lot of effort to protect and preserve wildlife.' __ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

As talks in Baku cross the halfway point, nations are no closer to a goal on cash for climate action	BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) — Distractions were bigger than deals in the first week of United Nations climate talks, leaving a lot to be done, especially on the main issue of money. In week one, not a lot of progress was made on the issue of how much money rich countries should pay to developed ones to move away from dirty fuels and how to cope with rising seas and temperatures and pay for damage already caused by climate-driven extreme weather. But more is expected when government ministers fly in for week two to handle the hard political deal-making at the negotiations — known as COP29 — in Baku, Azerbaijan. Countries remain about a trillion dollars a year apart in the big number to be settled. 'All the developing countries look very united behind $1.3 trillion. That’s not a ceiling. That’s what they want. That’s what they think they need,' said Debbie Hillier, policy lead at Mercy Corps. 'The U.S. and Canada are constantly talking about a floor of $100 billion.... So you've got $100 billion at one end and $1.3 trillion' on the other end. While poor countries have come up with a number for the total final package, the rich donor nations have assiduously avoided giving a total, choosing to pick a figure late in the bargaining game, Hillier said. 'The intention of developed countries to really come clean and show commitment is missing,' said Harjeet Singh, global engagement director for the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative. 'They have not uttered a single word on what the (final total) is going to be which is very disturbing.' Especially when it comes to this total, United Nations Climate Secretary Simon Stiell said, 'negotiations on key issues need to be moving much faster.' 'What’s at stake here in Baku,' Stiell said, is 'nothing less than the capacity to halve emissions this decade and protect lives and livelihoods from spiraling climate impacts.' Climate talks run on ‘brinkmanship’ At the moment, the sides are far away, which is sort of normal for this stage. The technical details that are worked out by negotiators now have to give way to the bigger, harder number decisions made by climate and finance ministers to make more political decisions, said Ani Dasgupta, president of World Resources Institute. 'Member states have not moved and parties have not moved as expeditiously as they need to do,' said United Nations Environment Programme Executive Director Inger Andersen. 'This is causing frustration. I understand that. So the answer is to push and push more and ensure that we land where we need to land.' Andersen said it’s not smart to judge where countries will end up after just one week. Things change. It’s the nature of how negotiations are designed, experts said. That’s how it usually goes. 'COP works on brinkmanship,' said Avinash Persaud, a special climate adviser at the Inter-American Development Bank. 'COP works on the fear of us not reaching agreement in the end, which makes the process appear chaotic from the outside.' Ministers will also be consulting with their bosses half a world away and seven hours behind at the Group of 20 countries — the G20 — in Brazil from Monday. The G20 is comprised of the world’s richest nations, who are also responsible for 77% of planet-heating gases being spewed. Eyes are on the COP president Usually, the second week is when the COP president takes over and pushes sides together for a deal. Different negotiations' presidents have different styles. Last year's president used sharp elbows to get things done, upsetting some people. That's not the style of this year's COP29 President Mukhtar Babayev. 'What I see with Mukhtar is that he uses a gentle presence, a degree of humility in his very presence,' Andersen said. But Mohamed Adow, of the think tank Power Shift Africa said 'the presidency is not giving any hope for how he will help the world strike the right compromises.' Babayev struck an optimistic tone in a statement to The Associated Press on how things are looking at the halfway point. 'We have made good progress in the first week. We’re feeling positive but there is still much work to do,' Babayev said. 'Success does not depend on one country or party alone – it requires all of us.' At the talks' first week, there were many distractions Much of the news from the talks' first weeks came from outside the negotiation rooms. Host country president Ilham Aliyev triggered a few distractions himself. His combative welcome speech not only blasted neighbor Armenia and western mainstream media, but he called oil and gas — chief causes of climate change a 'gift from the Gods.' And then he got into a verbal spat with France, prompting the environment minister to pull out from the talks. Argentina called its delegation home in what may be a preview for the right-wing ruled country pulling out of the Paris climate agreement. At the same time, a letter signed by a former United Nations secretary-general and ex-top climate negotiators called for dramatic reform of the talks. But several authors said the letter was being misinterpreted. Activists blasted the talks as being too wedded to fossil fuels, citing Aliyev's comments, the fact that Azerbaijan is a big oil producer and that more than 1,700 people connected to the fossil fuel industry were part of the negotiations. A sense of optimism, but not urgency Some top leaders already at the climate talks expressed 'cautious optimism' but added that the larger goal of climate talks should be front and center next week. 'We need to keep 1.5 alive,' said Alliance of Small Island States Chair Cedric Schuster referring to the climate goal set nine years ago at the Paris climate talks to keep global heating to less than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. Schuster, who is also the environment minister of Samoa, a Pacific island impacted by rising seas, added that 'discussions are progressing, and we hope to get there.' Sehr Raheja from New Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment said countries have gone for the 'lowest hanging fruit so far' and said developed nations 'will have to engage in good faith on the issues of total money needed' if there's a chance of getting a strong outcome. Climate Analytics CEO Bill Hare called for more urgency from the talks. 'Despite the recent devastation the world has experienced and the soaring rise in temperatures, the urgency really hasn’t yet been felt here in Baku,' he said. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

The 'super year' of elections has been super bad for incumbents as voters punish them in droves	BANGKOK (AP) — Whether on the left or the right, regardless of how long they’ve been in power, sitting governments around the world have been drubbed this year by disgruntled voters in what has been called the 'super year' for elections. Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election was just the latest in a long line of losses for incumbent parties in 2024, with people in some 70 countries accounting for about half the world's population going to the polls. Issues driving voter discontent have varied widely, though there has been almost universal malaise since the COVID-19 pandemic as people and businesses struggle to get back on their feet while facing stubbornly high prices, cash-strapped governments and a surge in migration. 'There’s an overall sense of frustration with political elites, viewing them as out of touch, that cuts across ideological lines,' said Richard Wike, director of global attitudes research at the Pew Research Center. He noted that a Pew poll of 24 countries found that the appeal of democracy itself was slipping as voters reported increasing economic distress and a sense that no political faction truly represents them. 'Lots of factors are driving this,' Wike said, 'but certainly feelings about the economy and inflation are a big factor.' Since the pandemic hit in 2020, incumbents have been removed from office in 40 of 54 elections in Western democracies, said Steven Levitsky, a political scientist at Harvard University, revealing 'a huge incumbent disadvantage.' In Britain, the right-of-center Conservatives suffered their worst result since 1832 in July’s election, which returned the center-left Labour Party to power after 14 years. But just across the English Channel, the far right rocked the governing parties of France and Germany, the European Union's biggest and most powerful members, in June elections for the parliament of the 27-nation bloc. The results pushed French President Emmanuel Macron to call a parliamentary election in hope of stemming a far-right surge at home. The anti-immigration National Rally party won the first round, but alliances and tactical voting knocked it down to third place in the second round, producing a fragile government atop a divided legislature. In Asia, a group of South Korean liberal opposition parties, led by the Democratic Party, defeated the ruling conservative People Power Party in April’s parliamentary elections. India’s Narendra Modi, meanwhile, had been widely expected to easily sweep to a third straight term in June but instead voters turned away from his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party in droves, costing it its majority in parliament, though it was able to remain in power with the help of allies. Likewise, Japanese voters in October punished the Liberal Democratic Party, which has governed the country nearly without interruption since 1955. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba will stay in power, but the greater-than-expected loss ended the LDP’s one-sided rule, giving the opposition a chance to achieve policy changes long opposed by the conservatives. 'If you were to ask me to explain Japan in a vacuum, that’s not too difficult,' said Paul Nadeau, an adjunct assistant professor at Temple University’s Japan campus in Tokyo. 'Voters were punishing an incumbent party for a corruption scandal, and this gave them a chance to express a lot more frustrations that they already had.' Globally, however, it's harder to draw conclusions. 'This is pretty consistent across different situations, different countries, different elections — incumbents are getting a crack on the shins,' he said. 'And I don’t have any good big picture explanations for why that is.' Rob Ford, professor of political science at the University of Manchester, said inflation has been a major driver of 'the greatest wave of anti-incumbent voting ever seen' — though the reasons behind the backlash may also be 'broader and more diffuse.' 'It could be something directly to do with the long-term effects of the COVID pandemic — a big wave of ill health, disrupted education, disrupted workplace experiences and so forth making people less happy everywhere, and they are taking it out on governments,' he said. 'A kind of electoral long COVID.' In South Africa, high unemployment and inequality helped drive a dramatic loss of support for the African National Congress, which had governed for three decades since the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule. The party once led by Nelson Mandela lost its parliamentary majority in May’s election and was forced to go into coalition with opposition parties. Other elections in Africa presented a mixed picture, said Alex Vines, director of the African Program at the international affairs think tank Chatham House, partially clouded by countries with authoritarian leaders whose reelections were not in doubt, like Rwanda’s long-serving President Paul Kagame who got 99% of the vote. In African countries with strong democratic institutions, however, the pattern of incumbents being punished holds, Vines said. 'The countries with stronger institutions — South Africa, Senegal, Botswana — have witnessed either a government of national unity or change of party of government,' he said. In Botswana, voters unexpectedly ejected a party that had ruled for 58 years since independence from Britain in an October election. Vines said that across the continent, 'you’ve got this electorate now who have no memory of decolonization or the end of apartheid and so have different priorities, who are also feeling the cost-of-living pressures.' In Latin America, one major country stands out for bucking the anti-incumbent wave – Mexico. Andrés Manuel López Obrador, limited to a single term, selected Claudia Sheinbaum, a member of his party, to succeed him. Sheinbaum easily won the presidency in June’s election. Wike noted that Mexico is one of the few countries in Pew’s survey where voters reported satisfaction with economic conditions. Some newcomers to office have already found that the honeymoon following their victories has been short, as people have rapidly turned on them. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has seen his approval ratings plummet from a jaded electorate that wants lower prices and better public services — but is deeply skeptical of politicians’ intention and ability to deliver change. Ford, of the University of Manchester, said it's a problem for democracy when voters, whose task is to hold governments to account, are so quick to pass judgment. 'If voters are the electoral equivalent of a hanging judge, putting politicians to the gallows whether they be guilty or innocent, then what incentive is there for governments to try?' he asked. 'The angels and the devils get chucked out alike, but being an angel is harder.' Trump first came to power as a challenger in the 2016 election, and then lost as an incumbent in the 2020 election to Joe Biden. This year, he defeated Biden's vice president, Kamala Harris, who stepped in late in the race when the president unexpectedly dropped out. Trump's win is one of the conservative populist movement's highest-profile triumphs. But another icon of the cause, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, saw his own party suffer its worst showing in decades in this year's European Union election, demonstrating that no movement is safe from backlash. Nadeau, of Temple University, suggested that perhaps analysts had previously misunderstood global electoral trends — parsing them as ideological shifts — 'when all along it was actually an anti-incumbent mood.' 'Maybe it has always been anti-incumbent, and we were just misdiagnosing it,' he said. ___ Lawless reported from London and Riccardi from Denver, Colorado.	https://apnews.com/article/global-elections-2024-incumbents-defeated-c80fbd4e667de86fe08aac025b333f95	2024-11-16T20:08:10-08:00	
Biden will become the first sitting US president to visit the Amazon rainforest	SAO PAULO (AP) — Joe Biden will become the first sitting U.S. president to set foot in the Amazon rainforest during a brief stop Sunday in the Brazilian city of Manaus, coming as the U.S. is expected to scale back its commitment to combating climate change under the incoming administration of Donald Trump. The massive Amazon — it’s about the size of Australia — stores huge amounts of the world’s carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas driving climate change, even as it's rapidly deforested. Biden is expected to take an aerial tour over part of the world's largest tropical rainforest, meet local and indigenous leaders and visit an Amazonian museum as he looks to highlight his commitment to the preservation of the region. The Biden administration announced plans last year for a $500 million contribution to the Amazon Fund, the most significant international cooperation effort to preserve the rainforest, primarily financed by Norway. So far, the U.S. government said it has provided $50 million, according to a July statement from its embassy in Brazil, adding it would 'continue to work with Congress to secure the remaining funding for the Amazon Fund and related activities through 2028.' 'It’s significant for a sitting president to visit the Amazon. ... This shows a personal commitment from the president,' said Suely Araújo, former head of the Brazilian environmental protection agency and public policy coordinator with the nonprofit Climate Observatory. 'That said, we can’t expect concrete results from this visit.' She doubts that a 'single penny' will go to the Amazon Fund come January. The Trump administration is highly unlikely to prioritize the Amazon — or anything related to climate change. The Republican president-elect already said he'd again pull out of the Paris agreement, a global pact forged to avert the threat of catastrophic climate change, after Biden recommitted to the agreement. Trump has cast climate change as a 'hoax' and said he will eliminate energy efficiency regulations by the Biden administration. The Amazon is the world’s largest tropical rainforest, home to Indigenous communities and 10% of Earth’s biodiversity. It also regulates moisture across South America. About two-thirds of the Amazon lies within Brazil, and scientists say its devastation poses a catastrophic threat to the planet. The forest has been suffering two years of historic drought that have dried up waterways, isolated thousands of riverine communities and hindered riverine dwellers’ ability to fish. It's also made way for wildfires that have burned an area larger than Switzerland and choked cities near and far with smoke. When Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva took office last year, he signaled a shift in environmental policy from his predecessor — far-right Jair Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro prioritized agribusiness expansion over forest protection and weakened environmental agencies, prompting deforestation to surge to a 15-year-high. Lula has pledged 'zero deforestation' by 2030, though his term runs through the end of 2026. Forest loss in Brazil’s Amazon dropped by 30.6% in the 12 months through July from a year earlier, bringing deforestation to its lowest level in nine years, according to official data released last week. In that 12-month span, the Amazon lost 6,288 square kilometers (2,428 square miles), roughly the size of the U.S. state of Delaware. However, that data fails to capture the surge of destruction this year, which will only be included in next year’s reading. Despite the success in curbing Amazon deforestation, Lula’s government has been criticized by environmentalists for backing projects that could harm the region, such as paving a highway that cuts from an old-growth area and could encourage logging, oil drilling near the mouth of the Amazon River and building a railway to transport soy to Amazonian ports. Biden is making the Amazon visit as part of a six-day trip to South America, the first to the continent of his presidency. On Sunday morning, he's wrapping a visit to Lima, Peru, where he took part in the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit and met with Chinese President Xi Jinping. After his brief stop in Manaus, he's headed to Rio de Janeiro for this year's Group of 20 leaders summit. ___ Madhani reported from Lima, Peru, and Long from Washington.	https://apnews.com/article/biden-amazon-peru-g20-3cc827382d1e3c32865a14616ddfe467	2024-11-16T20:03:57-08:00	
Victoria Kjær Theilvig of Denmark is crowned the 73rd Miss Universe	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Victoria Kjær Theilvig of Denmark has been crowned Miss Universe. Kjaer, an animal protection advocate who works in the diamond selling business, beat out Miss Nigeria at the end of 73rd edition of the competition in Mexico City. Miss Mexico placed third. It is the first time a Danish contestant has won Miss Universe. The pageant was held in the Mexico City Arena, an indoor venue with a capacity for 20,000 people. Supporters inside shouted and waved flags from countries around the world. The ceremony began with 131 mariachi musicians and singer Taboo of the Black Eyed Peas playing 'Mexicana', a song created by Emilio Estefan for the contest. The gala was hosted by Mario López; Olivia Culpo, Miss Universe 2012; presenter Zuri Hall; and Catriona Gray, Miss Universe 2018. Organizers said that there were more than 120 contestants.

Latest typhoon lashes the Philippines, causing tidal surges and displacing massive numbers of people	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — A powerful typhoon wrecked houses, caused towering tidal surges and forced hundreds of thousands of people to flee to emergency shelters as it cut across the northern Philippines on Sunday in the sixth major storm to hit the country in less than a month. Typhoon Man-yi slammed into the eastern island province of Catanduanes on Saturday night with sustained winds of up to 195 kilometers (125 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 240 kph (149 mph). The country’s weather agency warned of a 'potentially catastrophic and life-threatening situation' in provinces along its path. There were no immediate reports of casualties from the typhoon, which was forecast to blow northwestward on Sunday across northern Luzon, the archipelago's most populous region. The capital region of metropolitan Manila would likely be spared from a direct hit but was placed, along with outlying regions, under storm alerts and warned of dangerous coastal storm surges. 'The rain was minimal, but the wind was very strong and had this eerie howling sound,' Roberto Monterola, a disaster-mitigation officer in Catanduanes, told The Associated Press by telephone. 'Along a main boulevard here, the tidal surges went up to more than 7 meters (23 feet) near the seaside houses. It looked really scary.' The entire province of Catanduanes had no power after the typhoon knocked down trees and electricity posts, and disaster-response teams were checking how many more houses were damaged in addition to those impacted by previous storms, he said. 'We need tin roofs and other construction materials, aside from food. Villagers tell us here that they still haven’t gotten up from the past storm and were pinned down again by this typhoon,' Monterola said. Nearly half of the island province’s 80,000 people were sheltering in evacuation centers. Catanduanes officials were so concerned as the typhoon approached that they threatened vulnerable villagers with arrest if they did not follow orders to evacuate to safer grounds. More than 750,000 people took refuge in emergency shelters, including churches and a shopping mall, due to Man-yi and two previous storms mostly in the northern Philippines, Assistant Secretary Cesar Idio of the Official of Civil Defense and other provincial officials said. The rare number of back-to-back storms and typhoons that lashed Luzon in just three weeks left more than 160 people dead, affected 9 million people and caused such extensive damage to residential communities, infrastructure and farmlands that the Philippines may have to import more rice, a staple food for most Filipinos. In an emergency meeting as Man-yi approached, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. asked his Cabinet and provincial officials to brace for 'the worst-case scenario.' At least 26 domestic airports and two international airports were briefly shut and inter-island ferry and cargo services were suspended due to rough seas, stranding thousands of passengers and commuters, according to the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippine and the coast guard. The United States, Manila’s treaty ally, along with Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei provided cargo aircraft and other storm aid to augment the government’s overwhelmed disaster-response agencies. Last month, the first major storm, Trami, left scores of people dead after dumping one to two months’ worth of rain in just 24 hours in several towns. The Philippines is battered by about 20 typhoons and storms each year. It’s often hit by earthquakes and has more than a dozen active volcanoes, making it one of the world’s most disaster-prone countries.	https://apnews.com/article/philippines-typhoon-manyi-520b17b3c2b0ccfd33c7421f65ba177d	2024-11-16T19:00:27-08:00	
Bela Karolyi, who trained Olympic champion gymnasts and was affected by Nassar scandal, dies at 82	Bela Karolyi, the charismatic if polarizing gymnastics coach who turned young women into champions and the United States into an international power in the sport, has died. He was 82. USA Gymnastics said Karolyi died Friday. No cause of death was given. Karolyi and wife Martha trained multiple Olympic gold medalists and world champions in the U.S. and Romania, including Nadia Comaneci and Mary Lou Retton. 'A big impact and influence on my life,' Comaneci, who was just 14 when Karolyi coached her to gold for Romania at the 1976 Montreal Olympics, posted on Instagram. Yet Karolyi's strident methods sometimes came under fire, most pointedly during the height of the Larry Nassar scandal. When the disgraced former USA Gymnastics team doctor was effectively given a life sentence after pleading guilty to sexually assaulting gymnasts and other athletes with his hands under the guise of medical treatment, over a dozen former gymnasts came forward saying the Karolyis were part of a system that created an oppressive culture that allowed Nassar’s behavior to run unchecked for years. While the Karolyis denied responsibility — telling CNN in 2018 they were unaware of Nassar's behavior — the revelations led to them receding from the spotlight. USA Gymnastics eventually exited an agreement to continue to train at the Karolyi Ranch north of Houston, though only after American star Simone Biles took the organization to task for having them train at a site where many experienced sexual abuse. The Karolyis receded from the spotlight in the aftermath after spending 30-plus years as a guiding force in American gymnastics, often basking in success while brushing with controversy in equal measure. The Karolyis defected from Romania to the United States in 1981. Three years later Bela helped guide Retton — all of 16 — to the Olympic all-around title at the 1984 Games in Los Angeles. At the 1996 Games in Atlanta, he memorably helped an injured Kerri Strug off the floor after Strug's vault secured the team gold for the Americans. Karolyi briefly became the national team coordinator for USA Gymnastics women's elite program in 1999 and incorporated a semi-centralized system that eventually turned the Americans into the sport's gold standard. It did not come without a cost. He was removed from the position after the 2000 Olympics when it became apparent his leadership style simply would not work, though he remained around the sport after Martha took over for her husband in 2001. While the Karolyis approach helped the U.S. become a superpower — an American woman has won each of the last six Olympic titles and the U.S. women earned the team gold at the 2012 and 2016 games under Martha Karolyi's leadership — their methods came under fire. Dominique Moceanu, part of the 'Magnificent 7' team that won gold in Atlanta, talked extensively about her corrosive relationship with the Karolyis following her retirement. In her 2012 memoir, Moceanu wrote Bela Karolyi verbally abused her in front of her teammates on multiple occasions. 'His harsh words and critical demeanor often weighed heavily on me,' Moceanu posted on X Saturday. 'While our relationship was fraught with difficulty, some of these moments of hardship helped me forge and define my own path.' Some of Karolyi's most famous students were always among his staunchest defenders. When Strug got married, she and Karolyi took a photo recreating their famous scene from the 1996 Olympics, when he carried her onto the medals podium after she vaulted on a badly sprained ankle. Being a gymnastics pied-piper was never Karolyi’s intent. Born in Clug, Hungary (now Romania) on Sept. 13, 1942, he wanted to be a teacher, getting into coaching in college simply so he could spend more time with Martha. After graduating, the couple moved to a small coal-mining town in Transylvania. Looking for a way to keep their students warm and entertained during the long, harsh winters, Karolyi dragged out some old mats and he and his wife taught the children gymnastics. The students showed off their skills to their parents, and the exhibitions soon caught the eye of the Romanian government, which hired the Karolyis to coach the women’s national team at a time when the sport was done almost exclusively by adult women, not young girls. Karolyi changed all that, though, bringing a team to the Montreal Olympics with only one gymnast older than 14. It was in Montreal, of course, where the world got its first real glimpse of Karolyi. When a solemn, dark-haired sprite named Nadia Comaneci enchanted the world with the first perfect 10 in Olympic history, a feat she would duplicate six times, Karolyi was there to wrap her in one of his trademark bear hugs. Romania, which had won only three bronzes in Olympic gymnastics before 1976, left Montreal with seven medals, including Comaneci’s golds in the all-around, balance beam and uneven bars, and the team silver. Comaneci became an international sensation, the first person to appear on the covers of Sports Illustrated, Time and Newsweek in the same week. Four years later, however, Karolyi was in disgrace. He was incensed by the judging at the Moscow Olympics, which he thought cost Comaneci a second all-around gold, and the Romanian government was horrified that he had embarrassed the Soviet hosts. 'Suddenly, from a position where we’ve been praised and considered the foremost athletes in the country, I was stigmatized,' he once said. 'I thought they could put me away for political misconduct.' When he and Martha took the Romanian team to New York for an exhibition in March 1981, they were tipped off that they were going to be punished upon their return. Despite not speaking any English and with their then-6-year-old daughter, Andrea, still in Romania, they decided to defect. 'We knew what kind of risks we were taking, because nobody was guaranteeing us anything,' Martha Karolyi once said. 'We started out with a suitcase and a little motel room. From there, it’s gradually improved.' The couple made their way to California, where they learned English by watching television and Bela did odd jobs. A chance encounter with Olympic gold medalist Bart Conner — who would later marry Comaneci — at the Los Angeles airport a few months later led to the Karolyis’ first coaching job in the United States. Within a year, their daughter had arrived in the U.S. and the Karolyis had their own gym in Houston. It soon became the center of American gymnastics, turning out eight national champions in 13 years. Three years after the Karolyis left Romania, Retton became the first American to win the Olympic all-around title, scoring a perfect 10 on vault to claim gold at the 1984 Games in Los Angeles. Retton also posted the highest score in the team competition as the Americans won the silver, their first team medal since 1948. Four years later, Phoebe Mills, another Karolyi gymnast, won a bronze on balance beam. It was the first individual medal for an American woman at a non-boycotted games. And in 1991, Kim Zmeskal — 'the little Kimbo,' as Bela Karolyi called her — became the first American to win the world all-around title. 'My biggest contribution was giving the kids the faith that they can be the best among the best,' Karolyi once said. 'I knew that if the Americans could understand they were not inferior ... then they can be groomed like international, highly visible athletes.' But as Karolyi’s resume grew, so did the criticism. Other coaches were irritated by his brash personality and ability to always find his way into the spotlight. When Retton won gold, Karolyi leaped a barrier — he had an equipment manager’s credential, not a coach’s — so he could scoop Retton up in a hug — right in front of the TV cameras, of course. He could be a harsh taskmaster, calling his gymnasts names, taunting them for their weight and pushing them to their limits. Even those warm embraces weren’t always quite what they seemed. 'A lot of those big bear hugs came with the whisper of `Not so good,’ in our ears,' Retton wrote. Yet Retton and Comaneci remained close with Karolyi, making appearances with him at gymnastics events or sitting with him at competitions. Zmeskal had her wedding at the Karolyi ranch. Karolyi briefly retired after the 1992 Games in Barcelona, where he led the Americans to their first team medal, a bronze, at a non-boycotted Olympics in 44 years. But he kept his gym and summer camps, and by 1994 was again coaching elite-level gymnasts after Zmeskal asked him to help in her attempt to make the Atlanta Games. Zmeskal didn’t make the Atlanta squad. But two of Karolyi’s other gymnasts, Strug and Moceanu, did, and it was Strug who provided one of the signature moments of the Olympics. The Americans went into their final event in team finals, vault, trying to hold off Russia for their first-ever title at an Olympics or world championships. Despite injuring her left ankle when she fell on her first vault attempt, Strug went ahead with her second attempt, believing — wrongly — the Americans needed her score to clinch the gold. With Karolyi shouting, 'You can do it!' Strug sprinted down the runway, soared high above the vault and landed on both feet — ensuring it was a clean vault — before pulling her left leg up. After saluting the judges, she fell to her knees and had to be carried off the podium. Tests would later show she had two torn ligaments in her ankle. As the rest of the Americans gathered on the podium to receive their gold medals, Karolyi carried Strug back into the arena, cradling her in his arms. But even that drew criticism. Many said Karolyi never should have encouraged Strug to vault on her injured ankle in the first place, and then should have stayed out of the spotlight rather than carrying her to the podium. 'Bela is a very tough coach and he gets criticism for that,' Strug said at the time. 'But that’s what it takes to become a champion. I don’t think it’s really right that everyone tries to find the faults of Bela. Anything in life, to be successful, you’ve got to work really hard.' The Karolyis retired again after the Atlanta Olympics. But after the U.S. women finished last in the medal round at the 1997 world championships, USA Gymnastics asked Bela Karolyi to come back. He agreed — but only if he could implement a semi-centralized training system. Rather than a patchwork system of individual coaches who had their own philosophies, Karolyi would oversee the entire U.S. program. Gymnasts could still train with their own coaches, but there would be regular national team camps to ensure they were meeting established training and performance standards. Though the idea was sound, Karolyi was not the right person to be in charge. Coaches who had been his equal chafed at his heavy-handedness, and were annoyed by his grandstanding. Gymnasts resented his bluster and demands. By the time the Americans left the Sydney Olympics, about the only thing everyone agreed on was that Karolyi needed to step away. He stepped aside and was replaced by his wife. Martha Karolyi’s standards were just as high — if not higher — than her husband’s, but on the surface, she was more willing to listen to other opinions. 'She’s more diplomatic. Absolutely,' Bela Karolyi said before the 2012 Olympics. 'I’m wild. The opposite.' ___ AP sports: https://apnews.com/sports	https://apnews.com/article/bela-karolyi-gymnastics-olympics-obituary-751cc725b57045bd9125132f1cbc1982	2024-11-16T16:03:12-08:00	
APEC closes in Peru with China's President Xi front and center as Trump whiplash looms	LIMA, Peru (AP) — After two days of meetings in Lima that rarely ventured beyond platitudes in discussing the strategies of robust economic engagement, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum wrapped up Saturday with a spirit of detente that many fear the annual summit may not see again for the next four years. The 21 leaders from economies bordering the Pacific, including U.S. President Joe Biden, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, descended on Peru this week at a time when America’s incoming president, Donald Trump, has vowed to withdraw the U.S. from its leadership of a global free trade agenda. Few could help noting that Biden's late entrance to the traditional APEC family photo Saturday lent itself to political metaphor, as the rest of the leaders took their place on the risers before looking around to find Biden missing. They tittered for five awkward minutes before a seemingly dazed Biden arrived and took the stage in the far back corner. Chinese President Xi, who draped himself in the banner of globalization this week inaugurating a massive $1.3 billion megaport in Peru and using his speeches to reject protectionism, scored the best spot onstage for the photo, front and center. The leaders all wore bark-hued wool scarves from Peru — in the APEC tradition of posing in some garb representative of the host country. Biden left the stage as reporters shouted questions, asking for a response to this being his last APEC summit, and one of his last major global events as U.S. president. Much of the conversation about APEC this year centers on the heightened trade and security rivalry between the U.S. and China. Biden and Xi will sit down later Saturday for their third and final meeting of Biden's tenure. They last met a year ago, at APEC in California.	https://apnews.com/article/peru-apec-biden-xi-china-trump-trade-c9883061b53ab82f5630a3bd6fcf87fa	2024-11-16T11:41:08-08:00	
At least 13 people killed and more kidnapped by extremist rebels in eastern Congo	KINSHASA, Congo (AP) — At least 13 people were killed and others kidnapped in eastern Congo by extremist rebels linked to the Islamic State group, local authorities said Saturday. Rebels with the Allied Democratic Forces, which has ties to IS, killed civilians in Mabisio village in North Kivu province, said the area's administrator, Col. Alain Kiwewa, on state television. Women were among those killed in the attack late Friday evening, and houses were burned and looted, he said. Eastern Congo has struggled with armed violence for decades as more than 120 groups fight for power, land and valuable mineral resources, while others try to defend their communities. Some armed groups have been accused of mass killings. In recent years, ADF attacks have intensified and spread towards Goma, eastern Congo’s main city, as well as neighboring Ituri province. Rights groups and the United Nations have accused the ADF of killing hundreds of people and abducting even more, including a significant number of children. In August, the ADF killed at least 12 people in several villages in North Kivu.	https://apnews.com/article/islamic-stage-congo-killings-kivu-adf-goma-d054dc1c3a0b43d1439ba83b4075a127	2024-11-16T10:12:45-08:00	
Venezuela releases from prison some of the thousands detained after presidential election	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Non-governmental organizations in Venezuela on Saturday announced the release from prison of some of the thousands of people who were detained during and after the deadly anti-government protests that followed the July presidential election, whose results remain under dispute. Their release happened a day after the attorney general, who is loyal to the ruling party, announced the review of 225 cases linked to the aftermath of the election, which President Nicolás Maduro and opposition candidate Edmundo González both claim to have won. The Venezuelan-based organizations Penal Forum and Venezuelan Prison Observatory announced the prison releases on X, but it was not immediately clear the exact number of people who were freed. The latter organization said the release came with certain conditions, which it did not explain further. Images shared on social media by the Observatory show women tearfully hugging loved ones outside a prison in the South American country. The organization described the releases as a 'victory' and demanded that all who remain in prison for their roles in the election and activities in its aftermath be freed. Maduro’s government has come under heavy criticism for the election’s lack of transparency and the repression unleashed in its aftermath, including the arrests of political leaders, lawyers, poll workers, election volunteers and protesters, both minors and adults. The protests erupted after Venezuela’s electoral authorities declared Maduro had won the July 28 contest and alleged they could not publish precinct-level results because their website had been hacked. At the same time, the main opposition coalition announced it had secured vote tally sheets from more than 80% of the electronic voting machines used across the country, published them online and declared that its candidate, González, had defeated Maduro by a landslide. The government’s arrest tally included about 2,400 people. Government officials, including Attorney General Tarek William Saab, have strongly defended the detentions, but earlier this week, Maduro called on Saab and judges to ensure 'justice' in the event that a case 'needs to be rectified and reviewed.'	https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-election-maduro-gonzalez-arrests-protests-release-815e8b91cb1ec76268c8b1da81f90b2f	2024-11-16T09:47:43-08:00	
Eight killed and 17 injured after knife attack at a vocational school in China	BEIJING (AP) — Eight people were killed and 17 others injured after a stabbing attack at a vocational school in the eastern Chinese city of Wuxi on Saturday night, local police said. The attack occurred at the Wuxi Vocational Institute of Arts and Technology in Yixing, a smaller city within Wuxi, at around 18:30 local time on Saturday, the Yixing police said in a statement. The suspect, a 21-year old male student surnamed Xu, was detained on site. Police said Wu had failed his examinations and could not graduate, and that he was dissatisfied about his pay at an internship. He decided to vent his frustrations via the attack, the statement said. Videos circulating on social media showed injured people lying on the street after the attack while others rushed to help. This is the second deadly attack within a week after a man drove his car into people at a sports facility in the southern city of Zhuhai, leaving 35 people dead and injured 43 others. China has seen a number of attacks in which suspects appear to target members of the public at random. In October, a man was detained after he allegedly attacked children with a knife at a school in Beijing. Five people were wounded. In September, three people were killed in a knife attack in a Shanghai supermarket, and 15 others were injured. Police said at the time that the suspect had personal financial disputes and came to Shanghai to 'vent his anger.' The same month, a Japanese schoolboy died after being stabbed on his way to school in the southern city of Shenzhen.	https://apnews.com/article/china-knife-attack-yixing-stabbing-school-xu-1cb98b756a2d638f68c1a04bb477e192	2024-11-16T09:36:31-08:00	
Former Greek premier Samaras is expelled from the ruling conservative party	ATHENS, GREECE (AP) — Former Greek Prime Minister and lawmaker Antonis Samaras was expelled from the ruling New Democracy party over his persistent criticism of government policies. Samaras, 73, a hard-line nationalist, has criticized Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis’ approach to negotiations with Turkey, which he has likened to appeasement. He also strongly disapproved of government policy that he considered too 'centrist' or 'woke,' especially the decision to legislate in favor of same-sex marriage earlier this year. The government appeared particularly irked by a Samaras interview to be published in Sunday newspaper To Vima in which he called for the ouster of Foreign Minister George Gerapetritis over his conduct of negotiations with Turkey. 'Mr. Samaras ... did not just express opinions. He expressed his complete disagreement with all governing policies. Moreover, he adopted extreme lies (about the foreign minister) in an unbecoming and provocative manner,' said government spokesman Pavlos Marinakis in announcing Samaras’ expulsion Saturday afternoon. Samaras responded in a lengthy statement, saying, 'Arrogance and loss of nerve explain Mitsotakis' move. Cut off from the party base, he is leading a party that scarcely resembles New Democracy.' It is not the first time that Samaras has clashed with a Mitsotakis. In 1992, then-Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis, father of the current premier, dismissed Samaras as foreign minister over policy differences regarding the name dispute with what was then the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the present North Macedonia. In 1993, Samaras and a few like-minded lawmakers left New Democracy, bringing down the Mitsotakis government and ushering in more than 10 years of socialist rule. Samaras founded his own short-lived party, Political Spring. Samaras succeeded former Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis as head of the conservatives in 2009, but left the post after an electoral defeat in 2015. 'This time, history will not repeat itself. The government majority continues its course, without Mr. Samaras,' said the governent spokesman. 'No one has the right to mess with the country’s stability in these troubled times,' said Marinakis. The ruling conservatives have a slight majority in Parliament, with 155 lawmakers out of 300. But Samaras has a number of supporters among that group, as does the now retired Karamanlis. In the interview, Samaras proposed Karamanlis should replace President Katerina Sakellaropoulou, a left-of-center former judge whose five-year term ends in early 2025. She had been elected by Parliament with Mitsotakis' backing.	https://apnews.com/article/greece-samaras-mitsotakis-new-democracy-a134c64c80a7aa8f5e0c0e9b13c0e35f	2024-11-16T08:03:36-08:00	
Tropical Storm Sara drenches Honduras’ northern coast with flash flooding and mudslides in forecast	SAN PEDRO SULA, Honduras (AP) — Tropical Storm Sara stalled over Honduras on Saturday, drenching the northern coast of the Central American nation, swelling rivers and trapping some people at home. Sustained rain fell overnight and continued into the morning in the city of San Pedro Sula, where the storm cut off access to an entire community when a river crossing washed away. And through the weekend, the region could see life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides, according to the Miami-based National Hurricane Center. The weather system made landfall late Thursday about 105 miles (165 kilometers) west-northwest of Cabo Gracias a Dios, on the Honduras-Nicaragua border. The Hurricane Center expects the storm will move near the Bay Islands of Honduras on Saturday before approaching Belize. Sara is then expected to turn northwesterly toward Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula, though forecasters said it probably will not reemerge into the Gulf after crossing the Yucatan. Rain-soaked residents were on edge Saturday as the conditions brought back memories of the disastrous November 2020 hurricane season, when two powerful storms passed through the region, displacing hundreds of thousands of people and causing widespread damage. Standing on a riverbank, Carlos Canelas, 48, acknowledged many residents like his mother had ignored official warnings to evacuate the Flor de Cuba neighborhood of San Pedro Sula. By Saturday morning, the 77-year-old woman was cut off from the rest of the city because the river crossing collapsed and remained home with her 35-year-old special-needs son. 'That is why I did not go to work, but there is little or nothing I can do,' he said. 'I can cross the river swimming, but how do I get my mother out? The storm, however, did not stop a CONCACAF Nations League soccer match Friday in San Pedro Sula. Under heavy rain, Mexico lost 2-0 to Honduras. In November 2020, Eta and Iota passed through Honduras after initially making landfall in Nicaragua as powerful Category 4 hurricanes. Northern Honduras caught the worst of the storms with torrential rains that set off flooding that displaced hundreds of thousands. Eta alone was responsible for as much as 30 inches (76 cm) of rain along the northern coast. ___ Associated Press writer Regina Garcia Cano contributed to this report from Mexico City.	https://apnews.com/article/tropical-storm-sara-honduras-flooding-hurricane-belize-39901b2082d735751607cdd186afdf01	2024-11-16T06:45:08-08:00	
Israeli troops reach deepest point in Lebanon since Oct. 1 invasion, Lebanese media say	BEIRUT (AP) — Israeli ground forces reached their deepest point in Lebanon since they invaded six weeks ago, before pulling back early Saturday after fierce battles with Hezbollah militants, Lebanese state media reported. Israeli troops captured a strategic hill in the southern Lebanese village of Chamaa, about 5 kilometers (3 miles) from the Israeli border early Saturday, the state-run National News Agency reported. It said Israeli troops were later pushed back from the hill. It added that Israeli troops detonated the Shrine of Shimon the Prophet in Chamaa as well as several homes before they withdrew, but the claim could not be immediately verified. Israel's military said in a statement that its troops 'continue their limited, localized, and targeted operational activity in southern Lebanon.' The military did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the Lebanese media reports. The push on the ground came as Israeli warplanes pounded Beirut’s southern suburbs as well as several other areas in southern Lebanon including the port city of Tyre. The morning strike in Beirut hit an area known as Dahiyeh, which the Israeli military called a Hezbollah stronghold, saying its planes had hit multiple sites used by the militant group. Residents were given advance warning by Israel, and it was not immediately clear whether there were any casualties. The increase of violence came as Lebanese and Hezbollah officials are studying a draft proposal presented by the U.S. earlier this week on ending the war. Since late September, Israel dramatically escalated its bombardment of Lebanon, vowing to cripple Hezbollah and end its barrages in Israel. More than 3,400 people have been killed in Lebanon by Israeli fire — 80% of them in the eight weeks — according to Lebanon’s Health Ministry. On Friday, Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister apparently urged Iran to try and convince Hezbollah to agree to a cease-fire deal with Israel, which would require the group to pull back from the Israel-Lebanon border. The proposal is based on U.N. Security Council resolution 1701, which ended the last Israel-Hezbollah war in the summer of 2006. A copy of the draft proposal was handed over earlier this week by the U.S. ambassador to Lebanon to Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, who has been negotiating on behalf of Hezbollah, according to a Lebanese official. The official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak about the secret talks said Berri is expected to give Lebanon’s response on Monday. Another Lebanese politician said Hezbollah officials had received the draft, were studying it and would express their opinion on it to Berri. The politician also spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media about the ongoing talks. Berri told the pan-Arab Asharq Al-Awsat daily newspaper that the draft does not include any item that allows Israel to act in Lebanon if the deal is violated. 'We will not accept any infringement of our sovereignty,' Berri was quoted as saying. He added that one of the items mentioned in the draft that Lebanon does not accept is the proposal to form a committee to supervise the agreement that includes members from Western countries. Berri added that talks are ongoing regarding this point as well as other details in the draft, adding that 'the atmosphere is positive but all relies on how things will end.' There is also a push to end the war between Israel and Hamas, which began after Palestinian militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing about 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. The U.N. Security Council’s 10 elected members on Thursday circulated a draft resolution demanding 'an immediate, unconditional and permanent cease-fire' in Gaza. The U.S., Israel’s closest ally, holds the key to whether the U.N. Security Council adopts the resolution. The four other permanent members — Russia, China, Britain and France — are expected to support it or abstain. The Health Ministry in Gaza said Saturday that in the past 24 hours another 35 people had been killed in Israeli strikes, bringing the overall death total to 43,799. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but it has said more than half of those killed have been women and children. _____ Associated Press writer David Rising in Bangkok contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-iran-ceasefire-beirut-41d19e05cebf73a66dc320ccad047d4d	2024-11-16T03:06:32-08:00	
Georgia election chief doused in paint as protests continue after divisive parliamentary vote	TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — The head of Georgia’s Central Electoral Commission was doused with black paint Saturday at a meeting to confirm the results of the country’s divisive Oct. 26 parliamentary elections. Protesters gathered outside the commission's building in Tbilisi, where officials announced that the ruling Georgian Dream party had won 53.93% of the vote. Opposition supporters have rejected the results amid allegations that the vote was rigged, an accusation that Georgian Dream denies. The Saturday session was interrupted when David Kirtadze, a commission member from the opposition United National Movement party, threw black paint at commission chairman Giorgi Kalandarishvili. Before the incident, Kirtadze told Kalandarishvili that the official results of the vote did not reflect voters’ 'true choice.' Kalandarishvili responded by saying that the use of 'pressure, bullying and personal insults' proved that there was no evidence of vote rigging. When the meeting resumed, Kalandarishvili was seen with a bandaged eye. 'It once again becomes evident that there is no tangible proof indicating that the elections were manipulated,' he told the audience. European election observers have described the Georgian parliamentary elections as taking place in a 'divisive' atmosphere marked by instances of bribery, double voting and physical violence. Many Georgians viewed the vote as a pivotal referendum on the country’s effort to join the European Union. The bloc suspended Georgia’s membership application process indefinitely in June after the country’s parliament passed a 'foreign influence law' that critics say mimics Moscow’s crackdown on civil society. Critics have accused the ruling Georgian Dream, established by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia, of becoming increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow. It has recently adopted laws similar to those used by the Kremlin to crack down on freedom of speech and LGBTQ+ rights. President Salome Zourabichvili, who has rejected the official results, says Georgia has fallen victim to pressure from Moscow against joining the European Union. Zourabichvili, who holds a mostly ceremonial position, has urged the United States and EU to support the demonstrations. Officials in Washington and Brussels have urged a full investigation of the election, while the Kremlin has rejected the accusations of interference.	https://apnews.com/article/georgia-parlimentary-elections-protest-central-electoral-committee-paint-732670469f47bf9c541ca6bf3c9b7bf1	2024-11-16T02:36:14-08:00	
Some exult, others worry: Reactions to Trump's victory are mixed on NATO's eastern flank	WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Conservative lawmakers in the Polish parliament exulted at Donald Trump's victory, standing and applauding while they chanted his name. The prospect of a second Trump term has excited people on the populist right across Central Europe who share his anti-immigrant views and contempt for international organizations. But many others in a region near the war in Ukraine are afraid. They worry Trump could abandon Ukraine and force Kyiv into a deal that ends up emboldening Russia further, or unwind the U.S. military presence in Europe. The change in Washington means Europe will have to invest more in its security and defense rather than relying on the American protective shield as it has done for decades, argues Michał Baranowski, managing director of Warsaw-based GMF East, part of the German Marshall Fund think tank. 'We Europeans — Poles and French and Brits and preferably Germany as well — need to step up,' Baranowski said. 'Only by stepping up do we have a chance to keep the worst case scenarios from happening, both a bad deal in Ukraine and perhaps a lowering of U.S. engagement in Europe.' Poland, the Baltic states and other nations across Central and Eastern Europe were under Moscow's control during the Cold War. When that era ended in 1989, it freed them to turn to the West. They never want to return to being satellites of Moscow. NATO members now, they worry that Trump in his second term could end a decades-long commitment to securing the peace in Europe. Just this week, a missile defense base in northern Poland was inaugurated — the fruit of years of planning by Republican and Democratic administrations. Polish officials expressed hopes that it was a sign that a bipartisan U.S. commitment to the region would endure. 'The whole world will see clearly that this is not Russia’s sphere of interest anymore,' Polish President Andrzej Duda declared. Trump has a long history of denigrating NATO, and former administration officials say he repeatedly threatened to withdraw the U.S. from the alliance. His allies have described that as bluster or tough negotiating tactics that have pushed other European allies to take more responsibility, and argue that Trump didn't abandon NATO. The change in Washington has in just a few days changed the dynamic of Poland’s presidential campaign before an election next spring. Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski, a former defense minister with ties in Washington, entered the running to be the candidate for centrist Prime Minister Donald Tusk’s party, challenging the longtime favorite, Warsaw Mayor Rafał Trzaskowski. Sikorski argues that his experience makes him the better choice for the times. His opponents argue that the anti-Trump views of his wife, the American writer Anne Applebaum, could create complications with Trump’s upcoming administration. The region is now holding its collective breath to see what a second Trump presidency will bring. Officials in Poland and the Baltic states have been stressing their high defense spending — relative to their overall economic output — in their congratulatory messages to Trump. Kersti Kaljulaid, who was Estonia's president during Trump's first term, told the Estonian public broadcaster ERR that Estonians, Poles and others in Eastern Europe found ways to reach Trump before, 'and I think that this skill is something that we still have today.' All are now watching to see if Trump will make a deal with Russia to end the war in Ukraine, as he has promised. It is a cause of existential importance, because any deal is expected to shape security in the region in profound ways in the years and decades to come. The biggest fear would be a deal that gives Russia significant Ukrainian territory, rewarding President Vladimir Putin's violation of international law and allowing Moscow to rebuild its military strength. Poland's Tusk has stressed that no deal should be made over the heads of Ukraine and countries in the region that will be affected. 'There is no doubt that the new political landscape is a serious challenge for everyone,' Tusk said last week. Tusk congratulated Trump last week and is striking a conciliatory tone after having been critical in the past of a position seen by most Poles as overly friendly to Putin. Duda, a conservative who has long admired Trump, said Wednesday that he doesn't believe that Trump would abandon Ukraine after U.S. taxpayers have already invested huge amounts in Ukraine's defense. Trump is a 'winner,' Duda said. 'I cannot imagine that he would allow Russia to destroy Ukraine.' Trump's win energized Poles at an Independence Day march on Monday organized by nationalist groups that drew tens of thousands of participants. Some there believed Trump's friendly stance toward Russia could help end the war in Ukraine. 'If he’s pro-Russian and that means peace in the world, I think it’s OK,' said Adrian Golik, a 23-year-old university student who joined the march with his brother and parents. All have dual Polish-U.S. citizenship and cast their votes for Trump in Illinois. The leaders of Hungary and Slovakia — both seen as friendly to Trump and Putin — believe Ukraine has already lost the fight and shouldn't keep getting Western military aid. Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico, who although a leftist is known for his pro-Russian and anti-American views, welcomed Trump’s victory as 'a defeat of liberal and progressivist ideas.' Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has called Trump 'the man of peace,' and last week predicted that the incoming administration would cease U.S. support for Ukraine as it fights Russia’s full-scale invasion. 'One of the key messages of this election is that Europe needs to grow up geopolitically and do it quickly, and that the era of security outsourcing is over,' said Baranowski, the analyst. 'The stakes are very high — Europe can have influence if we pull it together and if we step up.' ___ Justin Spike in Budapest, Hungary, Jari Tanner in Helsinki, Finland, and Karel Janicek in Prague contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/us-trump-poland-russia-b39772e4ca42d84878dbf717b830e11b	2024-11-16T01:14:08-08:00	
Japan's minister visits Ukraine to stress mutual concern over North Korean troops	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Japan's foreign minister arrived in Kyiv on Saturday to discuss North Korea’s deepening military alliance with Russia, including the deployment of thousands of troops to support Moscow's war in Ukraine. Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya will meet his Ukrainian counterpart, Andrii Sybiha, to reaffirm Japan’s 'strong support' for Ukraine against Russia’s invasion and to discuss further sanctions against Moscow, Japan's Foreign Ministry said. High on the agenda was Tokyo’s 'grave concern' over growing military cooperation between North Korea and Russia, the ministry said. According to U.S., South Korean and Ukrainian intelligence assessments, up to 12,000 North Korean troops have been sent to Russia as part of a major defense treaty between the countries. Last week, Ukrainian officials said Ukraine and North Korean troops engaged in small-scale fighting while Ukraine’s army fired artillery at North Korean soldiers in Russia’s Kursk border region, where Ukraine launched a surprise push on Aug. 6. The agreement requires both countries to use all available means to provide immediate military assistance if either is attacked. Russia strikes Kyiv in a wave of drone attacks Iwaya’s visit comes after the Ukrainian capital was attacked overnight by Russian drones, damaging residential buildings and infrastructure in Kyiv’s Obolon district. No casualties were reported. Ukrainian air defenses neutralized up to a dozen drones, said the head of Kyiv’s military administration, Serhii Popko. Russia attacked Ukraine with 83 Shahed drones in the early hours of Saturday morning, the Ukrainian air force reported. Of those, 55 were shot down, while another 30 veered off course or were lost after electronic jamming, it said. Meanwhile, Russia’s Ministry of Defense said that it had destroyed 35 Ukrainian drones, including 20 over the western Kursk region and 11 over the Bryansk region. ___ Associated Press writers Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo and Katie Marie Davies in Manchester, England, contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-japan-drones-cc0940413955683f3ba5d80eaf4431fa	2024-11-16T01:04:45-08:00	
Protesters gather at UN climate talks in global day of action as progress on a deal slows	BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) — Hundreds of activists formed a human chain outside one of the main plenary halls at the United Nations climate summit on what is traditionally their biggest protest day during the two-week talks. The demonstration in Baku, Azerbaijan will be echoed at sites around the world in a global 'day of action' for climate justice that's become an annual event. Activists waved flags, snapped their fingers, and hummed and mumbled chants in a silent protest, with many covering their mouths with the word 'Silenced.' Demonstrators held up signs calling for more money to be pledged for climate finance, which involves cash for transitioning to clean energy and adapting to climate change. It comes as negotiators at the venue try to hammer out a deal for exactly that — but progress has been slow and observers say the direction of any agreement is still unclear. Tired but inspired, activists vow to ‘keep fighting’ Lidy Nacpil said protestors like her are 'not surprised' about how negotiations are going. But past wins — like a loss and damage fund that gives developing nations cash after extreme weather events exacerbated by climate change — keep organizers going, said Nacpil, a coordinator with the Asian Peoples’ Movement on Debt and Development. 'The role we play is to increase the pressure,' she said of the action. 'We know we’re not going to get the results that the world needs in this round of negotiations, but at least to bring us many steps closer is our hope, is our aim.' She added: 'I think we have no option but to keep fighting ... It’s the instinctive response that anyone, any living being, living creatures will have, which is to fight for life and fight for survival.' Tasneem Essop said she was inspired by the action, which was challenging to organize. 'To be able to pull off something where people feel their own power, exercise their own power and get inspired in this creative way, I’m super excited about this,' she said. Essop says she’s 'not very' optimistic about an outcome on finance, but knows next week will be pivotal. 'We can’t end up with a bad deal for the peoples of the world, those who are already suffering the impacts of climate change, those who need to adapt to an increasing and escalating crisis,' she said. 'We fight until the end.' On a deal for climate cash, there's not much progress Negotiators at COP29, as the talks are known, are working on a deal that might be worth hundreds of billions of dollars to poorer nations. Many are in the Global South and already suffering the costly impacts of weather disasters fueled by climate change. Several experts have said $1 trillion a year or more is needed both to compensate for such damages and to pay for a clean-energy transition that most countries can't afford on their own. Samir Bejanov, deputy lead negotiator of this year's climate talks said in a press conference that the climate finance talks were moving too slowly. 'I want to repeat our strong encouragement to all parties to make as much progress as possible,' he said. 'We need everyone to approach the task with urgency and determination.' Observers were also disappointed at the pace of progress. 'This has been the worst first week of a COP in my 15 years of attending this summit,' said Mohamed Adow, of climate think tank Power Shift Africa. 'There’s no clarity on the climate finance goal, the quality of the finance or how it’s going to be made accessible to vulnerable countries.' 'I sense a lot of frustration, especially among the developing country blocks here,' he said. Panama environment minister Juan Carlos Navarro agreed, telling The Associated Press he is 'not encouraged' by what he’s seeing at COP29 so far. 'What I see is a lot of talk and very little action,' he said, noting that Panama is among the group of countries least responsible for warming emissions but most vulnerable to the damage caused by climate change-fueled disasters. 'We must face these challenges with a true sense of urgency and sincerity,' he said. 'We are dragging our feet as a planet.' ___ Associated Press writer Dorany Pineda in Los Angeles contributed. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

The family of Israeli-American hostage pleads with Biden and Trump to bring hostages home	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Over the past two weeks, the political landscape around the negotiations for a cease-fire in Gaza have undergone a dramatic transformation. The American elections, the firing of Israel’s popular defense minister, Qatar’s decision to suspend its mediation, and the ongoing war in Lebanon all seem to have pushed the possibility for a cease-fire in Gaza further away than it has been in more than a year of conflict. Still, some families of the dozens of hostages who remain captive in Gaza are desperately hoping the changes will reignite momentum to bring their loved ones home — though the impact of Donald Trump returning to the White House and a hard-line new defense minister in Israel remains unknown. 'I think maybe there is new hope,' said Varda Ben Baruch, the grandmother of Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander, 20, a soldier kidnapped from his base on the Gaza border during the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, 2023. Alexander’s parents, Adi and Yael Alexander, who live in New Jersey, met this week with Trump and President Joe Biden in Washington and pleaded with them to work together to bring all the hostages home in a single deal. 'As a grandmother, I say, cooperate — Trump wants peace in this region, Biden has always said he wants to release the hostages, so work together and do something important for the lives of human beings,' Ben Baruch said. She said neither leader offered specific details or plans for releasing the hostages or restarting negotiations for a Gaza cease-fire. Talks have hit a wall in recent months, largely over Hamas' demands for guarantees that a full hostage release will bring an end to Israel’s campaign in Gaza and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s vows to continue fighting until Hamas is crushed and unable to rearm. 'We’re not involved in politics, not American and not Israeli, the families are above politics, we just want our loved ones home,' she said. 'Edan was kidnapped because he was Jewish, not because he voted for a certain party.' More than 250 people were kidnapped and 1,200 killed when Hamas militants burst across the border and carried out a bloody attack on southern Israeli communities. Israel’s campaign of retaliation since has killed more than 43,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, and some 90% of its 2.3 million people have been displaced. As militants attacked on the morning of Oct. 7, Edan Alexander, then 19, was able to send a quick message to his mother amid the intense fighting around his base. He told her that despite having shrapnel embedded in his helmet from the explosions, he had managed to get to a protected area. After 7 a.m., his family lost contact. Alexander was considered missing as the family desperately searched hospitals for him. After five days, friends recognized him in a video of Hamas militants capturing soldiers. The family was happy: He was alive, Ben Baruch said. 'But we didn’t understand what we were entering into, what is still happening now.' When a week-long cease-fire last November brought the release of 105 hostages in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners, some of the freed hostages said they had seen Alexander in captivity. Ben Baruch said they told her Alexander kept his cool, encouraging them that everyone would be released soon. Ben Baruch said she was disheartened when Netanyahu last week fired Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, who she said had consistently reassured the families that the hostages were at the top of his agenda. 'I felt he was a partner,' she said. Gallant was replaced by a Netanyahu loyalist who has urged a tough line against Hamas. A mass protest movement urging the government to reach a hostage deal has shown signs of weariness, and hostage families have struggled to keep their campaign in the headlines. A delegation of former hostages and their relatives met with the pope on Thursday and expressed hope the incoming and outgoing American administrations would bring their loved ones home. In Tel Aviv’s Hostage Square, the headquarters of the protest movement, opinions were mixed on the effect of Trump’s election on hostages. 'I don’t think this is good for Israel or the hostages, I’m really scared of him,' said David Danino, a 45-year-old hi-tech worker from Tel Aviv. He was at Hostages Square with his family, visiting from France, who wanted to pay their respects. Danino noted that Israel had already achieved many of its war goals, including killing Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. 'They are building us a photo of what is ‘victory,’ but how is there victory without the hostages?' he asked. Others thought Trump’s reputation might help the situation. 'When he decides to do something, he does it, without blinking, and he can create ultimatums,' said Orly Vitman, a 54-year-old former special education teacher from the Tel Aviv suburb of Holon. She comes every few months to the square with her daughter to light candles in honor of the hostages. While she was opposed to the firing of Gallant in the middle of the war, she was heartened by Trump’s election. 'We will have the legitimacy and ability to use the full force of what we know how to do,' she said. Ben Baruch, a philanthropist and accomplished artist whose modernist sculptures dot the Tel Aviv home where she has lived for 52 years, said she has pushed everything aside in her life to focus on the struggle to bring her grandson home. Her days are filled with meetings, interviews, rallies, protests and communal prayer sessions uniting different groups of Israelis from across the religious spectrum. 'It’s like people’s lives went back to their routine, but ours did not,' she said. 'There’s nothing left to say. All the words have been said. We have heard everything. We have met with everyone. But they are still there.'	https://apnews.com/article/israel-gaza-hamas-war-hostages-trump-biden-7e3cd6a6f0b9cd70cced92225a31e66c	2024-11-15T20:45:40-08:00

Colombia’s government is eager for a post-fossil fuels economy. But costs are a barrier	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — Colombia's fiery left-wing President Gustavo Petro is one of the biggest opponents of fossil fuels on the world stage today, with speeches that lump oil and coal with cocaine as his country's 'three poisons.' He's set a goal of weaning Colombia off those fossil fuels, putting the green energy transition and environmental protection at the center of his agenda. His opposition is long-held, but it's also practical. Colombia's oil reserves are projected to last only about seven years, and without new discoveries, the country will eventually have to find a way forward without the oil and coal that make up more than half its exports. But doing so will require overcoming the same challenges that many smaller nations face with the energy transition: higher borrowing costs that more developed nations face, Environment Minister Susana Muhamad said. Muhamad has been highlighting Colombia's challenge at the United Nations climate talks in Azerbaijan, where the major goal of this year's talks known as COP29 is establishing just how much wealthy nations will contribute to the developing world to cope with climate change and transform their energy systems. At a press conference on the sidelines of the climate talks Saturday, Muhamad said the world 'cannot continue to play with the same financial rules that leave developing countries behind.' Muhamad also touted her country's support for a non-proliferation treaty for fossil fuels. The treaty, modeled on others like a non-nuclear proliferation treaty, is aimed at ending the expansion of new coal, oil and gas projects, and manage a global transition away from fossil fuels. 'Oil is not a gift from god,' Muhamad told The Associated Press on the sidelines of COP29, referring to a comment made by Azerbaijan’s president Ilham Aliyev earlier in the talks. 'It’s a trap. We need to untangle ourselves from that.' 'We’re trying to look for a path that actually helps us to be more resilient, be more competitive in a new era of economics where climate and people are at the center, so we can create a different economy,' she said. 'But we are not finding a positive response towards this path.' Developing economies face higher costs for renewable energy and sustainable projects due in part to perceived risks for investors, according to the World Economic Forum, which says significant international investment is necessary for the energy transition. Muhamad said, like many developing nations, Colombia faces 'unfair conditions' in accessing capital. Petro, a former guerrilla with the M-19 Marxist group in his youth, is a longstanding critic of what he calls the 'greedy' extractive sector. He has stopped approval of new oil drilling contracts, has banned fracking and pushed through some of the first offshore wind power projects in Latin America since taking office in 2022. But his mission to leave fossil fuels behind has faced criticism. Tomas Gonzalez, a former Colombia energy minister from the Conservative Party who now directs the Bogota-based Regional Center for Energy Studies, called Petro's approach 'very radical'. 'As long as there is demand someone will meet it, so restricting Colombian production doesn’t reduce emissions globally,' Gonzalez said. 'But for Colombia, it means major sacrifices in fiscal revenue and funding for public spending.' Oil and coal are key to Colombia’s national revenue, according to government data, accounting for about 8% of GDP and over 50% of its exports. It's the world's sixth-largest exporter of coal, according to the national mining agency, and a top-20 exporter of crude. But its oil reserves are considered small, at around seven years, according to the country’s oil regulator, ANH. 'We don't have huge reserves,' Muhamad said. 'We are not like other countries which could have 200 years of oil under the soil. So as the world decarbonizes, our markets will be closing and we need a replacement.' Colombia may have more oil and gas, but Petro’s administration has stopped issuing new oil and gas exploration contracts. Gonzalez called that 'the opposite direction of what we need.' Colombia launched a new investment portfolio at the end of September for its climate adaptation plans, which it hopes will attract around $40 billion to help fund ecotourism, a fair energy transition and conservation and restoration of ecosystems. 'Colombia is doing the right thing in a way by saying we need to move away from fossil fuels,' said Bill Hare, a climate scientist and chief executive of Climate Analytics, a science and policy group that supports action on climate change. 'They’re doing it for a combination of different reasons, some of them economic, some basically completely moral and oriented around the climate crisis. What is really bad that’s happening is that they’re not being backed up by the international financial community.' Hare said the whole ecosystem of the international financial community is not backing Colombia up. 'They’re going with the fossil fuel industry. So Colombia is facing a downgrade economically because of that,' he said. 'It will need backing. It may not be hard cash, but it could be debt guarantees. It can be all sorts of things like that that ultimately don’t cost a lot that make all the difference.' For Gonzalez, when it comes to the energy transition, there are serious gaps between the ambitions Petro has set and the policies in place. 'Colombia needs to expand its clean energy supply and improve energy efficiency at a scale and speed far greater than what we’re currently achieving,' he said. 'When you want to be a global leader the disconnect between goals and policy actions in this area remains a major challenge.' ___ Arasu reported from Baku, Azerbaijan.

They fled war in Sudan. Now, women in refugee camps say they’re being forced to have sex to survive	ADRE, Chad (AP) — Crossing into Chad, the 27-year-old thought she'd left the horrors of Sudan's war behind: the bodies she ran over while fleeing, the screams of girls being raped, the disappearance of her husband when gunmen attacked. But now she says she has faced more suffering — being forced as a refugee to have sex to get by. She cradled her 7-week-old son, who she asserted was the child of an aid worker who promised her money in exchange for sex. 'The children were crying. We ran out of food,' she said of her four other children. 'He abused my situation.' She and other women who spoke to The Associated Press requested anonymity because they feared retribution. Some Sudanese women and girls assert that men, including those meant to protect them such as humanitarian workers and local security forces, have sexually exploited them in Chad's displacement sites, offering money, easier access to assistance and jobs. Such sexual exploitation in Chad is a crime. Hundreds of thousands of people, most of them women, have streamed into Chad to escape Sudan's civil war, which has killed over 20,000 people. Aid groups struggle to support them in growing displacement sites. Three women spoke with the AP in the town of Adre near the Sudanese border. A Sudanese psychologist shared the accounts of seven other women and girls who either refused to speak directly with a reporter or were no longer in touch with her. The AP could not confirm their accounts. Daral-Salam Omar, the psychologist, said all the seven told her they went along with the offers of benefits in exchange for sex out of necessity. Some sought her help because they became pregnant and couldn't seek an abortion at a clinic for fear of being shunned by their community, she said. 'They were psychologically destroyed. Imagine a woman getting pregnant without a husband amid this situation,' Omar said. Sexual exploitation during large humanitarian crises is not uncommon, especially in displacement sites. Aid groups have long struggled to combat the issue. They cite a lack of reporting by women, not enough funds to respond and a focus on first providing basic necessities. The U.N. refugee agency said it doesn't publish data on cases, citing the confidentiality and safety of victims. People seeking protection should never have to make choices driven by survival, experts said. Nidhi Kapur, who works on preventing sexual exploitation and abuse in emergency contexts, said exploitation represents a deep failure by the aid community. Yewande Odia, the United Nations Population’s Fund representative in Chad, said sexual exploitation is a serious violation. U.N. agencies said displacement camps have 'safe spaces' where women can gather, along with awareness sessions, a free hotline and feedback boxes to report abuse anonymously. Yet many of the Sudanese women said they weren’t aware of the hotline, and some said using the boxes would draw unwanted attention. The Sudanese woman with the newborn said she was afraid to report the aid worker for fear he'd turn her in to police. She said she approached the aid worker, a Sudanese man, after searching for jobs to buy basic necessities like soap. She asked him for money. He said he'd give her cash but only in exchange for sex. They slept together for months, she said, and he paid the equivalent of about $12 each time. After she had the baby, he gave her a one-time payment of approximately $65 but denied it was his, she said. The man was a Sudanese laborer for Doctors Without Borders, known by its French acronym MSF, she said. Two other Sudanese women said Chadian men working at MSF sites— one wearing MSF clothing — solicited them after they applied for work with the organization. The men took their phone numbers and repeatedly called, saying they'd give them jobs for sex. Both women said they refused. Christopher Lockyear, MSF's secretary general, said the organization was not aware of the allegations and wanted to investigate. 'Asking for money or sex in exchange for access to care or a job is a clear violation of our behavioral commitments,' he said. MSF would not say how many such cases had been reported among Sudanese refugees in Chad. Last year, out of 714 complaints made about MSF staff behavior where it works globally, 264 were confirmed to be cases of abuse or inappropriate behavior including sexual exploitation, abuse of power and bullying, Lockyear said. Lockyear said MSF is creating a pool of investigators at the global level to enhance its ability to pursue allegations. One woman told the AP that a man with another aid group also exploited her, but she was unable to identify the organization. Omar, the psychologist, said several of the women told her they were exploited by aid workers, local and international. She gave no evidence to back up the claims. Another woman, one of the two who alleged they were approached after seeking work with MSF, said she also refused a local policeman who approached her and promised an extra food ration card if she went to his house. Ali Mahamat Sebey, the head official for Adre, said police are not allowed inside the camps and asserted that allegations against them of exploitation were false. With the growing influx of people, however, it's hard to protect everyone, he said. The women said they just want to feel safe, adding that access to jobs would lessen their vulnerability. After most of her family was killed or abducted in Sudan's Darfur region last year, one 19-year-old sought refuge in Chad. She didn't have enough money to support the nieces and nephews in her care. She got a job at a restaurant in the camp but when she asked her Sudanese boss for a raise, he agreed on the condition of sex. The money he paid was more than six times her salary. But when she got pregnant with his child, the man fled, she asserted. She rubbed her growing belly. 'If we had enough, we wouldn’t have to go out and lose our dignity,' she said. ___ The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

In the polar bear capital of the world, a community lives with the predator next door and loves it	CHURCHILL, Manitoba (AP) — Sgt. Ian Van Nest rolls slowly through the streets of Churchill, his truck outfitted with a rifle and a barred back seat to hold anyone he has to arrest. His eyes dart back and forth, then settle on a crowd of people standing outside a van. He scans the area for safety and then quietly addresses the group's leader, unsure of the man's weapons. 'How are you today?' Van Nest asks. The leader responds with a wary, 'We OK for you here?' 'You’re good. You got a lot of distance there. When you have people disembarking from the vehicle you should have a bear monitor,' Van Nest, a conservation officer for the province of Manitoba, cautions as the tourists gaze at a polar bear on the rocks. 'So, if that’s you, just have your shotgun with you, right? Slugs and cracker shells if you have or a scare pistol.' It's the beginning of polar bear season in Churchill, a tiny town on a spit of land jutting into Hudson Bay, and keeping tourists safe from hungry and sometimes fierce bears is an essential job for Van Nest and many others. And it's become harder as climate change shrinks the Arctic sea ice the bears depend on to hunt, forcing them to prowl inland earlier and more often in search of food, according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, a group of scientists that tracks how endangered species are. 'You're seeing more bears because there are more bears on the land for longer periods of time to be seen' and they are willing to take more risks, getting closer to people, said Polar Bears International research and policy director Geoff York. There are about 600 polar bears in this Western Hudson Bay population, about half what it was 40 years ago, but that's still close to one bear for every resident of Churchill. Yet this remote town not only lives with the predator next door, but depends upon and even loves it. Visitors eager to see polar bears saved the town from shrinking out of existence when a military base closed in the 1970s, dropping the population from a few thousand to about 870. A 2011 government study calculated that the average polar bear tourist spends about $5,000 a visit, pumping more than $7 million into a tiny town that boasts fancy restaurants and more than two dozen small places to stay amid dirt roads and no stoplights. 'We’re obviously used to bears so (when you see one) you don’t start to tremble,' Mayor Mike Spence said. 'It’s their area too. It’s important how the community coexists with bears and wildlife in general to really get along. We’re all connected.' It's been more than a decade since a bear mauled two people in an alley late on Halloween night before a third person scared off the animal. 'It was the scariest thing that's ever happened in my life,' said Erin Greene, who along with a 72-year-old man who tried to fight off the bear with a shovel survived their injuries. Greene, who had come to Churchill the year before for a job in the tourist trade, said it was the other animals of Churchill — the beluga whales that she sings to as she runs paddleboat tours and her dozen rescued retired sled dogs — that helped her recover from the trauma. There have been no attacks since then, but the town is watchful. At Halloween, trick-or-treating occurs when bears are hungriest, and dozens of volunteers line the streets to keep trouble at bay. Any time of year, troublesome bears that wander into town too often may be put into the polar bear jail — a big Quonset hut-style structure with 28 concrete-and-steel cells — before being returned to the wild. The building doesn't fill up, but it can get busy enough to be noisy from banging and growling inside, Van Nest said. Residents show polar bear pride in a way that mixes terror and fun, kind of like a rollercoaster. 'You know we're the polar bear capital of the world, right? We have the product, it's just about getting out there to see the bears safely,' said Dave Daley, who owns a gift shop, runs dog sleds and talks up the city like the former Chamber of Commerce president he is. 'I always tell tourists or whatever ‘You know what, they’re the T. rex like, of the dinosaur era. They're the Lords of the Arctic. They'll eat you.' Usually they don't. The military base's rocket launch site seemed to keep bears away, and when it closed in the 1970s, they came around more, longtime residents said. So Churchill and province officials 'put together a polar bear alert program to make sure the community members were looked after, protected,' said Spence, mayor since 1995. The town's old curfew siren blares nightly at 10 p.m., suggesting to people that it's time to go home for safety from bears. But on this Saturday night, three different bonfire parties are going on at the town beach — a spot next to the school, library and hospital that is a particular hot spot for bears coming inland. Yet no one is leaving. Then a truck shows up, and a lone figure — one of government's paid guards — gets out, armed with a shotgun. He walks out on the dunes about 100 yards from the parties and scans the horizon for polar bears. The guards are expected to scare any bears away with warning shots, flares, bear spray or noise — not kill them. 'It's just everybody watches out for everybody,' Spence said. 'So it's just, it's just normal. It kicks into gear as a community that lives alongside polar bears, you're always accustomed to coming out of your house and you look like this and you look ahead. And that's just in your DNA now.' Georgina Berg recalls growing up in the 1970s outside of Churchill, where many First Nations people lived, and how differently her father and mother reacted to a bear sighting. Her father, she said, would see a bear poking in garbage and just walk on by. 'He said, ‘If you don’t bother them, then they won’t bother you’,' she recalled. When a bear came near in later years, after her father had died, her mom was scared. 'Everything was like pandemonium. Everybody was yelling, and all the kids had to come in and everybody had to go home. And then we stayed silent in the house for a long time until we knew for sure that bear was gone, ' Berg recalled. For Van Nest, the provincial officer, the group he came upon that day was plenty safe from a bear about 300 yards (meters) away. He said the bear was 'putting on a bit of a show' for the tourists. 'This is a great situation to be in,' he said.

Investigation reveals a Russian factory's plan to mix decoys with a new deadly weapon in Ukraine	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A high-tech factory in central Russia has created a new, deadly force to attack Ukraine: a small number of highly destructive thermobaric drones surrounded by huge swarms of cheap foam decoys. The plan, which Russia dubbed Operation False Target, is intended to force Ukraine to expend scarce resources to save lives and preserve critical infrastructure, including by using expensive air defense munitions, according to a person familiar with Russia’s production and a Ukrainian electronics expert who hunts them from his specially outfitted van. Neither radar, sharpshooters nor even electronics experts can tell which drones are deadly in the skies. Here's what to know from AP's investigation: A deadly mix Unarmed decoys now make up more than half the drones targeting Ukraine and as much as 75% of the new drones coming out of the factory in Russia’s Alabuga Special Economic Zone, according to the person familiar with Russia’s production, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the industry is highly sensitive, and the Ukrainian electronics expert. The same factory produces a particularly deadly variant of the Shahed unmanned aircraft armed with thermobaric warheads, the person said. During the first weekend of November, the Kyiv region spent 20 hours under air alert, and the sound of buzzing drones mingled with the boom of air defenses and rifle shots. In October, Moscow attacked with at least 1,889 drones – 80% more than in August, according to an AP analysis tracking the drones for months. On Saturday, Russia launched 145 drones across Ukraine, just days after the re-election of Donald Trump threw into doubt U.S. support for the country. Since summer, most drones crash, are shot down or are diverted by electronic jamming, according to an AP analysis of the Ukrainian military briefings. Less than 6% hit a discernible target, according to the data analyzed by AP since the end of July. But the sheer numbers mean a handful can slip through every day – and that is enough to be deadly. The drone lab Tatarstan’s Alabuga zone, an industrial complex about 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) east of Moscow, is a laboratory for Russian drone production. Originally set up in 2006 to attract businesses and investment to Tatarstan, it expanded after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine and some sectors switched to military production, adding new buildings and renovating existing sites, according to satellite images analyzed by The Associated Press. In social media videos, the factory promoted itself as an innovation hub. But David Albright of the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security said Alabuga’s current purpose is purely to produce and sell drones to Russia‘s Ministry of Defense. The videos and other promotional media were taken down after an AP investigation found that many of the African women recruited to fill labor shortages there complained they were duped into taking jobs at the plant. Russia and Iran signed a $1.7 billion deal for the Shaheds in 2022, after President Vladimir Putin invaded neighboring Ukraine, and Moscow began using Iranian imports of the unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs, in battle later that year. Soon after the deal was signed, production started in Alabuga. The most fearsome Shahed adaptation so far designed at the plant is armed with thermobarics, also known as vacuum bombs, the person with knowledge of Russian drone production said. The plan to develop unarmed decoy drones at Alabuga was developed in late 2022, according to the person with knowledge of Russian drone production. Production of the decoys started earlier this year, said the person, who agreed to speak only on condition of anonymity. Now the plant turns out about 40 of the unarmed drones a day and around 10 armed ones, which are more expensive and take longer to produce. The vacuum bomb From a military point of view, thermobarics are ideal for going after targets that are either inside fortified buildings or deep underground. They create a vortex of high pressure and heat that penetrates the thickest walls and, at the same time, sucks out all the oxygen in their path. Alabuga’s thermobaric drones are particularly destructive when they strike buildings, because they are also loaded with ball bearings to cause maximum damage even beyond the superheated blast. Serhii Beskrestnov, a Ukrainian electronics expert and more widely known as Flash whose black military van is kitted out with electronic jammers to down drones, said the thermobarics were first used over the summer and estimated they now make up between 3% and 5% of all drones. They have a fearsome reputation because of the physical effects even on people caught outside the initial blast site: Collapsed lungs, crushed eyeballs, brain damage, according to Arthur van Coller, an expert in international humanitarian law at South Africa’s University of Fort Hare. For Russia, the benefits are huge. An unarmed drone costs considerably less than the estimated $50,000 for an armed Shahed drone and a tiny fraction of the cost of even a relatively inexpensive air defense missile. One decoy with a live-feed camera allows the aircraft to geolocate Ukraine’s air defenses and relay the information to Russia in the final moments of its mechanical life. And the swarms have become a demoralizing fact of life for Ukrainians. ___ Burrows reported from Washington D.C.	https://apnews.com/article/russian-ukraine-war-drones-factory-279cce33ab035de6c18635c5159f91cf	2024-11-15T20:12:13-08:00	
Operation False Target: How Russia plotted to mix a deadly new weapon among decoy drones in Ukraine	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — At a secretive factory in Russia's central grasslands, engineers are manufacturing hundreds of decoy drones meant to overwhelm Ukrainian defenses as they try to protect against a horrific new weapon, an Associated Press investigation has found. The plant at Russia’s Alabuga Special Economic Zone recently started churning out thermobaric drones alongside the decoys, the investigation found. The thermobaric warheads create a vortex of high pressure and heat that can penetrate thick walls. They suck out all the oxygen in their path, and have a fearsome reputation because of the injuries inflicted even outside the initial blast site: Collapsed lungs, crushed eyeballs, brain damage. Russia came up with the plan for decoys in late 2022 and codenamed it Operation False Target, according to a person familiar with Russia’s drone production who spoke on condition of anonymity because the industry is highly sensitive. The idea was to launch armed drones along with dozens of decoys, sometimes stuffed with rags or foam, and indistinguishable on radar from those carrying real bombs. Ukrainian forces must make split-second decisions about how to expend scarce resources to save lives and preserve critical infrastructure. 'The idea was to make a drone which would create a feeling of complete uncertainty for the enemy. So he doesn’t know whether it’s really a deadly weapon ... or essentially a foam toy,' the person said. With the thermobarics, there is now a 'huge risk' an armed drone could deviate from its course and end up in a residential area where the 'damage will be simply terrifying,' he said. Russia's drone factory In recent weeks, decoys have filled Ukraine’s skies by the dozens, each one appearing as an indistinguishable blip on military radar screens. During the first weekend of November, the Kyiv region spent 20 hours under air alert, and the sound of buzzing drones mingled with the boom of air defenses and rifle shots. Unarmed decoys now make up more than half the drones targeting Ukraine, according to the person and Serhii Beskrestnov, a Ukrainian electronics expert whose black military van is kitted out with electronic jammers to down drones. Both the unarmed decoys and the armed Iranian-designed Shahed drones are being built at a factory in Russia’s Alabuga Special Economic Zone, an industrial complex set up in 2006 about 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) east of Moscow to attract businesses and investment to Tatarstan. It expanded after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine and some sectors switched to military production, adding new buildings and renovating existing sites, according to satellite images analyzed by The Associated Press. In social media videos, the factory promotes itself as an innovation hub. But David Albright of the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security said Alabuga’s current purpose is purely to produce and sell drones to Russia‘s Ministry of Defense. The videos and other promotional media were taken down after an AP investigation found that many of the African women recruited to fill labor shortages there complained they were duped into taking jobs at the plant. Russia and Iran signed a $1.7 billion deal for the Shaheds in 2022, after President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, and Moscow began using Iranian imports of the unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs, in battle later that year.

Since summer, most drones crash, are shot down or are diverted by electronic jamming, according to an AP analysis of Ukrainian military briefings. Less than 6% hit a discernible target, according to the data analyzed by AP since the end of July. But the sheer numbers mean a handful can slip through every day – and that is enough to be deadly. Daily drone swarms The swarms have become a demoralizing fact of life for Ukrainians. Russian drone tactics continue to evolve. Now, more powerful missiles often follow close behind as air defenses are exhausted by the drones. The most destructive are the ballistic and cruise missiles that fly many times faster than the drones, which buzz loudly and can be tracked by the naked eye. Even the decoys can be useful to Russia. One decoy with a live-feed camera allows the aircraft to geolocate Ukraine’s air defenses and relay the information to Russia in the final moments of its mechanical life. Night after night, Ukrainian sharpshooters spring into action to down the drones with portable surface-to-air missiles. One sharpshooter, who like most Ukrainian soldiers asked to be identified by his call-sign Rosmaryn, said he’s shot down perhaps a dozen drones in all over nearly two years and saw one that was stuffed with rags and foam. Rosmaryn sees his adversary in almost human terms, describing the aircraft’s quest to outwit his small unit. 'It was part of a swarm, flying as one of the last ones,' he said. 'When it’s in the sky, we can’t tell what kind it is, because everything is inside the drone. We only find out after it’s shot down.' Many fly at 2,000 to 3,000 meters (6,500 feet to around 10,000 feet) before dropping to lower altitudes on their final approach, Rosmaryn said. Leaked videos suggest Ukraine is now using helicopters to shoot down the high-altitude drones. Three decoys of Russian origin have crashed in Moldova in the past week, authorities there said. Thanks to optical trickery, radar can’t distinguish a drone armed with a Shahed’s usual 50-kilogram payload of explosives or with a thermobaric weapon – also known as a vacuum bomb – from those without a warhead or topped with live-feed surveillance cameras. There are also other even rougher-quality drones, armed and unarmed, but in fewer quantities than the Shahed-style unmanned aircraft. That’s why, even knowing that decoys now make up most of an incoming swarm, Ukraine can’t afford to let anything through. 'For us, it’s just a point on the radar … It has speed, direction, and altitude,' said Col. Yurii Ihnat, an Air Force spokesman. 'We have no way of identifying the exact target during flight, so we have to either jam them with electronic warfare or use firepower to neutralize them. The enemy uses these to scatter our attention.' The engines and electronics for the armed Shaheds and decoys are a mix of Chinese and Western imports, according to fragments seen by The Associated Press at a Ukrainian military lab. Without them, the drones can’t fly. Despite nearly three years of sanctions, Moscow can still source the parts – largely from China and via third countries in Central Asia and the Middle East. Halfway through the series of air alerts on Nov. 2, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the swarms of Shaheds, which he put at 2,000 for the month of October alone, were made possible by Western technology slipping through sanctions. 'Included in this many Shaheds are more than 170,000 components that should have been blocked for delivery to Russia. Microcircuits, microcontrollers, processors, many different parts, without which this terror would simply be impossible,' Zelenskyy said. The joint manufacturing of the drones — some to carry bombs, others to divert attention — is saving Russia's military money. Production of the decoys started earlier this year and now the plant turns out about 40 of the cheaper unarmed drones a day and around 10 armed ones, which cost an estimated $50,000 and take longer to produce, according to the person with knowledge of Russian drone production. The Russian news outlet Izvestia in late October said the aim of the decoy is to 'weaken' the enemy by forcing it to waste ammunition before sending in armed Shaheds. Both Beskrestnov and the person familiar with Russian drone production said engineers at Alabuga are also constantly experimenting, putting Moscow at the cutting edge of drone production. To make electronic interference harder, they add Ukrainian SIM cards, roaming SIMS, Starlinks, fiberoptics – and can sometimes receive real-time feedback before the drones are jammed, downed or run out of fuel. Sometimes they attach a silver-painted foam ball to make the drone seem larger on a radar. But the latest thermobaric variant is causing new anguish in Ukraine. Thermobaric fears From a military point of view, thermobarics are ideal for going after targets that are either inside fortified buildings or deep underground. Alabuga’s thermobaric drones are particularly destructive when they strike buildings, because they are also loaded with ball bearings to cause maximum damage even beyond the superheated blast, said Albright. Beskrestnov, who is more widely known as Flash and whose black military van is kitted out with electronic jammers to down drones, said the thermobarics were first used over the summer and estimated they now make up between 3% and 5% of all drones. 'This type of warhead has the possibility to destroy a huge building, especially block flats. And it’s very effective if the Russian Federation tries to attack our power plants,' he said. They have a fearsome reputation because of the physical effects even on people caught outside the initial blast site, said Arthur van Coller, an expert in international humanitarian law at South Africa’s University of Fort Hare. 'With a thermobaric explosion, because of the cloud it would create, everything in its radius would be affected,' he said. 'It creates massive fear in the civilian population. Thermobaric weapons have created this idea that they are really horrible weapons and that creates fear.' ___ Burrows reported from Washington D.C.

In final talks, Biden to press China's Xi on North Korea's ties with Russia	LIMA, Peru (AP) — President Joe Biden is expected to use his final meeting with China's leader, Xi Jinping, to urge him to dissuade North Korea from further deepening its support for Russia's war on Ukraine. Saturday's talks on the sidelines of the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Peru come just over two months before Biden leaves office and makes way for Republican President-elect Donald Trump. It will be Biden's last check-in with Xi — someone the Democrat saw as his most consequential peer on the world stage. With the final meeting, officials say Biden will be looking for Xi to step up Chinese engagement to prevent an already dangerous moment with North Korea from further escalating. Biden on Friday, along with South Korean President Yoon Seok Yul and Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, condemned North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's decision to send thousands of troops to help Moscow repel Ukrainian forces who have seized territory in Russia's Kursk border region. Biden called it 'dangerous and destabilizing cooperation.' White House officials also have expressed frustration with Beijing, which accounts for the vast majority of North Korea's trade, for not doing more to rein in Pyongyang. Biden, Yoon and Ishiba spent most of their 50-minute discussion focused on the issue, agreeing it 'should not be in Beijing’s interest to have this destabilizing cooperation in the region,' according to a senior administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss their private conversations. The North Koreans also have provided Russia with artillery and other munitions, according to U.S. and South Korean intelligence officials. And the U.S., Japan and South Korea have expressed alarm over Pyongyang’s stepped-up cadence of ballistic missile tests. Kim ordered testing exercises in the lead-up to this month’s U.S. election and is claiming progress on efforts to build capability to strike the U.S. mainland. Biden and Xi have much beyond North Korea to discuss, including China's indirect support for Russia, human rights issues, technology and Taiwan, the self-ruled democracy that Beijing claims as its own. There's also much uncertainty about what lies ahead in the U.S.-China relationship under Trump, who campaigned promising to levy 60% tariffs on Chinese imports. Already, many American companies, including Nike and eyewear retailer Warby Parker, have been diversifying their sourcing away from China. Shoe brand Steve Madden says it plans to cut imports from China by as much as 45% next year. 'When Xi meets with Biden, part of his audience is not solely the White House or the U.S. government,' said Victor Cha, an analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. 'It’s about American CEOs and continued U.S. investment or trying to renew U.S. investment in China and get rid of the perception that there’s a hostile business environment in China.' White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Biden administration officials will advise the Trump team that managing the intense competition with Beijing will likely be the most significant foreign policy challenge they will face. Administration officials are concerned that tensions between China and Taiwan could devolve into all-out war if there is a miscalculation by either side, with catastrophic consequences for the world. Sullivan said the Trump administration will have to deal with the Chinese military's frequent harassment of its regional neighbors. Skirmishes between the Philippine and Chinese coast guards in the disputed South China Sea have become a persistent problem. Chinese coast guard ships also regularly approach disputed Japanese-controlled East China Sea islands near Taiwan. Ishiba met with Xi on Friday. Afterward, the Japanese prime minister said he told Xi he was 'extremely concerned about the situation in the East China Sea and escalating activity of the People’s Liberation Army.' The White House worked for months to arrange Saturday's meeting between Xi and Biden, something the Democrat badly wanted to do before leaving office in January. Sullivan traveled to Beijing in late August to meet with his Chinese counterpart and also sat down with Xi. Beijing agreed to the meeting earlier this week. It's a big moment for Biden as he wraps up more than 50 years in politics. He saw his relationship with Xi as among the most consequential on the international stage and put much effort into cultivating that relationship. Biden and Xi first got to know each other on travels across the U.S. and China when both were vice presidents, interactions that both have said left a lasting impression. But the last four years have presented a steady stream of difficult moments. The FBI this week offered new details of a federal investigation into Chinese government efforts to hack into U.S. telecommunications networks. The initial findings have revealed a 'broad and significant' cyberespionage campaign aimed at stealing information from Americans who work in government and politics. U.S. intelligence officials also have assessed China has surged sales to Russia of machine tools, microelectronics and other technology that Moscow is using to produce missiles, tanks, aircraft and other weaponry for use in its war against Ukraine. And tensions flared last year after Biden ordered the shooting down of a Chinese spy balloon that traversed the United States. ___ Associated Press writer Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/biden-xi-china-north-korea-russia-88725252ce926384aaf36004b9f863b3	2024-11-15T20:01:52-08:00	
Fire engulfs hospital ward in northern India, killing 10 newborn babies	LUCKNOW, India (AP) — A fire tore through a neonatal intensive care unit in a hospital in northern India, killing 10 newborn babies and injuring 16 others, authorities said. The fire occurred late Friday at a hospital in Jhansi city in India's Uttar Pradesh state. Officials said the blaze spread quickly through the ward, where 55 infants were being treated. Forty-five babies were rescued and are receiving medical care, said Bimal Kumar Dubey, a local official. It was not immediately clear what sparked the blaze. Brajesh Pathak, the deputy chief minister of the state, visited the hospital and met with families on Saturday. He pledged government support for the victims’ families and promised a thorough investigation. 'We will identify those responsible for this tragedy and take strict action. The government stands with families during this difficult time,' he said. When the firefighters arrived, the ward was engulfed in flames and plumes of smoke. Rescuers had to break through windows to reach the newborn babies. Eyewitnesses said the rescue operation began about 30 minutes after the fire erupted, delaying evacuation efforts. The accident has raised questions over the hospital’s safety measures. While fire alarms had been installed in the intensive care unit, parents and witnesses said they did not activate during the blaze. Hospital staff acted only after they saw signs of smoke and fire. 'If the safety alarm had worked, we could have acted sooner and saved more lives,' said Naresh Kumar, a parent who lost his baby. Akhtar Hussain, whose son was rescued and is receiving treatment in an adjacent ward, agreed that the tragedy could have been prevented if the hospital had better safety protocols. Fires are common in India, where building laws and safety norms are often flouted by builders and residents. Poor maintenance and lack of proper firefighting equipment in the country also leads to deaths.	https://apnews.com/article/india-jhansi-hospital-fire-newborns-c2236ba37d12e4f5353df5ebb68171e2	2024-11-15T19:13:50-08:00	
Iranian official met with Musk in a possible step to ease tensions with Trump	WASHINGTON (AP) — Iran successfully sought a meeting with Elon Musk, according to a U.S. official, one in a series of steps that appeared aimed at easing tensions with President-elect Donald Trump. Iran's U.N. Ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani met with Musk — a Trump ally named this week to advise his administration on ways to cut the federal government — on Monday in New York, according to a U.S. official briefed on the meeting by a foreign colleague. The official said he had been informed that the discussion covered a variety of topics, most notably Iran’s nuclear program, its support for anti-Israel groups throughout the Middle East and prospects for improved relations with the United States. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a non-U.S. governmental meeting, said no immediate decisions were taken by either side. The official said the Iranians sought the meeting with Musk, the world's richest man, and that it did not take place at the Iranian mission to the U.N. The Trump transition team would not confirm or deny the meeting, which was first reported by The New York Times. 'The American people re-elected President Trump because they trust him to lead our country and restore peace through strength around the world. When he returns to the White House, he will take the necessary action to do just that,' Karoline Leavitt, a spokesperson for the Trump transition, said in a statement. Iran’s U.N. mission declined to comment. Iran's outreach comes as Trump has been announcing picks for key foreign policy posts — including Sen. Marco Rubio for secretary of state and Rep. Mike Waltz for national security adviser — who are expected to be tough on Iran. Intelligence officials have said Iran opposed Trump's second term, seeing him as more likely to increase tension between Washington and Tehran. Trump’s administration ended a nuclear deal with Iran, reimposed sanctions and ordered the killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, an act that prompted Iran’s leaders to vow revenge. The Justice Department this month revealed an Iranian murder-for-hire plot to kill Trump, charging a man who said he had been tasked by an Iranian government official in September with planning Trump's assassination. The Iranian foreign ministry rejected the report. The plot was part of what federal officials have described as ongoing efforts by Iran to target U.S. government officials, including Trump, on U.S. soil. Last summer, for instance, the Justice Department charged a Pakistani man with ties to Iran in a murder-for-hire plot targeting American officials. Meanwhile, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing unnamed U.S. officials, that Iran told the Biden administration in a written message delivered on Oct. 14 that it would not try to kill Trump. It was a response to an earlier warning from the U.S. that an attempt on Trump's life would be considered an act of war, the Journal reported. In response to inquiries about reports in the Journal and other outlets, Iran's U.N. mission said it does not issue public statements about 'official messages exchanged between the two countries.' 'The Islamic Republic of Iran has long declared its commitment to pursuing Martyr Soleimani’s assassination through legal and judicial avenues, while adhering fully to the recognized principles of international law,' its statement said. While Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has final say on all matters of state, has repeatedly expressed his own disgust with Trump, Iran’s new reformist president has kept the door open to talks with Trump to seek relief from international sanctions. The Trump transition team did not respond to messages seeking comment on the Iranian mission's statement Friday. ___ Lederer reported from the United Nations. AP reporter Michelle L.

In Milei's latest drastic move, Argentina is sole UN holdout voting 'no' to ending gender violence	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — The usual suspects abstained from voting on a seemingly uncontroversial United Nations resolution that denounced violence against women and girls on Thursday — Iran, Russia, North Korea. But the country casting the sole vote against the nonbinding resolution, drafted by France and the Netherlands, took the world by surprise. It was Argentina, long considered one of Latin America’s most socially progressive countries. Unleashing an avalanche of criticism across the political spectrum on Friday, the ‘no’ vote by Buenos Aires marked the latest in a series of dramatic foreign policy shifts under President Javier Milei, the most right-wing leader in Argentina's 41 years of democracy. It comes just days after Milei, an outspoken climate change skeptic, abruptly called Argentina's negotiators home from the U.N. climate summit in Baku, Azerbaijan, stirring concerns that the radical economist might seek to emulate former U.S. President Donald Trump in withdrawing Argentina entirely from the 2015 Paris climate agreement. Not only has Milei transformed Argentine foreign policy in line with the United States and Israel, his government has also taken fringe positions on the global stage that fly in the face of the liberal, rules-based international order. 'It's a big break with standard Argentine foreign policy, which has long been oriented toward making Argentina an integrated part of the Global South,' said Richard Sanders, a global fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and former State Department official in the region. 'It’s a definitely a significant change in how Argentina relates internationally.' Argentina's vote at the U.N. Thursday recalled a similar clash last month when Argentina became the only member of all the Group of 20 nations to sign onto a statement adopting language about gender equality. 'Argentina votes alone, against the rest of humanity,' the conservative party of former President Mauricio Macri, an ally of Milei’s government, wrote on social media platform X Friday. Another centrist party, the Unión Cívica Radical, joined the chorus of local condemnation. 'By fighting imaginary cultural battles we end up isolated from the world,' said Senator Martín Lousteau, president of the centrist party. Lousteau denounced Argentina’s U.N. vote opposing an end to gender violence as a 'disgrace.' Top official Guillermo Francos defended the decision, saying 'neither commitments nor treaties will solve the issue of gender violence.' Nearly a year into his presidency, the former Argentine TV pundit remains erratic and idiosyncratic in the global spotlight, in striking similarity to Trump. Milei became the first foreign leader since the U.S. election to meet Trump, albeit informally, late Thursday at the president-elect's private Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. In a congratulatory phone call with Trump earlier this week, Miei's spokesperson reported that Trump told the Argentine leader: 'You're my favorite president.' Trump has not confirmed the claim. The Argentine presidency on Friday proudly released a stream of photos from Mar-a-Lago featuring Milei in a sharp suit beaming alongside Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk, with whom Milei has also publicly cultivated a bromance over their shared contempt for 'wokeness,' gender issues and socialism. In November 2023, an angry Argentine electorate fed up with sky-high inflation, debt defaults and bank runs handed the outsider a sweeping mandate to carry out an overhaul of Argentina's crisis-stricken economy. But along with Milei's libertarian crusade has come a series of cultural battles — both at home, where the president eliminated Argentina's women’s and environment ministries and scrapped the national anti-discrimination institute, as well as abroad, where Milei has sought to fashion himself as a far-right icon, raising the hackles of key allies like Braziland Spain. 'Milei got into the presidency on the basis of his clearly stated libertarian views, it was all about the economy,' Sanders said. 'But these other views are nothing he kept hidden.' Tensions over Milei's culture war escalated this month. When Argentina voted at the U.N. in favor of ending the American economic embargo against Cuba on Oct. 30, Milei fired then-Foreign Minister Diana Mondino over what he called her 'unforgivable mistake' and swiftly replaced her with Gerardo Werthein, a wealthy businessman who had been Buenos Aires’ ambassador to the U.S. This weekend, Milei and Werthein plan to meet Trump again at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando, Florida. Experts say that Milei hopes to cash in on his friendship with Trump to help crisis-stricken Argentina secure a much-needed infusion cash infusion from the International Monetary Fund, to which Argentina owes over $44 billion. The U.S. is the fund’s largest shareholder. In recent weeks, Milei's shock dismissal of Argentina's top diplomat — a polished political performer who frequently worked to mend diplomatic relations strained by Milei’s profanity-laden fights with traditional allies — has sent shivers through Argentina's diplomatic ranks. Milei has vowed to purge his foreign ministry of so-called 'traitors to the country' who have strayed from his stance, which includes rejecting the 'Pact for the Future' adopted by the U.N. in September that promotes climate action, female empowerment and the regulation of artificial intelligence. Local media has reported the forced resignations of at least seven diplomats in recent weeks who were perceived as critical of the president's Trump-like attacks on the collective philosophy of the U.N. Milei accuses such multilateral forums of restricting members’ freedom. Argentina's left-leaning Peronist movement — which has dominated the country's politics for decades — was seething Friday, with lawmakers aghast at what they saw as the unraveling of hard-won social gains like Argentina's breakthrough legalization of abortion in 2020 and recent efforts to curb fossil fuels. 'For you, freedom is violence,' said Mayra Mendoza, a prominent Peronist politician on Friday, addressing Milei. The libertarian has called abortion 'murder,' climate change a 'socialist lie' and the U.N. a 'leviathan with multiple tentacles.'	https://apnews.com/article/argentina-milei-united-nations-gender-b55668acab6e97b5ebbb97abe2dda996	2024-11-15T15:46:51-08:00

Virgin Mary statue, a symbol of resilience, returns to Notre Dame Cathedral 5 years after fire	PARIS (AP) — A medieval statue of the Virgin Mary and Child, known as 'The Virgin of Paris,' returned to Notre Dame cathedral Friday evening, five years after surviving the devastating 2019 fire that engulfed the landmark. The nearly six-foot-tall stone sculpture, a symbol of hope and faith for Catholics in Paris and beyond, was relocated after the blaze on April 15, 2019. Miraculously intact, it earned the nickname 'Stabat Mater' — the standing Virgin — as a sign of resilience amid the destruction. The statue’s return began with a torchlit procession from the forecourt of Saint-Germain-l’Auxerrois Church. Hundreds of faithful and residents accompanied the statue along the Seine river to the cathedral’s square, where Archbishop Laurent Ulrich of Paris led a blessing ceremony. 'Tonight, as we accompany the Virgin Mary to her cathedral, before she takes her place at the pillar where so many generations have come to pray, we know she is joining the house of Christ,' Ulrich said, bowing before the statue and blessing it with incense. The statue, originally from the Saint-Aignan Chapel on the Île de la Cité, dates to the mid-14th century. Moved to Notre Dame cathedral in 1818, it was relocated several times before finding a permanent home in 1855 against the southeast pillar of the cathedral, under the guidance of architect Eugène Viollet-le-Duc, according to a news release from the cathedral. A vigil followed, concluding a nine-day prayer cycle that began Nov. 7. The ceremony is part of the lead-up to the cathedral’s grand reopening, scheduled for Dec. 8. Last Thursday, the cathedral took delivery of three new bells, including one used in the Stade de France during the Paris Olympics earlier this year. The Olympic bell, a gift from the Paris 2024 organizing committee, will join two smaller bells, Chiara and Carlos, above the altar. 'We’ll be together again in a few days to open the door to Christ,' Ulrich said during the ceremony.	https://apnews.com/article/paris-notre-dame-cathedral-virgin-mary-statue-c7161cc1d283ffd183e667d7b59d2f98	2024-11-15T11:26:31-08:00	
Spanish regional leader admits mistakes made in flood response, but refuses to step down	MADRID (AP) — The Spanish regional leader facing immense pressure for his handling of the catastrophic Valencia floods last month defied calls to step down Friday, but conceded that authorities made mistakes in their response to the disaster. More than 220 people were killed from the powerful Oct. 29 storms that brought tsunami-like waves to parts of eastern and central Spain, wrecking countless homes and leaving entire towns caked in mud. Carlos Mazón of the conservative Popular Party addressed regional lawmakers in Valencia more than two weeks later, saying he would 'not deny failings' as anger has continued to grow at what people perceive was a slow and chaotic response. The storm, he said, 'showed that our detection and warning systems have cracks in them.' His remarks Friday were the first detailed public comments he has made about his government's disaster response, coming six days after tens of thousands of people took to the streets in Valencia city calling for his resignation. Criticism mounted after local authorities failed to send emergency alerts sooner to cell phones on Oct. 29, in spite of Spain’s national weather forecaster having issued the highest level of warning as early as 7:30 a.m. that day. Spaniards, particularly in Valencia, have been critical of other aspects of the regional and national government’s initial response to the disaster. In hard-hit Paiporta, survivors pelted mud at Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, King Felipe VI, and Mazón when the three leaders visited the town days after the floods. Mazón’s reputation took another beating this week when local media reported that he had a three-hour lunch with a journalist on the day of the storm, while some towns and villages had already started to fill with water. On Friday, Mazón repeated a previous assertion that a national body responsible for measuring river flows had provided insufficient warnings, and said the magnitude of the deluge was hard to foresee. 'It is legitimate to question in general whether the (emergency) system responded how we believed it should,' Mazón said, adding that it had not. Spain’s decentralized government tasks regional authorities with handling civil protection. Regional governments can ask the national government in Madrid, now led by the Socialists, for extra resources, and use information from the national weather forecaster and other agencies. Science minister Diana Morant who belongs to the Socialist party called Mazon’s speech an 'act of political cowardice.' She said the Popular Party should dismiss him. Most of the victims of last month's floods died in small towns just outside Valencia. Official data released on Thursday showed that almost half were 70 years or older.	https://apnews.com/article/valencia-floods-spain-mazon-3b0cfbb67f5a8d8a9ba3696766c26d04	2024-11-15T11:19:19-08:00

Pope asks Church of Rome to help address housing crisis ahead of Holy Year in 2025	ROME (AP) — Pope Francis on Friday called on the diocese of Rome to respond to a growing housing crisis in the Eternal City, wading into the debate about rising rental prices that has only grown more acute with Holy Year celebrations in 2025. Francis has written to the city's church leaders and religious order priests for any available church properties to be used for the homeless or residents facing possible eviction because of rising rents. The letter reflected something of the paradox facing the Vatican: Francis’ yearlong jubilee is expected to bring more than 30 million pilgrims to Rome to celebrate the Holy Year. That has had the predictable effect of driving up demand for short-term apartment rentals, particularly near the Vatican. That demand, in turn, has only accelerated the trend of local residents moving out or being priced out as owners turn their properties over to short-term property agents, such as Airbnb and other platforms that cater to tourists. It's a trend that is happening in other Italian cities, including Florence and Venice, and across Europe, leading to protests by local residents. In his letter, Francis noted that Rome’s Catholic institutions were preparing to provide shelter to millions of pilgrims for the jubilee. But he asked them to also 'make a courageous gesture of love' to Romans by offering up any unused housing or apartments. 'I want all diocesan realities that own real estate to offer their contribution to stem the housing emergency with signs of charity and solidarity to generate hope in the thousands of people in the city of Rome who are in a condition of precarious housing,' Francis wrote. The Catholic Church is a major property owner in Rome, with a portfolio including commercial and residential real estate as well as church-owned convents and monasteries. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Winston Churchill portrait returns to Ottawa after international art caper	OTTAWA, Ontario (AP) — A stolen portrait of Winston Churchill that was swapped with a forgery during the pandemic has returned to its rightful place, after two Ottawa police detectives traveled to Rome to retrieve it. Police said 'The Roaring Lion' was stolen from the Fairmont Chateau Laurier hotel in Ottawa, sometime between Christmas Day 2021 and Jan. 6, 2022, and replaced with a forgery. The swap was only uncovered months later, in August, when a hotel worker noticed the frame wasn't hung properly and looked different than the others. Genevieve Dumas, the hotel’s general manager, unveiled the portrait in a ceremony on Friday. 'I can tell you that it is armed, locked, secured,' Dumas said. 'It’s not moving,' she said, adding that staff accidentally triggered the alarm on Thursday, while they hung it up, 'and I’m sure they heard it on Parliament Hill.' The most famous depiction of Churchill, known as 'The Roaring Lion,' appears on the U.K.’s five-pound banknote and shows a glowering wartime prime minister staring into the camera. Renowned photographer Yousuf Karsh snapped the iconic portrait in 1941 in the Speaker’s office just after Churchill delivered a rousing wartime address to Canadian lawmakers. Toward the end of his life, Karsh signed and gifted the portrait to the hotel, where he had lived and worked. The portrait had been sold through an auction house in London to a private buyer, and both seller and buyer were unaware that it had been stolen, police said. Police have now charged a man from the town of Powassan, Ontario, with forgery, theft and trafficking. That case is before the courts. The portrait’s return was a widely anticipated event, with a ceremony held in a room packed with attendees including Ottawa's mayor. Nicola Cassinelli, a lawyer in Genoa who bought the stolen artwork, sent a message. 'The magnificent photograph by Yousuf Karsh captures in the eyes of Sir Winston Churchill the pride, the anger and the strength of the free world. And it represents, better than any other, the desire for the triumph of good over evil.' And despite the 'extraordinary privilege' of having the portrait hang in his home, 'The Roaring Lion,' he said, belongs to the public.	https://apnews.com/article/stolen-winston-churchill-portrait-returned-b230594156879725968ab0bd1f276846	2024-11-15T09:35:28-08:00	
Austria says Russia's Gazprom will cut off natural gas supply this weekend	VIENNA (AP) — Russia’s state-owned natural gas company Gazrom will cut off supplies to Austria’s OMV utility early Saturday, Austria’s chancellor said, adding that his country’s underground gas storage was full and that it had alternative, non-Russia supplies. The cutoff follows OMV’s announcement that it would stop paying for Gazprom gas to its Austrian arm to offset a 230 million-euro ($242 million) arbitration award it won over an earlier cutoff of gas to its German subsidiary. Chancellor Karl Nehammer said Friday that Austria has a secure supply of alternative fuel and that 'no one will freeze this winter, no home will be cold.' 'Our gas storage facilities are full and we have sufficient capacity to obtain gas from other regions,' Nehammer said in a hastily called appearance at the chancellery. 'We cannot be blackmailed.' OMV gave notice of the cutoff in a trading statement on the Central European Gas Hub website. An OMV spokesperson couldn't be reached for comment. Gazprom had no immediate comment. The cutoff will cost Gazprom around $2.5 billion a year in annual revenue, said Janis Kluge, an expert on the Russian economy at German Institute for International and Security Affairs. Oil and gas exports, and the associated tax revenues are the most important single source of cash for the Kremlin. Russia cut off most natural gas supplies to Europe in 2022, citing disputes over payment in rubles, a move European leaders described as energy blackmail over their support for Ukraine against Russia's invasion. The cutoff sent gas prices soaring and contributed to a sharp burst of inflation that went into double digits in October 2022, but has since subsided. European governments had to scramble to line up alternative supplies at higher prices, much of it liquefied natural gas brought by ship from the U.S. and Qatar. Still, three European countries — Austria, Slovakia and Hungary — have been getting supplies of Russian gas through a pipeline through Ukraine despite the fighting there. Ukraine has said it won't continue gas transit past Jan. 1, leaving those countries looking for other supplies. Austria gets the bulk of its natural gas from Russia, as much as 98% in December 2023, according to Energy Minister Lenore Gewessler. The European Union has ended most supplies of Russian oil, but hasn't directly sanctioned Russian gas. Instead, it has set a nonbinding goal of 2027 for member countries to stop importing Russian gas. In 1968, Austria became the first Western European country to import gas from the Soviet Union, and its dependence on Russian energy increased in the following decades. During a visit by Russia’s President Vladimir Putin to Austria in 2018, an agreement for the extension of natural gas supplies to Austria until 2040 was signed by Gazprom head Alexey Miller and Rainer Seele, then chairman of the OMV Executive Board. The contract obligates the Austrian side to pay for the gas whether it takes delivery or not. Gewessler convened a commission to look into the circumstances under which it was signed and legal possibilities to get out of it. ___ David McHugh reported from Frankfurt, Germany.	https://apnews.com/article/austria-russia-gazprom-gas-supplies-8851d55ac8bb8621a1ee11ae9e476d68	2024-11-15T09:13:49-08:00	
Rauw Alejandro on Puerto Rico, salsa and working with Pharrell on his new album	MIAMI (AP) — Last year, Puerto Rican superstar Rauw Alejandro was in outer space. 'Playa Saturno,' the 2023 surprise spinoff to his 2022 record 'Saturno,' brought his R&amp;B-informed reggaeton to new heights on an extraterrestrial concept album. A year later, and he's completely shifted gears, finding inspiration in classic sounds and imagery, pulling from a '60s and '70s Nuyorican cool — while still doing what he’s always done best: contorting familiar genres into something novel. Alejandro is releasing his fifth studio album 'Cosa Nuestra,' a title borrowed from Willie Colón and Héctor Lavoe's 1969 album, on Friday. (There's a sample of Colón and Lavoe's 'Qué Lío' in the opening title track.) It marries classic Puerto Rican instruments and genres, like salsa and merengue, with more modern sounds like reggaeton. And it is amplified by a number of inventive samples — like Frankie Ruiz's 'Tú Con Él' — and all-star collaborators: Pharrell Williams, Bad Bunny and Feid among them. Alejandro's created a kind of character for the release, whom he calls 'Raúl Alejandro,' a nod to his father and the early migration of Puerto Ricans to New York, which he explored in an interview conducted in Spanish and English ahead of the 2024 Latin Grammys. It has been translated and edited for clarity and brevity. AP: You've really challenged yourself on this album. How does it feel to get to the next level? ALEJANDRO: I'm really happy. I think it's a different stage of my career. More elevated as a music producer, writer, artist in general. I've also grown a lot as a person. I feel more mature in every part of my life. This feels like the whole experience of my career in one whole project. AP: If New York is homebase for hip-hop, Carolina, Puerto Rico, is a home for reggaeton. How would you describe its influence? ALEJANDRO: Puerto Rico is in every part of the books, in history. We're in every part of the world. You mentioned hip-hop, Puerto Ricans were involved in that as well. But before that, you see a salsa world — the Fania All-Stars. New York in the '70s was a lot of jazz, soul. It's just a lot of music from New York and Puerto Ricans have always been there. Reggaeton comes from Carolina, Puerto Rico. It's the birthplace. It's special. I feel really proud to be a Puerto Rican. In this new era, I went to New York and found great inspiration for my music but kept my essence. I keep the island at the forefront of everything that I do. I'm thinking about what it means to be Puerto Rican, our culture. AP: Is it that pride that made you want to go back to your roots on this album? ALEJANDRO: Of course, definitely. Salsa was a world that I had yet to explore. When I'm doing new projects, I try to look back at what I've accomplished and what I have yet to do. I try to analyze my whole career and see what's going to be next with Rauw, what's going to be new; I take my time at the studio, at home, studying, analyzing. This project has a lot of salsa influence, a lot of African influence. I'm using the live instruments (for) the first time. Instruments traditional to Puerto Rico like the cuatro, puertorriqueño guitar, maraca, el guiro, la conga, all mixed with the digital sounds. And, you know, it sounds fresh. It sounds rich and perfect for dancing. AP: Pharrell Williams is a producer on this album, and he's featured on 'Committed.' What was it like working with him? ALEJANDRO: We started working in New York and we finished in Paris. We have a few other records at the studio, but 'Committed,' this song is really special. He was the one that wrote that, the hook. And he was like, 'Rauw, you have to sing it in English.' And I was like, 'I've never done this before. It's new.' It was challenge for me, you know, singing a whole hook in English. I told him, 'OK, but I’ll do the verse in Spanish.' I like to write my own verses and wanted to make it my own. We fused our ideas together. He understood the whole concept of the project. He's a legend, a mentor. You're going to hear more music from Pharrell and Rauw. AP: How much of you is in the character you created for this album? ALEJANDRO: I always liked the classic stuff, and being really elegant, since I was a kid. I always like to be in a suit and tie. I found excuses to be really dressed up. And I think this character borrows that from Rauw Alejandro. I'm 31. I feel like a young spirt with an old soul, living in New York, the city's vibes, the musical influence of the '60s, the long coats ... the swag of Puerto Rico. I can't deny it. I think the way that you dress is the way you express yourself and your art. AP: You, Bad Bunny,Residente and other Puerto Rican artists have been vocal about issues facing the island. Why is it important to talk about? ALEJANDRO: I'm from Puerto Rico, that's my island. As a civilian, I'm always going to fight for my rights and give my opinion, share a positive message, be an example for the next generation and try to find the best solutions for my island. I think Benito (Bad Bunny) and Rene (Residente) have always done the same. I think everyone expresses themselves in different ways, but as an artist, the people can always count on me to share a message. ___ Associated Press Music Writer Maria Sherman contributed to this report from New York.	https://apnews.com/article/rauw-alejandro-interview-cosa-nuestra-puerto-rico-602c9804346dfd487b13d81dac330977	2024-11-15T07:53:12-08:00	
Man and four teenagers convicted of murdering two boys in mistaken identity case	LONDON (AP) — Four teenagers and an adult male were convicted in a British court on Friday of stabbing two boys to death in a case of mistaken identity -- killings that shocked a country already anxious about knife crime. Mason Rist, aged 15, and Max Dixon, 16, were chased down and attacked by four youths as they went to get pizza near their homes in Bristol, southwest England, on Jan. 27 this year. During the five-week trial at Bristol Crown Court, prosecutor Ray Tully said Rist and Dixon were the victims of a rivalry between their Knowle West neighborhood and the nearby Hartcliffe district. He said they were wrongly identified by their attackers as being responsible for throwing bricks at a house in Hartcliffe earlier on the day of the attack. The pair were set upon with machetes, a bat and a sword in an attack that lasted just half a minute. They died hours later in a hospital. On Friday, the jury found all five defendants guilty of the murders of both boys. Three defendants aged 15, 16 and 17 — who cannot be identified because of their ages — were convicted along with Riley Tolliver, 18, and getaway driver Antony Snook, 45. All five will be sentenced at a later date. Vicky Cook, chief crown prosecutor for southwest England, said the deaths of Rist and Dixon had 'sent shockwaves through their community and the city of Bristol.' She added: 'Regardless of which individuals caused any of the fatal injuries, the evidence shows that all five (defendants) were working together and share joint responsibility for this terrible crime.' Dixon’s mother, Leanne Ekland, said: 'Today’s outcome doesn’t change the fact that two families go home without their boys. We can now hopefully begin to process that and remember them both and the happy memories that both families have of Max and Mason. 'I wish we didn’t have to be here today, but we’ve got some sort of justice for our boys.'	https://apnews.com/article/uk-teenagers-killed-knife-crime-79b3a833485e0dd5c9ab4314a112d01f	2024-11-15T07:51:49-08:00	
Jake Paul beats 58-year-old Mike Tyson as the hits don't match the hype	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) — The boos from a crowd wanting more action were growing again when Jake Paul dropped his gloves before the final bell, and bowed toward 58-year-old Mike Tyson. Paying homage to one of the biggest names in boxing history didn't do much for the fans that filled the home of the NFL's Dallas Cowboys on Friday night. Paul won an eight-round unanimous decision over Tyson as the hits didn't match the hype in a fight between the 27-year-old YouTuber-turned-boxer and the former heavyweight champion in his first sanctioned pro bout in almost 20 years. All the hate from the pre-fight buildup was gone, replaced by boos from bewildered fans hoping for more from a fight that drew plenty of questions about its legitimacy long beforehand. The fight wasn't close on the judge's cards, with one giving Paul an 80-72 edge and the other two calling it 79-73. 'Let’s give it up for Mike,' Paul said in the ring, not getting much response from a crowd that started filing out before the decision was announced. 'He’s the greatest to ever do it. I look up to him. I’m inspired by him.' Tyson came after Paul immediately after the opening bell and landed a couple of quick punches but didn't try much else the rest of the way. Even fewer rounds than the normal 10 or 12 and two-minute rounds instead of three, along with heavier gloves designed to lessen the power of punches, couldn't do much to generate action. Paul was more aggressive after the quick burst from Tyson in the opening seconds, but the punching wasn't very efficient. There were quite a few wild swings and misses. 'I was trying to hurt him a little bit,' said Paul, who improved to 11-1. 'I was scared he was going to hurt me. I was trying to hurt him. I did my best. I did my best.' Tyson mostly sat back and waited for Paul to come to him, with a few exceptions. It was quite the contrast to the co-main event, another slugfest between Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano in which Taylor kept her undisputed super lightweight championship with another disputed decision. Paul said he eased up starting about the third round because he thought Tyson was tired and vulnerable. 'I wanted to give the fans a show, but I didn't want to hurt somebody that didn't need to be hurt,' Paul said. It was the first sanctioned fight since 2005 for Tyson, who fought Roy Jones Jr. in a much more entertaining exhibition in 2020. Paul started fighting a little more than four years ago. 'I didn’t prove nothing to anybody, only to myself,' Tyson said when asked what it meant to complete the fight. 'I'm not one of those guys that looks to please the world. I'm just happy with what I can do.' The fight was originally scheduled for July 20 but had to be postponed when Tyson was treated for a stomach ulcer after falling ill on a flight. His record is now 50-7 with 44 knockouts. Tyson slapped Paul on the face during the weigh-in a night before the fight, and they traded insults in several of the hype events, before and after the postponement. The hate was long gone by the end of the anticlimactic fight. 'I have so much respect for him,' Paul said. 'That violence, war thing between us, like after he slapped me, I wanted to be aggressive and take him down and knock him out and all that stuff. That kind of went away as the rounds went on.' The fight set a Texas record for combat sports with a gate of nearly $18 million, according to organizers, and Netflix had problems with the feed in the streaming platform's first live combat sports event. Netflix has more than 280 million subscribers globally. 'This is the biggest event,' Paul said. 'Over 120 million people on Netflix. We crashed the site.' Among the celebrities were basketball Hall of Famer Shaquille O'Neal and former NFL star Rob Gronkowski, along with Cowboys owner Jerry Jones. Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis, two foes with Tyson's heyday, greeted him in his locker room before the fight. Tyson infamously bit Holyfield on the ear in a 1997 bout, and appeared to have one of his gloves in his mouth several times during the Paul bout. He was asked if he had problem with his mouthpiece. 'I have a habit of biting my gloves,' Tyson said. 'I have a biting fixation.' 'I've heard about that,' the interview responded. Mario Barrios retained the WBC welterweight title in a draw with Abel Ramos on the undercard. Barrios was in control early before Ramos dominated the middle rounds. Each had a knockdown in the 12-round bout. It was the first fight for the 29-year-old Barrios since he was appointed the WBC welterweight champ when Terence Crawford started the process of moving up from the 147-pound class. Barrios, who is 29-2-1, won the interim WBC title with a unanimous decision over Yordenis Ugás last year. The 33-year-old Ramos is 28-6-3. ___ AP sports: https://apnews.com/sports	https://apnews.com/article/mike-tyson-jake-paul-fight-0e1597caaae41254df029eb9fe62cc39	2024-11-15T07:50:08-08:00	
AP PHOTOS: An AP photographer captures a bomb falling on a building in his childhood neighborhood	BEIRUT (AP) — As a bomb descended on a multi-story apartment building in Beirut's Tayouneh area Friday, hundreds of onlookers gathered in the street at a traffic roundabout several hundred meters (yards) away. Among them was an Associated Press photographer. Hassan Ammar had donned his flak jacket and helmet and rushed to the scene — taking up his position at a safe distance using a long lens — after the Israeli military issued an evacuation warning with a map marking the targeted building. The Israeli army said the building contained facilities belonging to the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. However, Ammar had different associations with the building. He had grown up less than a kilometer (less than 0.6 miles) from it, and he had been there on multiple occasions. When he was a child during the 15-year Lebanese civil war that ended in 1990, 'this building was on the front line between Muslim and Christian neighborhoods,' the so-called Green Line, he recalled. But in later years, Ammar said, he visited the building 'many times.' There was a notary public on the first floor, and next door was a sports supply store where he used to shop. Next to the building was a cemetery where his family had loved ones buried. 'I know it very well,' he said. Ammar said he even once considered renting an apartment in the building that was struck, or in the building next door — now he can't remember which — because it had a beautiful view of the pine trees in Horsh Beirut, a large public park nearby. When he heard the sound of the projectile overhead, Ammar had his camera already trained on the building set to a high shutter speed, and he began snapping photos immediately, capturing the bomb in mid-air and as it descended, ending with a massive explosion. There were no immediate reports of casualties, but much of the building was reduced to rubble. Richard Weir, a senior crisis, conflict and arms researcher at Human Rights Watch, reviewed close-up photos of Friday's bomb to determine what type of weapon was used. 'The bomb and components visible in the photographs, including the strake, wire harness cover, and tail fin section, are consistent with a Mk-84 series 2,000-pound class general purpose bomb equipped with Boeing’s Joint Directed Attack Munition (JDAM) tail kit,' he said. Weir added that 'the use of large, air-dropped bombs, like these, that produce wide-area effects in populated areas carries significant risks to civilians and civilian objects.' A few weeks earlier, another AP photographer, Bilal Hussein, had captured a nearly identical scene as a similar powerful bomb hit a nearby building in Beirut. The Israeli military has maintained that it takes measures to reduce civilian casualties by issuing warnings before many of its strikes in Lebanon. More than 3,200 people have been killed in Lebanon during 13 months of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah — most of them since mid-September — of whom about 27% were women and children, according to Lebanon’s Health Ministry.	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-beirut-israel-hezbollah-strike-bomb-photos-a9fd45ca7c75171e1e6983e2b389d595	2024-11-15T07:39:45-08:00	
Dutch coalition parties gather in crisis talks after last week's soccer violence	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — The leaders of coalition parties in the Dutch government dominated by hard-right leader Geert Wilders gathered Friday for crisis talks following reports that the finance state secretary was resigning over what she saw as denigrating comments on immigrants after Israeli fans were assaulted after a soccer game in Amsterdam. Wilders last Wednesday blamed Moroccans for attacks on Israeli soccer fans, claiming that 'we saw Muslims hunting Jews' and added it was fueled by 'Moroccans who want to destroy Jews.' He said those convicted of involvement should be deported if they have dual nationality. Dutch media said that Morocco-born Nora Achahbar of centrist New Social Contract party would announce her resignation as finance secretary later Friday. The news couldn't immediately be independently confirmed. While lawmakers condemned antisemitism and agreed that perpetrators of the violence should be prosecuted and handed harsh punishments, opposition legislators accused Wilders of pouring oil on the fire. Wilders, whose party became the biggest in last year's election, also sowed some dissent within the four-party coalition with his comments. Late Friday, video and photos appeared of party leaders arriving at the Catshuis residence of Prime Minister Dick Schoof. The leader of the Green-left-Socialist opposition, Frans Timmermans, lauded Achahbar even before any move was announced. 'In this government, racist remarks are the order of the day. This government is not for all Dutch people,' he said. Violence erupted in the Dutch capital before and after last week’s soccer match between Ajax Amsterdam and Maccabi Tel Aviv. Fans from both sides were involved in unrest. A number of Maccabi fans chanted anti-Arab slogans and ripped a Palestinian flag off a building, while some men carried out 'hit-and-run' attacks on Maccabi fans and people they thought were Jews, according to a 12-page report on the violence issued by Amsterdam authorities.	https://apnews.com/article/netherlands-government-crisis-wilders-far-right-riots-fd4f44c8bf944dbd60c9fdd52663b1f9	2024-11-15T07:37:57-08:00	
Police clash with students in Turin as anti-government rallies draw support across Italy	ROME (AP) — At least 15 police officers were taken to hospital on Friday following clashes in Turin with students protesting against Italy's far-right government of Giorgia Meloni. The demonstration in the northern Italian city was one of several held across the country, including in Rome and Milan, on what the organizers dubbed 'No Meloni Day.' The officers in Turin were injured when they were exposed to fumes from a rudimentary explosive device used during the scuffles, local authorities reported. The protests across Italy were organized by students opposed to the policies of the Meloni government, particular in education. Some protests were coupled with demonstrations against arms sales to Israel and in support of the people of Gaza. Clashes broke out in Turin when police blocked students trying to break through a security cordon and reach the door of the prefecture building in the central Piazza Castello. Demonstrators used flagpoles to attack police vehicles outside the offices of public broadcaster RAI, while an effigy of education minister Giuseppe Valditara was set on fire. At the city's popular museum of cinema, protesters stripped the Italian tricolor from the entrance and replaced it with a Palestinian flag. In Milan, a photo of Meloni was splashed with blood-red paint during a rally, while protesters in Rome chanted slogans including 'Every day is a No-Meloni day.' Responding to the violent scenes in Turin, Meloni said: 'Today too we witnessed unacceptable scenes of violence and chaos in some squares by the usual troublemakers.' Expressing solidarity with the injured officers in a social media post, she wrote: 'I hope that certain politicians stop protecting or justifying this violence and unambiguously join in condemning such serious and unworthy episodes.'	https://apnews.com/article/italy-students-government-protests-education-d26606c68b6a066ba74f56180cf20f18	2024-11-15T07:08:43-08:00

Kennedy Jr. and other controversial choices for his Cabinet and administration positions. Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: Hakeem Jeffries says transparency is always best when it comes to high-ranking officials But he’s not ready to declare whether the House Ethics Committee should give its investigative report of former Rep. Matt Gaetz to senators weighing his nomination for attorney general. Jeffries says he needs to speak with the lead Democrat on the panel and he doesn’t want to get ahead of that discussion. Jeffries also says he won’t respond to every Trump nomination or statement, calling it a 'distraction.' He encouraged the Senate to fulfill its constitutional responsibilities. 'Advice and consent should mean something. It certainly doesn’t mean rolling over and giving any administration, Democratic or Republican, what they want,' Jeffries said. House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries questions Trump's Cabinet picks House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries says Donald Trump promised on the campaign trail that America would have the best administration possible, but his nominees so far raise the question of whether the president-elect is fulfilling that promise. Speaking to reporters Friday, Jeffries particularly singled out Trump’s choice of anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. 'Is Robert F. Kennedy Jr., by way of example, the best America has to offer? Will he and others give us the best opportunity to make a difference in the lives of the American people?' He says the answer is clear. Transgender-rights advocates say the election of Trump and his allies marks a major setback Election victories for Donald Trump and other candidates whose campaigns demeaned transgender people reinforced a widespread backlash against trans rights. For America’s LGBTQ+-rights movement, it adds up to one of the most sustained setbacks in its history. For transgender Americans, it’s personal: There is palpable fear of potential Trump administration steps to further marginalize them. But there's also a spirit of resilience — a determination to persevere in seeking acceptance and understanding. 'I just went through an election where I couldn’t watch a sports event on TV without seeing a commercial where trans people were portrayed as monsters,' said Jennifer Finney Boylan, a transgender author who teaches at Barnard College in New York. Anti-trans momentum has been growing for several years, with Republican-governed states enacting dozens of laws restricting trans people’s options for medical care, sports participation and public restroom access. Voters held divided views on Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. That's according to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 120,000 voters nationwide. About 4 in 10 voters had a very or somewhat favorable opinion of Kennedy, and roughly 4 in 10 had a very or somewhat unfavorable view. Slightly more than 1 in 10 did not know enough about Kennedy to have an opinion. Kennedy’s anti-vaccine stance may be at odds with many voters’ interests, if he’s confirmed to lead the Health and Human Services Department. About half of voters said they wanted the government to be 'more involved' in ensuring children are vaccinated for childhood diseases. About one-quarter said the government’s current involvement is 'about right,' and only about 2 in 10 wanted the government less involved. Roughly 3 in 10 parents of children under 18 years old want the government less involved, compared to about 2 in 10 voters without children under 18. About 6 in 10 voters said they wanted the government more involved in ensuring that Americans have health care coverage, and a similar share said they wanted the government to take a bigger role in forgiving medical debt. About three-quarters wanted the government more involved in lowering the cost of prescription drugs. In an election where pocketbook concerns were a primary focus, more than half of voters said they were 'very concerned' about their health care costs. WHO says global vaccine efforts have saved an estimated 154 million lives In a report released in April, the U.N.’s World Health Organization said global immunization efforts have saved an estimated 154 million lives over the past half-century, roughly equivalent to six lives every minute of every year. More than 101 million lives were those of children. Asked in Geneva on Friday about the nomination of anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, WHO spokesperson Dr. Margaret Harris told reporters it’s up to member countries — the U.S. is one of the biggest funders and sources of technical support to the U.N. agency — to decide who they appoint. She also said vaccines were 'absolutely critical' to good health outcomes. 'Vaccines are the reason so many more of us have survived to adulthood than we ever did before,' said Harris. 'Vaccine-preventable diseases have disappeared in the communities … where vaccination has been widely available and has been widely taken up.' Trump is already testing Congress and daring Republicans to oppose him After a resounding election victory, delivering what President-elect Donald Trump and Republicans said is a mandate to govern, an uneasy political question is emerging: Will there be any room for dissent in the U.S. Congress? Trump is laying down a gauntlet even before taking office challenging the Senate, in particular, to dare defy him over the nominations of Matt Gaetz, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other controversial choices for his Cabinet and administration positions. The promise of unified government, with the Republican Party’s sweep of the White House and GOP majorities in the House and Senate, is making way for a more complicated political reality as congressional leaders confront anew what it means to line up with Trump’s agenda.	https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-election-kamala-harris-bcc2651d77e1a79ecf3bd1e33c038956	2024-11-15T06:51:21-08:00	
Moody's downgrades Mexican government's outlook to 'negative' over weakening of judiciary and debt	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico’s president lashed out Friday at Moody’s ratings service, after it downgraded the Mexican government’s debt outlook to 'negative.' Moody’s said it had downgraded the government's debt outlook from 'stable' to 'negative' because newly approved laws in Mexico could weaken the judiciary branch and checks and balances. It reaffirmed Mexico’s Baa2 overall credit rating, but said increased government debt represented a risk for Mexico. It also mentioned the possibility that the government will have to transfer more money to shore up the highly indebted state-owned oil company, Pemex. 'Deteriorating debt affordability and further government spending rigidity make fiscal consolidation challenging, following this year’s widening in the government deficit,' Moody’s wrote, 'a deviation from a longstanding track record of low deficits regardless of economic pressures.' President Claudia Sheinbaum said that ratings agencies often have a 'bias of origin' against the economic policies her party adopted under former President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who took office on Dec. 1, 2018. 'Many times these ratings agencies are aimed at issuing evaluations starting from an economic model,' Sheinbaum said. 'Starting in 2018, the economic model in our country changed. Many times these ratings have this bias of origin.' Under López Obrador, who was Sheinbaum's political mentor, the government began transferring large amounts of money to the state-run oil company, started large building projects and implemented cash handout programs. That led to federal budget deficits of about 6% of Mexico's gross domestic product in 2024. Sheinbaum ruled out enacting new taxes next year and said she would rely on increasing tax collection from existing sources. But in the 2025 federal budget submitted by her administration to Congress on Friday, it was clear that sizable budget deficits would continue for some time. Mexico's treasury department said it would aim to reduce the deficit to 3.9% of GDP in 2025, but it was unclear if it could achieve that: López Obrador left behind a lot of unfinished train and oil refinery projects, and Sheinbaum has expanded benefit programs for the elderly. 'The government will only gradually narrow the deficit in coming years,' Moody's wrote. The 2025 budget says Mexico's outstanding federal debts would finish 2025 at around 51.4% of GDP. But that doesn't include a lot of government oil company and pensions debts. It also predicted the economy would grow by between 2 and 3% in 2025, something analysts say is optimistic, given that Mexico's GDP grew by only 1.5% in the third quarter of 2024. The government is also expecting the exchange rate to improve to 18.70 pesos to $1 and inflation to fall to 3.5%, both of which also seem highly optimistic. The Mexican peso has dropped in value to about 20.40 to $1 in recent days. The election of Donald Trump in the United States may also weigh on Mexico's economy, given his past threats to close the border and impose tariffs. Moody's said Mexico has been benefitting from 'nearshoring' investments by companies seeking to move production closer to the U.S. market. But it noted 'additional downside risks to investment dynamics could emerge ahead of the revision of United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) in 2026, particularly if modifications to the agreement’s rule of origins, labor specifications and other US trade policies towards Mexico changed in a way that durably limit the country’s exports.' 'Lower economic growth and, consequently, government revenue would undermine fiscal consolidation efforts,' it continued. Perhaps most importantly, Sheinbaum has continued López Obrador's push to implement changes to the judiciary that will make all federal judges stand for election in 2025 and 2026. The U.S. government and business groups worry that could weaken the independence of the courts, and make them vulnerable to political pressure. Critics say that could also allow drug cartels to fund judges' election campaigns and get their own candidates elected. 'The constitutional overhaul risks eroding checks and balances of the country’s judiciary system, with potential negative impact to Mexico’s economic and fiscal strength,' it continued, adding the changes 'have the potential to materially alter the checks and balances and the business operating environment in the country.' ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-economy-credit-rating-moodys-outlook-negative-78eb3e4f9d45af051c9378dae26eee4c	2024-11-15T06:27:17-08:00	
Aid groups say Italy-Albania migration deal violates medical ethics	ROME (AP) — More than a dozen humanitarian organizations that provide health care to migrants denounced Italy’s migration deal with Albania on Friday as a violation of the code of medical ethics, and urged health workers not to cooperate with it. The deal, the centerpiece of Premier Giorgia Meloni’s crackdown on human trafficking, calls for some male migrants rescued at sea to have their asylum cases processed while they are detained at two holding centers in Albania, a non-EU nation. Italy, which has long demanded Europe shoulder more of the continent’s migration problem, has held up the deal with Albania as a model for the continent and a strong deterrent to would-be refugees setting out on smugglers’ boats from North Africa for a better life. But the five-year deal, which is budgeted to cost Italy 670 million euros ($730 million), has run into a series of obstacles and legal challenges that have prevented even a single migrant from being processed in Albania. First, construction delays prevented the opening of the centers for several months. Then, after the first two batches of 20 men were brought to Albania this month, Italian courts issued rulings that resulted in them being taken to Italy anyway. The matter is now before the European Union’s Court of Justice in Luxembourg, which has been asked to rule on whether the men come from countries deemed safe for return. All 20 hail from Bangladesh and Egypt. On Friday, the non-governmental organizations released a detailed analysis of the procedures to screen migrants first on Italian naval ships, and then in the Albanian centers, to determine if they are 'vulnerable.' Only men deemed to be not 'vulnerable' are to be sent to Albania. The aid groups said there were no proper facilities or instruments to make such a determination. And regardless, practically everyone who has set off on the dangerous Mediterranean crossing has endured the type of physical, psychological or sexual abuse that should disqualify them from Albanian detention, they said. The migrants should be considered at risk of post-traumatic stress disorder or other serious physical and mental health consequences, they said. The groups criticized the international organizations that are apparently cooperating with the project, identifying the International Organization of Migration and the Knights of Malta’s Italian rescue corps as being 'complicit' in human rights violations. 'The Italy-Albania Protocol violates the code of medical ethics and human rights and puts the physical and psychological health of migrants at risk,' the statement said. There was no immediate reply to emails sent to the IOM or the Knights' press offices seeking comment. The Italian government has said the rights of the migrants would be fully guaranteed in the Albanian centers and the deal has been blessed by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen as an example of 'out-of-box thinking' to tackle the migration issue. But human rights groups say it sets a dangerous precedent and represents a violation of Italy's obligations under international law. The U.N. refugee agency has agreed to supervise the first three months of the agreement and one of its teams is conducting an 'independent mission' on board the transfer ship to monitor the screening process. The legal challenges have come despite the small number of people impacted so far. Even though the centers were built to house as many as 3,000 migrants a month, just 20 were transferred in the first two separate ship passages, only to be sent to Italy after the Rome courts intervened. The statement was signed by Doctors’ Without Borders, Emergency, Sea-Watch, SOS Mediterranee and other aid groups.	https://apnews.com/article/italy-albania-migration-ba37f514ca4cefab40047722006a2978	2024-11-15T05:59:54-08:00	
Germany's Scholz discusses Ukraine with Russia's Putin in first such call in 2 years	BERLIN (AP) — German Chancellor Olaf Scholz spoke Friday with Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Kremlin leader’s first publicly announced conversation with the sitting head of a major Western power in nearly two years. Scholz urged Putin to be open to negotiations with Ukraine, his office said. The Kremlin leader responded that any peace deal should acknowledge Russia's territorial gains and security demands, including that Kyiv renounce joining NATO. Government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said Scholz urged Putin in the hour-long call to withdraw his troops and end the full-scale invasion launched in February 2022. The conflict will reach its 1,000th day on Tuesday, and exiled Russian opposition leaders, including Alexei Navalny's widow, Yulia, have set an antiwar rally for Sunday in Berlin. 'The chancellor urged Russia to be willing to negotiate with Ukraine with the aim of achieving a just and lasting peace and stressed Germany’s unwavering determination to support Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression for as long as necessary,' Hebestreit said in a statement. The new communication between Scholz and Putin — their first since December 2022 — comes at a time of widespread speculation about what the new administration of President-elect Donald Trump will mean for Ukraine. Scholz faces a political crisis at home and has called for a vote of confidence next month, with an early election in February. Washington has been Ukraine's biggest military backer, but Trump has repeatedly questioned the amount of aid being given to Ukraine. While Trump has suggested he could settle the war quickly, Ukraine has ruled out giving up any territory to Moscow in return for peace. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy criticized Scholz’s call to Putin, calling it 'a Pandora’s box' and would only serve to make Russia less isolated. 'Now there may be other conversations, other calls. Just a lot of words. And this is exactly what Putin has wanted for a long time,' Zelenskyy said in his nightly address. 'It is crucial for him to weaken his isolation. ... And to engage in negotiations, ordinary negotiations, that will lead to nothing.' Scholz condemned Russian air raids on Ukrainian civilian infrastructure and warned that the deployment of North Korean troops to Russia to fight in the war would mark a serious escalation. The U.S., South Korea and Ukraine say North Korea has sent thousands of troops to Russia to support its war against Ukraine. The Kremlin said Germany initiated the call, during which the leaders had a 'detailed and frank exchange of opinions on the situation in Ukraine.' Putin blamed 'the current crisis' on what he called NATO’s 'long-standing aggressive policy aimed at creating an anti-Russian stronghold on Ukrainian territory while ignoring our country’s security interests and trampling on the rights of Russian-speaking residents,' a Kremlin readout said. Putin also said Russia remains open to resuming peace talks, pointing to conditions he laid out in June that included Kyiv renouncing its bid to join NATO and withdrawing troops from the four Ukrainian regions that Moscow illegally annexed in 2022. 'Possible agreements should take into account the interests of the Russian Federation in the security sphere, proceed from new territorial realities, and most importantly, eliminate the root causes of the conflict,' the readout said. Putin, who earlier this month said it's up to Western leaders to resume contact with Russia if they want, also noted the 'unprecedented degradation' in bilateral relations between Germany and Russia, the Kremlin statement said, while noting that leaders also discussed the situation in the Middle East. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the leaders had a 'detailed' and 'frank' exchange of opinions but added that 'there is no talk about convergence of opinions.' The two sides agreed to remain in contact after the call. ___ Associated Press writer Jamey Keaten contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/scholz-putin-germany-russia-phone-call-f18e42dc5418fb682682d7dae69483a5	2024-11-15T05:27:43-08:00	
Poland moves to reopen embassy in North Korea closed during COVID pandemic	WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Poland said Friday it is reactivating its embassy in North Korea’s capital to become the second Western nation after Sweden to resume operations that were suspended due to Pyongyang's tight COVID-19 restrictions. The move by NATO member Poland opens another channel of communication between NATO states and Pyongyang, a close ally of Russia, which has provided troops to fight in Ukraine. New NATO member Sweden resumed activity at its Pyongyang mission in September. Polish Foreign Ministry representatives were in the North Korean capital this week as Poland seeks to restore its diplomatic presence. 'The visit is of a technical and political nature and one of its main goals is to restore the permanent diplomatic presence,' the ministry said. The Polish embassy was closed in December 2020 after the North Korean authorities announced a complete closure of the state border due to COVID-19. That made the normal work of the diplomatic mission 'impossible,' the ministry said. Sweden, which became a NATO member in March, also represents the interests of other countries who don't have embassies in Pyongyang at its mission that reopened in September. The restored diplomatic channels will be helpful given developments in the war in Ukraine. NATO and the European Union — to which Poland and Sweden also both belong — have been ramping up efforts to persuade China to help get North Korea to stop sending troops and other support to Russia to back its war on Ukraine. Up to 12,000 North Korean troops have been sent to Russia’s Kursk border region to help beat back Ukrainian forces there, according to U.S., South Korean and Ukrainian intelligence assessments. NATO says Russia is sending missile technology to North Korea in return.	https://apnews.com/article/poland-embassy-reopens-north-korea-533adb5cd7d4d9454638e8f2a3c53548	2024-11-15T05:03:45-08:00	
Biden to meet South Korean and Japanese leaders amid growing worries about North Korea	LIMA, Peru (AP) — President Joe Biden is gathering South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba for talks Friday amid heightened concerns about North Korea’s growing military partnership with Russia and Pyongyang’s stepped-up cadence of ballistic missile tests. The meeting on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Peru comes as North Korea has deployed thousands of troops to Russia to help Moscow try to claw back land in the Kursk border region that Ukraine seized earlier this year. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un also ordered a series of ballistic missile tests in the lead-up to this month’s U.S. election and is claiming progress on efforts to build capability to strike the U.S. mainland. White House officials are concerned that Pyongyang could be dialed up for more provocative action ahead of President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration and the early days of his administration. 'I do not think we can count on a period of quiet with the DPRK,' said White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan, using the initials for North Korea's formal name. 'The possibility of a seventh nuclear test remains ever present and something we’re vigilant for. The transitions have historically been time periods when the DPRK has taken provocative actions both before and after the transition from one president to a new president.' The introduction of North Korean troops to the Russia-Ukraine conflict comes as Moscow has seen a favorable shift in momentum in the grinding war on its neighbor. Trump has signaled that he could push Ukraine to agree to give up some land seized by Russia to find an end to the conflict. Up to 12,000 North Korean troops have been sent to Russia, according to U.S., South Korean and Ukrainian intelligence assessments. U.S. and South Korean intelligence officials say North Korea also has provided Russia with significant amounts of munitions. South Korea’s spy agency said last month that North Korea had sent more than 13,000 containers of artillery, missiles and other conventional arms to Russia since August 2023 to replenish its dwindling weapons stockpiles. Sullivan said the U.S., Japanese and South Korean leaders would use their meeting to discuss the North Korean soldiers in Russia and ensure their three countries are acting in a 'coordinated way.' Friday’s meeting will be the first face-to-face engagement between Biden and Ishiba, who took office on Oct. 1, replacing his unpopular predecessor Fumio Kishida. Ishiba pledged to pursue a military buildup plan under a 2022 security strategy adopted by his predecessor, which calls for a counterstrike capability with long-range cruise missiles, a break from its self-defense only principle. Ishiba said he will seek to improve cooperation between Japanese and U.S. troops. The trilateral talks are a follow-up on a partnership launched at a historic 2023 meeting between Biden, Yoon and Kishida at the U.S. presidential retreat at Camp David, Maryland. Biden nudged Japan and South Korea to put aside years of historic animosity and strengthen economic and security ties as the countries confront the threat from North Korea as well increasing military assertiveness by China in the Pacific. The three countries signed a pledge agreeing to consult, share information and align their messaging with each other in the face of a threat or crisis. Sullivan said the Biden administration is working to ensure the three-country cooperation is 'an enduring feature of American policy.' He expects it would continue under Trump, noting its bipartisan support, but acknowledged it was up to the incoming president’s team. Both Yoon and Ishiba already have reached out to Trump and are aiming to keep their countries’ relationships with the incoming administration on steady footing amid the heightened tensions. North Korea fired a barrage of short-range ballistic missiles into the sea just hours before Election Day in the United States. Those launches came days after Kim supervised a flight test of the country’s newest intercontinental ballistic missile designed to reach the U.S. mainland. In response, the United States flew a long-range B-1B bomber in a trilateral drill with South Korea and Japan on Sunday in a show of force. Biden also will meet Peru President Dina Boluarte on Friday. ___ Associated Press writer Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/biden-south-korea-japan-north-korea-russia-24e1a85916b650c130c5b167cd3c8b79	2024-11-15T03:47:58-08:00	
Workers at Canada's national postal service go on strike Friday, disrupting deliveries	TORONTO (AP) — Workers at Canada's national postal service are on strike after failing to reach a negotiated agreement with Canada Post. The Canadian Union of Postal Workers said early Friday approximately 55,000 workers are striking, claiming little progress has been made in the bargaining process. The work stoppage will disrupt mail service ahead of the busy holiday season. The union issued a 72-hour strike notice earlier in the week, saying it’s been asking for fair wages, safer working conditions and other improvements over nearly a year of bargaining. 'We still believe we can achieve negotiated collective agreements, but Canada Post must be willing to resolve our new and outstanding issues,' CUPW said in a statement. Canada Post served the union with the lockout notice not long after but had said it didn’t intend to lock workers out. The government corporation released a statement early Friday morning confirming that customers will experience delays. Mail and parcels will not be delivered for the duration of the strike, and some post offices will be closed. Canada Post says shutting down facilities will affect its national network, with processing and delivery of mail possibly needing time to return to normal once the strike is over. Ahead of the strike deadline, federal Labor Minister Steven MacKinnon said he formally appointed the director general of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Services as a special mediator to help in the talks. 'We are making sure that these two groups have everything they need to reach a deal,' he said in a post on X.	https://apnews.com/article/canada-post-strike-national-mail-service-cupw-mackinnon-b74d2a5c128dc96540e72aa0f170b6b7	2024-11-15T03:40:45-08:00	
Police and protesters clash in Georgia's separatist Abkhazia region over pro-Moscow property measure	TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — Protesters opposing a measure that would have allowed Russians to buy property in the Georgian territory of Abkhazia stormed into the separatist region's parliament building and presidential office on Friday and clashed with police. At least eight people were injured in the melee in the regional capital of Sukhumi on the Black Sea, news reports said. The parliament was to have discussed ratifying the measure but postponed the session as the demonstrators gathered outside the gates of the government compound. They rammed a gate with a truck and streamed inside the grounds, throwing rocks at police who responded with tear gas. President Aslan Bzhania's office later announced he was preparing an order to remove the measure from consideration. Police then left the parliament building but demonstrators remained, demanding Bzhania's resignation. Demonstrators also stormed into the presidential administration building and vowed to remain there until Bzhania resigned and snap elections were called. Most of Abkhazia broke away from Georgia in fighting that ended in 1993, and Georgia lost control of the rest of the territory in the short war with Russia in 2008. Russia recognizes Abkhazia as an independent country, but many Abkhazians are concerned that the region of about 245,000 people is just a client state of Moscow. Opponents of the property agreement say it would drive up prices of apartments and boost Moscow's dominance in the region. Abkhazia's mountains and Black Sea beaches make it a popular destination for Russian tourists, and the demand for holiday homes could be strong. The arrest of five opposition figures at a similar demonstration Monday set off wide protests the next day in which bridges leading to Sukhumi were blocked.	https://apnews.com/article/georgia-russia-abkhazia-protest-parliament-ae03ce7d8335e6a20316a95d0f7acc84	2024-11-15T03:40:23-08:00	
Italian hotel manager rejects Israeli couple's reservation, accusing Israeli people of 'genocide'	ROME (AP) — The manager of a small hotel in northern Italy refused a reservation made by an Israeli couple, accusing Israeli people of being 'responsible for genocide.' Jewish groups decried the incident as an example of antisemitism. The couple had booked two nights for the beginning of November at the Hotel Garni Ongaro in Selva di Cadore, a mountain village surrounded by the Dolomites, using the Booking.com online reservation platform. A day before their departure, they received a message from the hotel’s staff: 'Good morning. We inform you that the Israeli people as those responsible for genocide are not welcome customers in our structure.' The hotel manager then invited the tourists to cancel their reservation, adding they 'would be happy to grant free cancellation.' The manager has since closed his Facebook profile, and he wasn't immediately available for comment. 'I feel infinite sadness for the ignorance shown by certain people,' Dario Calimani, the president of the Jewish Community of Venice, said on Thursday. 'When you don’t agree with what Israel does, you spread hatred against all Israelis.' The incident caught the attention of the Israeli Foreign Ministry, which has confirmed they were investigating the matter. Booking.com said Friday that it had removed the hotel from its platform. 'We do not tolerate discrimination of any kind and in the rare event that we are alerted to discriminatory behavior from a property, we investigate immediately and will remove the listing from our platform, just as we have done in this instance,' the travel site said in an email sent to The Associated Press. The Veneto region governor, Luca Zaia, dubbed the incident as 'extremely serious.' 'I feel deeply disturbed and I’m shocked by what has happened,' he said. 'Veneto must guarantee its doors are open to all.' Incidents of antisemitism have increased in Italy to about 80 or 90 a week in the last year, from about 30 a week before the war in Gaza started, the Antisemitism Observatory reported. Last month, a mural depicting a survivor of last year’s Oct. 7 attack by Hamas on Israel, which killed around 1,200 people in Israel, was vandalized in Milan. More than 43,000 people have been killed in Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, more than half of them women and children, according to Palestinian health officials, who don’t distinguish between civilians and combatants when recording the deaths. Word of the hotel incident came on the same day that former hostages held by Hamas in Gaza and their relatives met at the Vatican with Pope Francis. Sharone Lifshitz, whose father remains a hostage after her mother was freed last year, responded to a request for comment, saying it was wrong to consider all Israelis as agents of the Israeli government, just as it would be wrong to consider all Americans as agents of the U.S. government. The tendency to do that, she added, was a sign of antisemitism. 'Not all people agree with the current government of Italy, and yet I don’t think the people of Italy traveling the world would be subjected personally as individuals to the actions of their government,' she said. 'The government of Israel does many things that I personally and absolutely and categorically don’t agree with as an individual … and yet we are taken as agents of our government,' she said. 'I think antisemitism and the inability of many people to separate individuals from the state seems to be very much connected to the people of Israel and to Jewish people.' ___ Nicole Winfield contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/italy-hotel-dolomites-antisemitism-israel-gaza-genocide-52b2e0db193911ab3beaa998f2d3f3ec	2024-11-15T03:36:36-08:00	
Rafael Nadal's farewell at the Davis Cup: When he'll play, how to watch on TV and more to know	MALAGA, Spain (AP) — Rafael Nadal is getting set to retire from professional tennis after one last event: He will be part of Spain's team at the Davis Cup finals that start Tuesday in front of a home crowd in Malaga. The 38-year-old Nadal has been on tour for more than 20 years and is the second member of the so-called Big Three of men’s tennis to stop playing. Roger Federer announced his departure in 2022, while Novak Djokovic is still near the top of the game. 'It is obviously a difficult decision, one that has taken me some time to make. But in this life, everything has a beginning and an end,' said Nadal, who has been practicing daily in Malaga since last week. 'And I think it is the appropriate time to put an end to a career that has been long and much more successful than I could have ever imagined.' Here is a guide to Nadal's goodbye to tennis: How to watch Rafael Nadal and the rest of the Davis Cup on TV —In the U.S.: Tennis Channel —Other countries are listed here. When will Nadal play his final match? It's not entirely clear when Nadal's last match will come, in large part because the Davis Cup is a team event and what's now known as the 'Final 8' begins at the quarterfinal stage. Spain will get things started against the Netherlands on Tuesday. Win that, and the Spaniards would advance to the semifinals Friday against Canada or Germany (who meet each other Wednesday). The other quarterfinals are scheduled for Thursday: the United States vs. Australia, and defending champion Italy vs. Argentina. The championship round will be Sunday. There are two matches in singles and one in doubles in each matchup; the first country to win twice progresses. The other wild card in all of this: No one knows for sure whether Nadal will be chosen by Spain's captain, David Ferrer, to play singles, doubles, both or — theoretically possible, if unlikely — neither. 'If I really don’t see myself ready to have a chance of winning in singles,' Nadal said, 'I’ll be the first who won’t want to play.' Who are Nadal’s teammates on Spain’s Davis Cup team? Nadal is joined on Spain’s roster by four-time Grand Slam champion Carlos Alcaraz, Roberto Bautista Agut, Pedro Martinez and Marcel Granollers. Why is Nadal retiring now? The biggest reason he is ready to move on is that he has been bothered by a series of injuries, including a painful foot, abdominal muscle problems and a hip issue that required surgery last season. 'The reality is that it has been some difficult years, these last two especially,' Nadal said. 'I don’t think I have been able to play without limitations.' When was Nadal’s most recent match? Nadal has not played much at all each of the last two seasons because of injuries; he's just 12-7 in 2024. His most recent official competition anywhere came in early August at the Paris Olympics, where he lost to his longtime rival — and eventual gold medalist — Djokovic in the second round of singles, and reached the doubles quarterfinals alongside Alcaraz before bowing out. Nadal also played two exhibition matches in Saudi Arabia last month. How many Grand Slam titles did Nadal win? Nadal finishes with 22 Grand Slam singles titles, behind only Djokovic's 24 among men in the history of tennis, and ahead of Federer's 20. The breakdown: 14 at the French Open, four at the U.S. Open, two at Wimbledon, two at the Australian Open. Nadal's last major championship came in Paris in 2022, when he needed nerve-numbing injections in his left foot. Has Nadal helped Spain win the Davis Cup in the past? Nadal has been a part of Spain's team at some stage of the Davis Cup during five years when the country won the title — in 2004, 2008, 2009, 2011 and 2019. That first title came after a teenage Nadal defeated then-No. 2-ranked Andy Roddick as Spain got past the U.S. 'I am very excited that my last tournament will be the final of the Davis Cup and representing my country,' Nadal said. 'I think I’ve come full circle, because one of my first great joys as a professional tennis player was the Davis Cup final in Seville in 2004.' ___ AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis	https://apnews.com/article/rafael-nadal-retirement-davis-cup-watch-guide-78e557ac78e8a3ea2cfbca9fbadfcfa8	2024-11-15T02:00:25-08:00	
Lebanon's prime minister asks Iran to help secure a cease-fire in Israel-Hezbollah war	BEIRUT (AP) — Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister on Friday asked Iran to help secure a cease-fire in the war between Israel and Hezbollah and appeared to urge it to convince the militant group to agree to a deal that could require it to pull back from the Israel-Lebanon border. The prime minister made the comments in talks with Ali Larijani, a top adviser to Iran’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei. Larijani’s visit to Lebanon comes as the United States continued pushing both sides to agree to a deal to end 13 months of exchanges of fire between Israel and Hezbollah. Iran is a main backer of Hezbollah and for decades has been funding and arming the Lebanese militant group. Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel the day after Hamas’ surprise attack into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023 ignited the war in Gaza – prompting exchanges between the two sides ever since. Since late September, Israel dramatically escalated its bombardment of Lebanon, vowing to cripple Hezbollah and end its barrages in Israel. More than 3,300 people have been killed in Lebanon by Israeli fire – 80% of them in the past month -- Lebanon’s Health Ministry says. According to Lebanese media, U.S. Ambassador Lisa Johnson handed over a draft of a proposed cease-fire deal to Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, who has been leading the talks representing Hezbollah. A Lebanese official confirmed that Beirut has received a copy of a draft proposal based on U.N. Security Council resolution 1701, which ended the last Israel-Hezbollah war, in the summer of 2006. That resolution, among other things, said that only the Lebanese army and U.N. peacekeepers should operate in southern Lebanon, meaning Hezbollah would have to end its presence there. That provision was never implemented. Lebanon accuses Israel of also violating the resolution by maintaining hold of a small, disputed border area and conducting frequent military overflights over Lebanon. The Lebanese official did not give details other than to say Israel was insisting that some guarantees be included. The official spoke on condition of anonymity, because they weren’t authorized to speak to the media about the ongoing talks. The U.S. Embassy refused to either confirm or deny the reports. In talks with Larijani, caretaker Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati urged Iran to help implement resolution 1701. He said the Lebanese government wants the war to end and the resolution to be implemented 'in all its details,' according to a statement on the talks issued by his office. Mikati, who in recent weeks has become more critical of Iran’s role in Lebanon, also said the government wants Iran to help Lebanon’s national unity and not take any stance backing one party against another. Iran’s backing for Hezbollah has helped the group, which is the most powerful faction among Lebanon’s Shiite Muslims, dominate the country’s politics the last decade. After meeting Mikati and Berri, Larijani said his visit’s main aim was 'to loudly say that we will stand by Lebanon’s government and people.' Asked if he was trying to thwart U.S. cease-fire mediation, Larijani said, 'We are not trying to blow up any effort, but we want to solve the problem and we will stand by Lebanon, whatever the circumstances.' Larijani held similar talks a day earlier in Syria with President Bashar Assad. Syria’s state news agency said that Assad and Larijani discussed the 'ongoing aggression on Palestine and Lebanon and the necessity of stopping it.' While Larijani was in Beirut, Israeli forces carried out a new strike on the southeastern edge of the city. Images taken by an Associated Press photographer showed a rocket about to strike an 11-story residential building in Beirut’s Tayouneh neighborhood – then a blast of flame erupts from the side of the building. Much of a lower level of the building was smashed to rubble. There were no immediate reports of casualties. The Israeli military had issued a warning before the attack, saying it was a facility that belonged to Hezbollah. Near the eastern Lebanese city of Baalbek, rescue teams continued searching through the rubble Friday at the site of an Israeli strike the night before that hit a civil defense center in the town of Douris. So far, the bodies of 13 employees and volunteers with the Lebanese Civil Defense had a been recovered, the agency said, as well as some other remains that will require DNA testing. Israel expanded its operations in Lebanon even as it continues its campaign in the Gaza Strip, vowing to destroy Hamas, which is also backed by Iran. Funerals were held Friday for 11 Palestinians killed Thursday in a series of Israeli airstrikes in and around the central Gaza Strip city of Deir al-Balah. Two children were among the dead, seen with the other dead by an AP reporter. On Thursday, the U.N. Security Council’s 10 elected members circulated a draft resolution demanding 'an immediate, unconditional and permanent cease-fire' in Gaza. The U.S., Israel’s closest ally, holds the key to whether the U.N. Security Council adopts the resolution. The four other permanent members — Russia, China, Britain and France — are expected to support it or abstain. The Israel-Hamas war began after Palestinian militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing about 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. Israel’s bombardment and ground offensives since then have killed more than 43,000 people in Gaza, Palestinian health officials say. The officials don’t distinguish between civilians and combatants but say more than half of those killed have been women and children. ___ Rising reported from Bangkok.

At least 10 people were killed in a fire at a nursing home in northeastern Spain	MADRID (AP) — At least 10 people died and others were injured in a blaze at a nursing home near Zaragoza in northeastern Spain, before firefighters managed to extinguish the flames, local authorities said Friday. The alarm was raised just before 5 a.m. on Friday in Villafranca de Ebro, about 28 kilometers (18 miles) from the city of Zaragoza. Two people remained in critical condition, officials said. The cause of the fire was not yet known. Local media said 82 people had been living in the Jardines De Villafranca nursing home, which focused on treating people with dementia and mental health issues. Jorge Azcón, head of the regional government of Aragon — which includes Villafranca de Ebro, population 840 — told reporters outside the nursing home that an investigation would be opened into the cause of the fire. The immediate priority was to transfer the remaining uninjured residents to other facilities, he said, including one in the city of Huesca, about 90 kilometers (56 miles) away. Volga Ramírez, mayor of Villafranca de Ebro, told reporters that intense smoke from the blaze was likely responsible for the deaths. 'It is due to smoke inhalation,' Ramírez said, 'not because they were burned.' She said that the remaining residents of the center had been safely evacuated. Zaragoza fire chief Eduardo Sánchez told reporters that firefighters had extinguished the blaze that came from one room of the center. A fire door had prevented the blaze from spreading to the other half of the building, he said. On X, formerly Twitter, Azcón announced that all government events in the Aragon region were cancelled for the day. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez wrote on X that he was 'shocked by the tragedy' and expressed condolences to the victims. The fire took place just weeks after devastating flash floods in the Spanish region of Valencia killed more than 200 people and destroyed thousands of homes. The floods were the worst natural disaster in Spain's recent history.	https://apnews.com/article/spain-fire-nursing-home-zaragoza-065863dafb5fbedbd4692131e0d1e540	2024-11-14T23:17:02-08:00	
UK economic growth slows down sharply in the third quarter	LONDON (AP) — U.K. economic growth slowed down sharply in the third quarter of the year, official figures showed Friday. The Office for National Statistics said growth during the July to September period was just 0.1%. That was lower than the 0.5% recorded in the previous three-month period and below market expectations for 0.2%. The statistics agency said output in September shrank, a development that is likely to fuel accusations from critics of the new Labour government talked the economy down in its first few weeks in power. Labour, which took office in July for the first time in 14 years, has made raising economic growth its number one priority over the next five years. Since the global financial crisis in 2008-9, the British economy has underperformed relative to previous years.	https://apnews.com/article/britain-growth-labour-economy-reeves-output-q3-53fbbd31d5b959e94b453455a3b6823d	2024-11-14T22:38:53-08:00	
Shanghai, Tokyo, New York, Houston spew most greenhouse gas of world cities	BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) — Cities in Asia and the United States emit the most heat-trapping gas that feeds climate change, with Shanghai the most polluting, according to new data that combines observations and artificial intelligence. Seven states or provinces spew more than 1 billion metric tons of greenhouse gases, all of them in China, except Texas, which ranks sixth, according to new data from an organization co-founded by former U.S. Vice President Al Gore and released Friday at the United Nations climate talks in Baku, Azerbaijan. Nations at the talks are trying to set new targets to cut such emissions, and figure out how much rich nations will pay to help the world with that task. Using satellite and ground observations, supplemented by artificial intelligence to fill in gaps, Climate Trace sought to quantify heat-trapping carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, as well as other traditional air pollutants worldwide, including for the first time in more than 9,000 urban areas. Earth's total carbon dioxide and methane pollution grew 0.7% to 61.2 billion metric tons with the short-lived but extra potent methane rising 0.2%. The figures are higher than other datasets 'because we have such comprehensive coverage and we have observed more emissions in more sectors than are typically available,' said Gavin McCormick, Climate Trace's co-founder. Plenty of big cities emit far more than some nations Shanghai's 256 million metric tons of greenhouse gases led all cities and exceeded those from the nations of Colombia or Norway. Tokyo's 250 million metric tons would rank in the top 40 of nations if it were a country, while New York City's 160 million metric tons and Houston's 150 million metric tons would be in the top 50 of countrywide emissions. Seoul, South Korea, ranks fifth among cities at 142 million metric tons. 'One of the sites in the Permian Basin in Texas is by far the No. 1 worst polluting site in the entire world,' Gore said. 'And maybe I shouldn’t have been surprised by that, but I think of how dirty some of these sites are in Russia and China and so forth. But Permian Basin is putting them all in the shade.' China, India, Iran, Indonesia and Russia had the biggest increases in emissions from 2022 to 2023, while Venezuela, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States had the biggest decreases in pollution. The dataset — maintained by scientists and analysts from various groups — also looked at traditional pollutants such as carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds, ammonia, sulfur dioxide and other chemicals associated with dirty air. Burning fossil fuels releases both types of pollution, Gore said. This 'represents the single biggest health threat facing humanity,' Gore said. Climate talks wrestle with fossil fuel interests Gore criticized the hosting of climate talks, called COPs, by Azerbaijan, an oil nation and site of the world's first oil wells, and by the United Arab Emirates last year. 'It’s unfortunate that the fossil fuel industry and the petrostates have seized control of the COP process to an unhealthy degree,' Gore said. 'Next year in Brazil, we’ll see a change in that pattern. But, you know, it’s not good for the world community to give the No. 1 polluting industry in the world that much control over the whole process.' Brazil President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has called for more to be done on climate change and has sought to slow deforestation since returning for a third term as president. But Brazil last year produced more oil than both Azerbaijan and the United Arab Emirates, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. At a press conference Friday by the Alliance of Small Island States, it's Chair, Cedric Schuster, said the negotiating bloc feels the need to remind everyone else why the talks matter. 'We’re here to defend the Paris agreement,' Schuster said, referring to the climate deal in 2015 to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit). 'We’re concerned that countries are forgetting that protecting the world’s most vulnerable is at the core of this framework.' ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

South Korean opposition leader gets a suspended jail term for violating election law	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korean opposition leader Lee Jae-myung was convicted of violating election law and sentenced to a suspended prison term Friday by a court that ruled he made false statements while denying corruption allegations during a presidential campaign. If it stands, the ruling could significantly shake up the country’s politics by potentially unseating Lee as a lawmaker and denying him a shot at running for president in the next election. But Lee, who faces three other trials over corruption and other criminal charges, is expected to challenge any guilty verdict and it remains unclear whether the Supreme Court would decide on any of the cases before the presidential vote in March 2027. Lee told reporters that he plans to appeal Friday’s verdict at the Seoul Central District Court, which gave him a sentence of one year in prison, suspended for two years. Under South Korean law, Lee would lose his legislative seat and be barred from running in elections for five years if he receives either a penalty exceeding a 1 million won ($715) fine for election law violations or any prison sentence for other crimes. 'There are still two more courts left in the real world, and the courts of public opinion and history are eternal,' he said, apparently referring to plans to take the case to the Supreme Court. 'This is a conclusion that’s impossible to accept.' Lee, a firebrand liberal who narrowly lost the 2022 election to conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol, had steadfastly denied wrongdoing. Choo Kyung-ho, the floor leader of Yoon’s People Power Party, said the verdict showed that 'justice was alive' and called for the judiciary to conclude the case swiftly. The ruling drew intense media coverage and seemingly thousands of protesters. Surrounded by police lines, Lee’s supporters and critics occupied separate streets near the court, shouting opposing slogans and holding signs that said 'Lee Jae-myung is innocent' and 'Arrest Lee Jae-myung.' There were no immediate reports of major clashes. Prosecutors indicted Lee in 2022 over charges that he made false claims related to two controversial development projects in the city of Seongnam, where he was mayor from 2010 to 2018, while campaigning as the presidential candidate for the Democratic Party. One of the comments cited by prosecutors is related to suspicions that Seongnam city in 2015 changed the land-use designation to allow a housing project on a site previously preserved as green space due to lobbying by private developers. Lee said during a parliamentary hearing in October 2021 that the city was instead 'coerced' by the national government to make the change to the site in the district of Baekhyeon-dong. Prosecutors say there’s no evidence to back Lee’s claim, which has been denied by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. Prosecutors also cited a TV interview Lee gave in December 2021, when he said he didn’t know a senior official at Seongnam city’s urban development arm during his time as mayor. Lee spoke a day after the official was found dead amid an investigation into a property development project in the district of Daejang-dong, which reaped huge profits for a small asset management firm and its affiliates and raised suspicions about possible corrupt links between them, city officials and politicians. Prosecutors argued that Lee was lying to the public to distance himself from the controversies and improve his chances of winning the election. They had sought a two-year prison sentence for him. The court found Lee guilty over the comments related to the Baekhyeon-dong project, saying it was clear that the city’s decision to change the site’s land-use designation wasn’t based on demands by the land ministry. It acquitted Lee on most of the charges related to his Daejang-dong comments, citing a lack of evidence. 'When false information is distributed to voters during an election process, that could prevent voters from making proper choices and risks distorting the will of the people and damaging the function of the electoral system,' the court said in a statement. 'Such actions cannot be taken lightly.' The same court on Nov. 25 will rule on another case against Lee. He is accused of suborning perjury by allegedly pressuring a Seongnam city employee to give false testimony in a different court case in 2019. The testimony was meant to downplay his 2003 conviction that, when as a lawyer, he had helped a TV journalist impersonate a prosecutor to secure an interview with then-Seongnam Mayor Kim Byung-ryang over suspected corruption in 2002. While running for Gyeonggi Province governor in 2018, Lee claimed he had been wrongly accused over the incident, prompting prosecutors to indict him on a charge of making false statements during an election campaign. Lee was acquitted in 2019, partially based on the testimony of the city employee, who had worked as Kim's secretary and said he contemplated dropping charges against the journalist to make Lee the main culprit of the incident. Prosecutors indicted Lee on the perjury charges in October last year, presenting transcripts of telephone conversations that they said showed Lee persuading the employee to testify in court that he was framed. A third and more significant trial at the Seoul Central District Court involves various criminal allegations stemming from Lee’s days as Seongnam mayor, including that he provided unlawful favors to private investors involved in the two development projects seen as dubious. Lee is also facing a trial at the Suwon District Court over allegations that he pressured a local businessman into sending millions of dollars in illegal payments to North Korea as he tried to set up a visit to that country that never materialized. While denying wrongdoing, Lee has accused the government of Yoon, a prosecutor-turned-president, of pursuing a political vendetta. Yoon, who has seen his approval ratings drop to the 20s in recent weeks, is grappling with his own political scandal. It centers around allegations that Yoon and first lady Kim Keon Hee exerted inappropriate influence on the People Power Party to pick a certain candidate to run for a parliamentary by-election in 2022 at the request of election broker Myung Tae-kyun, who was arrested this week.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korean-opposition-leader-lee-jae-myung-suspended-prison-sentence-321aa7e383e409edff4bd5924ad73776	2024-11-14T21:44:07-08:00	
Van falls off mountain highway in Nepal, killing 8 and injuring 4	KATHMANDU, Nepal (AP) — A passenger van veered off a mountain road early Friday in western Nepal, killing eight people and injuring four others, the army said. The van rolled about 200 meters (650 feet) below the road before dawn near the village of Shaileshikar, about 600 kilometers (375 miles) west of the capital, Kathmandu. The van was returning to the village with people who had been to a festival in a nearby town. The army said it used a helicopter to rescue the four injured people and flew them to a hospital for treatment. It was not clear what caused the crash. Nepal is covered with mountains where roads are narrow and poorly maintained, and autumn and winter weather conditions also make driving difficult and dangerous.	https://apnews.com/article/nepal-passenger-van-crash-2921bdf81b26bcb920a7f077e9d1e6fb	2024-11-14T21:09:44-08:00	
Activists at COP29 spend weeks planning demos. But they can feel stifled by rules and restrictions	BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) — In the nosebleed seats of a nearly-empty Baku Olympic stadium coated with a layer of dust, activists used a giant banner to beam the words 'Pay Up' to the world. The protest took weeks of thought and planning, but most of the attendees at this year's U.N. climate talks didn't see or hear it — except for maybe some in the COP29 presidency offices right below. The majority of the people involved in deciding the financial future of climate action at the talks remained in the sprawling venue, under white tarps with no windows. It’s 'really hard to make our demands heard,' said Bianca Castro, a climate activist from Portugal. She’s been to several COPs in the past and remembers years when there were thousands of protestors in the streets, and a multitude of strikes and actions throughout the event. But at the stadium's seats, they were told exactly where and when they could stand and chants were restricted. A United Nations climate change spokesperson said that the action was in a part of the venue that isn’t open to participants, and involved extensive dialogue among the participants, facility managers and health and safety officers. Still, Castro said the difficulty of making an impact meant many are 'losing hope in the in the process.' People involved in protests say they have felt a trend in recent years of stricter rules from the United Nations organizers with COPs being held in countries whose governments limit demonstrations and the participation of civil society. And some community spaces for prepping and organizing have had to resort to going underground because of security concerns. But the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change — who run the COPs — say the code of conduct that governs the conferences has not changed, nor has the way it's applied, and COP29 organizers say there's space across the venue for participants to 'make their voices heard in line with the UNFCCC code of conduct and Azerbaijan law safely and without interference.' Despite the challenges and what some see as a depressing mood, activists say it remains a critical time to speak up about the historical and present-day injustices that are in desperate need of money and attention. It's especially true this year at a COP where the theme is finance, because voices from the Global South play a pivotal role in bringing ambitious demands to the negotiating table, said Rachitaa Gupta, who coordinates a global network of organizations advocating for climate justice. But she said that there have been more and more defamation rules each year that prohibit protestors from calling out specific countries or names. 'We do feel that the restrictions have reached a stage where it’s a constant battle on what we can say,' Gupta said. Activists can’t name specific countries, people or businesses in line with the UNFCCC’s code of conduct. Meanwhile, across town in a downtown Baku building, activists paint, snip fabric and sculpt with cardboard and papier-mache in a quest for visually compelling symbols of climate action. The art space was once a place of community, where people came to pour their feelings into a creative outlet, said Amalen Sathananthar, coordinator at a collective called the Artivist Network. But now his team keeps the art space private and doesn't reveal its location because of security concerns. Restrictions, though, can breed creativity among the artists designing the banners, flags and props that demonstrators use during protests. In the absence of naming specific people or countries, or carrying country flags, they instead have to come up with other imagery to get their messages across. One of this year’s pieces was a larger-than-life snake for an action with the slogan 'Weed Out the Snakes,' calling attention for the removal of big polluters and fossil fuel lobbyists at climate talks, something that's been 'outrageous,' said Jax Bongon, whose organization is part of the Kick Big Polluters Out coalition. 'Would you invite an arsonist to put out the fire?' It's an issue that's 'particularly hard for me as someone from the Philippines,' Bongon added, but called it 'really uplifting' to watch the action come together despite challenges. Demonstrators hoisted the fire-colored serpent with on their shoulders and heads. Together, their hisses filled the tent, bringing the snake to life. 'I think that the only reason people dare to do this is because, one, they're struggling on how to be heard,' said Dani Rupa, one of the artists working in Baku with The Artivist Network. 'But, two, that there is like creative support for them to be able to do this.' The Artivist Network have been doing this for a long time, attending COPs unofficially since the early 2000s and officially since they formalized in 2018. Sathananthar's seen the multitude of ways protestors have had to argue with host countries and the UNFCCC governing body to get space for activism. But this year, especially, he said it's a struggle — 'negotiations within negotiations' that have had Sathananthar staying up late into the night in talks and on occasion have left him 'fuming.' A spokesperson for UNFCCC said they've 'been a recognized global leader in ensuring safe civic spaces at COPs for many years' which normally doesn't happen at other intergovernmental events. Still, activists feel that only being able to protest within certain areas throughout the venue — when previous years have seen mass street marches in host cities — can be frustrating. 'Every action you now have to fight for desperately,' Sathananthar said. 'We fought to get these spaces and we will fight to keep them.' ___ Follow Melina Walling on X at @MelinaWalling.

Trump's pick of Rubio as America's top diplomat jolts Latin America, long accustomed to US neglect	MIAMI (AP) — Growing up in Miami among Cuban exiles who fled Fidel Castro's revolution, Sen. Marco Rubio developed a deep hatred of communism. Now as President-elect Donald Trump's choice for America's top diplomat, he's set to bring that same ideological ammunition to reshaping U.S. policy in Latin America. As the first Latino secretary of state, Rubio is expected to devote considerable attention to what has long been disparagingly referred to as Washington’s backyard. The top Republican on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and a longtime member of the Foreign Relations Committee, he's leveraged his knowledge and unmatched personal relationships to drive U.S. policy in the region for years. For decades since the end of the Cold War, Latin America has faded from the U.S. foreign policy agenda even as U.S. adversaries like Russia, Iran and especially China have made deep inroads. If confirmed, the Florida Republican is likely to end the neglect. But Rubio’s reputation as a national security hawk, embrace of Trump’s plan for mass deportation of migrants and knack for polarizing rhetoric is likely to alienate even some U.S. allies in the region unwilling to fall in line with the incoming president’s America First foreign policy. 'Typically, Latin America policy is left to junior officers,' said Christopher Sabatini, a research fellow at Chatham House in London. 'But Rubio’s reflexes are firmly focused on the region. He’ll be paying attention, and governments are going to have to be more cooperative in their larger relationship with the U.S. if they want to draw close.' Rubio, through a Senate spokeswoman, declined to comment about his foreign policy goals. But his views on Latin America are well known and contrast sharply with the Biden administration’s preference for multilateral diplomacy and dialogue with U.S. critics. Taking cues from his boss, Rubio's main focus in the region is likely to be Mexico, on trade, drug trafficking and migration. Once a sponsor of bipartisan reforms allowing undocumented migrants a path to citizenship, Rubio transformed himself during Trump's first administration into a loyal supporter of his calls for increased border security and mass deportation. Rubio has said little about Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who took office last month. But he was a fierce critic of her predecessor, Andres Manuel López Obrador, who in 2022 defiantly skipped the U.S.-organized Summit of the Americas in Los Angeles for a gathering of leftist leaders in Cuba. Rubio accused López Obrador of capitulating to drug cartels and serving as an 'apologist for tyranny' in Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua. The Mexican president responded by calling Rubio a 'racist.' Despite the snub, the Mexican president was welcomed by President Joe Biden to the White House three weeks later as a 'friend' and 'partner.' 'That won’t happen under Rubio,' said Sabatini. 'He keeps close tabs on who is following his policy preferences.' Rubio, 53, has long had Trump's ear on Latin America — and hasn't hesitated to use that access to promote his hard-line agenda. He's been one of the most outspoken critics of Russian and Chinese economic, political and military outreach in the region, and is expected to punish countries who cozy up to America's geopolitical rivals, or those who fail to support Israel. When Trump canceled what would have been his first presidential visit to Latin America in 2018, Rubio was there to fill the void, sitting for meetings and photo ops at the Summit of the Americas in Peru with regional leaders from Argentina, Haiti and elsewhere. 'There's nobody in the U.S. Senate who comes close to having his affinity and depth of knowledge on Latin America,' said Carlos Trujillo, Rubio's close friend and former U.S. ambassador to the Organization of American States. 'Not only does he have personal relationships with dozens of officials, some of them for decades, but he has vetted almost every U.S. ambassador deployed to the region. It's a significant advantage.' Among those eager to work with Rubio is Argentine President Javier Milei, whose combative style, attacks on institutions and transformation from TV personality to far-right leader have drawn comparisons with Trump. Another ally is El Salvador's Nayib Bukele, whose crackdown on gang violence that once drove millions of Salvadoran migrants to the U.S. has drawn praise from Rubio. Rubio hasn't hesitated to use his power to bully leftist leaders he sees as harming U.S. national security interests. Even democratically elected moderates have been targets. Earlier this year, he slammed Chilean President Gabriel Boric, a critic of Israel's actions in Gaza, for allegedly providing safe haven for Hezbollah financiers, calling him 'one of the leading anti-Israel voices in Latin America.' In 2023, he called Colombian President Gustavo Petro, a former member of the M-19 guerrilla group, a 'dangerous' choice to lead a country that has been the longtime U.S. partner in the war on drugs. But it is on Venezuela that Rubio has left his biggest mark. Within weeks of Trump taking office in January 2017, Rubio brought the wife of prominent Venezuelan dissident Leopoldo Lopez to the White House. The Oval Office visit, marked by a photo of a grinning Trump and Rubio flanking the then jailed activist’s wife, immediately thrust Venezuela to the top of the U.S. foreign policy agenda, in a break from previous U.S. administrations efforts to keep a distance from the nation's troubles. Over the next two years, Trump slapped crushing oil sanctions on Venezuela, charged numerous officials with corruption and began talking of a 'military option' to remove President Nicolás Maduro. In 2019, at the height of Rubio’s influence, the U.S. recognized National Assembly President Juan Guaidó as the country’s legitimate leader. But the combative stance — popular among exiles in South Florida — came to haunt Trump, who later recognized he had overestimated the opposition. By strengthening Maduro's hand, it also paved the way for deeper Russian, Chinese and Iranian interests in the country, all the while aggravating a humanitarian crisis that led millions to uproot, with many migrating to the U.S. Michael Shifter, the former president of the Inter-American Dialogue in Washington, believes Trump may prove more forgiving of Maduro this time, even with Rubio heading the State Department, and continue the path of engagement and sanctions relief pursued by the Biden administration. 'Trump may begin to treat Maduro as he typically treats other strongmen around the world, and cater a bit less to the Cuban-American exile community in Florida,' Shifter said. Trujillo said Rubio's reputation for candor will serve him well negotiating with America's friends and foes alike, even if he has to temper his sometimes-heated rhetoric. 'He's going to be playing a different role now, but he's an exceptional negotiator and I have no doubt he will rise to the occasion,' Trujillo said. With Trump's selection of another vocal Maduro critic, Rep. Michael Waltz of Florida, as his national security adviser, Trujillo said the Venezuelan leader and his authoritarian allies in Cuba and Nicaragua should be worried. So far, officials in Venezuela and Cuba, who routinely criticize the U.S. on social media, haven’t commented on Rubio’s nomination and have remained largely muted on Trump’s victory. 'There is an opportunity to negotiate but it will have to be in good faith,' Trujillo said. 'If they don't, there will be consequences.' ___ Mark Stevenson and Maria Verza in Mexico City, and Isabel DeBre in Buenos Aires, Argentina, contributed to this report	https://apnews.com/article/marco-rubio-trump-latin-america-secretary-of-state-87aff0ce93f638fb69e30b067ecd84fb	2024-11-14T20:41:31-08:00	
As airlines avoid Israel, UAE's FlyDubai and Etihad keep up flights for both diplomacy and dollars	BEN GURION INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, Israel (AP) — At Israel's Ben Gurion International Airport, more than a year of war has taken its toll. Global airlines have canceled flights, gates are empty and pictures of hostages still held in the Gaza Strip guide the few arriving passengers to baggage claim. But one check-in desk remains flush with travelers: the one serving flights to the United Arab Emirates, which have kept up a bridge for Israelis to the outside world throughout the war. The Emirati flights, in addition to bolstering the airlines' bottom line, have shined a light on the countries’ burgeoning ties — which have survived the wars raging across the Middle East and could be further strengthened as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump prepares to return to office. 'It’s a political and economic statement,' said Joshua Teitelbaum, a professor of Middle Eastern studies at Israel’s Bar-Ilan University. 'They are the main foreign airlines that continue to fly.' Since the wars began with Hamas’ initial Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, many international airlines have halted, restarted and halted again their flights into Israel’s main gateway to the rest of the world. The concern is real for the carriers, who remember the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over Ukraine 10 years ago and Iran shooting down Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 after takeoff from Tehran in 2020. But FlyDubai, the sister airline to the long-haul carrier Emirates, has kept up multiple flights daily and kept Israel connected to the wider world even as its other low-cost competitors have stopped flights. Abu Dhabi’s Etihad has continued its flights as well. While maintaining the flight schedule remains politically important for the UAE after its 2020 diplomatic recognition of Israel, it also provided a further shot in the arm for revenues — particularly for FlyDubai. Since the wars started, international carriers such as Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines Inc., Germany’s Lufthansa and other major airlines halted their flights. Some resumed, only to stop again after Iran’s Oct. 1 ballistic missile attack on Israel and Israel’s Oct. 26 retaliatory strike on the Islamic Republic. Tehran has threatened to strike Israel again. That’s brought major business to Israel's national carrier El Al, which had struggled in the coronavirus pandemic and prior years. The airline posted its best-ever half-year results this year, recording a $227 million profit as compared to $58 million profit in the same period last year. El Al stock has risen by as much 200% over the last year, as compared to a 29% rise in the wider Tel Aviv 125 stock market index. El Al, however, lacks the routes and connections of major international carriers. Low-cost carriers as well have stopped flying into Israel during periods of the war, sending the price of El Al tickets ever higher. Passenger numbers through Ben Gurion halved compared to the same period the year before, El Al said in its second-quarter financial results. However, FlyDubai has kept flying. The carrier has operated over 1,800 flights to Israel since October last year, cancelling only 77 flights overall, according to Cirium, an aviation analytics company. In September alone, it flew over 200 flights. As a line snaked toward the FlyDubai check-in counters at Ben Gurion Airport, UAE-bound Motti Eis said the flights were 'a symbol that the Emirates countries decided to keep the peace.' FlyDubai declined to answer questions from The Associated Press about the flights. Etihad, the flag carrier for Abu Dhabi, has kept flying into Tel Aviv, but the number of its flights has been dwarfed by FlyDubai. FlyDubai had 3.6% market share at Ben Gurion, compared to El Al’s 43.2% in the second half of 2024. However, at least two of the foreign low-cost airlines with greater market, Wizz Air and Blue Bird, stopped flying for extended periods this year. Etihad said it maintains a close watch on the situation in the region, but continues its daily flights to and from Tel Aviv. 'Ben Gurion International Airport remains open, employing best practices in safety and security practices, enabling Etihad and other airlines to provide essential air connectivity as long as it is secure to do so,' the airline said in a statement. But beyond the financial impact, the decision also takes root in the UAE’s decision to recognize Israel in 2020, under agreements brokered by then President Trump known as the Abraham Accords. While Abu Dhabi has repeatedly expressed concern and outrage as Israel’s conduct during the wars, Israel’s Consulate in Dubai and Embassy remain open in the country. And while Dubai broadly speaking remains focused on business in the country, Abu Dhabi’s focus long has been on its geopolitical aims — which since the 2011 Arab Spring have been squarely focused on challenging Islamist movements, and those who back them, in the wider region. The UAE, a hereditary autocracy, long has viewed those groups as serious challenges to its power. The Emirati government, in response to questions from the AP over the flights, sent a story published by its state-run WAM news agency about its participation in a Nov. 1 conference in Riyadh in support of a two-state solution to the decadeslong Israel-Palestinian crisis. The UAE has called repeatedly for a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip, along with the release of hostages and Palestinian prisoners. However, likely given the wider anger in the Arab world over Israel’s devastating militant campaign in Gaza, Dubai International Airport no longer advertises on its electronic billboard the location of the check-in for Tel Aviv. It sits in a distant corner of one of the airport’s terminals, next to a Dubai police stand. Private security guards also keep watch over the line, while individuals who appeared to be undercover police officers watched the gate, a higher level of security than normally noticed at the airport. But in the lines, Hebrew and Arabic can be heard and those traveling routinely have their blue-backed Israeli passports out in their hands. 'It’s just a symbol of the UAE’s commitment to the relationship,' said Dina Esfandiary, a senior advisor on the Middle East at the International Crisis Group, a think tank. 'No matter what happens, no matter where the war goes, no matter how much Israel flouts international law, the UAE has decided that this is a step they took, that the relationship remains beneficial to them.' ___ Goldenberg reported from Tel Aviv, Israel.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-flydubai-el-al-airlines-816f5ac4fe206d35889989f0d40feda5	2024-11-14T20:15:32-08:00	
APEC leaders to open Lima summit as Trump prepares to return to office	LIMA, Peru (AP) — Representatives from 21 members representing the Pacific Rim are meeting in Peru on Friday for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, the first global summit since U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s victory featuring several major world leaders. The annual gathering brings together countries and members that jointly account for almost two-thirds of global GDP and half the world's trade, according to organizers. They confirmed heads of government attending in Lima include outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden, China's President Xi Jinping, Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Indonesia's President Prabowo Subianto, Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, among others, as the world wonders how a new U.S. government might upend global dynamics. Leaders and other representatives will hold closed-door discussions in the morning among themselves, and in the afternoon with members of APEC's business advisory council. The council met Wednesday and called on APEC nations and members to boost inclusive growth and prioritize the needs of micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises, particularly those led by women and Indigenous entrepreneurs. 'While the global economy remains resilient, APEC economies are grappling with persistent inflation, economic disparities, high interest rates and the urgent need to increase investments for a green, climate-resilient future,' said council chairwoman Julia Torreblanca. APEC is bound to be one of Biden's last before leaving office, and White House officials insist that his attendance as well as his subsequent visit to Brazil for the Group of 20 meeting next week will be substantive, with talks to focus on climate issues, global infrastructure, counter-narcotic efforts. For the first time since last year’s APEC forum, Biden will meet one-on-one with Chinese President Xi on Saturday. He will also meet with South Korea’s Yoon Suk Yeol, Japan’s Shigeru Ishiba and Peru’s President Dina Boluarte. The officials say Biden also will use the summits to press allies to keep up support for Ukraine as it tries to fend off Russia’s invasion and persist in negotiating an end to Israel's wars in Lebanon and Gaza. Still, analysts say he will be overshadowed at APEC by Xi, who arrived Thursday and proceeded to inaugurate a $1.3 billion megaport that is perhaps the clearest sign of Latin America’s ongoing reorientation in the region. The Chancay port will shave 10 days off shipping times to China, which has seen trade with South America boom over the past two decades. Peru’s economy minister in June said neighboring nations are actively modifying their supply chains to benefit from the port, in which total investment will top $3.5 billion. Ahead of the inauguration at the port, 60 kilometers (37 miles) north of Lima, locals told The Associated Press that the development hasn't buoyed their economic prospects. On the contrary, they said the port has impaired their ability to fish, threatening their livelihoods. Discontent has been brewing in the middle-class San Borja neighborhood outside Lima’s Convention Center, where the APEC conference is sited. Metal barriers and police equipped with riot gear surround the perimeter where, for the past two days, anti-government protesters angry about a recent spate of gang-fueled violence have shouted slogans demanding that their wildly unpopular presiden t take action against the crime wave. The rallies have devolved into scuffles with police, who used batons to drive away the more aggressive protesters on Thursday. ___ AP writer Isabel DeBre contributed	https://apnews.com/article/peru-apec-biden-xi-lima-china-fc2ac014b2f7314bfa1a53351b0bc3a7	2024-11-14T19:18:12-08:00	
Party of Sri Lanka's new Marxist-leaning president takes large lead in parliamentary vote	COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) — The party of Sri Lanka’s new Marxist-leaning President Anura Kumara Dissanayake took a large lead Friday in early results from the parliamentary elections, in an apparent solid mandate for his program for economic revival. Dissanayake’s National People’s Power Party won 15 of the 22 electoral districts whose results have been released so far by the Elections Commission. Dissanayake was elected president on Sept. 21 in a rejection of traditional political parties that have governed the island nation since its independence from British rule in 1948. But he received just 42% of the votes, fueling questions over his party’s outlook in Thursday’s parliamentary elections. But the party received large increases in support less than two months into his presidency. In a major surprise and a big shift in the country's electoral landscape, his party won the Jaffna district, the heartland of ethnic Tamils in the north, and many other minority strongholds. The victory in Jaffna marks a great dent for traditional ethnic Tamil parties that have dominated the politics of the north since independence. Of the 225 seats in parliament, 196 were up for grabs under Sri Lanka’s proportional representative electoral system, which allocates seats in each district among the parties according to the proportion of the votes they get. The remaining 29 seats — called the national list seats — are allocated to parties and independent groups according to the proportion of the total votes they receive countrywide.	https://apnews.com/article/sri-lanka-election-dissanayake-parliament-a57fb69161d49ebeac77d73568599a4e	2024-11-14T19:10:24-08:00	
Activists plant trees in Mali but residents strip them for firewood. They say there's no choice	BAMAKO, Mali (AP) — After years of serving as Mali's minister of the environment, Aida M'bo now spends her time planting trees in a fight that many in the arid West African country acknowledge they are losing. 'Deforestation is an important issue in Mali,' she said, standing in front of the Zamblara forest. For decades it has been classified as protected, but like many forests in the vast Sahel, it could be wiped out. 'It is mainly due to the excessive wood-cutting,' M'bo said. Even some of her fellow tree-planters that day were to blame. Salimata Diabate, who took part in the ceremony last month, lives nearby and sells firewood from the forest in the Sikasso region, long considered Mali’s breadbasket. While Diabate expressed concern about the threats to Mali’s forests, she said people like her in the countryside have no choice but firewood for cooking. 'Things like cooking gas and solar panels are better, but it’s too expensive for rural women,' she said. The loss of forests has become a pressing issue across Africa as the Sahara Desert continues to creep southward. Over the last three decades, nearly 7,722 square miles (20,000 square kilometers) of forest have been lost in Mali, according to the environmental nonprofit Tree Aid. M'bo's nonprofit, Energia, is financially supported by the Great Green Wall, an initiative by African countries launched in 2007 that aims to plant trees in a nearly 5,000-mile line across the continent, creating a natural barrier to hold back the desert as climate change sweeps the sands south. But millions of the trees died as temperatures rose and rainfall diminished. As a result, only 4% of the Great Green Wall’s original goal has been met, and an estimated $43 billion would be needed to achieve the rest. In Mali, the initiative is facing an additional challenge : the population’s dependency on firewood. Lassana Coulibaly, who lives in the town of Senou near the capital, Bamako, spends his days chopping up and reselling wood he buys from people who cut it from a nearby forest. 'This how we make a living on a daily basis,' he said. He doesn’t believe the forest will disappear. A 2019 study by the African Energy Commission found that 64% of Mali’s total fuel consumption was of biomass, primarily firewood and charcoal for household use. Their sale remains legal. Despite being one of Africa’s top gold producers, Mali ranks among the world's least developed nations, with almost half of its 23 million population living below the national poverty line. The problem is worse in rural areas, where subsistence farming — many people's only real option for survival — is threatened by armed conflict and climate change. The country has been plagued by an insurgency fought by armed groups, including some allied with al-Qaida and the Islamic State group, and two military coups since 2020. Mali is also among several countries in the Sahel that have experienced record-breaking floods this year, with more than 1,000 people killed and hundreds of thousands displaced across the region. Khady Camara, an environmental activist based in Senegal, said forests can help to weather the effects of climate change by absorbing water to prevent floods, and by absorbing carbon that would otherwise end up in the atmosphere as part of heat-trapping gas. 'We need to give more priority to our forests, but we also need to set up new forests and give priority to natural regeneration,' said Camara, whose organization Vacances Vertes has planted 150,000 trees in Senegal. She said the effects of climate change on the Sahel region can’t be overstated, and the causes often come from far beyond the African continent. ' Africa produces only 3% of greenhouse gases. Ninety percent is from the West,' she said. 'If we continue like this, I’m saying to myself that this will be the disappearance of Africa, and of Africans.' ___ The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

Japanese Princess Yuriko, wartime Emperor Hirohito's sister-in-law, dies at 101	TOKYO (AP) — Japanese Princess Yuriko, the wife of wartime Emperor Hirohito’s brother and the oldest member of the imperial family, has died after her health deteriorated recently, palace officials said. She was 101. Yuriko died Friday at a Tokyo hospital, the Imperial Household Agency said. It did not announce the cause of death, but Japanese media said she died of pneumonia. Born in 1923 as an aristocrat, Yuriko married at age 18 to Prince Mikasa, the younger brother of Hirohito and the uncle of current Emperor Naruhito, months before the start of World War II. She has recounted living in a shelter with her husband and their baby daughter after their residence was burned down in the U.S. fire bombings of Tokyo in the final months of the war in 1945. Yuriko raised five children and supported Mikasa’s research into ancient Near Eastern history, while also serving her official duties and taking part in philanthropic activities. She outlived her husband and all three sons. Her death reduces Japan’s rapidly dwindling imperial family to 16 people, including four men, as the country faces the dilemma of how to maintain the royal family while conservatives in the governing party insist on retaining male-only succession. The 1947 Imperial House Law, which largely preserves conservative prewar family values, allows only males to take the throne and forces female royal family members who marry commoners to lose their royal status. The youngest male member of the imperial family, Prince Hisahito — the nephew of Emperor Naruhito — is currently the last heir apparent, posing a major problem for a system that doesn’t allow empresses. The government is debating how to keep succession stable without relying on women. Yuriko had lived a healthy life as a centenarian before suffering a stroke and pneumonia in March. She enjoyed exercise in the morning while watching a daily fitness program on television, the Imperial Household Agency says. She also continued to read multiple newspapers and magazines and enjoyed watching news and baseball on TV. On sunny days, she sat in the palace garden or was wheeled in her wheelchair. Yuriko was hospitalized after her stroke and had been in and out of intensive care since then. Her overall condition deteriorated over the past week, the Imperial Household Agency said.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-oldest-princess-yuriko-obit-hirohito-6ebcce5d71b8e39f6c33f38e305e9e39	2024-11-14T17:51:24-08:00	
AP PHOTOS: Once-traditional camel trading fair in India transformed into tourist attraction	PUSHKAR, India (AP) — It’s early morning in Pushkar, a city at the edge of the Thar desert in the northwestern Indian state of Rajasthan, and a herd of about a dozen camels led by two men is returning, raising a golden sand cloud. The camels had been out grazing in the night at the foothills of the ancient Aravali mountain range, and their handlers spent the night out in the open. For the next two hours or so, when the heat is still bearable, prospective buyers will look for bargains among hundreds of camels that have been brought to be sold by herders and farmers from surrounding districts. Many camels wear necklaces made with a string of small round bells and have brightly colored plastic flowers on their snouts and heads. Specialized barbers walk around trimming camel hair for a fee to make them look more attractive to buyers. Some herders have walked with their animals for two weeks or more on paved roads and scrub land to reach the annual fair. Camels were once the most important animals used for transportation in the desert. Even though paved roads and vehicles have made them largely irrelevant, they are still being used in some remote parts of the state. Hitched to a wooden cart, they can be seen transporting people and construction materials. Some are still in use by farmers selling fresh vegetable produce to townsfolk. Herders supplement their diet with camel milk, make blankets with camel hair and use camel dung as cooking fuel. Even though fewer camels are being traded now, the state government has worked to turn the fair into a big tourist attraction. On the large sandy plain where the fair is held, large Ferris wheels are installed and dozens of stalls are set up to sell local handicrafts. Men with impressive moustaches compete for a prize, and tourists are encouraged to take selfies with them. Children wear traditional costumes, play string instruments and carry on their heads replicas of vessels used by women to fetch water as they enact rural scenes and mingle with the crowd presenting live tableaux. Everything is carefully choreographed for the tourists. Thousands of tourists from around the world now enjoy camel rides, watch cultural shows, and get to participate in rural sports contests and play a game of cricket watched by a bustling crowd. Hindu devotees visiting the fair can take a dip in the holy Pushkar Lake, situated about 2 kilometers (1¼ miles) from the site of the fair and visit a number of old temples dotting the city of Pushkar.	https://apnews.com/article/india-camel-trading-fair-photos-4b19104d0c7f5651694004662e19fc61	2024-11-14T17:37:27-08:00	
North Korea tests exploding drones as Kim calls for mass production	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea tested exploding drones designed to crash into targets and leader Kim Jong Un called for accelerating mass production of the weapons, state media said Friday. The country’s latest military demonstration came as the United States, South Korea and Japan engaged in combined military exercises involving advanced fighter jets and a U.S. aircraft carrier in nearby international waters, in a display of their defense posture against North Korea. North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency published photos of Kim talking with officials near at least two different types of unmanned aerial vehicles. They included those with X-shaped tails and wings that look similar to the ones the country disclosed in August, when Kim inspected another demonstration of drones that explode on impact. The drones flew various routes and accurately struck targets, KCNA said. Its images showed what appeared to be a BMW sedan being destroyed and old models of tanks being blown up. Kim expressed satisfaction with the weapons’ development process and stressed the need to 'build a serial production system as early as possible and go into full-scale mass production,' noting how drones are becoming crucial in modern warfare. KCNA paraphrased Kim as saying drones were easy to make at low cost for a range of military activities. The report didn’t say if Kim spoke directly about rival South Korea, which the North Korean drones are apparently designed to target. North Korea last month accused South Korea of sending its own drones to drop anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets over the North's capital of Pyongyang, and threatened to respond with force if such flights occur again. South Korea’s military has refused to confirm whether or not the North’s claims were true. Tensions in the region have escalated as Kim flaunts his advancing nuclear and missile program, which includes various nuclear-capable weapons targeting South Korea and intercontinental ballistic missiles that can potentially reach the U.S. mainland. Kim is also allegedly sending military equipment and troops to Russia to support President Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine, which raised concerns in Seoul that he would get Russian technology in return to further develop his arsenal. In addition to his intensifying nuclear threats, Kim has also engaged in psychological and electronic warfare against South Korea, such as flying thousands of balloons to drop trash in the South and disrupting GPS signals from border areas near the South’s biggest airport. South Korean officials say North Korea will be a key topic in a trilateral summit between South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, U.S. President Joe Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba this week at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meetings in Peru. South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met on the margins of the APEC on Thursday and discussed 'strong concerns' over deepening ties between Pyongyang and Moscow, particularly the deployment of North Korean troops to support Russia’s war against Ukraine, the U.S. State Department said.	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-suicide-drones-attack-south-korea-kim-jong-un-de54b69cae1b30408bf4d63fdd7c3848	2024-11-14T16:26:29-08:00	
Australia's plan to ban children from social media proves popular and problematic	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — How do you remove children from the harms of social media? Politically the answer appears simple in Australia, but practically the solution could be far more difficult. The Australian government’s plan to ban children from social media platforms including X, TikTok, Facebook and Instagram until their 16th birthdays is politically popular. The opposition party says it would have done the same after winning elections due within months if the government hadn’t moved first. The leaders of all eight Australian states and mainland territories have unanimously backed the plan, although Tasmania, the smallest state, would have preferred the threshold was set at 14. But a vocal assortment of experts in the fields of technology and child welfare have responded with alarm. More than 140 such experts signed an open letter to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese condemning the 16-year age limit as 'too blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.' Details of what is proposed and how it will be implemented are scant. More will be known when legislation is introduced into the Parliament next week. The concerned teen Leo Puglisi, a 17-year-old Melbourne student who founded online streaming service 6 News Australia at the age of 11, laments that lawmakers imposing the ban lack the perspective on social media that young people have gained by growing up in the digital age. 'With respect to the government and prime minister, they didn’t grow up in the social media age, they’re not growing up in the social media age, and what a lot of people are failing to understand here is that, like it or not, social media is a part of people’s daily lives,' Leo said. 'It’s part of their communities, it’s part of work, it’s part of entertainment, it’s where they watch content – young people aren’t listening to the radio or reading newspapers or watching free-to-air TV – and so it can’t be ignored. The reality is this ban, if implemented, is just kicking the can down the road for when a young person goes on social media,' Leo added. Leo has been applauded for his work online. His home state Victoria nominated him for the Young Australian of the Year award, which will be announced in January. His nomination credits his platform with 'fostering a new generation of informed, critical thinkers.' The grieving mom-turned-activist One of the proposal's supporters, cyber safety campaigner Sonya Ryan, knows from personal tragedy how dangerous social media can be for children. Her 15-year-old daughter Carly Ryan was murdered in 2007 in South Australia state by a 50-year-old pedophile who pretended to be a teenager online. In a grim milestone of the digital age, Carly was the first person in Australia to be killed by an online predator. 'Kids are being exposed to harmful pornography, they’re being fed misinformation, there are body image issues, there’s sextortion, online predators, bullying. There are so many different harms for them to try and manage and kids just don’t have the skills or the life experience to be able to manage those well,' Sonya Ryan said. 'The result of that is we’re losing our kids. Not only what happened to Carly, predatory behavior, but also we’re seeing an alarming rise in suicide of young people,' she added. Sonya Ryan is part of a group advising the government on a national strategy to prevent and respond to child sexual abuse in Australia. She wholeheartedly supports Australia setting the social media age limit at 16. 'We’re not going to get this perfect,' she said. 'We have to make sure that there are mechanisms in place to deal with what we already have which is an anxious generation and an addicted generation of children to social media.' A major concern for social media users of all ages is the legislation’s potential privacy implications. Age estimation technology has proved inaccurate, so digital identification appears to be the most likely option for assuring a user is at least 16. Australia’s eSafety Commissioner, an office that describes itself as the world’s first government agency dedicated to keeping people safer online, has suggested in planning documents adopting the role of authenticator. The government would hold the identity data and the platforms would discover through the commissioner whether a potential account holder was 16. The skeptical internet expert Tama Leaver, professor of internet studies at Curtin University, fears that the government will make the platforms hold the users’ identification data instead. The government has already said the onus will be on the platforms, rather than on children or their parents, to ensure everyone meets the age limit. 'The worst possible outcome seems to be the one that the government may be inadvertently pushing towards, which would be that the social media platforms themselves would end up being the identity arbiter,' Leaver said. 'They would be the holder of identity documents which would be absolutely terrible because they have a fairly poor track record so far of holding on to personal data well,' he added. The platforms will have a year once the legislation has become law to work out how the ban can be implemented. Ryan, who divides her time between Adelaide in South Australia and Fort Worth, Texas, said privacy concerns should not stand in the way of removing children from social media. 'What is the cost if we don’t? If we don’t put the safety of our children ahead of profit and privacy?' she asked.	https://apnews.com/article/australia-social-media-ban-children-1abadf5445418c8c14f5f68cf76b38d0	2024-11-14T16:23:11-08:00	
The world's tallest teenager, 7-foot-9 Olivier Rioux, plans to redshirt at Florida this season	GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) — The world's tallest teenager might have to wait a year to become the world's tallest college basketball player. Florida coach Todd Golden said Thursday that Olivier Rioux, a 7-foot-9 freshman who owns a spot in the Guinness record book, is planning to redshirt. Had the popular Canadian played in even one game, he would have burned one of his four seasons of college eligibility. Instead, Rioux, 18, will spend the 2024-25 season practicing with teammates and honing his skills — and still be a freshman next fall. 'I should have made that clear (before),' Golden said. 'Honestly, it’s put him in a tough situation. He’s sitting over there at the end of games and everybody’s yelling at him and trying to get him out there. They just hadn’t understood that that was our potential plan for him. 'So that’s where we’re at at this moment. I’m not saying that’s 100% going to be the plan. We’ll continue to talk to him and see if he changes what he wants to do. But as of right now, that’s the plan that we’re going to have with him as we move forward.' Florida students chanted for 'Oli' in both of the team's home games this season. Golden emptied the bench in the final minutes of an 86-62 victory over Grambling State on Monday night and even said a few words to Rioux during the chaotic scene. 'I was just explaining to him, ’Hey, the reason why I’m not putting you in right now is what we’ve talked about a little bit,'' Golden said. 'This wasn’t a choice that I made for him. This is something that people (from) our program have talked with him and his family and his parents, his AAU coach and just kind of trying to figure out what the best route for him is. 'I just went up to him and I was like, ‘Hey, I’m not trying to be disrespectful with you. I’m just not trying to burn your year putting you in for 30 seconds.’' Rioux handled the decision well, Golden said. 'He’s a great kid, and he’s a pleaser,' Golden said. 'He wants to do what others think is best for him. And he’s coachable. Again, if this is what our staff, his parents, the people around him that care about him, think is best, I think he’s going to be comfortable. Ultimately, it’s his decision. But I think that’s where he’ll land.' ___ AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll	https://apnews.com/article/florida-gators-olivier-rioux-tallest-teenager-897a48d6f01a3b65f7d20cf2a6548537	2024-11-14T11:18:33-08:00	
Tropical Storm Sara threatens to bring flash floods and mudslides to Central America	MIAMI (AP) — Tropical Storm Sara formed Thursday in the Caribbean Sea and was expected to cause life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides across portions of Central America, including Honduras, forecasters said. The storm was expected to stall and meander near the coast of Honduras through the weekend, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. Heavy rain also is forecast for Belize, El Salvador, eastern Guatemala and western Nicaragua. The storm is expected to strengthen before approaching Belize and the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico early next week. It was too soon to determine Friday morning what conditions the system could bring next week to portions of the eastern Gulf of Mexico, including Florida, the Florida Keys, and Cuba, the hurricane center said.	https://apnews.com/article/tropical-storm-sara-1285618560ac8706a6b7735d7656bf15	2024-11-14T09:00:20-08:00

Masses flee homes in Haiti as gangs make violent push for power during political turmoil	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — Masses of people on Thursday fled one of the few communities in Haiti's capital that previously hadn't been taken over by gangs, part of a surge of violence this week as gangs capitalize on the country's political turmoil. Families frantically packed mattresses and furniture into cars and carried their belongings on their heads as they left the Solino neighborhood, one of a handful of areas in Port-au-Prince where a coalition of gangs, called Viv Ansanm, and police were locked in a violent firefight over the past several days. Violence has exploded in the capital after Haiti fired and replaced its interim prime minister amid political infighting and corruption allegations against members of a transitional council created to restore democratic order to Haiti. The Caribbean nation hasn't held an election since 2016, largely because of the gang violence. Gangs like the Viv Ansanm coalition often seize on moments of political chaos to make power grabs like the one seen in Solino in recent days. Gangs also largely shut down the country's main airport by shooting a number of planes, wounding one flight attendant on Monday. The United Nations said that it documented 20 armed clashes in Port-au-Prince in just one day. The U.N. estimates that gangs control 85% of the city. The country's new interim prime minister, Alix Didier Fils-Aimé, has been largely silent about the violence since he was sworn in on Monday, but on Wednesday released a statement condemning the plane shootings. His office said that he ordered police to regain control of the airport and nearby area. Meanwhile, videos on social media show smoke rising up from the area and gunfire has echoed through Solino's streets in recent days. While it wasn’t immediately clear how many people were fleeing the violence in Solino, it appeared that much of the neighborhood was emptying out. Residents said they were leaving after gangs killed a police officer, known as a community leader fighting back against the gangs in the neighborhood. That killing was also reported by local media, though The Associated Press wasn't able to confirm the death with authorities. In October, the same gang coalition made a similar violent push into the Solino neighborhood, setting fire to homes and leaving many fleeing with all they could carry or calling radio stations to plead for help. ___ Megan Janetsky contributed to this report from Mexico City.	https://apnews.com/article/haiti-port-au-prince-gangs-solino-c2c1a07304854f7e3c3f4db9d3e25b98	2024-11-14T08:55:07-08:00	
A France-trained and armed force aims to strengthen Ukraine's defenses at critical juncture in war	A FRENCH MILITARY BASE, France (AP) — A French military task force with a festive name — 'Champagne' — is wrapping up a mission that's no party: Training a whole new brigade of several thousand Ukrainian troops who will be joining the fight against Russia's invasion armed with France-supplied tanks, artillery canons and other heavy weaponry. The approaching return to Ukraine of the 'Anne of Kyiv' brigade, after more than two months of intense military training in eastern and southern France, comes at another critical juncture in the almost three-year war. Russian forces are driving westward in an effort to capture all of Ukraine's eastern Donbas region. They've been bolstered by up to 12,000 North Korean troops that have been deployed to Russia’s Kursk border region to help beat back Ukrainian forces there, according to U.S., South Korean and Ukrainian intelligence assessments. The reelection of Donald Trump is also keeping Ukraine and its allies guessing about the impact he'll have as U.S. president on the war's future trajectory, following his campaign pledges to swiftly end the fighting and suggestions that Kyiv should cede territory to Moscow in return for peace. When deployed, the French-trained and equipped brigade named after a Kyiv princess who became a queen of France could prove to be a formidable force on the battlefields. It will eventually be made up of 4,500 troops, formed of infantry battalions, plus engineers, artillery teams and other specialists, French authorities have previously said. The more than 2,000 soldiers who have been training in France are being put through final paces before their return to Ukraine. The majority of them were recently mobilized and previously had just a few weeks of basic training before their arrival in France in September, the French military says. The Ukrainian military is also training other troops for the brigade back in Ukraine, according to French authorities. The French military dedicated around 1,500 of its own soldiers to the 'Champagne' task force that has been teaching the Ukrainians how to fight effectively together and how to use and maintain their France-supplied weaponry. The French military says the brigade's arsenal will include 18 AMX 10 light tanks, 18 truck-mounted Caesar artillery pieces, 128 armored troop carriers, anti-tank and anti-aircraft missile systems, plus other weaponry and equipment. With observation drones buzzing overhead and amid clouds of smoke and bursts of gunfire and explosions, the Ukrainian soldiers conducted exercises this week at a French military training camp, showing how they have learned to defend and storm a complex of trenches like those on the battlefronts in Ukraine. The French military wouldn't allow visiting journalists to interview the Ukrainians. French officers involved in the training said the troops are now better prepared for combat that they'll likely experience in months ahead. 'They have improved a lot,' said Col. Paul. The French military withheld his last name, citing security reasons. 'Now they are able to fight, they are able to maneuver,' he said. 'They are able to use the different specialists and to use the different equipment they will have on the battlefield.' ___ Follow AP’s coverage of Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/ukraine and coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/france-ukraine-russian-invasion-weaponry-military-5b1a638da2c69bd4f636b136939c2195	2024-11-14T07:41:12-08:00	
The Latest: Republicans take House as Democrats sound alarm over Matt Gaetz as attorney general	Republicans have won enough seats to control the U.S. House, completing the party’s sweep into power and securing their hold on U.S. government alongside President-elect Donald Trump. Meanwhile, Trump's pick of conservative loyalist Matt Gaetz to serve as attorney general has Democrats sounding the alarm with Sen. Dick Durbin saying Gaetz 'would be a disaster' in part because of Trump’s threat to use the Justice Department 'to seek revenge on his political enemies.' Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: Democrat Janelle Bynum wins election to US House in Oregon, beating incumbent Lori Chavez-DeRemer Democrat Janelle Bynum won election to a U.S. House seat representing Oregon on Thursday, defeating Republican Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer. The district, which includes the Portland suburbs and stretches through Bend, was a top target for Democrats. Democrats lost this seat in 2022, when Jamie McLeod-Skinner defeated seven-term Democratic Rep. Kurt Schrader in the primary but lost the general election. The district took in parts of more conservative central Oregon after 2022 redistricting. Bynum represents Happy Valley and North Clackamas in the state Legislature. The Associated Press declared Bynum the winner at 12:47 p.m. EST. Republican and Democratic senators call for ethics committee information on Gaetz Republican and Democratic senators alike on the Judiciary Committee that would review Matt Gaetz’s attorney general nomination are calling for a House Ethics Committee investigation into Gaetz to be made available to them. 'I think it’s going to be material in the proceedings,' said Sen. Thomas Tillis, a North Carolina Republican. Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, said, 'I think there should not be any limitation on the Senate Judiciary Committee’s investigation, including whatever the House Ethics Committee has generated.' Sen. Dick Durbin, the Democrat who currently chairs the Judiciary Committee, earlier Thursday said in a statement, 'We cannot allow this valuable information from a bipartisan investigation to be hidden from the American people.' Incoming Senate GOP Leader John Thune says Senate’s priority will be confirming Trump’s nominees Thune did not mention Matt Gaetz, Tulsi Gabbard or other Trump picks that have raised deep concerns among several senators. But he said senators should expect 'an aggressive schedule until his nominees are confirmed.' Sen. Dick Durban says ethics committee should preserve information gathered on Matt Gaetz Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin, D-Ill., is calling on the House Ethics Committee to preserve information it's gathered on former Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz, President-elect Donald Trump’s intended nominee for attorney general, and also share it with the Senate. Trump announced Gaetz as his pick for the post Wednesday and Gaetz immediately resigned from Congress, ending the investigation against him. The ethics panel said several months ago that its review included whether Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, accepted improper gifts and sought to obstruct government investigations of his conduct. Gaetz has categorically denied all the allegations before the committee. 'The sequence and timing of Mr. Gaetz’s resignation from the House raises serious questions about the contents of the House Ethics Committee report,' Durbin said Thursday. 'We cannot allow this valuable information from a bipartisan investigation to be hidden from the American people.' Bohannan requests a recount in Iowa’s close congressional race as GOP wins control of House The Democrat looking to unseat an incumbent Republican in a close Iowa congressional race, one of a handful yet to be called after Republicans won control of the U.S. House, has asked for a recount. Democrat Christina Bohannan’s campaign on Thursday requested the recount in her bid against Republican incumbent Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks to represent Iowa’s 1st District. The initial tally puts Bohannan fewer than 1,000 votes — less than a percentage point — behind Miller-Meeks. The contest is a much tighter rematch of 2022, when Miller-Meeks won by 7 percentage points. Miller-Meeks earned a first term in Congress representing Iowa’s 2nd District when she defeated Democrat Rita Hart by just six votes in 2020.	https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-election-kamala-harris-70b2f4856efe7e22ead7661ca292ff80	2024-11-14T07:34:30-08:00	
Brazil authorities link bombing in the capital to extremist discourse	SAO PAULO (AP) — A Brazilian Supreme Court justice said Thursday that he believes the explosion outside the court in capital Brasilia was the consequence of frequent far-right attacks and hate speech targeting the country’s institutions. 'It grew under the guise of a criminal use of freedom of speech. To offend, threaten, coerce,' Justice Alexandre de Moraes said at an event in Brasilia. Federal Police are investigating the explosions on Wednesday as terrorism and a violent attack on the democratic rule of law, its director, Andrei Passos, said at a news conference later. Passos said that the man had attempted to enter the Supreme Court and that it appeared that he acted alone, though the police official indicated he also was viewing the attack in the broader context of extremism. 'Even if the visible action is individual, behind that action there is never just one person. It's always a group, or ideas of a group, or extremism, radicalism, that lead to committing those crimes,' Passos said. 'The action, in fact, was an individual action, but the investigation will tell if there are other connections, if there are other networks, what's behind it, what drove it.' The police director also said the Supreme Court has received other threats via email, without specifying when. Security camera footage from the Supreme Court, obtained by television network Globo, shows the suspect approaching a statue outside the Supreme Court. As a guard nears, the man throws an explosive and retreats a few steps, then throws a second device and an explosion follows. Finally, the suspect ignites a third device near to himself, causing his death. Passos said that the man was a native of southern Santa Catarina state where he previously ran for city council, and had been in Brasilia several months. Celina Leão, the lieutenant governor of Brazil’s federal district, said Wednesday night that the man first detonated explosives in a car in a Congress parking lot, which didn't cause injuries. Then he went to Three Powers Plaza, where the Supreme Court, Congress and presidential palace are located. Local media identified the man as being a member of Brazil’s Liberal Party, the same as former President Jair Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro has railed against the Supreme Court in the past and specifically focused his ire on de Moraes. Bolsonaro supporters consider de Moraes their chief enemy. He has led a five-year investigation into fake news and threats against Supreme Court justices, which has led to the ban of some far-right allies and supporters from social media and even some imprisonments. He also presided over the nation’s top electoral court when it ruled Bolsonaro ineligible for office until 2030, finding that he had abused his power and cast unfounded doubts on the validity of the 2022 election result. Bolsonaro condemned the attack on social media. 'It is high time for Brazil to once again cultivate an environment suitable for different ideas to confront each other peacefully, and for the strength of arguments to be worth more than the argument of force,' he wrote. Some accuse de Moraes of overstepping in the name of protecting Brazilian democracy from political violence and disinformation. Others view his brash tactics as justified by extraordinary circumstances. Months after Bolsonaro lost his 2022 election bid, Bolsonaro's supporters stormed the main government buildings in Brasilia, seeking to oust his leftist successor, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, from power. It was widely seen as an echo of the insurrection in the U.S. Capitol two years earlier. The Supreme Court has since convicted hundreds of those involved in the uprising for crimes such as criminal association and attempted coup. De Moraes said Thursday that the explosions outside the Supreme Court appeared to be the most serious attack on the institution since then. 'The country’s pacification is only possible with the accountability of all criminals. There is no possibility of pacification with amnesty for criminals,' de Moraes said. Earlier this year, de Moraes ordered a nationwide ban of X after clashing with its billionaire owner, Elon Musk, over free speech, far-right accounts and misinformation. Musk had disparaged de Moraes, calling him an authoritarian and a censor, even though his rulings, including X’s suspension, were repeatedly upheld by his peers. The platform was reinstated in October. Brazil will host the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro next week. Passos said that the bombing shouldn’t raise any concerns, given that authorities are already implementing the highest level security possible, including with support of the armed forces. 'I am going this afternoon, shortly, to Rio de Janeiro, where I will personally accompany all actions so we can have the absolute guarantee of security,' he added.	https://apnews.com/article/brazil-supreme-court-explosion-29e8d6247a7ab7d3b6f6cf41d19bf278	2024-11-14T07:16:07-08:00	
2 Israeli airstrikes hit Syria's capital and a suburb, killing 15 people, Syrian state media say	DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — Israel carried out at least two airstrikes on a a western neighborhood of Damascus and one of the capital’s suburbs on Thursday, killing at least 15 people and wounding another 16, Syria's state news agency said. The news agency, SANA, said the airstrikes on the Mazzeh neighborhood in Damascus and the suburb of Qudsaya northwest of the capital struck two buildings. An Associated Press journalist at the scene in Mazzeh said that a five-story building was damaged by a missile that hit the basement. The Israeli military said that it had hit infrastructure sites and command centers of the Islamic Jihad militant group in Syria, and had 'inflicted significant damage to the terrorist organization’s command center and to its operatives.' The airstrikes in Damascus and the nearby suburb came shortly before Ali Larijani, an adviser to Iran’s supreme leader Ali Khamenei, was scheduled to meet in the Syrian capital with representatives of Palestinian factions at the Iranian Embassy in Mazzeh. The Israeli military said that Islamic Jihad had participated alongside Hamas, the Palestinian militant group in the Gaza Strip, in the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks on southern Israel that triggered the ongoing war in the Middle East. The military 'will continue to operate against the Islamic Jihad terrorist organization wherever necessary,' it said. An official with the Palestinian Islamic Jihad Group said that the strike in Mazzeh targeted one of their offices, and that several members of the group were killed. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak to the media. Syria's state news agency SANA said that the country's air defenses were activated against a 'hostile target' south of the central city of Homs. It gave no further details. Tehran has been a main backer of Syrian President Bashar Assad’s government since a 2011 uprising turned into full-blown civil war and has played an instrumental role in turning the tide of the conflict in his favor. Iran has sent scores of military advisers and thousands of Iran-backed fighters from around the Middle East to Syria to fight on Assad’s side. Tehran has also been an economic lifeline for Assad, sending fuel and credit lines worth billions of dollars. Israel has carried out hundreds of airstrikes in Syria targeting members of neighboring Lebanon’s Hezbollah and officials from Iranian-backed groups.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-israel-war-airstrikes-damascus-1f6dd957d1d6c8f610349e99cfed1a98	2024-11-14T05:30:06-08:00	
Airbnb users to play gladiators in Rome's Colosseum, sparking mixed reactions over $1.5 million deal	ROME (AP) — The ancient Roman Colosseum will be the venue of gladiator fights — albeit staged — for the first time in two millennia under a $1.5 million sponsorship deal with Airbnb that aims to promote 'a more conscious tourism.' But some visitors to the monument Thursday, as well as housing activists, were skeptical about the value of the arrangement, citing ongoing controversies in many cities over the role of short-term rental platforms in fueling overtourism and limiting affordable housing for residents and students. Under the deal announced by Airbnb and the Colosseum on Wednesday, the sponsorship by the short-term rental giant will cover the renewal of an educational program inside the ancient Roman amphitheater covering the history of the structure and gladiators. Eight of the platform's users and their plus-ones will be able to participate in faux gladiator fights after the Colosseum's closing time on May 7-8, taking the same underground route used by gladiators in ancient Rome to reach the arena. People can apply for the experience on Nov. 27 at no cost, and the 'gladiators' will be chosen by lottery. The superintendent of the Colosseum Archaeological Park, Alfonsina Russo, told The Associated Press that the deal is in conjunction with the release of Ridley Scott's new film 'Gladiators II,' which opened in Italy on Thursday. Russo characterized the sponsorship arrangement as one of the many such deals to help finance projects at the park. The Italian fashion brand Tod's, for example, has funded a multimillion renovation of the Roman monument, including a cleaning, replacing the locking system of arches with new gates and redoing the subterranean areas. Alberto Campailla, the coordinator of the Nonna Roma nonprofit organization that focuses on housing and food for the poor, called the campaign with Airbnb 'a disgrace,' and a form of 'touristification.' Airbnb and other platforms offering short-term rentals 'are literally driving people out of not only the city center, but also the outskirts and suburban neighborhoods,' Campailla said. Tourists from other European cities grappling with overtourism also took issue with the deal. 'It seems to me that the purpose of the Colosseum today is to be a tourist attraction, but not to create an amusement park within it,' said Jaime Montero, a tourist visiting from Madrid. 'In the end, tourism eats the essence of the cities, here in Rome, as in other capitals.' Visiting from Naples, Salvatore Di Matteo saw the deal as 'yet another takeover of the territory' by big companies. 'If they start to touch sacred monuments such as the Colosseum here in Rome, it is obviously something that should make us think and is, in any case, a bit worrying,' he said. The Colosseum is the most important and largest amphitheater constructed by the ancient Romans. Built in the 1st century, it was the center of popular entertainment, hosting hunts and gladiator games, until the 6th century. ____ Colleen Barry contributed from Milan.	https://apnews.com/article/rome-colosseum-gladiators-airbnb-ac44f85f856293c5c8083e7e91662186	2024-11-14T05:22:12-08:00	
In Cyprus, Ukrainians learn how to dispose of landmines that kill and maim hundreds	NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — In a Cypriot National Guard camp, Ukrainians are being trained on how to identify, locate and dispose of landmines and other unexploded munitions that litter huge swaths of their country, killing and maiming hundreds of people, including children. Analysts say Ukraine is among the countries that are the most affected by landmines and discarded explosives, as a result of Russia’s ongoing war. According to U.N. figures, some 399 people have been killed and 915 wounded from landmines and other munitions since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, equal to the number of casualties reported from 2014-2021. More than 1 in 10 of those casualties have been children. The economic impact is costing billions to the Ukrainian economy. Landmines and other munitions are preventing the sowing of 5 million hectares, or 10%, of the country’s agricultural land. Cyprus stepped up to offer its facilities as part of the European Union’s Military Assistance Mission to Ukraine. So far, almost 100 Ukrainian armed forces personnel have taken part in three training cycles over the last two years, said Cyprus Foreign Ministry spokesperson Theodoros Gotsis. 'We are committed to continuing this support for as long as it takes,' Gotsis told the Associated Press, adding that the Cyprus government has covered the 250,000 euro ($262,600) training cost. Cyprus opted to offer such training owing to its own landmine issues dating back five decades when the island nation was ethnically divided when Turkey invaded following a coup that sought union with Greece. The United Nations has removed some 27,000 landmines from a buffer zone that cuts across the island, but minefields remain on either side. The Cypriot government says it has disposed of all anti-personnel mines in line with its obligations under an international treaty that bans the use of such munitions. In Cyprus, Ukrainians undergo rigorous theoretical and practical training over a five-week Basic Demining and Clearance course that includes instruction on distinguishing and safely handling landmines and other explosive munitions, such as rockets, 155 mm artillery shells, rocket-propelled grenades and mortar shells. Theoretical training uses inert munitions identical to the actual explosives. Most of the course is comprised of hands-on training focusing on the on-site destruction of unexploded munitions using explosives, the chief training officer told the Associated Press. The officer spoke on condition of anonymity because he’s not authorized to disclose his identity for security reasons. 'They’re trained on ordnance disposal using real explosives,' the officer said. 'That will be the trainees’ primary task when they return.' Cypriot officials said the Ukrainian trainees did not want to be either interviewed or photographed. Defusing discarded munitions or landmines in areas where explosive charges can’t be used — for instance, near a hospital — is not part of this course because that’s the task of highly trained teams of disposal experts whose training can last as long as eight months, the officer said. Trainees, divided into groups of eight, are taught how to operate metal detectors and other tools for detecting munitions like prodders — long, thin rods which are used to gently probe beneath the ground’s surface in search of landmines and other explosive ordnance. Another tool is a feeler, a rod that’s used to detect booby-trapped munitions. There are many ways to booby-trap such munitions, unlike landmines which require direct pressure to detonate. 'Booby-trapped munitions are a widespread phenomenon in Ukraine,' the chief training officer explained. Training, primarily conducted by experts from other European Union countries, takes place both in forested and urban areas at different army camps and follows strict safety protocols. The short, intense training period keeps the Ukrainians focused. 'You see the interest they show during instruction: they ask questions, they want to know what mistakes they’ve made and the correct way of doing it,' the officer said. Humanitarian data and analysis group ACAPS said in a Jan. 2024 report that 174,000 sq. kilometers (67,182 sq. miles) or nearly 29% of Ukraine’s territory needs to be surveyed for landmines and other explosive ordnance. More than 10 million people are said to live in areas where demining action is needed. Since 2022, Russian forces have used at least 13 types of anti-personnel mines, which target people. Russia never signed the 1997 Ottawa Convention banning the use of anti-personnel mines, but the use of such mines is nonetheless considered a violation of its obligations under international law. Russia also uses 13 types of anti-tank mines. The International Campaign to Ban Landmines said in its 2023 Landmine Monitor report that Ukrainian government forces may have also used antipersonnel landmines in contravention of the Mine Ban Treaty in and around the city of Izium during 2022, when the city was under Russian control.	https://apnews.com/article/cyprus-ukraine-landmines-explosive-ordnance-demining-munitions-45aaa2eb9ac4d1dd9e94d3a8b666d1d1	2024-11-14T05:21:22-08:00	
Edinburgh Zoo blames fireworks for death of baby red panda	LONDON (AP) — Zookeepers in Scotland have blamed pyrotechnics from annual Bonfire Night celebrations for the death of a baby red panda named Roxie. The three-month-old died on Nov. 5 after choking on vomit that was believed to be caused by stress from the explosions that could be heard to mark Guy Fawkes Day, when fireworks and bonfires are lit to mark the failed plot in 1605 to blow up the British Parliament. 'Roxie had access to her den, but the frightening noises seem to have been too much for her,' said Ben Supple, deputy chief executive of the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, which owns Edinburgh Zoo. 'Very sadly, she choked on her vomit on Bonfire Night and our vets believe this was probably a reaction to fireworks.' The red panda, a cat-sized nocturnal animal with reddish fur and a shaggy tail, is native to the eastern Himalayas and southwestern China. While it is protected in India, Bhutan, China, Nepal and Myanmar, the species is threatened by habitat loss, human encroachment and poaching. Fewer than 10,000 remain in the wild. The small mammals have a low chance of survival — even when born in captivity — and they are especially vulnerable in their first months. Studies show that as many as 60% don't reach their first birthday, according to the Toronto Zoo, which in August announced the death of one of two infant red pandas born there in June. Roxie's mother, Ginger, died five days earlier but Roxie had been eating on her own and responding well to care, Supple said. Stress from fireworks in the days between Halloween on Oct. 31 and Guy Fawkes' Day could have been a contributing factor in the mother's death, he said. Pet owners are well aware of the distress fireworks can cause dogs, cats, horses and other animals. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has campaigned for tighter restrictions and the zoo used the incident to call for a ban on fireworks sales and for only light, public pyrotechnic displays. A petition to curb fireworks was signed by more than 1 million people and delivered to British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's office this month. Police in Edinburgh said disorder on Bonfire Night had caused a state of alarm in the city this year. More than a dozen people have been arrested so far on allegations that include shooting fireworks at police officers and other anti-social behavior. Scottish community safety minister Siobhian Brown said this had been the first year that local authorities could ban the use of fireworks in certain areas. She said it was now a matter for the U.K. government to take up. Alex Cole-Hamilton, leader of the Liberal Democrats in the Scottish Parliament, said current rules don't seem to be working and there may need to be a ban on noisy fireworks. 'This is extremely sad news. These are rare and beautiful creatures,' said Cole-Hamilton. 'The scenes across Edinburgh over the last few weeks have been anarchic and troubling.'	https://apnews.com/article/zoo-fireworks-baby-red-panda-death-34a452edc665d56b813bb6a527106256	2024-11-14T04:58:01-08:00	
EU slaps Meta with a nearly 800 million euro fine for engaging in 'abusive' Marketplace practices	LONDON (AP) — European Union regulators issued their first antitrust fine to Facebook parent Meta on Thursday with a penalty of nearly 800 million euros for what they call 'abusive practices' involving its Marketplace online classified ads business. The European Commission, the 27-nation bloc's executive branch and top antitrust enforcer, issued the 797.72 million euro ($841 million) penalty after its long-running investigation found that the company abused its dominant position and engaged in anti-competitive behavior. It’s the first time the EU has imposed a fine on the social media giant for breaches of the bloc’s competition law. Brussels has already slapped Big Tech rivals Google and Apple with billions in antitrust penalties. The commission had accused Meta of distorting competition by tying its online classified ad business to its social network, automatically exposing Facebook users to Marketplace 'whether they want it or not' and shutting out competitors. It was also concerned that Meta was imposing unfair trading conditions with terms of service that authorized the company to use ad-related data — generated from competing classified ad platforms who advertise on Facebook or Instagram — to benefit Marketplace. Meta's practices gave it 'advantages that other online classified ads service providers could not match,' Margrethe Vestager, the commission's executive vice-president in charge of competition policy, said in a press release 'This is illegal under EU antitrust rules. Meta must now stop this behaviour.' Meta said in a statement that the decision fails to prove any 'competitive harm' to rivals or consumers and 'ignores the realities of the thriving European market for online classified listing services.' The company said the Commission's case ignores the fact that Facebook users can choose to 'engage with Marketplace, and many don't.' It said online marketplaces, including global sites like eBay, Europe-wide platforms like Vinted, and national services are continuing to grow. Meta said it would comply with the Commission's order to end the offending conduct and not repeat it, but also vowed to appeal. The case dates back to 2021, when European Union regulators and their counterparts in Britain opened dual investigations into the classified business. The British regulator wrapped up its investigation last year after Meta made concessions. The company continues to face EU scrutiny on other fronts, including investigations into whether Facebook and Instagram child safety and election integrity measures comply with the bloc’s digital rulebook. Meta has previously been hit with a series of fines for breaches of the EU’s stringent privacy laws, including a record 1.2 billion euro penalty last year.	https://apnews.com/article/meta-facebook-european-union-competition-fine-6886192353a344126a15886d6ca7c627	2024-11-14T04:45:09-08:00	
2 charged in connection with orange spray attack on Stonehenge monuments	LONDON (AP) — Two environmental activists have been charged over the spraying orange paint powder at the Stonehenge monuments in southwest England in June, police said Thursday. Rajan Naidu, 73, and Niamh Lynch, 22, have been charged with 'destroying or damaging an ancient protected monument, and intentionally or recklessly causing a public nuisance,' Wiltshire Police said in a statement. They are due to appear at Salisbury Magistrates’ Court on Dec. 13. Soon after the spray attack at the UNESCO World Heritage Site, the group Just Stop Oil took responsibility and released video showing a man it identified as Naidu blast a fog of orange from a fire extinguisher at one of the vertical stones. The second protester, identified as Lynch, sprayed three stones before she was stopped. It said the paint was made of cornstarch and would dissolve in the rain. Following the protest, English Heritage, a charity that manages hundreds of historic sites, said that experts had quickly removed the orange powder from the stones. Stonehenge was built on a windswept plain in southern England in stages starting 5,000 years ago. Its origin and purpose remain somewhat of a mystery, though the stone circle aligns with the summer solstice sunrise and winter solstice sunset, drawing crowds of spiritualists, druids and sun worshippers. The publicity stunt was among a long line of disruptive acts by Just Stop Oil to draw attention to the climate crisis. The protests have halted sporting events, sullied famous works of art and caused traffic jams. The acts have led to convictions, jail terms and widespread criticism.	https://apnews.com/article/stonehenge-orange-paint-powder-activists-charged-uk-945ed9d9df23edd6310f3e1a2dd75903	2024-11-14T04:07:57-08:00	
Japan will resume V-22 flights after inquiry finds pilot error caused incident last month	TOKYO (AP) — Japan's fleet of hybrid-helicopter military aircraft have been cleared to resume operations after being grounded following an incident last month. A V-22 Osprey tilted and hit the ground as it was taking off during a joint exercise with the U.S. military on Oct. 27. An investigation has found human error was the cause. The aircraft was carrying 16 people when it 'became unstable' on takeoff from a Japanese military base on Yonaguni, a remote island southwest of Okinawa. The flight was aborted and nobody was injured, Japan Ground Self-Defense Force, or JGSDF, said at the time. In a statement on Thursday, the JGSDF said that the pilots had failed to turn on a switch designed to temporarily increase engine output during takeoff, causing the aircraft to descend and sway uncontrollably. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said that an internal investigation determined that the incident was caused by a human error, not by 'physical or external factors.' He said that the fleet of more than a dozen V-22s would resume flight operations from Thursday after a review of safety and training measures. It was the first major incident involving Japan's V-22s since November 2023, when a U.S. Air Force Special Operations Command Osprey crashed off Japan’s southern coast, killing eight people. The fleet only resumed flight operations earlier this year, but the use of the V-22 remains controversial, particularly in Okinawa where residents have questioned its safety record. The small southern island is home to half of about 50,000 U.S. troops based in Japan.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-defense-osprey-aircraft-accident-3d6c8e4e82d1ae3a4007ed4bee8ec022	2024-11-14T03:40:43-08:00	
Biden arrives in Peru for international summit and meeting with Xi as world leaders brace for Trump	LIMA, Peru (AP) — President Joe Biden arrived Thursday in Peru to start his six-day visit to Latin America for the final major international summits of his presidency, even as world leaders turn their attention to what Donald Trump’s return to the White House means for their countries. The visit to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Peru and stops in the Amazon rainforest and at the Group of 20 leaders summit in Brazil offer Biden one of his last chances as president to meet with heads of state he’s worked with over the years. But world leaders' eyes are firmly affixed on Trump. They already are burning up Trump's phone with congratulatory talks. At least one leader, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, is dusting off his golf clubs, in case the chance to bond with the golf-loving Trump should present itself. White House officials insist that Biden's visits will be substantive, with talks on climate issues, global infrastructure, counternarcotic efforts and one-on-one meetings with global leaders, including Chinese President Xi Jinping, and a joint meeting with South Korea's Yoon and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. The meeting with Yoon and Ishiba would aim to solidify the progress made since their initial meeting last year, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters on Air Force One. That includes tightening security and economic cooperation amid increasingly tense relations with China and North Korea. It also would be an opportunity for them to discuss North Korean troops going to Russia to help with the war in Ukraine, Sullivan said. He says the Biden administration is working to ensure the three-country meeting is 'an enduring feature of American policy.' He expects it would continue under Trump, noting its bipartisan support, but acknowledged it was up to the incoming president's team. Biden's South American trip comes a day after he met with Trump in the White House. That wide-ranging discussion touched on the conflicts in Gaza, Lebanon and Ukraine. 'I wanted — I asked — for his views, and he gave them to me,' Trump told The New York Post after his conversation with Biden. Sullivan indicated that White House officials also are making clear to Trump's team that the delicate U.S.-China relationship is the 'paramount priority for the incoming administration.' He stressed the risks if stability is upended in the Taiwan Strait: 'that would be catastrophic for everyone involved — for Taiwan, for Beijing, for us, for the world,' he said. 'Because of the size of the risk, even if it’s not that likely, it’s something that has to be at the top of the agenda.' Beijing claims Taiwan as its own territory and vows to annex it — by force if necessary. The U.S. is Taiwan’s biggest unofficial ally and is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself. Trump is nominating noted China hawks for key positions: Florida Sen. Marco Rubio for secretary of state and Florida Rep. Mike Waltz for his national security adviser. The White House had been working for months to arrange the meeting with Xi, whose country is the United States' most prominent economic and national security competitor. For Xi, front of mind will be Trump's campaign promise to impose 60% tariffs on Chinese imports. White House officials avoided commenting in detail about how Biden will approach conversations with Xi and other world leaders about Trump. Those officials say Biden also will use the summits to press allies to keep up support for Ukraine as it tries to fend off Russia's invasion and not lose sight on finding an end to the wars in Lebanon and Gaza. That includes bringing home hostages held by Hamas for more than 13 months. Between the summits, Biden will visit the Amazon rainforest, the first such visit by a sitting U.S. president. James Bosworth, founder of the Latin America-focused political consultancy Hxagon, said Biden will use one of his last big moments in the international spotlight 'to reassure the world that transitions of power are normal for democracies.' 'Biden will get public applause and praise, even as world leaders nervously await the transition,' Bosworth said. Biden's meeting with Xi will likely be the most consequential moment during the American president's time in South America. Biden has tried to maintain a steady relationship with Xi even as the U.S. administration repeatedly has raised concerns about what it sees as malign action by Beijing. U.S. intelligence officials have assessed that China has surged sales to Russia of machine tools, microelectronics and other technology that Moscow is using to produce missiles, tanks, aircraft and other weaponry to use against Ukraine. The Biden administration last month imposed sanctions on two Chinese companies accused of directly helping Russia build long-range attack drones. Tensions flared last year after Biden ordered the shooting down of a Chinese spy balloon that traversed across the intercontinental United States. And the Biden administration has criticized Chinese military assertiveness toward Japan, the Philippines and Taiwan. During the campaign, Trump spoke of his personal connection with Xi, which started out well during the Republican's first term before becoming strained over disputes about trade and the origins of COVID-19. In a congratulatory message to Trump, Xi called for the U.S. and China to manage their differences and get along in a new era, according to Chinese state media. Biden finds himself in a similar position to when then-President Barack Obama traveled to Peru in 2016 for the annual APEC leaders gathering soon after Trump's first White House victory. World leaders peppered Obama with questions about Trump's win would mean. 'His message was to wait and see ... because we didn’t know Donald Trump,' said Victor Cha, a National Security Council official in the George W. Bush administration. 'Now we’re in a very different situation where we do know what the first Trump administration was like.' ___ Associated Press writer Isabel DeBre in Lima, Peru, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/biden-trump-apec-g20-latin-america-peru-8b317fc2c4f161a60f1a17d52eac3f0a	2024-11-14T03:11:02-08:00	
Lawmakers stage Māori protest in New Zealand's parliament during fraught race relations debate	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — A vote in New Zealand’s parliament was suspended and two lawmakers ejected on Thursday when dramatic political theater erupted over a controversial proposed law redefining the country’s founding agreement between Indigenous Māori and the British Crown. Under the principles laid out in the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi, which guide the relationship between the government and Māori, tribes were promised broad rights to retain their lands and protect their interests in return for ceding governance to the British. The bill would specify that those rights should apply to all New Zealanders. The bill has scant support and is unlikely to become law. Detractors say it threatens racial discord and constitutional upheaval, while thousands of New Zealanders are traveling the length of the country this week to protest it. Despite its unpopularity, however, the proposed law passed its first vote on Thursday after dominating public discussion for months, due to a quirk of New Zealand’s political system that allows tiny parties to negotiate outsized influence for their agendas. It also reflects unease among some New Zealanders about more rapid progress in recent years toward upholding the promises made to Māori when the country was colonized. A 184-year-old treaty provokes fresh debate For decades after the Treaty of Waitangi was signed, differences between the English and Māori texts and breaches by New Zealand governments intensified the disenfranchisement of Māori. By the middle of the 20th century, Indigenous language and culture had dwindled, much tribal land was confiscated and Māori were disadvantaged on every metric. As the Indigenous protest movement surged in the 1970s, lawmakers and the courts slowly began to elucidate what it understood the treaty to promise Māori: partnership with the Crown, participation in decision-making and protection of their interests. 'What all of these principles have in common is that they afford Māori different rights from other New Zealanders,' David Seymour, leader of minor libertarian party ACT and the bill’s author, said Thursday. To those who have championed the treaty, that is the point. Work has involved billion-dollar land settlements, embrace of the Māori language, guaranteed representation in central and local government and attempts through policy to reverse the stark inequities Indigenous people still face. But Seymour – who is Māori -- said no law or court had actually settled for good a definition of the treaty’s principles, and that had caused division. His bill filled 'a silence this parliament has left for five decades,' he said. Lawmakers vote for a bill they oppose Prime Minister Christopher Luxon disagrees, but his party voted for the bill Thursday to fulfil the political deal with Seymour that handed Luxon power. Without enough seats to govern after last October's election, Luxon curried support from two minor parties – including Seymour's ACT, which won less than 9% of the vote – in return for political concessions. Luxon told Seymour his party would vote for the treaty bill once, while promising publicly that it would go no further. The treaty’s principles had been negotiated and debated for 184 years, Luxon told reporters Thursday, and it was 'simplistic' for Seymour to suggest that they could be resolved 'through the stroke of a pen'. Government lawmakers made awkward speeches in parliament explaining that they opposed the bill before voting for it to jeers from opponents, who demanded they break ranks. Luxon was spared that; he left the country for the meeting of leaders from the Asia-Pacific APEC bloc hours before the vote. His political horse-trading drew scorn from opposition lawmakers. A fraught and outraged response 'Shame! Shame! Shame on you, David Seymour,' roared Willie Jackson, a veteran Māori lawmaker. 'Shame on you for what you’re trying to do to this nation.' Jackson was thrown out of the debating chamber by Speaker Gerry Brownlee for calling Seymour a liar. 'You are complicit in the harm and the division that this presents,' said Rawiri Waititi, a lawmaker from Te Pāti Māori, an Indigenous group, speaking to all who advanced the bill. 'If you vote for this bill, this is who you are,' Green party leader Chloe Swarbrick told Luxon's lawmakers. No one deviated from their planned votes and the bill passed. But not before one final flashpoint. A rare outburst of protest When asked how her party’s lawmakers would vote, Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke of Te Pāti Māori stood and began a ringing haka – a rhythmic Māori chant of challenge – which swelled to a roar as first opposition lawmakers, and then spectators in the public gallery, joined in. An irate Brownlee was unable to quiet the fracas as opponents approached Seymour’s seat. The live broadcast of Parliament’s proceedings was cut and Brownlee ordered the public be removed before the vote resumed. He suspended Maipi-Clarke, 22, from Parliament for a day. The bill will proceed to a public submission process before another vote. Seymour hopes for an outpouring of support to change Luxon's mind about vetoing it. The proposal will shortly roil Parliament again. Thousands of protesters are due to arrive in the capital, Wellington, on Tuesday for what is likely to be one of the largest race relations marches in New Zealand’s history.	https://apnews.com/article/treaty-waitangi-protest-maori-zealand-seymour-haka-b85059be2620fc08b21ae06f62ab5079	2024-11-14T02:42:49-08:00	
UK plans to create pension megafunds with aim of unlocking $100 billion for investment	LONDON (AP) — British Treasury chief Rachel Reeves said Thursday the government planned to merge dozens of pension funds with the aim of unlocking tens of billions of pounds for investment and boosting the U.K.'s subpar economic growth. Reeves said in her speech to finance leaders in central London that the creation of so-called 'megafunds' will represent the 'biggest pension reform in decades.' In her first so-called Mansion House speech, an annual ritual for British chancellors of the exchequer, Reeves said the changes could help unlock 80 billion pounds ($100 billion) for investment. Pension funds invest in a variety of assets, such as shares, bonds, real estate and infrastructure, in an attempt to increase the retirement benefits for their members. The proposed merger of 86 local authority pension funds in England and Wales has echoes in Australia and Canada, where pension funds are widely seen to have taken advantage of their bigger size to invest in assets and boost growth. By 2030, the new Local Government Pension Scheme in England and Wales is set to manage assets worth around 500 billion pounds by 2030. The Labour government will introduce the reforms through a bill in parliament next year. Early indications suggest it has broad support across the political divide — the former Conservative government had indicated it would go this route, too — and within the pensions industry. 'Larger pension schemes can help achieve better outcomes for savers through economies of scale, stronger governance, negotiating power and additional resources,' said Zoe Alexander, director of policy and advocacy at the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association, an organization that seeks to bring the industry together and promote best practices. Business leaders cautiously welcomed the reform plan but said the government needs to work hard to win their support following Reeves's tax-raising budget last month. 'With the budget piling additional costs on firms and squeezing their headroom to invest, the government needs to work hard to regain the confidence in the U.K. as a place businesses and communities can succeed,' said Confederation of British Industry chief economist Louise Hellem. 'Pension schemes will want to operate within a U.K. economy that is prospering,' she added. Since the global financial crisis in 2008-9, the British economy has underperformed relative to previous years. The government's main aim is to bolster growth. Figures Friday are predicted to show that the economy barely grew in the second quarter of the year.	https://apnews.com/article/britain-pensions-reeves-megafund-investment-growth-treasury-0c4cc275d3db9907469f6d58f49a0eff	2024-11-14T02:24:48-08:00	
AP PHOTOS: Thick smog shrouds Asian cities	NEW DELHI (AP) — Thick smog shrouded New Delhi and other cities around South and Southeast Asia as air pollution levels soared Thursday. Air pollution in the region worsens particularly in winter when the burning of crop residue in agricultural areas coincides with cooler temperatures that trap the smoke. The smoke is blown into cities, where there are more people and where auto emissions further add to the pollution. Emissions from industries without pollution controls and the use of coal to produce electricity are also linked to poor air quality in urban areas. Several studies have estimated more than a million Indians die each year from air pollution-related diseases. New Delhi’s air quality fell into the severe category, according to SAFAR, India’s main environmental monitoring agency. It measures particulate matter in the air that can enter the lungs. In many areas of the city, the levels were more than 50 times higher than the World Health Organization’s recommended safe limit. Forecasters warned air quality will worsen before the arrival of cold winds next week that could blow away the smog. Lahore, Pakistan, which is on the border with India, had an air quality index level considered hazardous, according to the Swiss group IQAir, which tracks global air quality. The levels in Hanoi, Vietnam, were unhealthy, according to IQAir. Transport, industry and construction were the main causes of bad air in Hanoi, Nguyen Hoang Anh, deputy head of the environmental quality management division at the ministry’s Pollution Control Department told state media on Monday. Hanoi has around 1 million cars and nearly 7 million motorbikes. Many are old and don’t meet emission standards. Construction projects also don’t stop dust from escaping, and factories use fossil fuel for power, contributing to the city’s smog. Bangkok’s air quality was unhealthy for sensitive groups on IQAir. The Meteorological Department said air ventilation rates have been poor recently and an atmospheric inversion layer caused airborne particles to accumulate.	https://apnews.com/article/india-air-pollution-smog-emissions-crop-burning-fe92c7a6d45ed080704945be41bc1303	2024-11-14T01:09:01-08:00	
Head of UN's nuclear watchdog visits Iran as Mideast wars and Trump's return raise worries	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency warned Thursday that the 'space for negotiation and diplomacy ... is getting smaller' over Iran's advancing atomic program as wars in the Mideast rage on and as President Donald Trump will return to the White House. Rafael Mariano Grossi of the IAEA was visiting Tehran in an effort to restore his inspectors' access to Iran's program and answer still-outstanding questions over it, as he has on previous trips with limited success since Trump unilaterally withdrew the U.S. from the Islamic Republic's nuclear deal with world powers. However, the remarks from both Grossi and his Iranian counterpart at a news conference suggested sizeable gaps still exist, even as some countries are pushing to take action against Iran at an upcoming IAEA Board of Governors' meeting. 'We know that it is indispensable to get, at this point of time, to get some concrete, tangible and visible results that will indicate that this joint work is improving (the) situation, is bringing clarification to things and in a general sense it is moving us away from conflict and ultimately war,' Grossi said. Since the deal’s collapse in 2018, Iran has abandoned all limits on its program, and enriches uranium to up to 60% purity — near weapons-grade levels of 90%. Surveillance cameras installed by the IAEA have been disrupted, while Iran has barred some of the Vienna-based agency’s most experienced inspectors. Iranian officials also have increasingly threatened that they could pursue atomic weapons, something the West and the IAEA has been worried about for years since Tehran abandoned an organized weapons program in 2003. Speaking at a news conference with Mohammad Eslami of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, Grossi stressed that while the IAEA and Iran continued to negotiate, time was not necessarily on their side. 'The fact that international tensions and regional tensions do exist — this shows that the space for negotiation and diplomacy is not getting bigger, it is getting smaller,' Grossi said. Before appearing with Eslami, Grossi met with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who later wrote on the social platform X that 'differences can be resolved through cooperation and dialogue.' However, he warned Tehran was 'NOT ready to negotiate under pressure and intimidation.' Some politicians have even suggested Iran abandon the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, known as the NPT, and pursue the bomb. Araghchi referred to Iran as 'a committed member of NPT,' though Eslami in his remarks warned Iran could retaliate if challenged at the upcoming IAEA Board of Governors' meeting. Grossi acknowledged some nations were considering taking action against Iran. 'We have repeatedly said any resolution seeking to intervene in the Islamic Republic of Iran’s nuclear affairs will be definitely followed by immediate reciprocal steps and we will not allow them to (exert) this kind of pressure,' Eslami said. Journalists at the news conference, as well as Eslami, criticized Israel for its longtime sabotage and assassination campaign targeting Iran's nuclear program. Some noted Israeli officials had threatened Iran's nuclear sites as targets for potential retaliation as Iran and Israel trade direct attacks amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip and Israel's ground and air offensive in Lebanon. 'The answer is in what we do here, what we, the IAEA, and Iran can do in terms of solving the questions at hand,' Grossi said, describing 'a situation of tension' with Iran's nuclear program at its center. 'I am here to work with Iran, (to) try to find adequate solutions to ease tensions, to move forward. This is my target. This is my concern. And I am confident that we are going to be able to do it,' he said. But as the two men ended the news conference to shouted questions from journalists, neither had offered any sign a breakthrough was imminent. Grossi also met Thursday for the first time with reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian. He’s scheduled to visit Iran’s Fordo and Natanz nuclear enrichment sites Friday. ___ Associated Press writer Nasser Karimi in Tehran, Iran, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-iaea-nuclear-program-grossi-trump-eslami-ce1dcf29eb76a89bd83d51768597d887	2024-11-14T01:05:38-08:00	
Middle East latest: Human Rights Watch accuses Israel of war crimes in Gaza Strip	Human Rights Watch said in a report released Thursday that Israel has committed war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip, including massive forced displacements that amount to ethnic cleansing. A new report released by the New York-based rights group said people have been killed while evacuating under Israeli orders and in Israeli-designated humanitarian zones, where hundreds of thousands are crammed into squalid tent camps. The report said the widespread, deliberate demolition of homes and civilian infrastructure in Gaza -– some of them to carve a new road bisecting the territory and establish a buffer zone along Israel’s border -– was likely to 'permanently displace' many Palestinians. 'Such actions of the Israeli authorities amount to ethnic cleansing,' Human Rights Watch said. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the report. Israel’s blistering campaign in Gaza has killed over 43,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to local health officials who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants. Around 90% of the territory’s population has fled their homes, with many displaced multiple times. The Israeli offensive has also damaged or destroyed around two-thirds of homes and other buildings in Gaza, according to U.N. assessments. Israel says it does not deliberately target civilians and blames Hamas for their deaths, saying the militants hide among civilians and operate in residential areas. Israeli forces have encircled the Gaza Strip’s northernmost areas for the past month, saying Hamas militants have regrouped there. Experts say the Israeli military campaign has caused a new wave of displaced civilians and warn that famine is imminent or may already be happening there. Israel has also been striking deeper inside Lebanon since September as it escalates the war against Hezbollah. On Thursday Israeli warplanes intensified airstrikes targeting multiple areas of Lebanon, killing at least nine people in the eastern city of Baalbek. The Israel-Hamas war began after Palestinian militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. Lebanon's Hezbollah group began firing into Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, in solidarity with Hamas in Gaza. Since then, more than 3,200 people have been killed in Lebanon and more than 14,200 wounded, the country's Health Ministry reported. In Israel, 76 people have been killed, including 31 soldiers. ___ Here's the latest: Lebanon reports 9 killed in airstrike on eastern city; strikes continue targeting Beirut suburbs BEIRUT — An Israeli airstrike hit a building in Baalbek city in eastern Lebanon, killing at least nine people and wounding five others, Lebanon’s state media said. The strike on Baalbek came without warning. The Israeli military did not immediately comment and the target was not clear. Israeli warplanes intensified airstrikes on Thursday, targeting various areas in southern and eastern Lebanon, including the outskirts of the southern port city of Tyre city and the Nabatieh province, the National News Agency said. Throughout the day, sporadic airstrikes targeted Beirut’s southern suburbs in a clear uptick in attacks on the area over the past two days, with the Israeli army issuing evacuation warnings for several locations and buildings in the suburbs. The Israeli military said it carried out strikes on Hezbollah targets in the Dahiyeh area, including weapons storage facilities and command centers. Lebanon’s Health Ministry said the death toll in Lebanon since the war began on Oct. 8, 2023 has reached 3,365 while those wounded are 14,344. Nearly 1.2 million people have been displaced in Lebanon. Before the war intensified on Sept. 23, Hezbollah had said that it had lost nearly 500 members but the group has stopped releasing statements about their killed fighters since 2 Israeli airstrikes in Syria kill at least 15, state media report DAMASCUS, Syria — Syria’s state news agency says Israel carried out two airstrikes on a western neighborhood Damascus and one of the capital’s suburbs, killing at least 15 people.

SANA said the airstrikes on the Mazzeh neighborhood in Damascus and the suburb of Qudsaya northwest of the capital struck two buildings. An Associated Press journalist at the scene in Mazzeh said a five-story building was damaged by a missile that hit the basement. An official with the Palestinian Islamic Jihad Group said the strike in Mazzeh targeted one of their offices, and that several members of the group were killed.

EU's top diplomat proposes suspending political dialogue with Israel BRUSSELS — The European Union’s top diplomat is proposing that the bloc suspend political dialogue with Israel over concerns about human rights abuses and breaches of international law in its war against Hamas. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell will put the proposal to foreign ministers from the 27 member countries at a meeting he will chair in Brussels on Monday. Borrell 'will ask ministers to consider whether Israel is violating human rights, whether Israel is respecting or not international humanitarian law, and he will invite the ministers to express their views on his proposal to suspend political dialogue,' his spokesman said. The EU is deeply divided over Israel and the Palestinians and it’s unlikely that all the ministers would agree to halt the dialogue. 'Any kind of decisions regarding the political parts of this agreement are subject to unanimity of all the member states,' the spokesman, Peter Stano, told reporters on Thursday. Under the pact, the dialogue covers 'all subjects of common interest, and shall aim to open the way to new forms of cooperation with a view to common goals, in particular peace, security and democracy.' It’s meant to strengthen EU-Israeli relations. Israeli police complete demolition of Arab Bedouin village in the Negev Desert JERUSALEM — Israeli police completed the demolition of the Arab Bedouin village of Umm Al-Hiran Thursday, ending a years-old legal battle. Many in the minority community had seen the village as a symbol of their larger struggle against Israeli plans to relocate them. On Thursday, Israeli bulldozers entered the 400-person village in the Negev Desert and demolished the last building left standing –- the mosque. Residents had dismantled their makeshift homes earlier this week to avoid having to pay fees for the state to demolish them. Israel says the hundreds of villagers were squatting on public land and has offered them plots in a nearby Bedouin township. The villagers accuse the authorities of forcibly displacing them so the land can be developed for Israel’s Jewish majority. Israel’s far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, celebrated the move, posting on X that there has been a 400% increase in the issuance of such demolition orders so far this year. 'Proud to lead a strong policy of demolishing illegal houses in the Negev!' he wrote. Or Hanoch, an Israeli activist who witnessed the demolition, said drones and helicopters hovered overhead as seven police bulldozers took down the mosque. 'After the mosque was demolished, the rest of the heavy machinery started re-destroying the rest of the houses, which were already demolished,' Hanoch said. Three members of the village council were arrested early Thursday before the demolition began, said Nati Yefet, the spokesperson for the Regional Council for Unrecognized Villages in the Negev. The council has accused Israel of clearing the land for the construction of a Jewish community. 'The destruction of Umm al-Hiran to make way for the settlement of Dror is part of a systematic population replacement program in the Negev,' it said. Four other Bedouin villages have been demolished this year as part of a larger plan to raze unrecognized villages and build new Jewish communities in their place, it said. Umm al-Hiran was founded in its current location in 1956, after the Israeli military relocated the village clan multiple times following the 1948 war that led to Israel’s creation. Israel’s more than 200,000 Bedouin are the poorest members of the country’s Arab minority, which also includes Christian and Muslim urban communities. Israel’s Arab population, which makes up roughly 20% of the country’s 10 million people, are citizens with the right to vote but often suffer discrimination and tend to identify with Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Syrian state media report explosions near Damascus and Homs DAMASCUS, Syria — Syrian state media are reporting explosions near the capital, Damascus, and the central city of Homs in what appeared to be Israeli airstrikes. State news agency SANA said the country’s air defenses were activated against a 'hostile target' south of Homs on Thursday. It gave no further details. The agency later reported an explosion near Damascus, adding that the cause of the blasts was not immediately clear. Israel has carried out hundreds of airstrikes in Syria targeting members of Lebanon’s Hezbollah and officials from Iranian-backed groups. Israel says it has allowed 15 trucks carrying aid into northern Gaza JERUSALEM — Israel says 15 trucks loaded with aid have been allowed into northern Gaza, where aid groups have warned that a monthlong offensive could cause a famine. The military body handling aid deliveries into the territory, COGAT, said the 15 trucks entered Gaza on Wednesday with aid shipped in by sea by the United Arab Emirates. It said the aid consists of food and water, as well as hygiene, shelter and medical supplies. U.N. agencies did not immediately confirm that the aid was delivered to its destination inside northern Gaza. Over the past week, the U.N. says aid trucks have entered the north but have not reached their final destinations due to Israeli movement restrictions and hungry crowds taking items from the trucks. Israel has scrambled to ramp up aid to Gaza after a monthlong stretch during which aid plunged to its lowest levels this year. The U.S. Biden administration warned Israel to increase the aid last month, saying a failure to do so could lead to a reduction in military support. The White House backed down this week, citing some improvements and ruling out any reduction in arms supplies, even after international aid groups said Israel had fallen far short of the American demands. Human Rights Watch accuses Israel of war crimes, crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip JERUSALEM — Human Rights Watch says Israel has committed war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip, including massive forced displacements that amount to ethnic cleansing. A report released by the New York-based rights group on Thursday says Israeli evacuation orders have often caused 'grave harm' to civilians. People have been killed while evacuating and in Israeli-designated humanitarian zones, where hundreds of thousands are crammed into squalid tent camps. 'The Israeli government cannot claim to be keeping Palestinians safe when it kills them along escape routes, bombs so-called safe zones, and cuts off food, water, and sanitation,' said Nadia Hardman, refugee and migrant rights researcher at Human Rights Watch. The report said the widespread, deliberate demolition of homes and civilian infrastructure in Gaza -– some of them to carve a new road bisecting the territory and establish a buffer zone along Israel’s border -– was likely to 'permanently displace' many Palestinians. 'Such actions of the Israeli authorities amount to ethnic cleansing,' Human Rights Watch said. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report. Human Rights Watch called on governments to stop supplying weapons to Israel and to comply with a July opinion by the International Court of Justice saying Israel’s presence in the Palestinian territories is unlawful and must end. The group says its researchers interviewed 39 displaced Palestinians in Gaza, reviewed evacuation orders Israel has released throughout the war and analyzed satellite imagery and video of attacks along evacuation routes and in 'safe zones.' US military says it conducted strikes against Houthi rebels DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — The U.S. military says it has conducted several days of strikes targeting Yemen’s Houthi rebels. The strikes included U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy aircraft, including the Navy’s F-35C stealth fighter jet, it said Thursday. The military also released video showing a strike by an MQ-9 Reaper drone on a mobile missile launcher placed on the back of what appeared to be a truck. A person standing next to the launcher is seen running away after the strike. 'This targeted operation was conducted in response to the Houthi’s repeated and unlawful attacks on international commercial shipping, as well as U.S., coalition and merchant vessels in the Red Sea, Bab al-Mandeb Strait and the Gulf of Aden,' the U.S. military’s Central Command said. 'It also aimed to degrade the Houthi’s ability to threaten regional partners.' The strikes happened Saturday and Sunday. The Houthis launched an attack this week targeted two U.S. Navy destroyers entering the Red Sea. The Americans said they 'engaged and defeated' eight bomb-carrying drones, five anti-ship ballistic missiles and four cruise missiles that the Houthis used to target the vessels. ___ For more Middle East news: https://apnews.com/hub/middle-east	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-hezbollah-mideast-latest-14-november-2024-ad692fc0f735157f8ed7997922e0138b	2024-11-14T01:00:11-08:00	
French weapons system found in Sudan is likely violation of U.N. arms embargo, says Amnesty	CAIRO (AP) — Armored vehicles manufactured by the United Arab Emirates and equipped with French defense systems have been captured by the Sudanese army during the civil war in Sudan, Amnesty International says. The rights group said in a report on Thursday it had identified the UAE-made armored personnel carriers (APCs) in various parts of Sudan, including the Darfur region, where they were used by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in its fight with the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF). It added that the presence of the military vehicles on the battlefield 'likely constitutes a violation' of a United Nations arms embargo that prohibits the transfer of weapons to Sudan. The civil war broke out in April 2023 after simmering tensions between the RSF and the Sudanese army escalated to intense fighting across the North African country, where rampant human rights violations were committed. More than 20,000 people have been killed in the conflict, according to the U.N., while 11.6 million have been forcibly displaced, including 8.3 million people internally and 3.1 million people who fled to neighboring countries. Sudan's claim that the UAE has been supplying the RSF with weapons that prolonged the 18-month war with the army has been denied by the UAE. Amnesty's report said it had identified the presence of several Nimr Ajban APCs on the ground after verifying pictures shared on social media showing the vehicles captured or destroyed by the Sudanese army. The vehicles were reportedly made in the UAE by Edge Group and equipped with the Galix reactive defense system, which is manufactured in France by Lacroix Defense and KNDS France, according to the Amnesty report. The Galix system is designed to protect vehicles from approaching threats by releasing projectiles, smoke and decoys, according to Lacroix’s website. 'Our research shows that weaponry designed and manufactured in France is in active use on the battlefield in Sudan,' said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General. 'The Galix System is being deployed by the RSF in this conflict, and any use in Darfur would be a clear breach of the U.N. arms embargo. 'The French government must ensure that Lacroix Defense and KNDS France immediately stop the supply of this system to the UAE.' ِLacroix has been contacted through its website form for comment. Responding to the Amnesty report, a spokesperson for the Emirati government said in an emailed statement that the UAE is the 'target of a coordinated disinformation campaign aimed at undermining our foreign policy, regional role, and humanitarian efforts.' 'It is both outrageous and unacceptable that the SAF representatives continue to level accusations against the UAE, alleging our involvement in the ongoing conflict,' the statement read, adding that the UAE has been involved with humanitarian initiatives to help Sudanese people in the conflict. The UAE said it has told the U.N. Security Council and international partners that it is not providing support or supplies to the RSF or 'any of the belligerent warring parties in Sudan.' Last month, the United States sanctioned Algoney Hamdan Daglo Musa, a senior RSF leader and the brother of the paramilitary’s commander Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, for 'leading efforts' to supply weapons throughout the war. Algoney controls the UAE-based Tradive General Trading LLC, a front company that imported vehicles to Sudan on behalf of the paramilitary RSF and retrofitted them with machine guns.	https://apnews.com/article/sudan-war-uae-france-arms-embargo-7c8b68e42f6c51cecabd69637f332670	2024-11-14T00:53:00-08:00	
South African government says it won't help thousands of illegal miners inside a closed mine	JOHANNESBURG (AP) — South Africa's government says it will not help an estimated 4,000 illegal miners inside a closed mine in the country's North West province who have been denied access to basic supplies as part of an official strategy against illegal mining. The miners in the mineshaft in Stilfontein are believed to be suffering from a lack of food, water and other basic necessities after police closed off the entrances used to transport their supplies underground. It is part of the police’s Vala Umgodi, or Close the Hole, operation, which includes cutting off miners’ supplies to force them to return to the surface and be arrested. North West police spokesperson Sabata Mokgwabone said information received from those who recently helped bring three miners to the surface indicated that as many as 4,000 miners may be underground. Police have not provided an official estimate. In the past few weeks, over 1,000 miners have surfaced at various mines in North West province, with many reported to be weak, hungry and sickly after going for weeks without basic supplies. Police continue on Thursday to guard areas around the mine to catch all those appearing from underground. Cabinet Minister Khumbudzo Ntshavheni told reporters on Wednesday that the government would not send any help to the illegal miners because they are involved in a criminal act. 'We are not sending help to criminals. We are going to smoke them out. They will come out. Criminals are not to be helped. We didn’t send them there,' Ntshavheni said. Illegal mining remains common in South Africa's old gold-mining areas, with miners going into closed shafts to dig for any possible remaining deposits. The illegal miners are often from neighboring countries, and police say the illegal operations involve larger syndicates that employ the miners. Their presence in closed mines have also created problems with nearby communities, which complain that the illegal miners commit crimes ranging from robberies to rape. Illegal mining groups are known to be heavily armed and disputes between rival groups sometimes result in fatal confrontations.	https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-illegal-miners-arrests-4d376ae6f6afca6170220f88fe859f90	2024-11-14T00:29:16-08:00	
Trump's mainstream picks for top foreign policy posts could reassure allies — and worry China	WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump is famously unconventional, but he made conventional picks for his two top foreign policy positions. That could be reassuring to American allies, while China and Iran have reasons to be wary. Trump on Wednesday announced his choice of Sen. Marco Rubio for secretary of state. Two days earlier, he picked Rep. Mike Waltz for national security adviser. Both men share Trump's hard-line stance on China and Iran. They have shown themselves willing to adapt their foreign-policy positions to echo aspects of Trump’s more isolationist 'America First' approach — a requirement for anyone serving under a president who demands absolute loyalty. But both are fairly mainstream conservatives with foreign policy experience who have previously differed with Trump on Russia, NATO and other issues. They've also been open to working with Democrats — a point underscored when Sen. Mark Warner, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Rubio would be a 'strong voice for American interests' abroad. Rubio and Waltz stand in contrast to some other national security selections. Trump named Pete Hegseth, a Fox News host untested on the global stage, as defense secretary. He picked a congresswoman with little foreign policy experience, Rep. Elise Stefanik, as ambassador to the United Nations. His choice for ambassador to Israel, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, rejects the two-state solution to the conflict with Palestinians. And U.S. allies may be relieved that Rubio was selected over Richard Grenell for secretary of state. Grenell is an ardent and combative Trump advocate and former diplomat and intelligence official, with a reputation for favoring autocratic strongmen abroad. Rubio, a 14-year veteran of the Senate, is a senior member of the Senate Intelligence Committee and Foreign Relations Committee. His roots as the son of Cuban immigrants who worked as a bartender and a hotel maid after coming to the United States helped shape his tough positions on the leftist governments of Cuba and Venezuela. While Trump has alarmed U.S. allies in Europe with his criticism of the NATO military alliance and praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose war on Ukraine has galvanized European fears of Russian expansionism, Rubio was instrumental in the Senate in securing the U.S. position in NATO. He and Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine spearheaded legislation to bar any president from pulling the U.S. out of NATO without Senate approval or an act of Congress. But Rubio, like Waltz in the House, has altered his public statements and legislative votes to more closely align with Trump's criticism of the Biden administration's backing of Ukraine as it battles invading Russian forces. After early votes and supportive statements for Ukraine after Russia's 2022 attack, Rubio and Waltz more recently voted against additional military aid to Ukraine. Rubio, like Trump, has increasingly stressed the need to end the war. That's in contrast to Ukraine supporters in both parties who say the U.S. must support Ukraine's fight so it gets the best possible terms in any eventual cease-fire. 'I don’t think he (Trump) puts people in positions that are going to disagree with him. He wants people to be loyal, and I don’t think he’s looking for people that are going to challenge his beliefs,' said Kelly Grieco, a senior fellow at the Stimson Center, a Washington-based research institute. 'So I think this is actually quite revealing, probably, of what the direction of U.S. policy will be, that it will be really hawkish on China in particular. And I think also on Iran.' In China, analysts consider Rubio and Waltz to be 'ultra-hawkish' toward Beijing and have taken to calling them part of the 'Florida faction' in foreign policy, since both are from the state. Trump piled tariffs on China in his first term and promises more tariffs in his next one. Rubio has argued for a more confrontational approach toward China, and he has been a vocal supporter of Taiwan, which Beijing sees as Chinese territory. Rubio is known in China as the 'anti-China vanguard' for his ideologically driven, anti-communism stance. He landed on Beijing’s blacklist in 2020 over his support for the minority Uyghurs in China’s far western region of Xinjiang and for Hong Kong activists. He co-chaired the bipartisan Congressional-Executive Commission on China, which focuses on human rights, and introduced and supported numerous bills on China’s rights issues. The sanctions Beijing imposed on Rubio bar him from visiting the country. It’s unclear if China's foreign minister will meet with him given the ban, or how the ban will otherwise affect his dealings with Chinese officials. For his part, Waltz is a former Green Beret with combat tours in Afghanistan and the Middle East, a former defense policy director in the Pentagon, and a senior member of the House committees for armed services, intelligence and oversight. He’s supported Western backing for Ukraine, saying doing nothing would invite further Russian aggression in Europe and draw in U.S. troops. But Waltz increasingly emphasizes the importance of Ukraine’s neighbors stepping up, saying Europeans should be spending as much on Ukraine's defense as the United States does. In a Nov. 2 article he co-wrote for The Economist, Waltz argued that China has benefited from the Biden administration’s failures to deter conflicts in Europe and in the Middle East. In 2021, Waltz introduced a resolution calling on the U.S. Olympic Committee to withdraw from the 2022 Winter Games in Beijing. 'The world cannot legitimize the CCP’s acts of genocide in Xinjiang, destruction of the democratic rights of Hong Kong, and dangerous suppression of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan that cost lives by sending delegations to Beijing,' Waltz said then, referring to the Chinese Communist Party. At a daily briefing in Beijing, Lin Jian, a spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry, said China would not comment on Trump's appointments. Shen Dingli, a Shanghai-based international relations expert, noted the gap between Trump and his nominees on China. 'Trump didn’t say China was an enemy during his first term and the presidential elections, but the hawkish officials he has appointed may believe China is an enemy to some extent,' Shen said. Robert Manning, a China expert at the Stimson Center, said Trump is not as ideologically driven as Rubio but he raised concerns that Trump's foreign policy could be more disruptive than President Joe Biden's. 'I think some in the Trump camp want to get rid of the Communist Party of China, which I think is a fool’s errand, but nonetheless I think they’re more focused on a different endgame than achieving a stable balance of power,' he said. ___ Associated Press writer Mary Clare Jalonick in Washington and AP researchers Yu Bing and Liu Zheng in Beijing contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-rubio-waltz-china-foreign-policy-6179fa4a34e8c1768c75ad70b55b17cc	2024-11-13T20:08:23-08:00	
The Latin Grammys are almost here for a 25th anniversary celebration	The 2024 Latin Grammy Awards are here and back in Miami. It's a big year: the award show is celebrating its 25th anniversary, and Latin music genres have never been bigger globally. So, what should you expect? Édgar Barrera — the producer and songwriter known for his work with such artists as Madonna, Karol G, Peso Pluma, Shakira, Grupo Frontera and beyond — leads the 2024 Latin Grammy nominations for a second year in a row. This year, he’s up for nine awards; last year he received 13 nominations and won three. Barrera is nominated for producer, songwriter, record and album of the year. He’s also nominated twice in the best Regional Mexican song category, and three times in the song of the year category, for his work on Shakira and Grupo Frontera’s 'Entre Paréntesis', Karol G’s 'Mi Ex Tenía Razón,' and Maluma and Carin León’s 'Según Quién.' Just behind Barrera are some of his collaborators, like Karol G and Bad Bunny. Those giants of reggaetón and beyond are tied with eight nominations each. Colombian songwriter Keityn has six nods. The Latin Grammys will begin at 8 p.m. Eastern and are being held at the Kaseya Center in Miami. Performers at this year’s bash include Barrera, Residente, Myke Towers, DJ Khaled, Jon Bon Jovi, Joe Jonas, Anitta, Becky G, Eladio Carrión, Grupo Frontera, Kali Uchis, Pitbull, Luis Fonsi, Juan Luis Guerra, Carín León and many more. The 2024 Latin Recording Academy Person of the Year recipient, Carlos Vives, will also perform. Past winners include Juanes, Laura Pausini, Marco Antonio Solís, Rubén Blades and more. There are also two new categories this year: best Latin electronic music performance, housed within the new electronic music field, and best contemporary Mexican music album. The three-hour 25th annual Latin Grammy Awards telecast will air live on Univision, UniMás, Galavisión and ViX.	https://apnews.com/article/2024-latin-grammys-show-a1320963a36cc848ea4a8d7b521a0cba	2024-11-13T20:07:43-08:00	
Ukrainian soldiers focus on keeping Russian advances at bay and brace for storm to come from US	KHARKIV REGION, Ukraine (AP) — The four drones were designed to carry bombs, but instead the men of Ukraine's Khartia brigade pack them with food, water and handwarmers and launch them in darkness toward the front line, a 15-minute flight away. The unit commander who goes by the callsign Kit, or 'cat,' pilots the tiny uncrewed aircraft from a basement room he jokingly calls their Airbnb. Guided by the drone's night-vision camera, he drops the 10-kilogram (22-pound) packages one by one as close as he can to the position where as many as five infantrymen battle Russian forces in the late autumn chill. The delivery will hold them for two or three days. That's about as far as Kit dares look into the future. He knows that the reelection of Donald Trump will change something in his life, but as far as he and other Ukrainian soldiers on the front are concerned, trying to figure out how is a game for politicians. For him, all that matters is the distance he measures in the meters (yards) that Russian forces advance or retreat in the front-line sector that is his responsibility. 'We are trying with all our might to destroy them and win back our territories, so that it does not go any further, so that there are no more destroyed cities and destroyed lives,' Kit said. 'We need to focus on the present in our work and try to do it effectively in the here and now.' But he cannot escape the sense of a gathering storm. Russia is increasingly hitting the Kharkiv region with unstoppable, building-leveling glide bombs and swarms of drones and chipping away at territory there. Its troops are advancing in the Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia regions. Up to 12,000 North Korean troops have been sent to Russia's Kursk border region to help beat back Ukrainian forces there, according to U.S., South Korean and Ukrainian intelligence assessments. Trump, who has called President Vladimir Putin 'pretty smart' for invading Ukraine, has repeatedly criticized American backing of Ukraine. He characterized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as 'the greatest salesman on Earth' for winning U.S. aid. Zelenskyy was among the first world leaders to publicly congratulate Trump, and said the two discussed how to end 'Russian aggression against Ukraine' when they met in September. Between now and Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration, the Biden administration has said it will send as much aid to Ukraine as possible to help hold back Russian forces and possess a strong hand in any potential peace negotiations. But Russia is pressing just as hard for an advantage in what most believe are crucial weeks to come. Aviator, a Khartia soldier launching the supply drones, said he can only do his job and hope for the best. His attention is fixed on how many hours remain before the coming dawn, when Russian forces will be able to spot the uncrewed aircraft and shoot them down. If his mission fails, he knows that the men he calls brothers will suffer. 'You feel you’re useful, that you are in the right place, that the lives and health of our brothers depend on your work,' said Aviator, who returned to Ukraine from a job in Poland to join the army. 'We’re just doing our job, we don’t have time to worry about the election.' Tolstiy, who runs a drone repair workshop not far away, knows firsthand what happens to territory captured by Russia. A former infantryman, he fought in Bakhmut and watched the city fall to Russian forces who bombed it to rubble. He confessed that sometimes, reading the news makes him want to give up. But that's simply unthinkable. 'It’s like we’re in another world here,' he said. 'When you see that your comrades are injured or killed, it motivates you.' ___ Lori Hinnant contributed from Kyiv.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-trump-frontline-weapons-b466c861d935c5b41631a6710ce9ea48	2024-11-13T20:07:24-08:00	
1 million migrants in the US rely on temporary protections that Trump could target	NEW YORK (AP) — Maribel Hidalgo fled her native Venezuela a year ago with a 1-year-old son, trudging for days through Panama's Darien Gap, then riding the rails across Mexico to the United States. They were living in the U.S. when the Biden administration announced Venezuelans would be offered Temporary Protected Status, which allows people already in the United States to stay and work legally if their homelands are deemed unsafe. People from 17 countries, including Haiti, Afghanistan, Sudan and recently Lebanon, are currently receiving such relief. But President-elect Donald Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, have promised mass deportations and suggested they would scale back the use of TPS that covers more than 1 million immigrants. They have highlighted unfounded claims that Haitians who live and work legally in Springfield, Ohio, as TPS holders were eating their neighbors’ pets. Trump also amplified disputed claims made by the mayor of Aurora, Colorado, about Venezuelan gangs taking over an apartment complex. 'What Donald Trump has proposed doing is we’re going to stop doing mass parole,' Vance said at an Arizona rally in October, mentioning a separate immigration status called humanitarian parole that is also at risk. 'We’re going to stop doing mass grants of Temporary Protected Status.' Hidalgo wept as she discussed her plight with a reporter as her son, now 2, slept in a stroller outside the New York migrant hotel where they live. At least 7.7 million people have fled political violence and economic turmoil in Venezuela in one of the biggest displacements worldwide. 'My only hope was TPS,' Hidalgo said. 'My worry, for example, is that after everything I suffered with my son so that I could make it to this country, that they send me back again.' Venezuelans along with Haitians and Salvadorans are the largest group of TPS beneficiaries and have the most at stake. Haiti's international airport shut down this week after gangs opened fire at a commercial flight landing in Port-Au-Prince while a new interim prime minister was sworn in. The Federal Aviation Administration barred U.S. airlines from landing there for 30 days. 'It's creating a lot of anxiety,' said Vania André, editor-in-chief for The Haitian Times, an online newspaper covering the Haitian diaspora. 'Sending thousands of people back to Haiti is not an option. The country is not equipped to handle the widespread gang violence already and cannot absorb all those people.' Designations by the Homeland Security secretary offer relief for up to 18 months but are extended in many cases. The designation for El Salvador ends in March. Designations for Sudan, Ukraine, and Venezuela end in April. Others expire later. Federal regulations say a designation can be terminated before it expires, but that has never happened, and it requires 60 days' notice. TPS is similar to the lesser-known Deferred Enforcement Departure Program that Trump used to reward Venezuelan exile supporters as his first presidency was ending, shielding 145,000 from deportation for 18 months. Attorney Ahilan T. Arulanantham, who successfully challenged Trump's earlier efforts to allow TPS designations for several countries to expire, doesn't doubt the president-elect will try again. 'It's possible that some people in his administration will recognize that stripping employment authorization for more than a million people, many of whom have lived in this country for decades, is not good policy' and economically disastrous, said Arulanantham, who teaches at the University of California, Los Angeles School of Law, and helps direct its Center for Immigration Law and Policy. 'But nothing in Trump’s history suggests that they would care about such considerations.' Courts blocked designations from expiring for Haiti, Sudan, Nicaragua and El Salvador until well into President Joe Biden's term. Homeland Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas then renewed them. Arulanantham said he 'absolutely' could see another legal challenge, depending on what the Trump administration does. Congress established TPS in 1990, when civil war was raging in El Salvador. Members were alarmed to learn some Salvadorans were tortured and executed after being deported from the U.S. Other designations protected people during wars in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kuwait, from genocidal violence in Rwanda, and after volcanic eruptions in Montserrat, a British territory in the Caribbean, in 1995 and 1997. A designation is not a pathway to U.S. permanent residence or citizenship, but applicants can try to change their status through other immigration processes. Advocates are pressing the White House for a new TPS designation for Nicaraguans before Biden leaves office. Less than 3,000 are still covered by the temporary protections issued in 1998 after Hurricane Mitch battered the country. People who fled much later under oppression from President Daniel Ortega’s government don’t enjoy the same protection from deportation. 'It's a moral obligation' for the Biden administration, said Maria Bilbao, of the American Friends Service Committee. Elena, a 46-year-old Nicaraguan who has lived in the United States illegally for 25 years, hopes Biden moves quickly. 'He should do it now,' said Elena, who lives Florida and insisted only her first name be used because she fears deportation. 'Not in January. Not in December. Now.' __ Snow reported from Phoenix.

Thousands of police officers but few visiting fans for France-Israel soccer match after attacks	PARIS (AP) — There will be a heavy police presence but few visiting fans at Thursday’s soccer match between France and Israel in the Nations League, with authorities in Paris on high alert amid an increasingly tense political climate. French police chief Laurent Nuñez said 4,000 police officers and security staff will be deployed around the Stade de France stadium, with another 1,500 police on public transport. The extreme measures come one week after violence against Israeli fans around a Europa League soccer game in Amsterdam in attacks widely condemned across Europe as antisemitic. Three months after hosting an Olympic closing ceremony, the atmosphere has gone from festive to fearful and the national stadium was expected to be three-quarters empty for the match. French President Emmanuel Macron and French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau will be present. Only 20,000 of 80,000 tickets have been sold with around 150 Israel supporters reportedly attending, escorted by police. 'We’ve tried to prepare for this match as normally as possible. But obviously none of us within the team can be insensitive to such a heavy context,' France coach Didier Deschamps said Wednesday. 'It impacts the amount of supporters present tomorrow and everything that goes with it.' The away match against Israel on Oct. 10 — which France won 4-1 — was played in Budapest, Hungary. 'These are situations the players are not accustomed to,' Deschamps said. 'But we have to adapt.' The low number of visiting fans comes after Israel’s National Security Council warned citizens abroad to avoid sports and cultural events, specifically the match in Paris. Retailleau told French news channel TF1 on Tuesday that no specific threats were identified but 'zero risk does not exist.' Therefore, he said, exceptional measures are in place 'before the match, during the match and after the match.' The elite tactical unit of the French National Police, known as RAID, will be in the stadium and some police will be in plain clothes mingling with fans. There will also be heavy surveillance within Paris, including at Jewish places of worship. 'It is out of the question that we take the risk of seeing a repeat of the dramatic events, of the manhunt, that we saw in Amsterdam,' Retailleau said, adding that postponing or moving the game elsewhere was ruled out. 'France does not retreat,' he said. 'France does not submit, and the France-Israel match will take place where it's supposed to.' Last Thursday night, Amsterdam witnessed scenes of chaos when Israeli fans were attacked by hordes of young people apparently riled up by calls on social media to target Jewish people, according to Dutch authorities. Before the game, a large group of supporters of the Israeli team could be seen on video chanting anti-Arab slogans as they headed to the stadium, escorted by police. Protests erupted in Paris on Wednesday night against a controversial gala organized by far-right figures in support of Israel. The game in Saint-Denis, the suburb north of Paris where the stadium is located, is scheduled to kick off at 8:45 p.m. local time (1945 GMT) on Thursday. Nine years ago, Stade de France was one of several locations during the Nov. 13 terror attacks in which 130 people died. France was playing Germany that night when two explosions happened outside the stadium. Deschamps, Germany coach Joachim Löw and all the players stayed together in the locker rooms for hours until it was safe to leave. 'It's a sad date for us given what happened in 2015,' Deschamps said. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer	https://apnews.com/article/france-israel-security-fans-nations-league-d8104e6838a460741361297b23af539c	2024-11-13T20:03:18-08:00	
China's president unveils a megaport in Peru, but locals say they're being left out	CHANCAY, Peru (AP) — On the edge of Peru’s coastal desert, a remote fishing town where a third of all residents have no running water is being transformed into a huge deep-water port to cash in on the inexorable rise of Chinese interest in resource-rich South America. The megaport of Chancay, a $1.3 billion project majority-owned by the Chinese shipping giant Cosco, is turning this outpost of bobbing fishing boats into an important node of the global economy. From the presidential palace in Lima, 60 kilometers (37 miles) south of the port inauguration ceremony, China’s President Xi Jinping watched a livestream of the ribbon-cutting alongside his Peruvian counterpart, Dina Boluarte, late Thursday. The leaders' faces appeared on a giant screen in Chancay, where engineers in bright orange safety vests declared the port operational to the swell of string instruments. Chinese dancers with red dragon-costume heads seemingly burst out of nowhere to prance around the docking station as a crane lowered the first aluminum containers onto a berthed cargo ship. 'Considerable income and enormous job opportunities will be generated for Peru,' Xi said from Lima, where world leaders were preparing to gather for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. 'This will generate tangible results for the people of the region.' But the development — expected to encompass 15 quays and a large industrial park drawing more than $3.5 billion in investment over a decade — has met a skeptical response from impoverished villagers, who say it is depriving them of fishing waters and bringing no economic benefit to locals. 'Our fishing spots no longer exist here. They destroyed them,' said 78-year-old fisherman Julius Caesar — 'like the emperor of Rome' — gesturing toward the dockside cranes. 'I don't blame the Chinese for trying to mine this place for all it's worth. I blame our government for not protecting us.' The Peruvian government hopes the port will become a strategic transshipment hub for the region, opening a new line connecting South America to Asia and speeding trade across the Pacific for Peru's blueberries, Brazil's soybeans and Chile's copper, among other exports. Officials cite the port's potential to generate millions of dollars in revenues and turn coastal cities into so-called special economic zones with tax breaks to lure investment. 'We Peruvians are focused primarily on the well-being of Peruvians,' Foreign Minister Elmer Schialer told The Associated Press. But many of Chancay's 60,000 residents are unconvinced. Fishermen returning to port with smaller catches complain that they have already lost out. The dredging of the port — which sucked sediment from the seabed to create a shipping channel 17 meters (56 feet) deep — has ruined fish breeding grounds, locals said. 'I’ve been out in the water all day and I’m always needing to venture farther,' said Rafael Ávila, a 28-year-old fisherman with sand in his hair, returning to shore empty-handed and exhausted. 'This used to be enough,' he said, pointing at his painted dinghy. 'Now I need a larger, more expensive boat to reach the fish.' To make extra cash, Ávila started offering occasional joyrides to selfie-taking visitors wanting to get a glimpse at the hulking Chinese ships. With some of the world's largest container ships to berth at Chancay Port in January 2025, residents also fear the arrival of pollution and oil spills. In 2022, a botched tanker delivery at La Pampilla refinery nearby sent thousands of barrels of crude oil spilling into Peru's famously biodiverse waters, killing countless fish and putting legions of fishermen out of work. Today a glance at the moribund town center, featuring mostly empty seafood restaurants, tells the story of diminished fishing stocks and decimated tourism even without the port being operational. The port's breakwater changed the currents and destroyed good surfing conditions, locals said, affecting everyone from ice vendors to truckers to restaurant owners. 'No to the megaport' is spray-painted on a wall overlooking the waterfront. 'This port is a monster that's come here to screw us,' said 40-year-old Rosa Collantes, cleaning and gutting slimy drum fish on the shore. 'People come to the port and they say ‘Wow, tremendous!' but they don't see the reality.' Port authorities say they're aware of the stark contrast between the sleek modern port and the surrounding village of Chancay, where many live on unpaved roads lined with ragged shacks and littered with trash. 'You cannot build a state-of-the-art port and have a city next to it that has no drinking water, no sewage, a collapsing hospital and no educational centers,' said Mario de las Casas, a manager for Cosco in Chancay, adding that the company had already launched studies to determine how the port could help reduce inequality and spur local growth. 'The port should not be a blemish,' De las Casas said.	https://apnews.com/article/china-peru-port-poverty-latin-america-1e06904f76cca1d7aaf19bca8bd24d93	2024-11-13T20:02:57-08:00	
An overwhelmed Philippines braces for another typhoon, the fifth major storm to hit in three weeks	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The fifth major storm in three weeks approached the Philippines on Thursday, prompting more largescale evacuations and a United Nations request for emergency funds to help the government ease the plight of hard-hit villagers. Typhoon Usagi had sustained winds of up to 185 kilometers (115 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 230 kph (143 mph) and was forecast to strengthen further before slamming Thursday afternoon into the coast of Cagayan province at the northern tip of Luzon, the country’s most populous agricultural region. Another storm was brewing in the Pacific and may hit the northern Philippines this weekend, according to forecasters. The country's weather agency warned of life-threatening tidal surges of up to three meters (nearly 10 feet) in coastal areas of Cagayan and seven other nearby provinces and clusters of islands, and urged all ships to remain in port or immediately take shelter. Typhoon Toraji blew away from the northern Philippines just two days ago after unleashing floods, knocking down power lines and forcing more than 42,000 people to evacuate their homes. The government has struggled to deal with the impact of the last four major storms, which left at least 160 people dead, displaced millions and devastated farmland and infrastructure, mostly in the northern Luzon region. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s administration has spent more than 1 billion pesos ($17 million) for food and other aid for hundreds of thousands of storm victims, Welfare Assistant Secretary Irene Dumlao said. Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro, who oversees disaster-response efforts, sought the help of neighboring countries, including Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei, in providing additional aircraft to transport food, water and other aid to villages isolated by the storms. The United States, Manila’s longtime treaty ally, deployed cargo aircraft with food and other assistance. The U.N. Humanitarian Country Team in the Philippines said it was raising $32.9 million to help the government provide assistance to about 210,000 people in critical need of aid and protection, especially women, children and people with disabilities, in the next three months. 'The Philippines is facing an exceptionally challenging tropical cyclone season, with successive cyclones reaching unprecedented locations and scales,' the U.N. team in said in its emergency plan. 'Local authorities, who are often impacted themselves, are overwhelmed as they simultaneously respond to the crisis and coordinate rescue efforts for affected families.' The Philippines is battered by about 20 typhoons and tropical storms each year. It is often hit by earthquakes and has more than a dozen active volcanoes, making it one of the world’s most disaster-prone countries. In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest recorded tropical cyclones, left more than 7,300 people dead or missing, flattened entire villages and caused ships to run aground and smash into houses in the central Philippines.	https://apnews.com/article/philippines-typhoon-usagi-united-nations-4690fe8d399105fe63f3071c4912d1c2	2024-11-13T20:02:24-08:00	
Stock market today: Wall Street drifts near its records as Disney soars	NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are drifting Thursday as the market’s big burst following Donald Trump’s election continues to cool. The S&amp;P 500 was virtually unchanged in early trading and still near its all-time high set on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 41 points, or 0.1%, as of 9:50 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.2% lower. The Walt Disney Co. helped lead the market with a jump of 10.6% after the entertainment giant reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Disney CEO Robert Iger credited improved profits at its streaming businesses and strong box-office results for its movies, including 'Inside Out 2' and 'Deadpool &amp; Wolverine,' among other things. ASML, a major supplier to the global chip industry, also gave some encouraging signals for technology stocks. The Dutch company said it expects global semiconductor sales to top $1 trillion by 2030, with the help of demand related to artificial-intelligence technology, and it stood by its long-term financial forecasts. ASML shares that trade in the United States rose 4.9%. But a 1.3% drop for Cisco Systems was helping to keep indexes in check, even though the tech giant reported stronger profit than analysts expected for the latest quarter. Investors may have been looking for it to raise its financial forecasts more, analysts suggested. Super Micro Computer, which has been one of the biggest winners of the AI boom, fell 13.4% for the worst loss in the S&amp;P 500. It said on Wednesday that it doesn’t expect to file its quarterly financial statements with U.S. regulators on time. The server maker's stock has been struggling recently, particularly after Ernst &amp; Young resigned as its public accounting firm. A special committee of the company's board has since said that it’s found 'no evidence of fraud or misconduct on the part of management or the Board of Directors.' Tapestry shares jumped 11.4% after the luxury fashion company said it’s terminating its merger with Capri, another luxury brand owner. The companies agreed to a $8.5 billion deal in August 2023 to unite the makers of Coach and Michael Kors handbags, but the tie-up has faced numerous challenges, including a lawsuit from the Federal Trade Commission to block the deal on antitrust grounds. Capri shares fell 3.2%. Stocks were also feeling the effects of swinging yields in the bond market following the latest update on inflation. Prices paid at the U.S. wholesale level were 2.4% higher in October from a year earlier. That was an acceleration from September’s 1.9% inflation rate and a worse jump than economists expected. A separate report, meanwhile, suggested the U.S. job market remains solid. Fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week in the latest signal that layoffs aren’t taking off. Treasury yields initially jumped following the reports, as traders trimmed their expectations a bit for a coming cut to interest rates by the Federal Reserve at its meeting next month. But yields later regressed, and the yield on the 10-year Treasury eased to 4.42% from 4.45% late Wednesday. The Fed began cutting rates from their two-decade high in September to offer support for the job market, hoping to keep it humming after bringing inflation nearly all the way down to its target of 2%. Prior forecasts published by the Fed implied it could keep cutting rates through next year. But Trump’s victory may have scrambled such plans. Economists say his preferences for lower tax rates, higher tariffs and less regulation could ultimately lead to higher U.S. government debt and inflation, along with faster economic growth. While lower interest rates can give a boost to the economy and to prices for investments, they can also give inflation more fuel. And expectations for lower interest rates had been a major reason for the S&amp;P 500’s big jump of more than 20% for the year so far, as well as for hopes that the U.S. economy can keep growing and avoid a long-predicted recession. In stock markets abroad, European indexes were higher, including a 1.4% jump for Germany’s DAX. Asian markets were mixed, meanwhile. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dropped 2%, but South Korea’s Kospi added 0.1%. In the crypto market, bitcoin was up roughly 1% at $90,916 after crossing above $93,000 as cryptocurrencies generally soared. Trump has embraced cryptocurrencies, pledging to make the U.S. the crypto capital of the world. ___ AP Business Writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-rates-inflation-dollar-6a96ed4aef82bac9c23efd5d05d07a9b	2024-11-13T19:50:38-08:00	
India's Modi likely to find comfort in Trump's return and a shared worldview	NEW DELHI (AP) — Donald Trump’s return to the White House has made many countries anxious and recalculating where they stand with the U.S., but India appears to be welcoming the change that may embolden nationalist leaders like Prime Minister Narendra Modi. 'I know today a lot of countries are nervous about the U.S., let’s be honest about that,' India’s External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said over the weekend. India was 'not one of them.' A call from Modi 'was among the first three calls, I think, that President (elect) Trump took,' he added. A second Trump presidency is likely to play out in New Delhi’s favor, experts say, especially as Modi seeks to reset India’s relationship with the West after recent frictions over his refusal to join sanctions against Russia or condemn its 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Modi has also been criticized over India's democratic backsliding. 'Trump’s victory means that the Indian policies that have put New Delhi at odds with the West … will no longer be a cause of concern for Washington,' said Michael Kugelman, South Asia director at the Wilson Center. There could be ruptures on trade, immigration and climate change goals — but on balance, 'the return of Trump means that India’s relations with the West – and specifically its most powerful country — will get a boost,' he added. Modi has sought to cast India as a rising global player with a fast-growing economy that can counter China. But critics say his authoritarian politics and right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party have deeply polarized the country with minorities increasingly marginalized and the right to free speech and press under attack. When President Joe Biden honored Modi with a state visit last year, he walked a tightrope as activists and groups pressured him to confront Modi over his human rights record. Still, the two leaders rolled out new business deals on defense and technology. Such concerns won't be an issue with Trump, said Uday Chandra, an expert on South Asia and foreign policy. 'He is a refreshing reset from the Indian perspective … he is much more transactional.' Trump, long an open admirer of Russian President Vladimir Putin, is also likely to be more understanding of India’s strategic partnership with Moscow, which dates back to the Cold War, its record purchases of Russian crude, and its refusal to pick a side in the war in Ukraine. 'This was the real sort of thorn in India-U.S. relations over the past two years … but with Trump, I don’t see this being an issue,' Chandra said. One hot-button issue is trade. In his first term, trade differences between the two countries came to the fore with Trump calling India the 'tariff king' over disagreements on farm goods, Harley Davidson motorcycles and medical devices. In 2019, he canceled the country's special trade privileges and India responded by slapping tariffs on more than two dozen U.S. goods. This time, Trump wants to impose a 'universal' tax of 10% or 20% on all imports and raise tariffs on Chinese goods to 60%. India, which counts the U.S. as its second-largest trading partner, won't be an exception. 'New Delhi will have to do more than just tinkering with its policies to deal with Trump’s emphasis on fair trade,' said C Rajamohan, a professor at the Institute of South Asian Studies in Singapore. Immigration could turn into a sore point if Trump attempts to also curb skilled migration. Indians have often been the largest group applying for the H1-B work visa but Trump had called the visa program 'very bad' and 'unfair' for U.S. workers. Progress on climate change and clean energy could also be hit. 'India and the U.S. have done quite a lot on this front over the past four years — but this is something that could unravel because a Trump administration is more aligned with the fossil fuel industry than with green technology,' said Milan Vaishnav, South Asia Program director at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Both Trump and Modi embody strongmen tactics, count on an impassioned support base and have ramped up polarization to consolidate votes. And unlike liberal leaders in the West, Trump doesn’t view Modi’s policies at home problematic – or even relevant, said Kugelman. 'They’re both ardent nationalists committed to making their nations stronger at home and abroad,' he added. Analysts also point to the personal bond between the two. When Trump visited India in 2020, Modi threw him an event in the world's largest cricket stadium. The year before that, Trump held a massive rally for Modi in Texas and likened him to Elvis Presley for his crowd-pulling power. In his congratulatory post to Trump on X last week, Modi shared photos of the two leaders hugging, smiling and holding hands. 'There’s a bromance between the two,' said Chandra. 'But they're also united by a shared worldview — that we are in a post- liberal world and that liberalism as an ideology for conducting global politics is no longer viable. That’s as true in India as it is in America.'	https://apnews.com/article/india-us-election-2024-trump-modi-a291df0d68d76d88da353e1e12ad1934	2024-11-13T17:14:46-08:00	
Sri Lanka votes in a parliamentary election that's key for its new Marxist-leaning president	COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) — Sri Lankans are voting in a parliamentary election Thursday that is key for the country's new, Marxist-leaning president to consolidate his party's power and follow through on promises of economic recovery. President Anura Kumara Dissanayake won the presidential election on Sept. 21 in a victory that marked a rejection of the traditional political parties, which have governed the island nation since its independence from British rule in 1948. However, Dissanayake’s failure to secure more than 50% of the vote has fueled concerns over his party’s outlook in Thursday's election. His National People’s Power party must increase its votes significantly — from the 42% it won in the presidential election — if it is to acquire a minimum of 113 seats to take control of the 225-member Parliament. The biggest challenge for the NPP — which was founded in 2019 and is a relative newcomer on Sri Lanka’s political scene — is that many of its candidates are new faces in politics running against well-established politicians from the traditional parties. Of the 225 parliament seats, 196 are up for grabs under Sri Lanka's proportional representative electoral system, which allocates seats in each district among the parties according to the proportion of the votes they get. The remaining 29 seats — called the national list seats — are allocated to parties and independent groups according to the proportion of the total votes they receive countrywide. There are 8,821 candidates vying for the 196 seats for elected members of Parliament. Sajith Premadasa, who came in second in the presidential election and his Samagi Jana Balawegaya, or United People's Power party, is NPP's main competition. Dissanayake, while campaigning for his party’s candidates, has called on voters to help elect them to Parliament so he won’t need to rely on a coalition to enact the reforms he promised. Election results are expected on Friday. The election comes at a decisive time for Sri Lankans, as the island nation is struggling to emerge from its worst economic crisis, having declared bankruptcy after defaulting on its external debt in 2022. The country is now in the middle of a bailout program with the International Monetary Fund and debt restructuring with international creditors nearly complete. Dissanayake had said during the presidential campaign that he planned to propose significant changes to the targets set in the IMF deal, which his predecessor Ranil Wickremesinghe signed, saying it placed too much burden on the people. However, he has since changed his stance and says Sri Lanka will go along with the agreement. Sri Lanka’s crisis was largely the result of economic mismanagement combined with fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, which along with 2019 terrorism attacks devastated its important tourism industry. The pandemic also disrupted the flow of remittances from Sri Lankans working abroad. The government also slashed taxes in 2019, depleting the treasury just as the virus hit. Foreign exchange reserves plummeted, leaving Sri Lanka unable to pay for imports or defend its currency, the rupee. Sri Lanka’s economic upheaval led to a political crisis that forced then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to resign in 2022. Parliament then elected Wickremesinghe to replace him. The economy was stabilized, inflation dropped, the local currency strengthened and foreign reserves increased under Wickremesinghe. Nonetheless, he lost the election as public dissatisfaction grew over the government’s effort to increase revenue by raising electricity bills and imposing heavy new income taxes on professionals and businesses, as part of the government’s efforts to meet the IMF conditions. Dissanayake’s promise to punish members of previous governments accused of corruption and to recover allegedly stolen assets has also raised much hope among the people.	https://apnews.com/article/sri-lanka-parliamentary-election-dissanayake-fde212f89fb237f2a623b792ec958a22	2024-11-13T16:33:05-08:00	
Nevada trial set for ‘Dances with Wolves’ actor in newly-revived sex abuse case	LAS VEGAS (AP) — Former 'Dances with Wolves' actor Nathan Chasing Horse is set to stand trial early next year in Las Vegas on charges that he sexually abused Indigenous women and girls, a significant development in the sweeping criminal case after more than a year of stalled court proceedings while he challenged it. His trial in Clark County District Court is currently scheduled to begin on Jan. 13, court records show. He pleaded not guilty on Wednesday to 21 felonies, including sexual assault, kidnapping and producing and possessing videos of child sexual abuse, KLAS-TV in Las Vegas reported. Prosecutors are now able to move forward with their case because Chasing Horse was again indicted last month following a Nevada Supreme Court decision that his original indictment be dismissed. The high court's order left open the possibility for the charges to be refiled, and prosecutors quickly took their case before another grand jury. The high court said in its September order that prosecutors had abused the grand jury process when they provided a definition of grooming as evidence of Chasing Horse's alleged crimes without any expert testimony. But the justices also made clear in their ruling that their decision was not weighing in on Chasing Horse's guilt or innocence, saying the allegations against him are serious. Best known for portraying the character Smiles A Lot in the 1990 movie 'Dances with Wolves,' Chasing Horse was born on the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota, which is home to the Sicangu Sioux, one of the seven tribes of the Lakota nation. After starring in the Oscar-winning film, according to prosecutors, Chasing Horse began promoting himself as a self-proclaimed Lakota medicine man while traveling around North America to perform healing ceremonies. Prosecutors said he used his authority to gain access to vulnerable women and girls for decades until his arrest in January near Las Vegas. He has been jailed ever since. Chasing Horse's arrest reverberated around Indian Country as law enforcement in the U.S. and Canada quickly followed up with more criminal charges. In Montana, authorities there said his arrest helped corroborate long-standing allegations against him on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation. Tribal leaders banished Chasing Horse from the reservation in 2015 amid allegations of human trafficking. His latest indictment in Las Vegas includes new allegations that Chasing Horse filmed himself having sex with one of his accusers when she was younger than 14. Prosecutors have said the footage, taken in 2010 or 2011, was found on cellphones in a locked safe inside the North Las Vegas home that Chasing Horse is said to have shared with five wives, including the girl in the videos.	https://apnews.com/article/chasing-horse-dances-with-wolves-trial-nevada-de876354ce245a878c851f9e365c6d32	2024-11-13T16:27:44-08:00	
US ambassador says Mexico 'closed the doors' on security cooperation and denies its violence problem	MEXICO CITY (AP) — U.S. Ambassador Ken Salazar lashed out Wednesday at Mexico’s failure to accept aid in the fight against drug cartels, claiming the country 'closed the doors' on security cooperation. In a press conference, Salazar launched his harshest criticism yet of rampant violence, police corruption and the Mexican government’s mistaken attitude that 'there is no problem.' 'When they just say ‘there is no problem, we have these statistics to show people there is no problem,’ that is not based on reality,'' Salazar said. 'There is a very big problem.' Mexico sent a diplomatic note to the U.S. embassy 'expressing its surprise' at Salazar's statement, the foreign relations ministry said in a statement later Wednesday. Salazar cited violence in recent days in the northern state of Sinaloa as an example. Sinaloa state police chief Gerardo Mérida said Wednesday authorities found a pile of between five and seven bodies on a roadside there, but were still counting body parts to see how many there were. 'There is a pile of various bodies, with what we have found we have identified five bodies, but some are in pieces, they have been dismembered, there are mentions of seven,' said Mérida. Sinaloa's embattled governor, Ruben Rocha, seemed to typify Mexico's attitude when he said Tuesday —after a similar number of dead bodies were dumped on roadsides - that 'we're doing well, we'll get over this soon.' Salazar countered that in Sinaloa 'the dead can be seen everywhere.' Salazar had previously defended many of the Mexican government’s actions, but he now says former President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s 'hugs not bullets' strategy of not confronting the cartels 'did not work.' López Obrador left office on Sept. 30, but his successor, President Claudia Sheinbaum, has pledged to continue the policy, even though under her leadership troops appear more willing to open fire. Fighting between two factions of the Sinaloa drug cartel broke out after two drug capos — one from each faction — flew to the United States and were arrested there on July 25. Drug lords Ismael 'El Mayo' Zambada and Joaquín Guzmán López were apprehended in the United States after flying there in a small plane. Zambada later claimed he was kidnapped and forced aboard the plane by Guzmán López, causing a violent battle between Zambada’s faction and the 'Chapitos' group led by the sons of imprisoned drug lord Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzmán. Mexico later blamed the United States for detaining the capos, saying that had caused the outbreak of violence. Salazar said Mexico also shut down anti-drug cooperation after that. 'It totally accelerated from there, the Mexican government closed its doors,' Salazar said. The ambassador also criticized efforts by both López Obrador and Sheinbaum to downplay the problem of crime and violence, claiming the problem was being exaggerated and crime statistics were dropping. Salazar did not clarify why he thought the Mexican government's numbers were untrustworthy, but in recent days the government appears to have changed the way it reports homicide figures. 'The reality for the Mexican people, and that is for businesspeople, members of the press like you who work on the streets, those who have ranches, like the cattleman killed in Sinaloa over the weekend because he was a leader, they don't live with security,' Salazar said. The continuing violence 'is a very serious problem in Mexico and saying there is no problem, blaming someone else, blaming the United States, obviously is not (the solution)', he continued. He also blamed López Obrador for having refused '$32 million,' an apparent reference to López Obrador's decision to drop out of a U.S.-funded program to donate money to train and equip Mexican police. 'It was rejected for ideological problems, and other explanations,' Salazar said. López Obrador said at the time he didn't want U.S. helicopters and guns, but by that point most of the U.S. money was going for training, professionalization and legal reform. After taking office in 2018, López Obrador also cut funding for police forces and gave the army, navy and militarized National Guard the lead role in law enforcement. 'Police become corrupt because they don't earn enough to live on,' Salazar said. 'You cannot pay a police officer almost nothing and expect them to do their job.' Salazar had been previously known for defending López Obrador despite his constant efforts to militarize law enforcement, concentrate power, eliminate regulatory and oversight bodies and shore up Mexico's government-run companies even at the expense of U.S. firms. It was unclear if Wednesday's critical turn in his rhetoric was in any way related to the victory of Donald Trump in last week's U.S. presidential elections. Trump has long been fiercely critical of Mexico. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-sinaloa-cartel-violence-bodies-02e0c9a499e9605291f3ba5a2f9e6f4d	2024-11-13T14:53:25-08:00	
Man kills himself with blasts outside Brazil's Supreme Court after failing to get inside	SAO PAULO (AP) — A man who failed in an attempt to break into Brazil's Supreme Court killed himself in explosions outside the building Wednesday that forced justices and staff to evacuate, authorities said. The two strong blasts were heard about 7:30 p.m. after the day's session finished and all the justices and staff left the building safely, Brazil's Supreme Court said in a statement. Local firefighters confirmed one man died at the scene in the capital Brasilia, but did not identify him. Celina Leão, the lieutenant governor of Brazil's federal district, said the suspect had earlier detonated explosives in a car in a Congress parking lot, which did not cause injuries. 'His first action was to explode the car. Then he approached the Supreme Court and tried to get in the building. He failed and then there were the other explosions,' Leão said in a news conference. Local media reported that the car that exploded belonged to a member of Brazil's Liberal Party, the same of former President Jair Bolsonaro. Leão said only investigations will determine whether the owner of the car is the same man who died in the blasts. Leão recommended that Congress be closed Thursday to avoid new risks. Brazil's Senate heeded her call and the lower house will be shut until noon, speaker Arthur Lira said. 'It could have been a lone wolf, like others we've seen around the world,' Leão said in a news conference. 'We are considering it as a suicide because there was only one victim. But investigations will show if that was indeed the case.' Leão added only forensics will be able to identify the body, which remained outside the Supreme Court for three hours after the blasts. The blasts outside the Supreme Court took place about 20 seconds apart in Brasilia's Three Powers Plaza, where Brazil’s main government buildings, including the Supreme Court, Congress and presidential palace, are located. President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva was not in the neighboring presidential palace at the time, spokesman José Chrispiniano said. Police blocked all access to the area and the presidential security bureau was conducting a sweep of the grounds around the presidential palace. Brazil’s federal police said it is investigating and did not provide a motive. The Supreme Court in recent years has become a target for threats by far-right groups and supporters of Bolsonaro's due to its crackdown on the spread of false information. In particular, Justice Alexandre de Moraes has been a focus for their ire. Lula's spokesman said that late on Wednesday the leftist leader was gathering at the presidential residence with federal police chief Andrei Rodrigues, and Supreme Court Justices de Moraes and Cristiano Zanin.	https://apnews.com/article/brazil-supreme-court-explosion-police-350cf148ecf964818eba203f7e131f88	2024-11-13T14:46:18-08:00	
Protests erupt in Paris over pro-Israel gala organized by far-right figures	PARIS (AP) — Protests erupted in Paris on Wednesday against a controversial gala organized by far-right figures in support of Israel. The event, intended to raise funds for the Israeli military, included Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich among its invited guests. The demonstrations came on the eve of a high-stakes soccer match at France's national stadium against the Israeli national team, overshadowed by tensions around the wars in the Middle East. Authorities in Paris announced that more than 4,000 police officers and 1,600 stadium staff will be deployed for the game. Smotrich, a vocal advocate of Israeli settlements, had been expected to attend Wednesday's gala, dubbed 'Israel is Forever,' which was planned by an association of the same name. The group’s stated goal is to 'mobilize French-speaking Zionist forces.' After days of growing criticism of the event, Smotrich's office confirmed Wednesday that the minister would not travel to Paris to participate. But the invitation to Smotrich drew sharp criticism from local associations, unions and left-wing political parties, prompting two protests in the French capital. The minister, a hard-line settler leader, has been accused of inflaming tensions in the West Bank and drew international condemnations this week by saying he hopes the election of Donald Trump will clear the way for Israeli annexation of the West Bank — a step that would extinguish Palestinian statehood dreams. The French Foreign Ministry called Smotrich’s remarks 'contrary to international law' and counterproductive to efforts to reduce regional tensions. 'France reiterates its commitment to the implementation of the two-state solution, with Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace and security, which is the only prospect for a just and lasting settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,' the ministry said in a statement. Critics also pointed at Nili Kupfer-Naouri, president of the 'Israel is Forever' association, who sparked outrage in 2023, after the Israel-Hamas war started, when she tweeted that 'no civilian in Gaza was innocent.' On Wednesday night, several hundred protesters marched through central Paris, denouncing the event as a 'gala of hatred and shame.' 'Imagine if an association were hosting a gala for Hezbollah or Hamas — there’s no way the police would allow that,' said Melkir Saib, a 30-year-old protester. 'The situation is just unfair.' The march was largely peaceful, but some demonstrators broke windows at a McDonald's along the route. A separate group, including Jewish leftist organizations opposed to racism and antisemitism, gathered near the Arc de Triomphe chanting slogans against the gala and Smotrich. French authorities defended the event, with Paris police chief Laurent Nunez stating that the gala posed 'no major threat to public order.'

New storms and flooding threaten Spain's hard-hit Valencia again	MADRID (AP) — New storms in Spain caused school closures and train cancellations on Wednesday, two weeks after flash floods in Valencia and other parts of the country killed more than 220 people and destroyed thousands of homes. Coastal areas of Valencia were placed under the highest alert on Wednesday evening. Forecasters said up to 180 millimeters (7 inches) of rain could fall there within five hours. Cleanup efforts in parts of Valencia hardest hit by the Oct. 29 storm were still continuing, and there were concerns over what more rain could bring to streets still covered with mud and debris. In southern Malaga province, streets were flooded, while 3,000 people near the Guadalhorce river were moved from their homes as a preventive measure. Schools across the province were closed, along with many stores. Train service was canceled between Malaga and Madrid, and between Barcelona and Valencia. Valencia's regional government also restricted the use of private vehicles until Thursday in areas hit by the October storm, when tsunami-like floods caused severe car pile-ups. There were no reports of deaths due to the new storms. Spanish weather forecaster AEMET put Malaga on red alert, saying up to 70 millimeters (roughly 3 inches) of rain had accumulated in an hour. Parts of Tarragona province in the east also faced heavy rain and remained under red alert. The forecast in Malaga delayed the start of the Billie Jean King Cup tennis finals between Spain and Poland, which was set for Wednesday. The storm system affecting Spain is caused by warm air that collides with stagnant cold air and forms powerful rain clouds. Experts say that drought and flood cycles are increasing with climate change.	https://apnews.com/article/spain-floods-malaga-79ec155360f14a0b89a788e8cb6787b4	2024-11-13T08:15:40-08:00	
Argentina tribunal upholds corruption verdict against former President Cristina Fernández	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — A tribunal in Argentina on Wednesday upheld a six-year prison sentence and a lifetime ban from holding public office against former President Cristina Fernández, a dominant political leader in recent years in the South American country. Fernández was convicted and sentenced in 2022 by a three-judge panel for a fraud scheme that embezzled millions of dollars through public works projects during her presidency. She appealed, but the higher tribunal ratified the original ruling. Fernández has denied all the accusations. The Peronist leader can appeal to the Supreme Court, which means that she will remain free pending the outcome. Argentina’s dominant leader this century, she was accused of improperly granting public works contracts to a construction magnate with links to her family.	https://apnews.com/article/argentina-cristina-fernandez-corruption-sentence-dc8b668e3da263c18a9e84e0be8e71e0	2024-11-13T06:06:37-08:00	
Danish palace scraps system dating to the 1800s that grants royal labels for products	COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — Denmark’s royal court said Wednesday it will phase out a labeling system dating back to the 1800s that grants companies the right to use the image of the Danish crown on their letterhead, packaging and labels. The five-year renewable designations, including 'Holder of the Royal Warrant' and 'By Appointment to the Royal Danish Court' and others, will be phased out by Dec. 31, 2029, the palace said in a statement. Currently, there there are 104 Danish suppliers and five foreign companies who can use such designations and images of the Danish crown on their products. 'A system which implies that individual companies can claim special recognition from the Royal House of Denmark for a number of years is no longer in keeping with the times,' the palace said in a statement. The first company to get such a title was in 1840. Originally, such designations were given to companies or tradesmen who continually supplied goods or services to the royals. In recent years, however, several of the companies which supply goods or services to the royal household are not on the list of Royal Warrant holders. King Frederik took over Denmark's throne last January after his mother, Queen Margrethe II, then Europe’s longest-serving monarch, became the first Danish monarch to voluntarily relinquish the throne in nearly 900 years. Margrethe had stunned the nation when she announced during her traditional New Year’s Eve speech that she would step down for health reasons. The abdication has left Denmark with two queens: Margrethe keeps her title, while Frederik’s wife becomes Queen Mary. Frederik and Mary’s eldest son Christian, 18, is now the crown prince and heir to the throne.	https://apnews.com/article/denmark-royal-danist-court-purveyor-e7bae9c904ed405cc61880b2684ea1dc	2024-11-13T05:41:11-08:00	
The Latest: Republicans win House majority of 218 seats	Republicans have won enough seats to control the House of Representatives, completing the party’s sweep into power and securing their hold on both chambers of Congress and the White House. Republicans gained control of the Senate last week. Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz resigned from Congress Wednesday, ending an ethics probe into allegations of sex trafficking, sexual misconduct and drug use after President-elect Donald Trump nominated him for attorney general. Gaetz's nomination was one of several picks unveiled by Trump, including Sen. Marco Rubio as secretary of state and Tulsi Gabbard as director of national intelligence. President Joe Biden welcomed Trump to the White House for an Oval Office visit that's a traditional part of the peaceful handoff of power — a ritual Trump himself declined to participate in four years ago. Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: The GOP’s majority is thin and a highly functioning House is also far from guaranteed The past two years of Republican House control were defined by infighting as hardline conservative factions sought to gain influence and power by openly defying their party leadership. While Johnson — at times with Trump’s help — largely tamed open rebellions against his leadership, the right wing of the party is ascendant and ambitious on the heels of Trump’s election victory. The Republican majority also depends on a small group of lawmakers who won tough elections by running as moderates. It remains to be seen whether they will stay on board for some of the most extreme proposals championed by Trump and his allies. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, meanwhile, is trying to keep Democrats relevant to any legislation that passes Congress, an effort that will depend on Democratic leaders unifying over 200 members, even as the party undergoes a postmortem of their election losses. Trump’s governing trifecta will be different this time When Trump was elected as president in 2016, Republicans also swept Congress, but he still encountered Republican leaders resistant to his policy ideas, as well as a Supreme Court with a liberal majority. Not this time. When he returns to the White House, Trump will be working with a Republican Party that has been completely transformed by his 'MAGA movement' and a Supreme Court dominated by conservative justices, including three that he appointed. 'Republicans in the House and Senate have a mandate,' House Speaker Mike Johnson said earlier this week. 'The American people want us to implement and deliver that ‘America First’ agenda.' Republicans win 218 US House seats, giving Donald Trump and the party control of government Republicans have won enough seats to control the U.S. House, completing the party’s sweep into power and securing their hold on U.S. government alongside President-elect Donald Trump. A House Republican victory in Arizona, alongside a win in slow-counting California earlier Wednesday, gave the GOP the 218 House victories that make up the majority. Republicans earlier gained control of the Senate from Democrats. With hard-fought yet thin majorities, Republican leaders are envisioning a mandate to upend the federal government and swiftly implement Trump’s vision for the country. The incoming president has promised to carry out the country’s largest-ever deportation operation, extend tax breaks, punish his political enemies, seize control of the federal government’s most powerful tools and reshape the U.S. economy. The GOP election victories ensure that Congress will be onboard for that agenda, and Democrats will be almost powerless to check it. Rep. Matt Gaetz resigns from Congress Trump told Speaker Mike Johnson earlier today that he would be tapping Gaetz for his administration as attorney general, reducing Johnson’s slim majority even further. Gaetz submitted his resignation from Congress, effective immediately, launching an eight-week clock to fill his seat Johnson said, possibly in time for the start of the new Congress on Jan. 3. It also ends a long-running ethics investigation into the Florida congressman. Johnson framed the stunning move by Gaetz to resign early and before confirmation as a way to help the majority fill his vacancy much quicker than if he were to wait until his Senate confirmation as attorney general. But the decision and timing he chose to immediately step down raise concerns about the impending, years-long ethics probe into the Florida Republican, which was expected by many, including Gaetz, to be wrapped up by the end of the year. By stepping down, the bipartisan panel no longer has jurisdiction over Gaetz, deeming the probe and the subsequent report effectively dead. What other Cabinet positions does Trump still need to pick? While the president-elect has been busy filling out his incoming administration, there are still more appointments he needs to make. Here are the Cabinet positions that Trump has yet to pick: 1. Secretary of Treasury 2. Secretary of the Interior 3. Secretary of Agriculture 4. Secretary of Labor 5. Secretary of Health and Human Services 6. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development 7. Secretary of Transportation 8. Secretary of Energy 9. Secretary of Education 10. Secretary of Veterans Affairs 11. United States Trade Representative 12. Secretary of the Council of Economic Advisers 13. Administer of the Small Business Administration 14. Director of the Office of Management and Budget 15. Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy The House Ethics Committee’s GOP chair says its investigation into Gaetz will continue — for now Rep. Michael Guest, the GOP chair for the House Ethics Committee, told AP that Matt Gaetz’s nomination as attorney general does not change the panel’s ongoing probe into the congressman over alleged sex trafficking, sexual misconduct and drug use. But if Gaetz is confirmed for the cabinet position, the committee will no longer have jurisdiction to continue its probe or release its report. 'Once we lose jurisdiction, there would not be a report that would be issued,' Guest said. 'That’s not unique to this case, we have that every new Congress, where there are members who are under ethics investigation, who either choose not to run again, in some instances, or they resign or they lose reelection.' He added, 'We’re not going to rush this investigation because of the appointment. And so we’re going to again follow the rules and the procedures that we set in place.' Some at the State Department express cautious optimism over Rubio nomination At the State Department, at least some officials expressed cautious optimism about the Rubio nomination. Three officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations with colleagues, said there was a sense that Rubio would be willing to work with and listen to career staff even if he might ultimately discard their advice. And, one of them breathed a sigh of relief that Rubio was the least controversial pick announced by Trump. In comparison to Gabbard, Gaetz and Hegseth, Rubio, a current senator who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is likely to have a relatively quick and easy confirmation hearing and vote with support from all of his GOP colleagues and at least some Democrats. The new presidential transition rules Four years ago, the Trump-appointed head of the GSA, Emily Murphy, determined that she had no legal standing to determine a winner in the presidential race because Trump was still challenging the results in court, claiming falsely that there was widespread voter fraud. That held up funding and cooperation for the transition. It wasn’t until Trump’s efforts to subvert election results had collapsed across key states that Murphy agreed to formally ' ascertain a president-elect ' and begin the transition process. Trump eventually posted on social media that his administration would cooperate. To prevent that kind of holdup in future transitions, the Presidential Transition Improvement Act of 2022 mandates that the transition process begin five days after the election — even if the winner is still in dispute. That is designed to avoid long delays and means that 'an ‘affirmative ascertainment’ by the GSA is no longer a prerequisite for gaining transition support services,' according to agency guidelines on the new rules. Speaker Mike Johnson wins GOP nomination to remain in job, faces full House vote in new year While Johnson has no serious challenger, he faces dissent within his ranks, particularly from hard-right conservatives and the Freedom Caucus withholding their votes as leverage to extract promises ahead. Trump told House Republicans, during his first trip back to Washington since the party swept the 2024 election, that he’s with the speaker all the way, according to a person familiar with the remarks but unauthorized to discuss the private meeting near the Capitol. Johnson heaped praise on Trump, calling him the 'comeback king.' It’s been a remarkable political journey for Johnson, the accidental speaker who rose as a last, best choice to replace ousted former speaker Kevin McCarthy more than a year ago and quickly set course by positioning himself alongside Trump and leading Republicans during the elections. Trump’s selection of Gaetz is seen as a shock announcement The Florida lawmaker was not one of the main names seen as a likely pick for the top law enforcement job. And Trump’s announcement was first pushed out on his social media network instead of a more formal announcement from his transition team, as most of his picks have been made. Republican senators were reluctant to immediately criticize the pick. 16. Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, the likely incoming chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, refused to directly answer questions about Gaetz and stood silently for around a minute while he waited for a Senate subway train. 17. Texas Sen. John Cornyn, another member of the Judiciary panel, said he didn’t know Gaetz 'other than his public persona, so we’ll handle it like any other nomination.' 18. Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, newly elected as the incoming No. 2 Senate Republican, said that Trump 'is going to continue to make his appointments. We’re going to continue to look forward to them coming to the Senate and have hearings and get his cabinet confirmed as quickly as possible.' He would not comment on Gaetz specifically. 19. Only North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, appeared to express doubts about the nomination, saying he will have 'his work cut out for him' to win enough votes for confirmation. Trump says he will nominate Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida to be attorney general In selecting the congressman, Trump passed over some of the more established attorneys whose names had been mentioned as being contenders for the job. 'Matt will end Weaponized Government, protect our Borders, dismantle Criminal Organizations and restore Americans’ badly shattered Faith and Confidence in the Justice Department,' Trump said in a statement. Trump’s pick of Gaetz comes as the House Ethics Committee is still investigating allegations that he was part of a scheme that led to the sex trafficking of a 17-year-old girl. The committee said its review now includes whether Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, accepted improper gifts and sought to obstruct government investigations of his conduct. Gaetz has categorically denied all the allegations before the committee. The Justice Department in 2023 ended a sex trafficking case against Gaetz with no charges against him. Trump picks ex-Rep. Tulsi Gabbard as director of national intelligence Trump has chosen Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democratic member of Congress and presidential candidate, to serve as director of national intelligence, continuing to stock his Cabinet with loyal personalities complimentary to his own, rather than long-term professionals in their requisite fields. 'As a former Candidate for the Democrat Presidential Nomination, she has broad support in both Parties - She is now a proud Republican!' Trump said in a statement. 'I know Tulsi will bring the fearless spirit that has defined her illustrious career to our Intelligence Community, championing our Constitutional Rights, and securing Peace through Strength. Tulsi will make us all proud!' Gabbard would come to the role as somewhat of an outsider compared to her predecessor, Avril Haines who was confirmed by the Senate in 2021 following several years in top national security and intelligence positions. Gabbard hasn’t worked directly in the intelligence community, though has served on House committees including two years on the Homeland Security Committee. Like others, she has been among Trump’s most popular political surrogates. Trump picks Sen. Marco Rubio as his Secretary of State In naming Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida as his nominee for secretary of state, Trump has set up a onetime critic who evolved into one of the president-elect’s fiercest defenders to become the nation’s top diplomat. The conservative lawmaker is a noted hawk on China, Cuba and Iran, and was a finalist to be Trump’s running mate this summer. On Capitol Hill, Rubio is the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He has pushed for taking a harder line against China and has targeted social media app TikTok because its parent company is Chinese. He and other lawmakers contend that Beijing could demand access to the data of users whenever it wants. 'He will be a strong Advocate for our Nation, a true friend to our Allies, and a fearless Warrior who will never back down to our adversaries,' Trump said of Rubio in a statement. Trump made the announcement while flying back to Florida from Washington after meeting with President Joe Biden. Trump has spoken with new Senate leader John Thune President-elect Donald Trump spoke on the phone today with Sen. John Thune, who is fresh off being elected as the next Senate majority leader. 'Senate Republicans are excited and ready to get to work implementing President Trump’s agenda on behalf of the American people,' Thune said on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. Thune has had his differences with Trump, but reconnected with the president-elect earlier this spring as he launched a bid to replace Sen. Mitch McConnell atop the Senate Republican Conference. And in the days before the internal GOP leadership election, Thune stressed his commitment to working with Trump. Trump says he had a ‘very good meeting’ with Biden Trump told The New York Post that he and Biden discussed two issues they disagree on: Ukraine and Israel’s war against Hamas. 'I wanted — I asked for his views and he gave them to me,' Trump told the newspaper after the meeting. 'Also, we talked very much about the Middle East, likewise. I wanted to know his views on where we are and what, what he thinks. And he gave them to me, he was very gracious.' Biden strongly backs Ukraine’s fight against Russia’s invasion and has repeatedly said he supports Israel’s right to defend itself. Trump has promised to end the war in Ukraine quickly and has said the Biden administration isn’t doing enough to support Israel against Hamas and its other enemies. The White House says Trump and Biden had a ‘substantive’ meeting White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre says Biden and Trump had a 'substantive meeting' for about two hours in the Oval Office. She says they talked about domestic and foreign policy issues, and that Biden also raised important issues on Congress’ to-do list, such as funding the government and providing disaster relief money. Biden also stressed to Trump that the transition will be orderly and there will be a peaceful transfer of power. Trump heads back to Florida Trump’s plane took off from Joint Base Andrews just after 1:30 p.m. ET. He’s returning to his home in Palm Beach, Florida, after about four hours in Washington. Democratic state leaders prepare for a tougher time countering Trump in his second term Democratic governors and state attorneys general are dusting off the playbooks from their offices’ pushback against President-elect Donald Trump’s policies, but they know it could be a harder battle in his second time in office. Trump’s campaign promises included mass deportations of people in the country illegally, and his history includes rolling back environmental regulations and setting the stage for state abortion bans by nominating three new Supreme Court justices who helped overturn Roe v. Wade. All of that is putting liberals on edge — and believing that an organized resistance is necessary. Democratic state officials are positioning themselves to carry it out. ▶ Read more about Democrat-led states’ reaction to Trump’s reelection Trump leaves the White House Trump has left the White House after meeting with Biden for close to two hours.

Maine elections chief who drew Trump’s ire narrates House tabulations in livestream Maine’s elections chief, a former civil liberties attorney who sparred with President-elect Donald Trump over ballot access, is acting like a play-by-play sports announcer as she describes the state’s process of determining a congressional winner through ranked choice voting. Shenna Bellows is spending the week streaming the effort live on YouTube and answering questions in real time. 'We hope that when people see it for themselves, they will believe that our elections do have integrity, that they’re free and fair. And then maybe they’ll have a little more trust in the election officials who are working so hard to make these elections happen,' Secretary of State Shenna Bellows told The Associated Press. Democratic Rep. Jared Golden led Republican challenger Austin Theriault by about 2,000 first-place votes after nearly 400,000 ballots were cast in Maine’s 2nd Congressional District, but neither got more than 49%, so the ranked choice process will reallocate other votes to determine a majority, her office announced. ▶ Read more about the Maine House race Biden and Xi will meet in Peru as US-China relations tested again by Trump’s return President Joe Biden will hold talks Saturday with China’s Xi Jinping on the sidelines of an international summit in Peru, a face-to-face meeting that comes as Beijing braces for Donald Trump’s return to the White House. A senior Biden administration official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity ahead of the formal announcement, confirmed plans for the meeting to take place while the two leaders are in Lima for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. That will come just over two months before Trump’s inauguration. During his campaign against Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump promised to slap blanket 60% tariffs on all Chinese exports to the U.S., a move that would jolt the already tumultuous relationship between Beijing and Washington. ▶ Read more about the U.S.-China relationship — Aamer Madhani Republican Scott Baugh concedes to Democrat Dave Min in critical California House race Republican Scott Baugh has conceded in his race against Democrat Dave Min in a Southern California U.S. House district, ending his bid to seize the seat being vacated by Democratic Rep. Katie Porter. The Associated Press has not yet declared a winner because thousands of ballots have not yet been counted. In a post on the social media platform X on Tuesday night, Baugh said 'despite running a strong campaign … that effort is going to come up a little short.' The 47th District in Orange County, southeast of Los Angeles, was a top target for national Republicans looking to protect and possibly expand the party’s narrow majority in the chamber. ▶ Read more about the House race in California Republican John Thune of South Dakota is elected the next Senate majority leader Republicans have elected South Dakota Sen.

Thune, who’s 63 and in his fourth Senate term, has promised to work closely with Trump despite differences the two have had over the years. Thune will be a crucial part of the incoming president’s efforts to push through his policy agenda. He beat out two other competitors, Sens. John Cornyn of Texas and Rick Scott of Florida, by gaining majority support from GOP senators in a secret ballot vote. Republicans are replacing Kentucky’s McConnell, the longest serving Senate party leader, as they prepare to take majority control with the 53 seats they won in last week’s elections. ▶ Read more about Senate Republicans Biden and Trump both promise a smooth transition At the White House, they sat in matching yellow chairs in front of a roaring fireplace. Biden told Trump his team will 'do everything we can to make sure you’re accommodated' and has everything he needs. 'Congratulations and I look forward to having a smooth transition,' Biden said. Trump responded by saying, 'Politics is tough and it’s, uh, in many cases, not a very nice world, but it is a nice world today and I appreciate very much a transition that’s so smooth it’ll be as smooth as it can get. And I very much appreciate that, Joe.' White House chief of staff Jeff Zients and incoming chief of staff Susie Wiles are attending the meeting. House Republicans say Elon Musk was a center of attention as Trump addressed them 'He got three standing ovations,' Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., said of Musk. 'Out of everybody, Elon Musk is who (Trump) gave the biggest support for,' Norman said. Rep. Clay Higgins, R-La., described Musk as 'such a presence' during the meeting and drew a large crowd of lawmakers around him, though he didn’t get to speak to him personally. 'He’s a bright light in any room he’s in,' Higgins said Jill Biden joins the president to greet Trump at the White House First lady Jill Biden joined President Joe Biden to greet the president-elect when he arrived at the White House. The White House says the first lady also gave Trump a handwritten letter of congratulations for his wife, Melania, the incoming first lady. Melania Trump did not go to the White House with her husband for the traditional meeting with the outgoing first lady. In her letter, Jill Biden expressed her team’s readiness to assist Melania Trump with the transition, the White House said. During Biden meeting, an email went to Trump supporters with the subject ‘Trump is inside the White House’ The fundraising email said 'President Trump is inside the White House right now conducting a very important meeting' and directed supporters to fill out an online poll about what his priority should be. Trump’s fundraising operation has often timed his messages so they’re sent out notifying his supporters as he’s appearing on stage or — during his legal challenges — appearing in court. House Republicans were elated Wednesday when Trump came to speak to their conference Rep. Troy Nehls of Texas wore his 'Make America Great Again' tie with matching Trump gold sneakers. After Trump’s speech, Nehls told reporters it was electric inside the room and the party must put aside the chaos of the last few years and unify behind the president-elect. 'If Donald Trump says, ‘jump three feet high and scratch your head,’ we all jump three feet high and scratch our head,' Nehls said. Four advisers from Trump’s campaign will be joining his White House staff President-elect Donald Trump is bringing four advisers from his presidential campaign into his new White House as deputy chiefs of staff, including two longtime aides and the political director who played a key role in his victory. Trump announced Wednesday that longtime aide Dan Scavino will serve as a deputy without giving a specific portfolio; campaign political director James Blair as deputy for legislative, political and public affairs; and Taylor Budowich as deputy chief of staff for communications and personnel. All will have the rank of assistant to the president. Trump also formally announced Stephen Miller, an immigration hard-liner, will be deputy chief of staff for policy and homeland security adviser. That had previously been confirmed by Vice President-elect JD Vance on Monday. Speaker Johnson begins fight for the House gavel, winning nod from Trump Speaker Mike Johnson is beginning the hard fight for his gavel, a weeks-long campaign that starts Wednesday during internal House Republican leadership elections and will establish the new power centers in Congress for a Washington dominated by President-elect Donald Trump. While Johnson has no serious challenger, he faces dissent within his ranks, particularly from hard-right conservatives and the Freedom Caucus withholding their votes as leverage to extract promises ahead. The speaker won a welcome endorsement early Wednesday from Trump, who told House Republicans in a morning meeting near the Capitol he was with Johnson all the way, according to a person familiar with the private remarks and unauthorized to publicly discuss them. The visit was Trump’s first back to Washington after winning the 2024 election and Johnson heaped praise on the president-elect, calling him the 'comeback king.' ▶ Read more about House Republicans Biden greeted Trump with a handshake in the Oval Office, each pledging a smooth transition from Democrat to Republican Biden congratulated Trump.

Jill Biden has taught English and writing at community colleges for many years. At one point she noted that the semester is ending soon and her students are working on their final assignments. Then she said, 'Joe and I are also preparing for what’s coming next.' Biden then made the sign of the cross over himself and smiled. The audience laughed. Elon Musk arrives at the GOP conference in Washington Musk, who’s been a fixture of late with Trump, arrived at the GOP conference in Washington just as Trump was coming in to address leaders. On Tuesday night, Trump said Musk and former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy would run a panel focused on government efficiency that would be outside government but advise the White House. It’s not entirely clear how the operation will work. Trump says he thinks even Democratic strongholds can be won by the GOP 'We won it every way, all seven swing states by a lot,' he said, speaking to GOP leaders in Washington. Trump commented on the results in Democratic strongholds like New Jersey and California, declaring that winning in the latter state would be 'very doable. It would be really doable if they change the election process.' Trump says it’s ‘nice to win’ Trump is speaking to GOP leaders in Washington for the first time since he won the 2024 presidential election. 'It’s always nice to win,' Trump said. Trump won 312 electoral votes to Democrat Kamala Harris’ 226. Trump is welcomed with a standing ovation at the GOP conference Trump got a standing ovation from House GOP leaders gathered for a conference at a Washington hotel Wednesday morning. House Speaker Mike Johnson said: 'Ladies and gentlemen please stand for the 47th President of the United States.' Sen. Marco Rubio wouldn’t confirm or deny reports that Trump asked him to serve as secretary of state Rubio, when asked about it Wednesday, told reporters 'those are media reports' and said any news would come from Trump’s transition team. The Republican Florida senator is a former critic of Trump who’s become one of his fiercest defenders and appeared with him on the campaign trail in the final weeks. Two members of Congress honored for their efforts on immigration policy As House Republicans are meeting, two members of Congress trying to come to agreement on border and immigration policy are being honored for their efforts.

Trump is en route to meet with House Republicans The president-elect walked slowly down the airplane stairs at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, greeted his military greeter and got into the motorcade for the trip to Capitol Hill. He did not speak with reporters who were there to document his arrival in Washington. Elon Musk posted on social media details about his new appointment It’s meant to reassure investors in his publicly traded company, Tesla. The billionaire, in a post on X on Wednesday, shared a message from a shareholder in his company noting that his appointment running a new 'Department of Government Efficiency' for President-elect Donald Trump will provide advice and guidance to the new president from outside of government and is limited to 21 months, ending on July 4, 2026. Musk shared the post with the message: 'Important details' Melania Trump isn’t joining her husband at the White House 'Her husband’s return to the Oval Office to commence the transition process is encouraging, and she wishes him great success,' Melania Trump’s office said. No reason was given for why she didn’t accept the invitation. The Bidens had extended congratulations and a joint invite to the Trumps to meet at the White House.

The SpaceX owner, who Trump just named to a government efficiency advisory role in the new administration, is not currently expected to be at Trump’s meeting with Biden at the White House. Musk will join Trump’s earlier meeting with House Republicans before he and Biden meet in the Oval Office. He’s been a steady presence at Trump’s side since the election. Wednesday’s meeting puts Biden and Trump together for first time since their June debate It was Biden’s poor performance at that debate that led Democrats to start pressuring him to drop out and let another candidate take on Trump. Biden pulled the plug on his campaign weeks later and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris. She lost to Trump in last week’s election. Trump is heading to a big day in Washington President-elect Donald Trump is on his way to Washington to meet with Republican congressional leaders on Capitol Hill and President Joe Biden at the White House. Trump’s plane took off from the airport in West Palm Beach, Florida, around 7:30 a.m. ET for the roughly two-hour flight to the U.S. capital. A meeting between the incoming and outgoing president is tradition but then-President Trump didn’t invite Biden to the White House after he lost to the Democrat in 2020. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre says it was important to Biden to invite Trump because he believes in the 'norms' and a peaceful transfer of power. Senate Republicans are gathering behind closed doors to pick a new majority leader Republican senators will gather behind closed doors Wednesday to decide who will replace longtime Senate leader Mitch McConnell and lead their new majority next year — a decision that could shape the future of the Senate, and the party, as Donald Trump reclaims the presidency. South Dakota Sen. John Thune, Texas Sen. John Cornyn and Florida Sen. Rick Scott have been scrambling to win the most votes in the secret ballot election, promising a new direction in the Senate even as they furiously compete for Trump’s favor. It will be the first test of Trump’s relationship with Congress after he won the election decisively and claimed a mandate for his agenda. It’s uncertain who will win. ▶ Read more about the GOP’s decision	https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-election-kamala-harris-d92c61bd66f9b279d1c71d3ba2e4e8e5	2024-11-13T04:13:14-08:00	
A study says the global luxury goods market will shrink in 2025. Trump tariffs could make it worse	MILAN (AP) — Global sales of personal luxury goods are forecast to shrink in 2025 for the first time since the Great Recession, according to a Bain consultancy study released Wednesday. The outlook could worsen if the sector is hit by tariffs promised by Donald Trump. 'This could be a nightmare if implemented,’’ Claudia D’Arpizio, co-author of the study for Italy’s Altagamma association of luxury producers, told The Associated Press. 'European brands could end up being super expensive in an already expensive environment.’' Trump has pledged tariffs of up to 20% on imports, saying it would create factory jobs, shrink the federal deficit and lower food prices. While the study did not address the possible impact of tariffs, D’Arpizio said the impact on European luxury producers would depend on how the tariffs are implemented on the category, if at all. She noted that a dearth of American luxury substitutes may lead to an exemption. Any negative impact could also be offset by moving production to the United States, or by higher sales to U.S. tourists in Europe. The United States is the second-largest luxury market, following Europe, worth about 100 billion euros ($106 billion), or nearly one-third of all global high-end sales of apparel, leather goods and footwear. Sales of luxury goods are forecast to drop by 2% to 363 billion euros ($385 billion) next year, from an expected 369 billion euros in 2024, due to steep price increases imposed by brands and global turmoil, Bain said. The sector made a speedy rebound from the COVID-19 pandemic, surpassing 2019 sales by 2022, largely thanks to pent-up spending that was delayed by lockdowns. Even next year's modest dip would leave the market 28% higher than it was in 2019, and two-and-a-half times larger than the Great Recession lows in 2008. Social and political turbulence, including wars and a slate of national elections, have eroded consumer confidence, D’Arpizio said. In addition, brands’ strategy to increase prices while focusing on more 'subtle luxury' often lacking novelty has 'brought a strong negative impact on the willingness to buy,’’ even among wealthy consumers, she said. The creativity crisis is also alienating Gen-Z shoppers, many now in their 20s, the study found. The result is the luxury market has shrunk by 50 million customers, to an estimated 250 million to 360 million, as the luxury base shrinks for the first time. 'We have 50 million fewer customers either because they can’t afford to shop, or they don’t want to because they don’t feel there is enough juice,’’ D’Arpizio said.	https://apnews.com/article/luxury-sales-italy-trump-9806296c09548829bb71803aee572aff	2024-11-13T03:53:41-08:00	
Dutch lawmaker Wilders wants to deport those convicted of violence against Israeli soccer fans	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — Hard-right Dutch political leader Geert Wilders on Wednesday blamed 'Moroccans' for attacks on Israeli soccer fans in Amsterdam last week, asserting that they 'want to destroy Jews' and recommending the deportation of people convicted of involvement if they have dual nationality. While lawmakers condemned antisemitism and agreed that perpetrators of the violence should be prosecuted and handed harsh punishments, opposition legislators accused Wilders of 'pouring oil on the fire' and said his statements during a parliamentary debate were not conducive to 'a better society.' Violence erupted in the Dutch capital before and after last week's soccer match between Ajax Amsterdam and Maccabi Tel Aviv. Fans from both sides were involved in unrest; a number of Maccabi fans attacked a cab and chanted anti-Arab slogans while some men carried out 'hit and run' attacks on people they thought were Jews, according to Amsterdam Mayor Femke Halsema. After the match, parts of a large group of Maccabi supporters armed with sticks ran around 'destroying things,' a 12-page report on the violence issued by Amsterdam authorities said. There were also 'rioters, moving in small groups, by foot, scooter or car, quickly attacking Maccabi fans before disappearing,' it said. Amsterdam police said five people were treated in hospital for injuries. Police detained dozens of people before the match, but there were no immediate arrests for violence after it. On Wednesday night, hundreds of pro-Palestinian protesters gathered on Amsterdam's central Dam Square to hold a demonstration despite a new city ban on such gatherings. Large numbers of police, including some on horseback, were present and detained most of the protesters after they refused to leave, escorting them mostly peacefully into two buses and driving them away from the square. Reports of antisemitic speech, vandalism and violence have been on the rise in Europe since the start of the war in Gaza, and tensions were high in Amsterdam ahead of the soccer match. The assaults on Maccabi fans sparked outrage and were widely condemned as antisemitic. The violence badly tarnished Amsterdam's long-held image as a haven of tolerance and sparked soul-searching across the country. Wilders, whose anti-immigration Party for Freedom won elections last year and now is part of a four-party ruling coalition government, said Wednesday that on the night Amsterdam commemorated Kristallnacht, the 1938 anti-Jewish pogrom in Nazi Germany, 'we saw Muslims hunting Jews on the streets of Amsterdam,' and blamed 'Moroccans who want to destroy Jews.' He gave no evidence. Police and prosecutors have not disclosed the identities of any of the suspects that were detained, in line with Dutch privacy rules. Wilders advocated canceling the Dutch passports of people convicted of involvement in the violence — if they have a double passport — and deporting them. Wilders, who is sometimes described as the Dutch Donald Trump because of his fierce anti-immigration rhetoric, has lived under round-the-clock protection for 20 years because of death threats from Islamic extremists. He has also long been a staunch supporter of Israel. Some lawmakers warned that his new comments only served to deepen divisions in Dutch society. Rob Jetten of the centrist D66 party said Wilders' rhetoric 'does not contribute in any way to healing. In no way does he contribute to bringing our country together, but he throws oil on the fire and thus does not bring solutions against antisemitism and for a better society any closer, but only further away.' Frans Timmermans, who leads the biggest center-left bloc in parliament, agreed. 'What you are doing is just stirring things up, dividing this country when this country needs politicians who bring people together, who bring solutions closer,' Timmermans said. In Amsterdam, a prominent Jewish member of the City Council, Itay Garmy, said that although there’s a lot of anger and fear within the Jewish community, inflammatory remarks wouldn’t help. 'Don’t use my security or my suffering or my fear as a Jew to create political gains for yourself and make your points about integration, migration or Muslim hate,' Garmy said. ___ Associated Press writer Bram Janssen in Amsterdam contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/netherlands-wilders-israel-unrest-antisemitism-4ef4867043b9ed7fb02adfa1ff5bbf61	2024-11-13T03:53:12-08:00	
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz says he'll ask for a vote of confidence in December	BERLIN (AP) — German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Wednesday that he will ask for a vote of confidence on Dec. 16, paving the way for early parliamentary elections in February. He declared his plans during a speech in parliament, a week after his three-party coalition government collapsed. Germany has been governed since 2021 by a coalition led by Scholz’s left-leaning Social Democrats, which included the smaller pro-business Free Democrats and the Greens. It was an uneasy and fractious alliance, and it fell apart when Scholz fired Finance Minister Christian Lindner of the Free Democrats in a late-night move following disagreements over how to revive the shrinking economy. 'The date at the end of February has now been set and I am very grateful for that,' Scholz said, adding that he would try to pass important legislation through parliament before that, such as financial support for children of poor families, or amendments to the country's constitution to make the highest court more resilient to possible political interference. He said he would submit a request for a vote of confidence on Dec. 11, so that the Bundestag can decide on this on Dec. 16. The chancellor had initially wanted to have an early election only by late March — ahead of the vote that is regularly scheduled for September 2025. However, the center-right Christian opposition pushed for a quicker vote in the parliament to speed up the next election. In the end, party leaders across the political spectrum agreed on Wednesday on the two dates for the vote of confidence and the new election on Feb. 23. During his speech, Scholz as well as Friedrich Merz, the head of the main opposition party in parliament, the Christian Democrats, already shifted into campaign mode — though the heated part of campaigning usually only begins around six weeks before an election in Germany. 'There is a great sense of relief in our country. For a week now, the so-called progressive coalition ... has been history. And that is continuing good news for Germany,' Merz said to the applause of his Christian Democrats as he spoke after Scholz in the parliament. 'You are dividing the country, Mr. Chancellor. You are the one responsible for these controversies and for this division in Germany,' Merz attacked Scholz in his speech. 'You simply cannot govern a country like this.' He accused the chancellor of having tried to delay the vote of confidence and said he should have called for one immediately. According to Scholz's announcement on Thursday, his Social Democrats and the Greens will lead the country in a minority government until the chancellor asks for the vote of confidence on Dec. 16, which he is expected to lose. That will then set the path for a new parliamentary election in a little over 100 days from now, on Feb. 23. Four candidates are expected to make their bid for the chancellery with voters in February. Scholz has said he wants to run as chancellor candidate again — even though his party has not yet announced his candidacy. Merz of the Christian Democrats, currently leading the polls, was officially nominated as candidate by his party in September. For the environmentalist Greens, the country’s current economy minister and vice-chancellor, Robert Habeck, will lead his party as candidate for chancellor. The Greens are a small party that lost popularity in recent elections and whose support currently hovers around 10%, meaning it is unlikely that he would end up as the country’s leader. The far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, has said they would nominate current party leader Alice Weidel next month as their candidate. Merz’s Christian Democrats have been polling around 30% or more in the polls for a year now. Scholz’s Social Democrats, currently the strongest governing party, are in third place with around 16% — behind the AfD, which is at around 19%. The main campaign issues are likely going to be the country’s ailing econom y which led to the collapse of the government in the first place, more efficient control of migration, and — when it comes to foreign policy issues — Russia’s war on Ukraine and the next presidency of Donald Trump.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-scholz-vote-confidence-election-f3bf4635504f8df49b18f633da5d3d16	2024-11-13T03:41:43-08:00	
Italy's president sharply rebukes Elon Musk over comments on X about migration court rulings	ROME (AP) — Italian President Sergio Mattarella sharply rebuked Elon Musk on Wednesday for weighing in on Italian court rulings that have stymied the government’s plans to process some asylum-seekers in Albania. Musk, who is expected to have a top advisory role in Donald Trump’s new administration, wrote Tuesday on X that 'these judges need to go.' He was referring to the latest Italian court ruling against right-wing Premier Giorgia Meloni’s Albania immigration deal. In a subsequent post on Wednesday, Musk wrote: 'This is unacceptable. Do the people of Italy live in a democracy or does an unelected autocracy make the decisions?' The posts concerned a Rome court's refusal to rule on a formal request to detain seven migrants rescued at sea and transferred to Albania for processing. Monday's ruling, which resulted in the men being brought to Italy for processing, was the second judicial setback for Meloni’s much-touted plan to outsource to Albania the processing of some male asylum-seekers. Mattarella didn’t cite Musk by name but — in an unusually piqued statement — made clear on Wednesday that he was referring to him. Italy's head of state demanded respect for the country's sovereignty, especially from other soon-to-be public officials. 'Italy is a great democratic country and … knows how to take care of itself while respecting its Constitution,' Mattarella said in a statement issued by his spokesman. 'Anyone, particularly if as announced is about to assume an important role of government in a friendly and allied country, must respect its sovereignty and cannot attribute to himself the task of imparting prescriptions,' the statement said. Trump announced Tuesday that Musk, one of the most influential people around the U.S. president-elect, would help lead a Department of Government Efficiency, essentially an independent advisory panel to eliminate waste and fraud. Musk is a supporter of Meloni and has met with her in Rome on a few occasions, and in September joined her at an awards ceremony on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly. Photos of them together made such news that Musk seemingly felt the need to tamp down speculation by posting 'We are not dating.' Musk has a history of making provocative statements and sparring with leaders on X. Earlier this year, he posted messages insulting U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and saying the United Kingdom was headed for civil war. He has also clashed with a Brazilian supreme court justice over free speech, far-right accounts and purported misinformation on X, and also accused Venezuela’s socialist president, Nicolás Maduro, of 'major election fraud' after that country’s disputed election. The courts’ rulings have raised the ire of Meloni’s far-right-led government, which has been seeking strategies to ease the strain on Italy of the arrival of migrants seeking a better life in Europe. The government had held up the opening of the Albanian centers as a centerpiece of its immigration crackdown, also as a means of deterrence, and said they could be a model for Europe. In both cases, Italian courts referred the cases to the EU court of justice in Luxembourg to rule if the countries of origin for the migrants are considered safe for repatriation. There is no word on when the European court might rule. But as a result of the Rome court decisions, no migrant has yet been processed in the Albanian centers, which are budgeted to cost Italy 670 million euros ($730 million) over five years to build and operate. Italy's opposition says the money could be much better spent on reinforcing Italian-operated migrant processing centers, while human rights groups say the outsourcing of asylum processing contravenes international law. The centers opened in October after a months-long delay, because crumbling soil at one of the facilities needed to be repaired. They are run by Italy and are under the country's jurisdiction, while Albanian guards provide external security.	https://apnews.com/article/musk-italy-albania-migration-8a3cad24845a86f7ae5a11fc00ce4931	2024-11-13T03:33:59-08:00	
Thailand's baby pygmy hippo Moo Deng has an official song released in 4 languages	BANGKOK (AP) — In case you can’t get enough of the little pygmy hippo Moo Deng from Thailand, there's now an official song featuring the internet's favorite baby animal — released in four languages for her global fans. The upbeat 50-second song 'Moodeng Moodeng,' available in Thai, English, Chinese and Japanese versions, features simple lyrics like 'Moo Deng Moo Deng, boing boing boing/ Mommy mommy, play with me.' Its music video consists of short clips of the baby hippo bouncing, playing with her keeper or hanging out with her mom Jona. The catchy number was produced and written by well-known Thai composer Mueanphet Ammara, and released by one of Thailand's largest music companies, GMM Music. Moo Deng — the name literally means 'bouncy pork,' a type of meatball, in Thai — became a global phenomenon just a month after she was unveiled on Facebook by the Khao Kheow Open Zoo in Thailand’s southern Chon Buri province. Fans say her name compliments her chaotic personality. Moo Deng likes to 'deng,' or bounce, and her giddy bouncing has appeared all over social media in countless memes. Her image has been used by sports teams and businesses. The hippo, now four months old, has drawn a huge amount of visitors to the zoo, which is around two-hour drive away from the capital Bangkok. The zoo estimated it has received 3,000 to 5,000 visitors a day on average in the past few months, and it's selling clothes, bedding and other merchandise based on Moo Deng. Zoo director Narongwit Chodchoi has said the increasing income from Moo Deng will help its breeding programs for many endangered species like the pygmy hippopotamus, which is threatened by poaching and loss of habitat. The species is native to West Africa and there are only 2,000-3,000 of them left in the wild. The zoo sits on 800 hectares (almost 2,000 acres) of land and is home to more than 2,000 animals. All four versions of the Moo Deng song is available on YouTube and streaming platforms including Spotify and Apple Music.	https://apnews.com/article/thailand-moo-deng-hippo-khao-kheow-zoo-song-7bd956dd6766d3f1302b3e2c6ac73644	2024-11-13T03:32:01-08:00	
Philippines says it will cooperate if ICC seeks Duterte's custody over drug killings	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The Philippine government said Wednesday its law enforcement agencies will be bound to cooperate if the International Criminal Court seeks the custody of former President Rodrigo Duterte as part of an investigation into thousands of deaths during his crackdown on illegal drugs. The Hague-based court has been investigating the widespread killings that took place while Duterte was mayor of the southern Philippine city of Davao and later as president from 2016 to 2020, as a possible crime against humanity. Human rights groups estimate the deaths could exceed 20,000 during Duterte’s presidency alone. The bloody campaign alarmed Western governments and led to complaints that sparked the investigation by the ICC, a court of last resort for crimes that countries are unwilling or unable to prosecute themselves. Under intense grilling in a televised congressional inquiry Wednesday, the brash-speaking Duterte gave conflicting statements whether he would submit himself to the global court for investigation. 'The ICC does not scare me a bit. They can come here anytime,' Duterte told members of the House of Representatives conducting the inquiry. 'I’m asking the ICC to hurry up and come here and start the investigation tomorrow.' 'This issue has been hanging for many years and I may already die,' the 79-year-old said. 'If I’m found guilty, I can go to prison and rot there for all time.' Duterte, however, said later that he would physically kick any ICC investigator who would face him. Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin, the most senior Cabinet member, said if Duterte 'desires to surrender himself to the jurisdiction of the ICC, the government will neither object to it nor move to block the fulfillment of his desire.' 'But if the ICC refers the process to Interpol, which may then transmit a red notice to the Philippine authorities, the government will feel obliged to consider the red notice as a request to be honored,' Bersamin said. 'In which case, the domestic law enforcement agencies shall be bound to accord full cooperation to the Interpol pursuant to established protocols.' A red notice flags law enforcement worldwide to locate and temporarily arrest a person pending extradition or surrender. Duterte withdrew the Philippines from ICC in 2019 in a move activists said was an attempt to evade accountability and prevent an international probe into the drug killings. However, the ICC still has jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed when the country was still a member state of the court. Duterte’s successor, Ferdinand Marcos Jr., has said his administration has no plan to rejoin the ICC. During the congressional inquiry, Duterte renewed a vague pledge under oath that he would take full responsibility for the actions — whether 'right or wrong' — of police officers who enforced his anti-drugs crackdown when he was in power. Duterte denied any involvement when confronted with specific details of the killings. He claimed that he once pushed a suspected criminal out of a helicopter as punishment but later walked it back, saying it was a 'hyperbole' not to be taken literally.	https://apnews.com/article/philippines-duterte-icc-interpol-drug-killings-71de48e00c77c70ce37cf67146a94d12	2024-11-13T03:18:52-08:00	
Israel's West Bank settlers hope Trump's return will pave the way for major settlement expansion	BEIT EL, West Bank (AP) — As Donald Trump’s victory became apparent in last week's U.S. elections, Jewish West Bank settlement advocates popped bottles of champagne and danced to the Bee Gees at a winery in the heart of the occupied territory, according to a post on Instagram. The winery said it was rolling out a special edition red named for the president-elect. Settlement supporters believe they have plenty of reasons to celebrate. Not only did the expansion of housing for Jews in the West Bank soar past previous records during Trump's first term, but his administration took unprecedented steps to support Israel’s territorial claims, including recognizing Jerusalem as its capital and moving the U.S. Embassy there, and recognizing Israel's annexation of the Golan Heights. This time around, as Israel is embroiled in a multifront war, settlement advocates believe Trump’s history of fervent support could translate into their supreme goal: Israeli annexation of the West Bank — a move that critics say would smother any remaining hopes for Palestinian statehood. Some are even gunning for resettling Gaza under a Trump administration. 'God willing, the year 2025 will be the year of sovereignty in Judea and Samaria,' Israeli Finance Minister and settlement firebrand Bezalel Smotrich said Monday, referring to the West Bank by its biblical name, in comments that sparked international uproar. He said he would make sure the government lobbies the Trump administration on the idea. Israel captured the West Bank, along with east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want those territories for their hoped-for future state. Israel annexed east Jerusalem in a move most of the international community does not recognize and in 2005 it withdrew its settlers and troops from the Gaza Strip, where it has been fighting a war against Hamas. Settlement expansion in the West Bank has ballooned during Israel’s open-ended occupation, with more than half a million Israelis living in about 130 settlements and dozens of unauthorized outposts. The Western-backed Palestinian Authority administers semiautonomous parts of the West Bank that are home to most of the Palestinian population. During his first term as president, Trump abandoned decades-long U.S. opposition to the settlements. He proposed a Mideast plan that would have allowed Israel to keep them all. His ambassador to Israel was a staunch settlement advocate and opponent of Palestinian statehood. But Trump also took steps that are keeping some settler proponents cautious. His Mideast plan did leave room for a Palestinian state, even if critics say it was an unrealistic vision for one. And the Trump-brokered normalization agreements between Israel and Arab countries held the country back from annexing the West Bank. While he has not explicitly stated his policy for his second term, his initial administration picks, including ambassadors to Israel and the U.N., are deeply pro-Israel, indicating he likely will not stand in the way of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s far-right government advancing settlement building. 'There has never been an American president that has been more helpful in securing an understanding of the sovereignty of Israel,' Mike Huckabee, Trump's nominee for ambassador to Israel, told Israel Army Radio, when asked about the possibility of West Bank annexation. 'I fully expect that to continue.' A spokesperson for Netanyahu declined to say whether the Israeli leader would pursue annexation during Trump's presidency. But Netanyahu has named an American-born, hard-line settlement activist, Yechiel Leiter, to serve as ambassador to Washington. Rights groups already claim Israel is enforcing an apartheid system in the West Bank, and annexation would open Israel up to similar charges if it doesn’t grant Palestinians there equal rights. Israel opposes giving West Bank Palestinians citizenship, saying it would destroy Israel’s Jewish character. Regardless of whether annexation comes, settler advocates envision unbridled expansion under Trump and under an Israeli government where settler leaders and supporters hold key positions. They see a presidential term where they will be able to more deeply entrench their presence in the West Bank with a proliferation of housing, roads and industrial zones. 'I’m sure that with President Trump it will be much easier because he supports the state of Israel,' said Israel Ganz, the chairman of the Yesha Council, a settler lobbying group. Israeli settlement expansion has carried on to varying degrees under multiple American administrations. During Trump's term, Israel advanced nearly 33,000 housing units, according to Peace Now, an antisettlement watchdog group, almost three times as much as during President Barack Obama's second term. The numbers fell significantly during the first two years of the Biden administration, but shot up again in 2023, shortly after Israel's current far-right, prosettlement government was formed, and have surged throughout the war. The Biden administration has slapped sanctions on Jewish settlers suspected of fomenting violence against Palestinians, an approach that is likely to end under Trump. In the West Bank, billboards advertise new settlement housing, beckoning passersby to make their home there. In Beit El, next to the Palestinian administrative center of Ramallah, a new neighborhood boasts not the red-roofed, single-family homes that became icons of the settler movement, but rather six towering multistory apartment buildings that can house hundreds, and look like any Israeli suburb. Palestinians view the settlements as a violation of international law and an obstacle to peace, a position with wide international support. Israel considers the West Bank to be the historical and biblical heartland of the Jewish people and says any partition should be agreed on in negotiations. Peace talks have been moribund for more than a decade, and support for a Palestinian state among Israelis fell after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attacks that sparked the war. Wasel Abu Yusuf, a Palestinian official, said Trump hadn’t yet made his positions clear and it was unknown if he would support Israeli annexation. Dror Etkes, an antisettlement researcher and activist, said that during the first Trump administration, West Bank outpost farms, which have forced entire Palestinian communities off huge swaths of land, saw a 'meteoric rise,' as did infrastructure projects that allow settlements to expand, like roads and water systems. Over the next four years, 'we can assume that we will see more significant steps of de facto annexation or maybe even official annexation,' Etkes said. Some settler advocates, like Daniella Weiss, believe Trump will not pressure Netanyahu to withdraw troops swiftly from Gaza, creating an opening for resettlement. That notion would be a nonstarter with other American administrations, and much of the international community would oppose it. A similar strategy in the early years of Israel's West Bank occupation led to the proliferation of settlements there. Two of Netanyahu's key governing partners also support resettling Gaza, although the Israeli leader has said it is not 'realistic.' Yair Sheleg, a research fellow at Jerusalem's Shalom Hartman Institute who studies the settler movement, said Trump was 'fickle' and that in his expected push to normalize ties between Israel and Saudi Arabia, he could end up being less favorable to the settlement enterprise than many hope. But nonetheless, he said, the overarching feeling among settler advocates is that 'Trump understands ... the needs of the settlement enterprise.'	https://apnews.com/article/trump-israel-settlers-west-bank-gaza-e1813d86ac1d930c2354db0937abf5f2	2024-11-13T03:12:36-08:00	
Middle East latest: 3 young siblings killed in Gaza as Israeli strikes leave 6 dead in Lebanon	An Israeli strike on a home in northern Gaza killed three siblings aged 6 and under, among at least six people killed in airstrikes in the war-ravaged territory, Palestinian medics said. In Lebanon, an Israeli airstrike on an apartment building south of Beirut on Wednesday killed at least six people and wounded 15, the Health Ministry said. The Biden administration said Tuesday it won’t limit weapons transfers to Israel because it has made limited progress in increasing the flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza. Eight international aid groups had earlier said that Israel failed to meet U.S. demands for greater humanitarian access to the Gaza Strip, where hunger experts say the north may already be experiencing famine. Israel’s war in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 people, Palestinian health officials say. The officials do not distinguish between civilians and combatants, but say more than half of those killed were women and children. The Israel-Hamas war began after Palestinian militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. Lebanon's Hezbollah group began firing into Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, in solidarity with Hamas in Gaza. Since then, more than 3,200 people have been killed in Lebanon and more than 14,200 wounded, the country's Health Ministry reported. In Israel, 76 people have been killed, including 31 soldiers. ___ Here's the latest: Blinken says Israel should end the war in Gaza and allow displaced to return home BRUSSELS — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is urging Israel to allow displaced Palestinians and aid back into Gaza and says it should end the war against Hamas now that it’s achieved its main security aims. 'The situation is so difficult and so dramatic that to fully redress it, to fully answer the needs of people, the best way to do that is to end the war,' Blinken told reporters in Brussels on Wednesday. He said that Israel has accomplished its goals of dismantling the military wing of Hamas and ensuring that an attack like the one the militant group launched on Oct. 7 last year cannot happen again. 'Israel, by the standards it set itself, has accomplished the strategic goals it set for itself,' Blinken said. 'So this should be a time to end the war.' He said that hundreds of aid trucks in Gaza are unable to distribute relief supplies due to looting and other crime. 'It’s imperative that that be addressed. Israel has responsibilities to do that. We’re also working with Egypt,' he said. Blinken called for 'real and extended pauses' in the fighting in much of Gaza 'so that the assistance can effectively get to people who need it.' A new video shows an Israeli hostage in Gaza CAIRO — The Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group has released a new video showing an Israeli hostage who has been held in Gaza for over a year. The video shows Sasha Troufanov, likely speaking under duress, describing the harsh conditions inside Gaza, warning against military operations to free him and calling on Israelis to protest for his release. It was the first such video to be released in several weeks. It was not clear when it was filmed, but Troufanov appeared to refer to Israel’s war against Hezbollah in Lebanon and its recent exchange of fire with Iran, which occurred in October. Islamic Jihad took part in Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack into Israel, in which militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took another 250 people hostage. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, about a third of whom are believed to be dead. Islamic Jihad released two previous videos of Troufanov earlier this year. He turned 29 on Monday, marking his second birthday in captivity. His mother, grandmother and girlfriend were also taken captive, but they were released during a November 2023 cease-fire. His father was killed in the Oct. 7 attack. The U.S., Egypt and Qatar have spent most of this year trying to broker a cease-fire and the release of the remaining hostages. Hamas has said it will only release the remaining hostages in return for a lasting cease-fire, the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and the release of Palestinian prisoners. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to retain Israeli control over parts of Gaza and to continue the war until 'total victory' over Hamas and the return of the remaining captives. At least 6 dead and 15 wounded in an Israeli strike south of Beirut BEIRUT — An Israeli airstrike on an apartment building in the town of Aramoun, just south of Beirut, killed at least six people and wounded 15 others Wednesday, Lebanon’s Health Ministry said. The state-run National News Agency reported that there were children missing after the strike and it wasn't clear if they are under the rubble or were transferred to a hospital. There was no warning issued before the strike, and it was not clear what the target was. There was no immediate statement from the Israeli military. Also Wednesday morning, the Israeli military struck several sites in Beirut’s southern suburbs, an area known as Dahiyeh, after issuing evacuation warnings. It said the strikes were targeting 'Hezbollah facilities and interests.' There were no immediate reports of casualties. Israeli forces and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah have been clashing since Oct. 8, 2023, when Hezbollah began launching rockets across the border in support of its ally, Hamas, in Gaza. The conflict escalated beginning in mid-September. Israel has launched a widespread aerial bombardment of Lebanon and a ground invasion that it said is intended to push Hezbollah back from the border. 3 young siblings were killed in an Israeli strike in northern Gaza, Palestinian medics say DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Palestinian medics say an Israeli strike on a home in northern Gaza killed three siblings aged 6 and under. They were among at least six people killed in Israeli strikes on Tuesday in the war-ravaged territory, where Israel has been at war with Hamas for more than 13 months. The Gaza Health Ministry’s emergency service says the three children were killed in a strike on a home near a clinic in the urban Jabaliya refugee camp, where Israel has been waging an offensive for over a month. In the central city of Deir al-Balah, a strike hit a tent in the western side of the city, killing at least two people, including a 15-year-old boy, Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital said. Another strike on a tent in the built-up Nuseirat refugee camp killed a man, the hospital said. An Associated Press journalist counted the three bodies at the hospital. Israel says it only targets militants and tries to avoid harming civilians. It accuses Hamas militants of hiding among civilians in homes and shelters. The military rarely comments on individual strikes, which often kill women and children. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking another 250 people hostage. Around 100 captives are still inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed over 43,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities. They do not distinguish between militants and civilians in their count but say women and children make up more than half of those killed. US forces conduct strikes in Syria against Iranian-aligned militia groups WASHINGTON — U.S. forces conducted strikes in Syria against Iranian-aligned militia groups for a second day in a row Tuesday in response to further attacks on U.S. personnel, U.S. Central Command said late Tuesday. In the latest retaliatory strikes, U.S. forces hit a weapons storage and logistics facility after militia groups launched a rocket attack on U.S. personnel at Patrol Base Shaddadi in eastern Syria. Earlier Tuesday, Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said that over the weekend the militias had also targeted U.S. personnel with a drone attack and indirect fire at another base, Green Village, where U.S. troops are operating — which prompted the U.S. to strike nine militia targets on Monday in self-defense. There are about 900 U.S. troops deployed in Syria. No U.S. troops were wounded in either attack. ___ For more Middle East news: https://apnews.com/hub/middle-east	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-hezbollah-mideast-latest-13-november-2024-2e7065731020a76e89b42643bdfcb9ae	2024-11-13T00:54:03-08:00	
US says it intends to shore up support for Ukraine until Trump takes office	BRUSSELS (AP) — President Joe Biden intends to bolster U.S. military support to Ukraine in the final months of his administration, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Wednesday, after Russia launched a sophisticated missile and drone attack on Kyiv. The U.S. will 'continue to shore up everything we’re doing for Ukraine to make sure that it can effectively defend itself against this Russian aggression,' Blinken told reporters at NATO headquarters, before planned meetings with allied envoys and Ukrainian officials. Blinken warned that North Korea’s decision to send its troops into combat operations alongside Russian forces 'demands and will get a firm response.' He didn't elaborate. U.S., South Korean and Ukrainian intelligence assessments say up to 12,000 North Korean combat troops are being sent to the war. The bulk of those troops were expected to be deployed in Russia’s Kursk region where Ukrainian troops have seized a swathe of territory. Russia’s early morning missile and drone attack was the first on Kyiv in 73 days. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said that Russia is intensifying its strikes, apparently in an effort to discourage Ukrainians from continuing the war, which is approaching its 1,000-day milestone. Russia appears to be pressing its advantage as doubt swirls about how Washington might change policy on the war after Donald Trump takes office as U.S. president in January. The U.S. is the biggest provider of military help to Ukraine. Trump has slammed the Biden administration for giving Kyiv tens of billions of dollars in aid and has promised to quickly end the conflict. Ukraine’s international backers fear that any rushed settlement would mostly benefit Russian President Vladimir Putin. ___ Follow the AP’s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/nato-ukraine-russia-us-biden-blinken-a25d225efa5b06eab62d903b0ba08afc	2024-11-13T00:07:47-08:00	
Biden is sending aid to help Ukraine keep fighting next year, Blinken says	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The Biden administration is determined in its final months to help ensure that Ukraine can keep fighting off Russia's full-scale invasion next year, sending it as much aid as possible so that it might hold Russian forces at bay and possess a strong hand in any potential peace negotiations, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday. 'President Biden has committed to making sure that every dollar we have at our disposal will be pushed out the door between now and Jan. 20,' when president-elect Donald Trump is due to be sworn in, Blinken said. NATO countries must focus their efforts on 'ensuring that Ukraine has the money, munitions and mobilized forces to fight effectively in 2025, or to be able to negotiate a peace from a position of strength,' Blinken said during a visit to Brussels. The U.S. will 'adapt and adjust' with the latest equipment it is sending, Blinken said, without providing details. The almost three-year war has shown no signs of winding down. Russia attacked the Ukrainian capital Kyiv with a sophisticated combination of missiles and drones for the first time in 73 days on Wednesday. That came a day after the Pentagon said most of the North Korean troops sent to help Moscow's war effort are fighting to drive Ukraine's army off Russian soil in the Kursk border region. Ukraine is also straining to hold back a monthslong Russian onslaught in the eastern Donetsk region. Political uncertainty over how a U.S. administration under Trump will change Washington’s policy on the war is a key new factor in the conflict. U.S. military aid is vital for Ukraine, but Trump has signaled that he doesn’t want to keep giving tens of billions of dollars to Kyiv. Air raid warnings blared for hours as Russia targeted eight regions of Ukraine on Wednesday, firing six ballistic and cruise missiles and 90 drones, the Ukrainian air force said. Air defenses downed four missiles and 37 drones, and another 47 drones were stopped by electronic jamming, the statement said. The damage was being assessed. The air assault came as most of the more than 10,000 North Korean troops sent by Pyongyang to help Moscow in the war are engaged in combat in Russia's Kursk border region, according to the Pentagon. A Ukrainian army incursion into Kursk three months ago has succeeded in holding a broad area of land and has embarrassed the Kremlin. Russia’s military has trained the North Korean soldiers in artillery, drone skills and basic infantry operations, including trench clearing, Pentagon deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel told a briefing Tuesday. The cooperation faces challenges, according to the Pentagon, including how to achieve military interoperability and overcoming the language barrier. Kyiv officials say that Russia has deployed around 50,000 troops to Kursk in a bid to dislodge the Ukrainians. Russia has in recent months been assembling forces for a counteroffensive in Kursk, according to the Institute for the Study of War think tank, though the timescale of the operation isn't known. ___ Lorne Cook reported from Brussels. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-kyiv-attack-276e38b9e841f92032909f08456743f9	2024-11-12T23:16:55-08:00	
Trump's defense choice stuns the Pentagon, raises questions about the Fox News host's experience	WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump stunned the Pentagon and the broader defense world by nominating Fox News host Pete Hegseth to serve as his defense secretary, tapping someone largely inexperienced and untested on the global stage to take over the world's largest and most powerful military. The news was met with bewilderment and wide-eyed worry among many in Washington, as Trump passed on a number of established national security heavy-hitters and chose an Army National Guard captain who is well-known in conservative circles as a co-host of Fox News Channel’s 'Fox &amp; Friends Weekend.' While some Republican lawmakers had a muted response to the announcement, others called his combat experience an asset or said he was 'tremendously capable.' Hegseth's choice could bring sweeping changes to the military, as he has made it clear on his show and in interviews that, like Trump, he is stridently opposed to 'woke' programs that promote equity and inclusion. He's also questioned the role of women in combat and advocated pardoning service members charged with war crimes. In June, at a rally in Las Vegas, Trump encouraged his supporters to buy Hegseth’s book after vowing that if he won: 'The woke stuff will be gone within a period of 24 hours. I can tell you.' A staunch conservative who embraces Trump's 'America First' policies, the 44-year-old Hegseth has pushed for making the military more lethal. During an interview on 'The Shawn Ryan Show' podcast, he said allowing women to serve in combat hurts that effort. 'Everything about men and women serving together makes the situation more complicated, and complication in combat, that means casualties are worse,' Hegseth said. And while he said diversity in the military is a strength, he said it was because minority and white men 'can perform similarly' but the same isn't true for women. While Trump lauded Hegseth as 'tough, smart and a true believer in America First,' others were quick to point to the TV personality's lack of experience, with some suggesting he could be Pentagon chief in name only as the Trump White House runs the department. A number of other names floated as possible defense choices had included Rep. Mike Rogers of Alabama, the GOP chairman of the House Armed Services Committee; retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg; Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa; and Robert Wilkie, a former Pentagon official who was head of Veterans Affairs in Trump's first term. 'There is reason for concern that this is not a person who is a serious enough policymaker, serious enough policy implementer, to do a successful job,' said Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, the ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee. Mark Cancian, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Hegseth's lack of senior national security experience makes it more difficult to get Senate confirmation. 'I think Trump was tired of fighting with his secretaries of defense and picked one who would be loyal to him,' Cancian said. Military officials said the choice came out of the blue. A senior military officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media, said Hegseth's selection is raising concerns about whether he has the practical experience to manage a large department with an enormous budget. The Defense Department has a budget exceeding $800 billion, with about 1.3 million active-duty troops and another 1.4 million in the National Guard, Reserves and civilian employees based worldwide. If confirmed, Hegseth would face a daunting array of global crises, from the wars in the Middle East and Ukraine and the expanding alliance between Russia and North Korea to the growing competition with China. There is also the need to upgrade the complex U.S. missile and nuclear defense apparatus and ensure the defense industry can keep up with America's need for weapons systems. Smith said that while Hegseth's combat experience is a plus, running the Pentagon requires a lot of other skill sets, and his nomination will need some time for consideration. 'What’s your plan? What are you going to do? ... How can you assure us that that lack of experience, you know, isn’t going to make it impossible for you to do the job?' Smith said. 'I think those are questions that need to be answered over the next couple of months.' Even some Republicans in the Senate — who would vote on his nomination — had a subdued response. North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis called the choice 'interesting,' and Indiana Sen. Todd Young, who served in the Marine Corps, said, 'I don’t know much about his background or his vision, so I look forward to learning more.' North Dakota Sen. John Hoeven said he’s not surprised that Trump chose Hegseth because Trump is 'close to him and likes him and trusts him.' 'The guy’s obviously tremendously capable, a great communicator,' Hoeven said. 'I look forward to getting to know him better.' House Speaker Mike Johnson said Hegseth brings a lot to the table and will be 'reform-minded in the areas that need reform.' Hegseth has been a contributor since 2014 for Fox News, developing a friendship with Trump, who made regular appearances on his show. He is the author of 'The War on Warriors: Behind the Betrayal of the Men Who Keep Us Free.' 'With Pete at the helm, America’s enemies are on notice — Our Military will be Great Again, and America will Never Back Down,' Trump said in a statement. 'Nobody fights harder for the Troops, and Pete will be a courageous and patriotic champion of our ‘Peace through Strength’ policy.' ___ Associated Press writers Lisa Mascaro, Mary Clare Jalonick and Farnoush Amiri in Washington and Jill Colvin in New York contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-hegseth-defense-secretary-pentagon-2d8030921ecef933778cf92afd40ec72	2024-11-12T20:27:18-08:00	
In Africa, meager expectations and some hopes for a second Trump presidency	ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — African leaders may have been quick to congratulate Donald Trump on his election, professing a desire for mutually beneficial partnerships, but there are meager expectations that his presidency will change things for this continent of over 1.4 billion people. In the wake of Trump's win, Kenya's William Ruto said his country 'stands ready' to deepen its ties with Washington. Nigeria's Bola Tinubu spoke of a second Trump administration ushering in an era of 'earnest, beneficial, and reciprocal' cooperation. Still, observers say African countries — once described by Trump as 'shithole countries' — are definitely not going to be high on his to-do list. Low priority or not even a concern? U.S. foreign policy has not made Africa a priority for a long while — beyond seeing the continent through the lens of countering rivals such as Russia and China, said Charles Ray, chair of the Foreign Policy Research Institute’s Africa Program. President Joe Biden talked about Africa as a key partner, said Ray, who served as the U.S. ambassador to Zimbabwe between 2009 and 2012. But not much action followed those words. Africa 'will be at the very bottom of (Trump's) list of priorities' and any U.S. action on the continent would likely be driven by his 'transactional, ego-driven leadership style,' Ray added. Many experts agree, citing Trump’s 'America First' strategy. Murithi Mutiga, program director for Africa at the Crisis Group, says the president-elect is 'a committed isolationist and clearly wants to pull back' on various fronts across the world. Some say there are deals to be made, even in Africa J. Peter Pham, Trump's former special envoy to Africa's Great Lakes and Sahel regions, says the next Trump presidency may look for a 'win-win' situation in Africa. That could include a renewal of the African Growth and Opportunity Act, which grants eligible African countries duty-free access to U.S. markets, Pham said during a Voice of America broadcast. However, U.S. lawmakers have been asking questions about whether African countries are complying with conditions under the program — or if they are undermining U.S. foreign policy interests and national security, Pham said. South Africa, one of the biggest beneficiaries of the program, was accused by U.S. Ambassador Reuben Brigety in 2023 of providing weapons and ammunition to Russia for its war in Ukraine and its professed neutral stance on the war was brought into question. Basically, you don't 'kick America in the teeth' in ways that raise questions about compliance with such deals, Pham said. Those that do 'will be treated as pariahs,' said Ray, with the Foreign Policy Research Institute. Africa's myriad health and other crises, abortion and LGBTQ+ rights The top concern is that the next Trump presidency will cut funding. In many parts of Africa, such cuts could be critical for millions of girls and young women whose reproductive health and choices are supported heavily by U.S.-funded programs. 'The situation is already bad for girls (and) it will turn into a disaster without these services,' said Valentine Damitoni, a mother at 18. She regularly visits a local clinic in Zimbabwe’s capital of Harare to receive a contraceptive under a U.S.-funded program that allows her to return to school without fears of falling pregnant again. Max Primorac, a former acting deputy administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development — one of Africa’s biggest development aid donors — criticized some of the agency's programs in Project 2025, a 900-page blueprint proposed by the conservative-leaning Heritage Foundation to reshape the federal government. In particular, Primorac criticized USAID programs that 'promote abortion, climate extremism and interventions against perceived systematic racism.' The document is said to align closely with Trump’s vision — though he has distanced himself from it. Kiron Skinner, the head of policy planning at the U.S. State Department during Trump’s first term in office, recommends in the document that in Africa, America should 'focus on core security, economic, and human rights' rather than impose 'radical abortion and pro-LGBT initiatives.' New realignments in Africa, turning to Russia and China In Africa's volatile Sahel region, soldiers are increasingly booting out elected presidents and riding anti-Western sentiments to sever ties with longstanding allies like the United States and France — while turning to a new friend: Russia. China, which casts infrastructural loans to African countries as mutually beneficial cooperation, rarely interferes in internal politics of the recipients countries. Russia, the continent’s biggest arms supplier, is often in bed with Africa's military juntas. Both countries, as indeed America, have shown huge interest in Africa’s rich mineral resources. Mutiga, of the Crisis Group, says 'the problem historically has been that the U.S. and the West viewed Africa as a problem' to be solved. China and others 'saw it as an opportunity to be grasped.' Will Trump backpedal on Biden's pledges? The Biden administration announced last December that it had invested at least $22 billion in Africa and promised to do more. Trump, during his first term, continuously sought to slash foreign affairs funding, sometimes as much as 30%. Analysts are concerned about whether key U.S. projects in health, security and development would be implemented under Trump — especially at a time of worsening hunger and resurgent threats to democracy in Africa. For many ordinary Africans, Trump is just a distant leader who can't do much about their everyday problems. 'Trump ... is not going to save us from hunger caused by our government,' said Isah Mohammed, a fruit seller in Nigeria's capital, Abuja. Africa's flashpoints, from Western Sahara to Somalia In Morocco, many rejoiced after Trump’s win, hoping his return to office would help the North African country further its push to win global recognition for its sovereignty over the disputed Western Sahara. 'The return of the friend of Morocco to the White House,' proclaimed the country's Assabah newspaper in its editorial. As part of a larger deal that included Morocco normalizing its ties with Israel, Trump shifted longstanding U.S. policy and recognized Morocco’s sovereignty claims before leaving office in 2020. Biden has not reversed that decision — but has also not advanced the Trump administration’s promise to build a consulate in the disputed territory. The stability in the Horn of Africa is increasingly threatened by the raging war in Sudan and growing tensions between Somalia and Ethiopia over the latter’s business deal with Somalia’s breakaway region Somaliland. Trump will likely cut funding to Somalia and engage more with Somaliland, predicts Rashid Abdi, an analyst at the Nairobi-based Sahan Research think tank. What's stopping Africa's progress? Maybe Africa itself The G20, the group of the world’s leading economies, welcomed the African Union as a permanent member last year — a powerful acknowledgement of the continent's more than 50 countries and something Biden had said was 'a long time in coming.' But despite that step on the global stage, observers say the union and its leaders have not lived up to expectations, failing to articulate their interests and table their demands as a united front. 'The question is often, what will Washington do, but, really, what is Africa’s interest?' said Mutiga, with the Crisis Group. 'We’re in an age of transactional global relations and unless Africa can engage in a way that articulates its own interests, America’s (interests in Africa) will continue to be determined by geopolitical competition with its rivals,' he said. ___ Associated Press reporters Farai Mutsaka in Harare, Zimbabwe, and Sam Metz in Rabat, Morocco, contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s Africa coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/africa	https://apnews.com/article/trump-africa-us-foreign-policy-947951d341e0fb0cca66308557991cae	2024-11-12T20:05:36-08:00	
Children brought from Gaza to heal from war wounds become caught in another war, in Lebanon	BEIRUT (AP) — When Zarifa Nawfal’s family arrived in Beirut for her wounded daughter’s surgery, one of the first things she wanted to do was go to the sea. The Mediterranean had been a constant companion at their home in Gaza before the war. 'The moment I smelled the sea, I felt at peace inside — as if I were in Gaza,' she said. But soon their place of refuge reminded her of home in far more distressing ways. Nawfal’s 7-year-old daughter, Halima Abou Yassine, is one of a dozen severely wounded Palestinian children brought to Lebanon this year for treatment through a program launched by a British-Palestinian surgeon, Dr. Ghassan Abu Sitta. But months after their arrival, Lebanon is itself embroiled in a war some fear will end in Gaza-like destruction. In February, Nawfal was staying with her five children and her mother in an apartment in central Gaza. They had been displaced from their home in the north and Nawfal’s husband was missing, likely dead. The children were filling water containers outside when two missiles struck, Nawfal said. She rushed outside and found Halima, the youngest, lying in the street, her skull cracked open, her brain exposed. Through her shock, Nawfal said, 'I was relieved that her body was in one piece.' In Gaza, blasts often ripped people apart, leaving their loved ones without even a body to bury. Halima’s brother was unconscious next to her. He was quickly revived at the hospital. But staff at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital confirmed Nawfal’s fears, she said: Halima was dead. Her small body was placed in the morgue. But as the family was preparing to bury her, the little girl’s uncle noticed faint signs of life, the family said. Officials at Al-Aqsa hospital could not be reached to confirm the account. But Abu Sitta, who has worked in several Gaza hospitals during the war, said in the chaotic situation it was not uncommon for patients to be misidentified as dead because normal protocols for emergency room examinations were often abandoned. 'Because of the sheer number of cases that would come in with each air raid ... the ambulance staff would take to the morgue immediately those who they thought were dead,' he said. In the days after her daughter was determined to be alive, Nawfal stayed with her, manually pumping oxygen into her lungs. After a week, the little girl began to breathe on her own. Finally, she woke up. 'Some of the doctors cried and said this is a miracle,' Nawfal said. But they were unable to do more than keep the little girl alive. Her skull was still gaping open, a shard of bone missing. Her brain was beset by infection. The family was evacuated to Egypt in May. In July, they boarded a plane for Lebanon. An unlikely refuge The first of the wounded Palestinian children arrived in Lebanon in May. Five-year-old Adam Afana had nearly lost his left arm in a blast that killed his father and sister. His arm was paralyzed and he needed a complex surgery to correct the nerve damage. At the time, Lebanon was already embroiled in a low-simmering conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. The Lebanese militant group began firing rockets across the border into Israel in support of its ally, Hamas, on Oct. 8, 2023, a day after Palestinian militants staged the deadly surprise incursion into southern Israel that sparked the ongoing war in Gaza. Israel responded with shelling and airstrikes. For months, the conflict in Lebanon was mainly confined to the border area, far from Beirut. Abu Sitta said he chose Lebanon for the wounded children's treatment because the Mediterranean country has specialists with wide experience treating war injuries. Lebanon has been through its share of conflicts, including a 15-year civil war that ended in 1990 and a brutal monthlong war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006, as well as spillover effects from other regional conflicts. 'Even after the end of the wars (in Lebanon), the wounded from Iraq and Syria would come here for that kind of complex and multistage treatment,' Abu Sitta said. The war that followed them In July, Halima underwent successful surgery to repair her skull at the American University of Beirut Medical Center. Nawfal said her daughter has lingering memory problems but is improving with therapy. A chipper, happy-go-lucky child, Halima thrived in Beirut. She swam in the hotel pool, loved to color and played with the other children from Gaza. She walked with her siblings to pick out fruit at the neighborhood produce stand, a straw hat covering the scar on the back of her head. In mid-September, Israel launched an offensive against Hezbollah. It pummeled wide swathes of Lebanon with airstrikes, including Beirut’s southern suburbs and some sites within the city center. The children quickly snapped back into wartime habits. They cracked open the balcony's sliding glass doors to prevent the glass shattering from the pressure of a blast and began sleeping in the central sitting room in the family’s hotel suite, away from windows. Nawfal said some organizations offered to evacuate the family from Lebanon to continue treatment elsewhere, but she 'completely refused.' 'Lebanon isn’t just another Arab country or a country we came to for treatment — Lebanon is a sister to Gaza,' she said. 'We are like two souls in one body. ... We live or die together.' Adam Afana's uncle, Eid Afana, said the escalation in Lebanon 'reminds us of the beginning of the war in Gaza.' Afana said the sound of airstrikes frightened Adam, who felt the war was pursuing them. 'What we hope for Lebanon is that what happened in Gaza won’t happen here — that the beginning and the ending won’t both be the same,' Afana said. ‘All wars are waged on children’ The Ghassan Abu Sitta Fund halted bringing wounded Palestinian children to Lebanon but continues to treat the existing patients — with some challenges. Since arriving in Beirut, Adam has undergone a procedure to clear infection from his bones, a neurosurgery and regular physiotherapy sessions. With effort, he can now slightly clench his hand. But the final operation — a muscle transfer and surgery to repair the damaged nerves to his arm — is on hold. 'There’s just a handful of people who specialize in this globally, and we were expecting one of them to come to Lebanon,' Abu Sitta said. The trip has been delayed by the escalation in Lebanon. When he first launched the program, Abu Sitta hoped to treat 50 Palestinian children from Gaza at any given time. Unable to bring more patients in, the team is turning its resources to treating Lebanese children. The numbers of wounded Lebanese children are still far lower than in Gaza. As of last week, Lebanon’s Ministry of Public Health said 192 children had been killed and at least 1,255 wounded since October 2023. In Gaza, more than 13,000 children have been killed and thousands more have been wounded, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Abu Sitta said the wounds of children in Lebanon are 'identical to the injuries of Palestinian children from Gaza.' Most were wounded while at home. They suffered 'crush injuries to the limbs, blast injuries to the face' and often 'multiple members of the family killed at the same time,' he said. 'As in Gaza, this war takes its toll on children,' he said. 'All wars are waged on children.'	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-gaza-children-ghassan-abu-sitta-7ef6100b0f6bea94b1a939676ac09d34	2024-11-12T20:04:33-08:00	
Public mourns 35 killed in attack at sports complex in southern Chinese city	ZHUHAI, China (AP) — Members of the public paid their respects Wednesday to people killed by a driver who rammed into people exercising a sports complex in southern China, as the country mourned, but little information was available about the suspect or the victims in the attack. The crash Monday night in Zhuhai killed 35 people and severely injured 43 others, and the driver was detained as he was trying to escape. Authorities said the 62-year-old man with the surname Fan was upset over his divorce settlement. Members of the public had started bringing flowers in honor of the victims Tuesday night and continued into Wednesday. There was a light police presence in the morning at the Zhuhai sports complex, which was closed until further notice, but the number of officers increased as the morning passed. While police allowed people to leave bouquets of flowers in memory of the dead just outside the entrance of the sports complex, volunteers then quickly moved the flowers inside to the sports center. 'May there be no thugs in heaven,' said the message on one bouquet. 'Good deeds will be rewarded and evil deeds will be punished.' The attack on occurred on the eve of the Zhuhai Airshow, an aviation exhibition sponsored by the People's Liberation Army that is held every two years. China authorities often make extra efforts to tightly control information around major or sensitive events like the airshow. Censors also take extra care around major catastrophes or violence, often censoring eyewitness accounts. Clear information on the death and injury toll was not available for almost 24 hours after the attack. Videos were quickly censored inside China, though they circulated outside the Great Firewall. They were posted by Teacher Li, an artist turned dissident who runs a X account with 1.7 million followers that posts crowdsourced videos about news in China. Articles from Chinese media featuring interviews with survivors were quickly taken down Monday and Tuesday. The news that trended about the attack was largely based on official statements from authorities. Police said their preliminary investigation found Fan was dissatisfied with the split of financial assets in his divorce. Beyond that description, further information was not available on his divorce or alleged motive. Chinese leader Xi Jinping called for the 'strict' punishment of the perpetrator according to law, in a statement Tuesday evening. He also called on all local governments 'to strengthen prevention and control of risks at the source, strictly prevent extreme cases from occurring, and to resolve conflicts and disputes in a timely manner,' according to the official Xinhua news agency. ___ Wu reported from Bangkok.

Guns smuggled from the US are blamed for a surge in killings on more Caribbean islands	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Dozens of soldiers and police fanned out across a neighborhood on a recent night in the Turks &amp; Caicos Islands just days after the archipelago reported a record 40 killings this year. They were on the hunt for criminals and illegal weapons fueling a surge of violence across the Caribbean as authorities struggle to control a stream of firearms smuggled in from the U.S. Half an hour into the Oct. 30 operation, one driver tried to run authorities off the road as he tossed a handgun into the bushes. 'Rest assured, we remain committed to disrupting the flow of illicit guns,' Police Superintendent Jason James said hours later. But the flow is too strong, with illegal firearms blamed for an increase or a record number of killings in a growing number of Caribbean islands this year, including Trinidad and Tobago and the Bahamas. No Caribbean nation manufactures firearms or ammunition or imports them on a large scale, but they account for half of the world’s top 10 highest national murder rates, according to a statement from U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut. In a letter sent to U.S. legislators in late September, New York’s attorney general and 13 other colleagues across the U.S. demanded new measures to stop the flow of guns, noting that 90% of weapons used in the Caribbean were bought in the U.S. and smuggled into the region. 'American-made guns are flowing into Caribbean nations and communities and fueling violence, chaos, and senseless tragedies throughout the region,' wrote New York Attorney General Letitia James. In mid-2023, the U.S. government appointed its first coordinator for Caribbean firearms prosecutions to help curb weapon smuggling from the U.S. to the region, with the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives already tracing firearms seized in the Caribbean. Last year, 266 firearms seized in the Bahamas were submitted to ATF, along with 234 firearms from Jamaica, 162 from the Dominican Republic and 143 from Trinidad and Tobago, according to the agency’s most recent data. The majority are handguns, followed by semiautomatic pistols. The information gleaned from recovered weapons can help authorities in the U.S. determine where and when they were bought, triggering a domestic firearms trafficking investigation. But it’s a struggle to stop the flow of weapons, with smugglers disassembling them and hiding their parts in sea-bound containers. 'As much as you try to harden the infrastructure at the official ports, it is essentially like trying to plug a sift,' said Michael Jones, executive director of the Implementation Agency for Crime and Security at Caricom, a Caribbean trade bloc. Brazen killings Homicides are not the only thing rising across parts of the Caribbean. There’s an increase in privately made firearms using 3D printers, and gunmen are using higher caliber weapons and becoming more brazen, with younger and younger people committing crimes, Jones said. Killings are now occurring during the day, and not necessarily via a drive-by shooting, he said. 'You have some who are so bold as to walk up to an individual, put the gun to their head, and walk away,' he said. Jones said gangs are franchising across the region, with gunmen sometimes traveling to a certain island to commit the crime and then leaving. Gangs also are preying on young people because they lack opportunities, Jones said. 'Even now, there are some countries that will tell you they don’t have a gang problem,' he said. The victims On a recent afternoon in late October, a 42-year-old employee with Trinidad and Tobago’s Forestry Division was fatally shot while in a car near his brother’s house. He was one of six people killed in the span of 48 hours, raising the death toll in the twin-island nation of 1.4 million people to 518 compared with 468 killings last year. The sister island of Tobago alone reported a record 20 killings — in mid-August — and still counting. During a recent budget presentation, Prime Minister Keith Rowley urged lawmakers to draft a bill to ban assault weapons and high-powered rifles. Experts say many killings in the Caribbean are a result of gang-on-gang violence, but civilians are increasingly getting caught in the crossfire. 'The proliferation of privately made rifles and semi-automatic pistols, combined with the circulation of conversion devices, increases the likelihood that significantly more rounds will be fired during criminal shootings, which may in turn increase the risk of multiple injuries, including among bystanders,' warned a June report by Caricom’s Impacs, the Small Arms Survey and others. One of those bystanders was a 4-year-old boy shot in the leg when gunfire erupted outside his preschool in Trinidad in late September. The bullet fractured one of his bones. In the Bahamas, a man holding his 8-month-old baby was shot and killed in early October as he stepped out of his car, where another 6-year-old child was sitting. Both children were unharmed. It was the 90th slaying of the year for the Bahamas, which so far has reported a 23% increase in killings compared with last year. Overall crime is down, though, according to government statistics. Jamaica, meanwhile, has one of the world’s highest homicide rates among countries with reliable statistics: 53.3 per 100,000 people. As of Nov. 2 police statistics show 960 people were reported killed, a nearly 20% drop from last year and far from a record 1,683 homicides reported in 2009, but violence persists on the island of 2.8 million people, 'It is of grave concern to us,' Prime Minister Andrew Holness said at a press conference in November about large-scale shootings. In late October, five men were killed at a soccer game in a Kingston neighborhood that previously struggled with gang violence. It was the island’s latest massacre. In a visit to the neighborhood, Holness noted police have reduced the number of gangs from almost 600 to 150. While Jamaica has passed anti-gang legislation to crack down on violence, the Turks &amp; Caicos Islands approved a law in early October that allows authorities to offer immunity or reduced sentences to those who provide key information about a crime. Police in Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago and the Turks &amp; Caicos Islands did not respond to repeated messages for comment. ‘We’re asking the US to do more' Most of the firearms smuggled into the Caribbean come from Florida, followed by Georgia and Texas. They usually are shipped directly to an island, although sometimes they first go through a port in Jamaica or the Bahamas. Firearms have been found inside items ranging from cars to washing machines. 'It’s a big problem,' said James Sutton, police commissioner for St. Kitts and Nevis. 'We’re asking the U.S. to do more.' The twin-island nation has reported at least 27 homicides, the vast majority committed with guns. It’s creeping close to a record 32 killings in 2016. Haiti remains the Caribbean nation hardest hit by smuggled weapons that feed gangs controlling 85% of the capital of Port-au-Prince. 'Despite the strengthening of the arms embargo measures, arms trafficking continues unabated,' stated a U.N. Security Council report released in late October. 'Gangs have been increasingly procuring larger caliber weapons, resulting in more damage and a posing greater challenge to the police and the (U.N.-backed) mission.' The report said trafficking from the U.S. to Haiti is not a sophisticated process, noting there are numerous networks often based on family or social connections and that the 'vast majority' of the 200 containers heading from South Florida to Haiti every week are not inspected. 'Despite being brought into the country in small quantities, this recurrent ‘ant trafficking’ quickly builds up, leaving the country awash with weapons,' the report said.	https://apnews.com/article/caribbean-turks-caicos-gun-violence-4bc996c17d956b7c2f3809326b703f77	2024-11-12T19:26:45-08:00	
A diminished Biden heads to APEC summit in Peru, overshadowed by China's Xi	LIMA, Peru (AP) — If things had gone differently last week, U.S. President Joe Biden could have arrived at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Peru on Thursday projecting confidence and pledging his successor’s cooperation with eager Latin American partners. No longer. Just as in 2016, the last time that Peru’s capital Lima hosted APEC, Donald Trump’s election victory has pulled the rug out from under a lame-duck Democrat at the high-profile summit attended by over a dozen world leaders. The renewed prospect of Trump’s 'America First' doctrine hampers Biden’s ability to reinforce the United States’ profile on his first presidential trip to South America, experts say, leaving China and its leader, Xi Jinping, to grab the limelight in America’s proverbial backyard. President Xi’s first order of business in Peru is inaugurating a $1.3 billion megaport that will put China’s regional influence on stark display. Total investment is expected to top $3.5 billion over the next decade. 'This isn’t the way the U.S. had hoped to participate in the summit,' said Margaret Myers, the director of the China and Latin America program at the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington policy group. 'All eyes are going to be on the port, what Xi says about it and how he articulates relations across the Pacific.' With the U.S. seemingly headed back toward isolationism under Trump, 'China will be seen as the alternative,' Myers added. Sitting 60 kilometers (37 miles) northeast of Lima, the Chancay megaport — once a serene fishing village — is perhaps the clearest sign of Latin America's reorientation. The Chinese shipping and logistics giant Cosco holds a 60% stake in the project it developed with Peruvian partner, Volcan. 'With this port, we’re looking at the entire Pacific coast, from the United States and Canada all the way to Chile,' Peruvian Foreign Minister Elmer Schialer told The Associated Press in his office on Monday. 'The shipping business is being transformed.' Peruvian Economy Minister José Arista said in June during a visit to China that the country’s neighbors — Brazil, Colombia, Chile — are 'making constant trips to and from to see how they can modify their supply chain to use this port,' which will cut shipping time to Beijing by 10 days. China’s trade with the region ballooned 35-fold from 2000 to 2022, reaching nearly $500 billion, according to data from the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean. Most of the region's exports came from South America, and were concentrated in five products: soybeans, copper and iron ore, oil and copper cathodes. At the same time, China’s diplomatic engagement in the region has become more effective, with Xi visiting 11 Latin American countries since becoming president, according to Xinhua, China’s main state news agency. Brazil, host of the G20 summit, and Peru will bestow the rare honor of a full state visit to Xi this month, but not to Biden. The misguided notion that Latin America must choose between its two largest trading partners is 'a strategic defeat' for the U.S., said Eric Farnsworth, vice president at the Washington-based Council of the Americas. 'The idea that China is somehow a better partner is increasingly being heard around the region and I think Xi wants to solidify that and amplify that,' Farnsworth said. Roughly a decade after China poured billions of dollars into building power plants, roads, airports and other infrastructure that saddled some developing countries with unserviceable debt, few expect Beijing to direct more massive loans to Latin America through its Belt and Road Initiative. But deeper cooperation on other infrastructure is possible, particularly renewable energy and telecommunications, said the Boston University bulletin. The U.S. has appealed to Latin American governments to reject telecoms investment, particularly opposing Huawei, the Chinese tech giant that it argues could open the door to Chinese government spying. Similarly, U.S. officials have raised concerns over the Chancay port’s possible dual-use by Beijing’s navy in the Pacific — a prospect dismissed by Chinese officials. China 'is working to exploit insecurity in our hemisphere,' said U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin at the Southern Command headquarters in Florida this week, adding that the Asian giant is leveraging the need for investment in the Americas to advance its 'malign agenda.' Despite its objections to Chinese influence, the U.S. hasn’t shown the ability or willingness to build infrastructure like Chancay's megaport, experts note. Even when the U.S. government has worked to ensure competitive bidding in Latin American massive public works projects, American companies have refrained from participating, said Benjamin Gedan, director of the Wilson Center’s Latin America Program. A Kamala Harris administration wouldn’t have changed that, but a Democratic victory would have enabled Biden to speak in Lima with authority about U.S. collaboration to come, such as building regional supply chains, Gedan said. In sharp contrast to Biden’s alliance-building approach, Trump has vowed to protect American interests and promised more of the same unilateralist action the world saw in his first term, when he staked out a combative stance against foreign competitors and deepened the U.S. trade war with China. In 2022, Biden launched the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework to help integrate economies of the region and enable the U.S. to counterbalance China. But last year, on the campaign trail, Trump said he would kill the trade pact if he were to win the 2024 election and return to the White House — in the same way he pulled the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership immediately after taking office in 2017. In the years since, U.S. clout in South America has diminished while China’s has grown, said Farnsworth, recalling how the last time Lima hosted APEC in 2016, the shock of Trump’s victory sucked the energy out of then-President Barack Obama’s delegation. Peru’s top diplomat insists that the U.S. hasn’t ceded its dominant voice guiding discussions about trade at gatherings such as APEC — and doubted that it will, even under Trump. 'I’m not sure that Trump will go against these types of multilateral contexts just because he is worried about the American people,' Schialer said. 'He knows that the U.S. is too important for the world. We have to sit down and have a nice dialogue and see how we can face these challenges together.' Yet, in the wake of Trump’s win and China’s port opening in Peru, analysts expect the hard-nosed competition between the U.S. and China to overshadow APEC this week. 'The Chinese love the idea of outmaneuvering the U.S. in its near-abroad,' Gedan said. 'Xi will luxuriate in this dynamic of being able to arrive with a big delegation, (...) to inaugurate this transformational port and suck all the air out of the room when his American counterpart is very weak politically. That is significant to China.' ___ Associated Press writer Franklin Briceño contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/biden-xi-usa-china-apec-peru-504111bb2837ceae5fba1543a70d48c4	2024-11-12T19:20:48-08:00	
Stock market today: Asian stocks dip as Wall Street momentum slows with cooling Trump trade	HONG KONG (AP) — Asian stocks on Wednesday followed Wall Street lower as momentum cooled for the torrid 'Trump trade' that swept U.S. markets following Donald Trump’s presidential victory. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 slipped 1.1% in morning trading to 38,953.44, as wholesale inflation reached its highest level since July of last year. The corporate goods price index, which measures the price changes of goods traded in the corporate sector, rose 3.4% in October year-over-year, according to Bank of Japan data. The increase was partly attributed to the decline of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar. South Korea’s Kospi lost 1.5% to 2,445.90. Samsung Electronics shares fell by 2.1% in Wednesday trading, reaching their lowest level in over four years. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dropped for a fourth day, declining 0.5% to 19,754.92. The Shanghai Composite gained 0.2% to 3,426.98. Australia’s S&amp;P/ASX 200 fell nearly 1.0% to 8,178.00. U.S. futures dropped while oil prices were higher. On Tuesday, the S&amp;P 500 slipped 0.3% to 5,983.99, a day after setting its latest all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.9% to 43,910.98, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.1% to 19,281.40. Stocks had been broadly rising since last week on expectations that Trump’s preference for lower tax rates and other policies may mean faster economic growth, as well as bigger U.S. government debt and higher inflation. Some areas of the market rocketed on particularly high-grade fuel, such as smaller U.S. stocks seen as benefiting the most from Trump’s 'America First' ideas. They gave back some of their big gains Tuesday, and the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell a market-leading 1.8%. Even Tesla, which is run by Trump’s ally Elon Musk, sank. It dropped 6.1% for its first loss since before Election Day. A jump in Treasury yields also added pressure on the stock market, as trading of U.S. government bonds resumed following Monday’s Veterans Day holiday. The yield on the 10-year Treasury jumped to 4.42% on Tuesday from 4.31% late Friday, which is a notable move for the bond market. Treasury yields have been climbing sharply since September, in large part because the U.S. economy has remained much more resilient than feared. The hope is that it can continue to stay solid as the Federal Reserve continues to cut interest rates in order to keep the job market humming, now that it’s helped get inflation nearly down to its 2% target. Some of the rise in yields has also been because of Trump. He talks up tariffs and other policies that economists say could drive inflation and the U.S. government’s debt higher. That puts upward pressure on Treasury yields and could hinder the Fed’s plans to cut interest rates. While lower rates can boost the economy, they can also give inflation more fuel. The next update on inflation will arrive Wednesday, when the U.S. government will give the latest reading on prices that U.S. consumers are paying across the country. Economists expect it to show inflation accelerated to 2.6% in October from 2.4% the month before. But they’re also looking for underlying inflation trends, which ignore prices for groceries and fuel that can zigzag sharply from one month to another, to stay steady at 3.3%. In the crypto market, bitcoin soared to another record before pulling back. Trump has embraced cryptocurrencies generally and pledged to make his country the crypto capital of the world. Bitcoin got as high as $89,995, according to CoinDesk, before dipping back toward $89,500. It started the year below $43,000. In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude gained 26 cents to $68.38 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 31 cents to $72.20 a barrel. In currency trading, the U.S. dollar edged up to 154.75 Japanese yen from 154.51 yen. The euro cost $1.0623, down from $1.0625. ___ AP Business Writer Stan Choe contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/stock-market-inflation-trump-bitcoin-china-394a0f6b3c08e07d014590e4835372f1	2024-11-12T19:10:13-08:00	
Welcome to China’s underground raves, from street techno to quotes from Chairman Mao	CHANGCHUN, China (AP) — Crouch through the small metal door and walk down the dark tunnel, and even before you step into the abandoned air raid shelter, the air reverberates with pounding techno beats. Young Chinese holding booze and cigarettes shake and sway in a red-lit passageway, below a big screen rolling through quotations from Chairman Mao. This is an underground rave in China, part of a subculture growing in hidden corners of the nation’s cities, even as its political and cultural mainstream grow increasingly controlled, staid and predictable. For Chinese ravers, these gatherings — often called 'ye di,' or 'wild dances' — not only offer a rare space for unfettered fun, but signal resistance to the narrowly prescribed future a rigid society expects for them. By day, Xing Long works in the office of a state-owned company in Changchun, an industrial city in China's northeastern rust belt region. By night, he’s a DJ and underground rave organizer, a side gig that offers an escape from the humdrum of reviewing corporate contracts. 'My job cannot make me feel I fulfilled my values,' he said. 'Going to work is like executing a prewritten program.' Chinese young people face intense pressure and high expectations from the society around them. In recent years, facing bleak economic prospects, Chinese youth culture has been swept by a series of viral slang terms to describe frustration and hopelessness: ' 996 ' — the brutal 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week work schedule many companies ask of employees. 'Involution' — an endless treadmill of pointless competition that fresh graduates face. ' Lying flat ' — the growing trend among young people of giving up all ambition and aiming to do as little as possible. Techno dance parties are an escape from all that for people like Xing. Every time he walks into a rave, the 31-year-old said, his brain 'jolts awake like a bang.' Xing first learned about techno music from a documentary made by the American media company Vice. 'My eyes brightened up when I heard it,' he said. 'I should’ve listened to this kind of music earlier.' Xing began going to raves in Shenzhen, a southern city with a population of 17 million, but when he moved home in 2021 he realized no one else was organizing them. 'I want this city to have an underground techno music scene,' he said. 'I want to listen to it myself, so I want to make it happen.' Xing said that the underground techno scene fascinated him because it's 'real' even if not perfect, bad, not in the right order, or broken. 'It’s not a beautiful thing that was deliberately produced into a mold to present to the mainstream.' In recent years, space for culture and creativity has been shrinking in China as the authorities have ramped up censorship of concerts, shows, and other cultural events. Comedians have been silenced after joking about topics considered politically sensitive. A growing number of independent bookstores and creative spaces have shut down under pressure, while state-sanctioned media promotes uplifting, often saccharine narratives. Yet underground raves are free from all those limitations because they sprout in gray zones. Hidden from public view, they skirt formal approval processes, neither supported nor suppressed by the state. Feng Zhe, 27, a rave organizer in Shenyang, a northeastern city about 400 miles from Beijing, said raves are about 'refusing to be disciplined by society.' 'This is probably not how the world functions nowadays,' he said, adding that societies want to make people follow their rules and be useful but 'underground culture is useless.' 'Most people are going to be repressed,' Feng said. But for most rave organizers, the real meaning of underground rave culture is simply having fun. Loong Wu, a 26-year-old art student, started organizing raves in 2021 during COVID-19 lockdowns out of boredom. 'My original intention was just to break through the boredom,' she said. 'When you are truly enjoying it, you don’t think about meanings.' On one recent Saturday night, civil servants, students, an ex-firefighter, girls with dyed hair, and a man with a full face mask and goggles filed into a bar tucked behind a flower shop in downtown Changchun to attend one of Xing’s raves. They danced to fast-paced industrial techno spun by Du Jizhe, a local part-time DJ who works in HR by day. He said it’s the natural soundtrack of auto manufacturing cities like Changchun and Detroit, which prides itself on being the birthplace of techno. For Du, techno evokes childhood memories of the auto factory where his father worked. 'Techno is basically industrial noise like hammering and mechanical sounds,' Du said 'These noises exert a subtle influence on people’s ears in industrial cities.' Chen Xiangyu, a fashion student in an oversized black t-shirt with hair dyed blond, a black leather choker, a lip piercing, and smoky eye makeup, said raves are a pure release. 'The first time I came, I thought to myself, I don’t know anyone, no one knows me, so nobody’s paying any attention to how I dance, so long as I’m happy, it’s all good,' she said. 'I shouldn’t care too much about what others think.' Even at raves, illegal drugs are rarely seen in China, but promoters still face risks from authorities who have little patience for unapproved social gatherings. Advertisements promoting raves are often cryptic, with only a date, a DJ line-up, and the cost of admission. Sometimes, the location won’t be revealed until an hour ahead of the party. Some organizers require guests to cover their phone’s camera with a sticker. Loong Wu said her requirements for a rave spot were no CCTV cameras, no security, and no nearby residents. Even those aren't a guarantee — local police once busted one of her raves in an industrial port. 'It was pathetic how few such places exist in the city,' she said. Frustrated with how hard to find a good rave spot, she once organized a public party where she put her DJ equipment on a cart and pushed it through city streets as revelers danced alongside. 'Restrictions exist for sure, but that’s exactly why we need to create our own scene,' she said. 'We always need ‘wild dances.’ We always need to dance outside of set rules.' ___ Chen reported from Washington.	https://apnews.com/article/china-raves-techno-changchun-youth-culture-2edde8f402a604e3671900c5109b6fcd	2024-11-12T17:15:14-08:00	
British writer Samantha Harvey’s space-station novel 'Orbital' wins the Booker Prize for fiction	LONDON (AP) — British writer Samantha Harvey won the Booker Prize for fiction on Tuesday with 'Orbital,' a short, wonder-filled novel set aboard the International Space Station that ponders the beauty and fragility of Earth. Harvey was awarded the 50,000-pound ($64,000) prize for what she has called a 'space pastoral' about six orbiting astronauts, which she began writing during COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns. The confined characters loop through 16 sunrises and 16 sunsets over the course of a day, trapped in one another’s company and transfixed by the globe’s ever-changing vistas. 'To look at the Earth from space is like a child looking into a mirror and realizing for the first time that the person in the mirror is herself,' said Harvey, who researched her novel by reading books by astronauts and watching the space station's live camera. 'What we do to the Earth we do to ourselves.' She said the novel 'is not exactly about climate change, but implied in the view of the Earth is the fact of human-made climate change.' She dedicated the prize to everyone who speaks 'for and not against the Earth, for and not against the dignity of other humans, other life.' 'All the people who speak for and call for and work for peace — this is for you,' she said. Writer and artist Edmund de Waal, who chaired the five-member judging panel, called 'Orbital' a 'miraculous novel' that 'makes our world strange and new for us.' Gaby Wood, chief executive of the Booker Prize Foundation, noted that 'in a year of geopolitical crisis, likely to be the warmest year in recorded history,' the winning book was 'hopeful, timely and timeless.' Harvey, who has written four previous novels and a memoir about insomnia, is the first British writer since 2020 to win the Booker. The prize is open to English-language writers of any nationality and has a reputation for transforming writers’ careers. Previous winners include Ian McEwan, Margaret Atwood, Salman Rushdie and Hilary Mantel. De Waal praised the 'crystalline' writing and 'capaciousness' of Harvey’s succinct novel — at 136 pages in its U.K. paperback edition, one of the shortest-ever Booker winners. 'This is a book that repays slow reading,' he said. He said the judges spent a full day picking their winner and came to a unanimous conclusion. Harvey beat five other finalists from Canada, the United States, Australia and the Netherlands, chosen from among 156 novels submitted by publishers. American writer Percival Everett had been the bookies’ favorite to win with 'James,' which reimagines Mark Twain’s 'Huckleberry Finn' from the point of view of its main Black character, the enslaved man Jim. The other finalists were American writer Rachel Kushner’s spy story 'Creation Lake'; Canadian Anne Michaels’ poetic novel 'Held'; Charlotte Wood’s Australian saga 'Stone Yard Devotional'; and 'The Safekeep' by Yael van der Wouden, the first Dutch author to be shortlisted for the Booker. Harvey is the first female Booker winner since 2019, though one of five women on this year’s shortlist, the largest number in the prize’s 55-year history. De Waal said issues such as the gender or nationality of the authors were 'background noise' that did not influence the judges. 'There was absolutely no question of box ticking or of agendas or of anything else. It was simply about the novel,' he said before the awards ceremony at Old Billingsgate, a grand former Victorian fish market in central London. Founded in 1969, the Booker Prize is open to novels originally written in English published in the U.K. or Ireland. Last year’s winner was Irish writer Paul Lynch for post-democratic dystopia 'Prophet Song.' Lynch handed Harvey her Booker trophy at the ceremony, warning her that her life was about to change dramatically because of the Booker publicity boost. Harvey said she was 'overwhelmed,' but remained down-to-earth about spending her prize money. She said she'd disburse 'some of it on tax. I want to buy a new bike. And then the rest — I want to go to Japan.'	https://apnews.com/article/britain-booker-prize-winner-7d2de84490e136f62295dd89f2344240	2024-11-12T12:56:03-08:00	
Why is only limited aid getting to Palestinians inside Gaza?	JERUSALEM (AP) — The threatened U.S. deadline for Israel to allow more aid for people into the Gaza Strip or see fewer weapons shipments for its war with Hamasexpired on Tuesday but the Biden administration said it would not limit arms transfers. Because of Israeli border controls, the amount of food and other aid getting in is at its lowest level this year. Food security experts and rights groups caution that famine may already be underway in north Gaza. Almost the entire population of around 2.3 million Palestinians is relying on international aid for survival as Israel and Hamas wage their nearly 13-month-old war. 'I witnessed during my visit to Gaza last week the deliberate starvation of almost 2 million civilians, whilst the bombardment continues,' said Jan Egeland, secretary-general of the Norwegian Refugee Council, a major relief provider. 'There is barely any aid crossing into Gaza.' Israel, which controls all crossings into Gaza, says it is committed to delivering humanitarian assistance and has scrambled to ramp up aid. It says the U.N. and international aid groups need to do a better job of distributing supplies, and criminal gangs are stealing aid before it gets to civilians. The State Department spokesman Vedant Patel said that the progress to date must be supplemented and sustained but that 'we at this time have not made an assessment that the Israelis are in violation of U.S. law' requiring recipients of military assistance to adhere to international humanitarian law and not impede the provision of such aid. 'We are not giving Israel a pass,' Patel said, adding that 'we want to see the totality of the humanitarian situation improve.' Where do aid levels stand? Aid into Gaza is typically measured in terms of truckloads of food and supplies entering the territory. The U.S. has demanded 350 trucks daily. Israeli government figures show roughly 57 trucks a day entering on average in Oct and 75 a day in November. The U.N. counts trucks differently and says it has only received 39 trucks daily since the beginning of October. In northern Gaza, where the Israeli military has been carrying out a major offensive over the past month, the figures were even lower. No aid entered the northernmost areas of Gaza – Jabaliya, Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun – in October, the U.N. says. Israel says it closed all the Gaza crossings for the Jewish high holidays in October and couldn’t send aid to the north because of the offensive against Hamas fighters. Over the last two days, the military body handling aid deliveries to Gaza — COGAT — says it has allowed aid trucks to enter the hardest-hit northern areas. But only three of the trucks have made it to their destination successfully, according to the World Food Program. Denial of passage and entry Aid groups accuse the Israeli army of blocking aid-packed trucks from reaching areas where the fighting is most intense, including northern Gaza, where hunger is most acute. 'There can be aid sitting at the border ready to come in. But if we are not provided a safe passage to go and collect it, it’s not possible for us to have it. And it will not reach the people who need it,' said Louise Wateridge, a spokesperson for UNRWA, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees. UNRWA has been the main agency procuring and distributing aid in Gaza and a feud between Israel and the agency lead Israel to ban it last month. During October, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said Israeli authorities rejected roughly 43% of all humanitarian movement requests, and impeded a further 16%. Israeli authorities have also prohibited some vehicles and goods from entering the enclave, aid groups say, often without reason. Rachel Morris, of the aid group Mercy Corps, said trucks carrying the group’s tent supplies have been turned away more than five times. Israel says it denies entry to supplies that could be weaponized by Hamas. Under intense international pressure, Israel has since taken measures to up aid delivery, with COGAT saying it was allowed trucks into the hard-hit north. On Monday, the Israeli security Cabinet approved increased aid for Gaza, which will increase the number of trucks that enter Gaza each day, according to an official familiar with the matter. But aid groups say access is still an issue. The World Food Program said vehicles filled with its supplies were denied access to Jabaliya, Beit Hanoun, and Beit Lahiya on Tuesday. The day before, the U.N. agency said it received approval from the army to deliver supplies to Beit Hanoun only to be stopped by troops on route in Jabaliya and ordered to offload the stockpile there. Lawlessness along aid routes Also stymying distribution is theft and criminality along aid routes. Israel accuses UNRWA of failing to pick up hundreds of trucks worth of supplies piling up at the territory’s main southern aid crossing. It says the aid has been waiting there for months. But the military and aid agencies both acknowledge that aid deliveries are treacherous because family-based crime groups are robbing the trucks. An Israeli official, speaking on the condition of anonymity under military briefing guidelines, estimated 30% to 40% of aid supplies are stolen by members of criminal families. COGAT spokesperson Shani Sasson said the Israeli army has tried to secure part of the route and find alternate routes for drivers, but cannot accompany each aid truck and the criminal groups are always moving. Many aid groups that used to use the crossing now say it is too dangerous for their staff to collect aid. Aseel Baidoun, a senior manager at Medical Aid for Palestinians, said that drivers sometimes have to pay fees to move their aid from the crossing into Gaza. He said the Israeli military was 'failing to provide an enabling environment to bring in sufficient humanitarian goods to Gaza.' Aid groups also say their warehouses and workers have come under attack from Israeli forces. OCHA says that at least 326 aid workers have been killed since the start of the war. It is not clear how many have been killed while working. As the deadline passes, what does Israel say? The U.S. has not yet said how it will respond to the low aid levels. Last week, the State Department said Israel needs to do more. Israel’s new foreign minister, Gideon Saar, appeared to downplay Washington’s deadline, telling reporters on Monday that he was confident 'the issue would be solved.' The Israeli military announced on Tuesday that it would open a fifth crossing for humanitarian aid into Gaza, a key demand by the United States. But it remains unclear when the Kissufim crossing in central Gaza will be operational.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-gaza-aid-hamas-unrwa-biden-bcf8489c338a2f33cb4d6f0a4f7138b5	2024-11-12T10:25:00-08:00	
Who is Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby and why did he resign during an abuse scandal?	LONDON (AP) — Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, the head of the Church of England and spiritual leader of the worldwide Anglican Communion, resigned Tuesday amid the fallout from a long-running sexual abuse scandal. Welby stepped down after an independent investigation found that he had failed to inform police about serial physical and sexual abuse by a volunteer at Christian summer camps as soon as he became aware of it. Here are the answers to some questions about the Church of England, Welby’s decision and its global significance. What is the Church of England? The Church of England, also known as the Anglican Church, is a Christian denomination and the official church of England. It was created in the 16th century when the English church broke away from the Roman Catholic Church. The church is part of the global Anglican Communion, a family of churches that has over 85 million members in more than 165 countries. Britain’s monarch is the supreme governor of the Church of England and has the power to appoint bishops and other church leaders. What is the Archbishop of Canterbury? The Archbishop of Canterbury is the head of the Church of England and is traditionally seen as the spiritual leader of the Anglican Communion. Each of the 46 churches that comprise the Anglican Communion has its own primate, but the Archbishop of Canterbury is considered first among equals. Who is Justin Welby? Justin Welby, 68, was the 105th Archbishop of Canterbury. He worked in the oil industry for 11 years before he left in 1989 to study for the priesthood. Welby was ordained in 1992 and worked extensively in Africa and the Middle East before he became Archbishop of Canterbury in 2013. Though a skilled mediator — who has worked to resolve conflicts in Nigeria and elsewhere in Africa — he struggled to unite the global Anglican Communion. What are the splits in the Anglican Communion? Like many Christian denominations, the Anglicans are split by disagreements over the church’s teachings about homosexuality and the role of women. While churches in England and America have become more welcoming to the LGBT community and moved to ordain women priests and bishops, some more conservative churches in Africa and Asia have resisted those changes. Those divisions have weakened the Archbishop of Canterbury’s influence in the Anglican Communion. Why did Welby resign? An independent investigation last week released its long-awaited report into the late John Smyth, who sexually, psychologically and physically abused more than 100 boys and young men at Christian summer camps in the United Kingdom, Zimbabwe and South Africa over five decades. The 251-page report concluded that Welby failed to report Smyth to authorities when he was informed of the abuse in August 2013, soon after he became Archbishop of Canterbury. Had he done so, Smyth could have been stopped sooner and many of his victims wouldn’t have been abused, the report found. Welby initially refused to resign, saying he was wrongly informed that police had already been notified and he shouldn’t do anything to interfere with their investigation. But his position became untenable after a growing number of church leaders and victims criticized him for failing to take responsibility for the scandal. 'It is very clear that I must take personal and institutional responsibility for the long and retraumatizing period between 2013 and 2024,' Welby said, announcing his resignation. Has the church faced other abuse allegations? Yes. Like the Catholic Church, the Church of England has faced a long series of allegations that priests and others affiliated with the church used their positions to abuse young men and women. An independent inquiry established by the government found that 390 people associated with the church were convicted of child sexual abuse between the 1940s and 2018. Deference to the authority of priests, taboos surrounding the discussion of sexuality and a culture that gave more support to alleged perpetrators than their victims helped make the Church of England 'a place where abusers could hide,' the inquiry found. Welby’s supporters said he was instrumental in changing the culture of the church and improving its safeguarding procedures after he became Archbishop of Canterbury in 2013. What happens next? The process of selecting Welby’s successor will begin with the Crown Nominations Commission, which nominates candidates for Archbishop of Canterbury and other bishoprics in England. The commission will send the name of a preferred candidate and an alternate to Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who will then advise King Charles III on his selection. The commission has 16 members, including the Archbishop of York, representatives of the clergy and laypeople, a representative of the Anglican Communion and a chair appointed by the prime minister.	https://apnews.com/article/church-of-england-abuse-justin-welby-resigns-2a34fc8107f7f1dc5b562c41f3b8b704	2024-11-12T09:51:59-08:00	
Imprisoned Belarus activist resurfaces after no contact with her family for 20 months	TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — Imprisoned Belarusian opposition activist Maria Kolesnikova has resurfaced after more than 20 months without any communication with relatives or friends and met with her father, a human rights group said Tuesday. Kolesnikova, one of the most popular and charismatic figures who helped lead protests of Belarus’ authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko, was last heard from in February 2023. The 42-year-old musician-turned activist, who suffered a serious illness and underwent surgery while in prison, has been serving her 11-year sentence at a facility near Gomel. Viasna, Belarus’ leading rights group, said Kolesnikova met her father, Alexander Kolesnikov, at a prison hospital. Raman Pratasevich, a former opposition journalist who later became a government supporter after he was arrested, on Tuesday released photos of smiling Kolesnikova embracing her father, who previously had been denied permission to see her. He said the meeting took place Tuesday, but it was not immediately possible to verify the photos or when they might have been taken. Kolesnikova gained prominence when mass protests erupted in Belarus after the widely disputed August 2020 election gave Lukashenko a sixth term in office. With her close-cropped hair, broad smile and trademark gesture of forming her outstretched hands into the shape of a heart, she often was seen at the front of the demonstrations. She became an even greater symbol of resistance the next month when Belarusian authorities tried to deport her. Driven to the Ukrainian border, she briefly broke away from security forces in the neutral zone at the frontier and tore up her passport, then walked back into Belarus. She was convicted a year later of charges including conspiracy to seize power. In November 2022, Kolesnikova was moved to an intensive care ward to undergo surgery for a perforated ulcer. Former inmates told her sister, Tatiana Khomich, that the 5-foot-9-inch Kolesnikova weighed only about 45 kilograms (100 pounds). Kolesnikova, who before the 2020 protests was a classical flautist, is one of several major Lukashenko opponents to disappear behind bars. Viasna counts about 1,300 political prisoners in Belarus, including the group’s Nobel Peace Prize-winning founder, Ales Bialiatsky. At least seven have died behind bars. The U.N. Human Rights Committee has repeatedly demanded Belarusian authorities take 'urgent protective measures' in relation to Kolesnikova and other political prisoners held incommunicado. In September, the European Parliament demanded that Belarus release all political prisoners. Lukashenko, who is seeking a seventh term in an election set for January 2025, has released 146 political prisoners since July. Those freed had health problems, wrote petitions for pardons and repented. At the same time, Belarusian authorities have launched a new wave of arrests, seeking to uproot any sign of dissent before the election. Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, the Belarusian opposition-leader-in-exile, told The Associated Press that she was happy that Kolesnikova was allowed to see her father and reaffirmed a demand that she and other political prisoners be released. 'We must to keep pressing for an end to the isolation of other political prisoners and their release,' said Tsikhanouskaya, whose husband, Siarhei Tsikhanouski, is serving a 19 1/2-year prison sentence and has been held incommunicado for more than 20 months. Pavel Sapelka of Viasna said allowing Kolesnikova to see her father could be a signal from Lukashenko that he's 'ready to start a conversation about the fate of other political prisoners.' 'Lukashenko is waiting for Western reaction to the latest steps and is prepared to bargain ahead of January's election,' Sapelka said.	https://apnews.com/article/belarus-crackdown-opposition-kolesnikova-lukashenko-prison-3665c76cdbe65769e747577a8ec5b6ce	2024-11-12T09:47:42-08:00	
French farmers protest EU-Mercosur deal that will increase South American imports	PARIS (AP) — French farmers protested Tuesday against a trade deal that would increase agricultural imports from South America, saying it hurt their livelihoods. The European Union and the Mercosur trade bloc, composed of Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and Bolivia, reached an initial agreement in 2019, but negotiations stumbled due to opposition from farmers, and some European governments, leading to sweeping rallies where they particularly expressed worry about the use of pesticides in South American produce. Tuesday's protest in Aurillac, in southern France, was the start of a fresh wave expected to spread among the European agricultural community amid concern that the deal could be finalized at the G20 summit in Brazil on Nov. 18-19 despite the French minister of agriculture, Annie Genevard, saying it was 'highly unlikely.' A group of more than 600 French lawmakers also published an open letter in Le Monde, telling the EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen that the conditions for adopting an agreement with the Mercosur bloc 'have not been met.' Last week, French protesters blocked the state building in the western commune of Niort, while on Monday, the Copa-Cogeca European farmers’ group sent a letter to von der Leyen, urging her to reject the Mercosur deal and adopt 'a coherent trade policy' Meanwhile, France's three biggest farming unions have vowed action: The FNSEA, France’s largest, has called for nationwide protests once the winter sowing season ends in mid-November. Coordination Rurale has promised 'an agricultural revolt' starting on Nov. 19 in Auch and Agen, two cities in the Southwest of France, while the Confédération Paysanne, the third-largest union, known for its anti-globalization stance, is also planning its move against 'free trade agreements.' Farmers in Belgium have also called for demonstrations close to the EU headquarters in Brussels on Wednesday. European farmers' apprehensions stem from what they say are the too-strict EU environmental regulations they follow while the Mercosur deal could flood the market with imports from South America which are produced under lower environmental and labor standards, according to Véronique Le Floc’h, the president of Coordination Rurale, France’s second-largest farmers’ union. 'The anger hasn’t gone away. It’s still there, and, in fact, our worries have grown,' said Le Floc'h whose organization has been linked to France's far-right party National Rally. 'If the Mercosur agreement is signed, it will spell the end of our agriculture,' she said. Genevard, the agriculture minister, reiterated the government’s opposition to the deal on Tuesday. In an interview with TF1, she said: 'We don’t want this agreement because it’s harmful. It will bring in products, including substances banned in Europe, at the cost of deforestation. It will unfairly compete with our domestic production.' But Le Floc’h was not convinced. 'When the minister says the agreement won’t be signed, she’s either naive or thinks we are,' she said. 'Why should we believe her when so many countries are in favor of it?' In March, French President Emmanuel Macron called the deal 'terrible' and 'outdated.' Negotiations began on June 28, 1999, but have taken a long, torturous path since. Macron opposes any agreement as long as South American producers fail to adhere to the same environmental and health standards as Europeans.	https://apnews.com/article/france-farmers-protest-eu-mercosur-c3e28b8005655b3fedf2a4ed68529ea4	2024-11-12T08:53:05-08:00

Proposed assisted dying bill for England and Wales rekindles debate over choice and ethics	LONDON (AP) — Details of a proposed law to legalize assisted dying in England and Wales have been published, rekindling debate on the controversial topic ahead of a vote in Parliament later this month. The draft bill, published Monday, proposes allowing terminally ill adults expected to have less than six months to live to ask for and be provided with help to end their own life, subject to safeguards and protections. Opponents have voiced concerns that the bill would mean people could become pressured to end their lives. But Labour lawmaker Kim Leadbeater, who proposed the bill, said the law has robust safeguards built into it and contains 'three layers of scrutiny' — two doctors and a High Court judge will have to sign off on any decision. A debate and first vote on the bill is expected to take place on Nov. 29. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Tuesday he will study the details of the bill and 'will not be putting pressure on any MP (Member of Parliament) to vote one way or the other.' Here's a look at what's in the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill and the next steps: What does the bill propose? Under the draft legislation, only those over 18-years-old in England and Wales and who are expected to die within six months can request assisted dying. They must have the mental capacity to make a choice about the end of their life and will be required to make two separate declarations about their wish to die. Two independent doctors have to be satisfied the person is eligible and a High Court judge will need to approve the decision. Anyone found guilty of pressuring, coercing or dishonestly getting someone to make a declaration that they wish to die will face up to 14 years in prison. Assisted suicide is currently banned in most parts of the U.K. It is not a specific criminal offense in Scotland, but assisting the death of someone can result in a criminal charge. Who will administer the medication? The patient must self-administer the life-ending medication themselves. No doctor or anyone else can give the medication. No health professional is under any obligation to provide assistance to the patient. Doctors who do take part would have to be satisfied the person making their declaration to die has made it voluntarily. They also must ensure the person is making an informed choice. What happens next? The bill will be debated in Parliament and lawmakers will be able to vote on it according to their conscience, rather than along party lines. Opinion among lawmakers appears to be divided, though some senior ministers including Health Secretary Wes Streeting has said he intended to vote against the bill. Starmer has previously supported assisted dying, but the government says it will remain neutral on the issue. If the bill passes the first stage in the House of Commons, it will face further scrutiny and votes in both Houses of Parliament. Leadbeater suggested that any new law is unlikely to come into effect within the next two to three years. Do other countries have similar laws? One argument supporting the bill is that wealthy individuals can travel to Switzerland, which allows foreigners to go there to legally end their lives, while others have to face possible prosecution for helping their loves ones to die. Other countries that have legalized assisted suicide include Australia, Belgium, Canada and parts of the United States, with regulations on who is eligible varying by jurisdiction. Assisted suicide is different to euthanasia, allowed in the Netherlands and Canada, which involves healthcare practitioners killing patients with a lethal injection at their request and in specific circumstances.	https://apnews.com/article/uk-assisted-dying-bill-contents-d11dab69f5d79ba516946afb30aee925	2024-11-12T08:19:01-08:00	
FAA prohibits US airlines from flying to Haiti and UN suspends flights after plane was shot by gangs	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — The Federal Aviation Administration announced Tuesday that it will prohibit U.S. airlines from flying to Haiti for 30 days after gangs shot a Spirit Airlines flight and the United Nations said it will suspend flights, 'obviously limiting the flow of humanitarian aid and humanitarian personnel into the country.' The bullets hit the plane when it was about to land Monday in the country’s capital Port-au-Prince, injuring a flight attendant. It was part of a wave of violence that erupted in Haiti as the country swore in its new prime minister after a politically tumultuous process. Life in much of Haiti’s capital was frozen after the wave of violence, which came to a head when gangs shot a Spirit Airlines airplane Monday, forcing the airport to shut down. Photos and videos obtained by The Associated Press show bullet holes dotting the interior of a plane. A number of airlines suspended flights to Haiti through Thursday, but it was unclear how long closures could drag on. Neither the former interim prime minister, Garry Conille, nor the newly inaugurated Alix Didier Fils-Aimé commented on the violence. But Luis Abinader, who as president of the neighboring Dominican Republic has cracked down on Haitian migration, called firing on the airplane terrorism. 'This was a terrorist act; the countries that are following and helping Haiti should declare these armed gangs as terrorist groups,' Abinader said in a news conference. On Tuesday, heavily armed police in armored cars outside the airport checked trucks used for public transportation passing by. Schools were closed, as were banks and government offices. Streets, where just a day before gangs and police were locked in a fierce firefight, were eerily empty, with few driving by other than a motorcycle with a man who had been shot clinging to the back. The sounds of heavy gunfire still echoed through the streets in the afternoon — a reminder that despite political maneuvering by Haiti's elites and a strong push by the international community to restore peace, the country's toxic slate of gangs kept its firm hold on much of the Caribbean nation. The United Nations estimates that gangs control 85% of the capital, Port-au-Prince. A U.N.-backed mission led by Kenyan police to quell gang violence struggles with a lack of funding and personnel, prompting calls for a U.N. peacekeeping mission. The violence comes after a transitional council, tasked with restoring democratic order to Haiti, which hasn't held elections since 2016, decided to fire Conille, who often was at odds with the council during his six months in office. The council rapidly swore in businessman Fils-Aimé as the new interim prime minister. Conille originally called the move illegal, but on Tuesday acknowledged Fils-Aimé's appointment in a post on the social media platform X. '(I) wish him success in fulfilling this mission. At this crucial moment, unity and solidarity are essential for our country. Long live Haiti!' he wrote. Fils-Aimé promised to work with international partners to restore peace and hold long awaited elections, a vow also made by his predecessor. But many Haitians, like 43-year-old Martha Jean-Pierre, have little taste for the political fighting, which experts say only give gangs more freedom to continue expanding their control as Haiti teeters on the brink of famine. Jean-Pierre was among those to brave the streets of Port-au-Prince on Tuesday to sell the plantains, carrots, cabbage and potatoes she carried in a basket on her head. She had no choice, she said — selling was the only way she could feed her children. 'What good is a new prime minister if there's no security, if I can't move freely and sell my goods,' she said, nodding to her basket of vegetables. 'This is my bank account, this is what my family depend on.' It was a frustration that appeared to be international players that have pushed for a peaceful resolution in Haiti like the U.N. and the U.S. On Tuesday, the U.S. State Department lamented that Conille and the council 'were unable to move forward in a constructive manner' and called on Fils-Aimé and the council to provide a clear action plan outlining a joint vision on how to decrease violence and pave the path for elections to be held to 'prevent further gridlock.' 'The acute and immediate needs of the Haitian people mandate that the transitional government prioritize governance over the competing personal interests of political actors,' it wrote in a statement. ___ Associated Press video journalist Pierre-Richard Luxama contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/haiti-violence-gangs-airport-90dc8d26bc58eb9b214385ac10f315a2	2024-11-12T06:26:27-08:00	
UN force says Israeli work on Syrian frontier saw 'severe violations' of cease-fire after AP report	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — United Nations peacekeepers warned Tuesday that the Israeli military has committed 'severe violations' of a cease-fire deal with Syria as its military continues a major construction project along the so-called Alpha Line that separates the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights from Syria. The comments from the U.N. Disengagement Observer Force, which has patrolled the area since 1974, come after an Associated Press report Monday that published satellite imagery showing the extent of the works along the frontier. The work, which UNDOF said began in July, follows the completion by the Israeli military of new roadways and what appears to be a buffer zone along the Gaza Strip’s frontier with Israel. The Israel military also has begun demolishing villages in Lebanon, where other U.N. peacekeepers have come under fire. While such violence hasn't broken out along the Alpha Line, UNDOF warned the work risked further inflaming tensions in the region. 'Such severe violations of the (demilitarized zone) have the potential to increase tensions in the area and is being closely monitored by UNDOF,' it added. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Syrian officials have declined to comment on the construction, though UNDOF described Syria as having 'strongly protested' the work. High-resolution images taken on Nov. 5 by Planet Labs PBC for the AP show over 7.5 kilometers (4.6 miles) of construction along the Alpha Line, starting some 3 kilometers (1.8 miles) southeast of the Israeli-held Druze town of Majdal Shams. That's the town where a July rocket strike killed 12 children playing soccer. The images appear to show a trench between two embankments, parts of which appear to have been laid with fresh asphalt. There also appears to be fencing running along it as well toward the Syrian side. The construction follows a southeast route before heading due south along the Alpha Line, and then again cutting southeast. The images show excavators and other earth-moving equipment actively digging along the route, with more asphalt piled there. The area is also believed to be littered with unexploded ordnance and mines from decades of conflict. As Israel conducted the construction work, which UNDOF described as 'extensive engineering groundwork activities' and 'ditches,' it has protected earth-moving equipment with armored vehicles and main battle tanks, the peacekeepers said Tuesday. Troops and earth-moving equipment have crossed the Alpha Line into the demilitarized zone in Syria, known to UNDOF as the 'area of separation.' 'Violations of the 1974 Disengagement Agreement have occurred where engineering works have encroached into the AoS,' the peacekeepers said in a statement, using an acronym for the area. 'There have been several violations by (Israel) in the form of their presence in the AoS because of these activities.' UNDOF has repeatedly protested the work, which it described as violating the cease-fire deal over the months of construction so far. 'Based on the engagement, (Israel) has indicated that the current earthworks are being carried out for (a) defensive purpose to prevent unauthorized crossing and violations by civilians,' the peacekeepers added. Israel sent a 71-page letter in June to the U.N. outlining what it described as 'Syrian violations of the Alpha Line and armed presence in the area of separation (that) occur daily.' The letter cited numerous Israeli-alleged violations by Syrian civilians crossing the line. Syria has constantly accused Israel of launching attacks against it from territory it occupies in the Golan Heights. Israel has frequently struck Syria over the years, particularly after the start of the Mideast wars following Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, assault on Israel. Israel seized control of the Golan Heights from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war. The U.N. Secretary Council voted to create UNDOF to patrol a roughly 400-square-kilometer (155-square-mile) demilitarized zone and maintain the peace there after the 1973 Mideast war. A second demarcation, known as the Bravo Line, marks the limit of where the Syrian military can operate. The lines are delineated by barrels. UNDOF has around 1,100 troops, mostly from Fiji, India, Kazakhstan, Nepal and Uruguay, who patrol the area. Israel annexed the Golan Heights in 1981 — a move criticized by a U.N. resolution declaring Israel’s action as 'null and void and without international legal effect.' The territory, some 1,200 square kilometers (460 square miles) in size, is a strategic high ground that overlooks both Israel and Syria. Around 50,000 Jewish settlers and Arabs who are mostly members of the Druze sect of Shiite Islam live there. In 2019, President Donald Trump unilaterally announced that the United States would 'fully recognize' Israel’s control of the territory, a decision that has been unchanged by the Biden administration. However, it's the only other country to do so, as the rest of the world views it as occupied Syrian territory.	https://apnews.com/article/mideast-israel-syria-alpha-line-construction-77b11eb8e82e256eb7abae6678cae492	2024-11-12T05:27:08-08:00	
Church of England head Justin Welby resigns over handling of sex abuse scandal	LONDON (AP) — Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, head of the Church of England and spiritual leader of the global Anglican Communion, resigned Tuesday after an investigation found that he failed to tell police about serial physical and sexual abuse by a volunteer at Christian summer camps as soon as he became aware of it. Pressure on Welby had been building since Thursday, when the archbishop’s refusal to accept responsibility for his failure to report the abuse in England and in Africa in 2013 kindled anger about a lack of accountability at the highest reaches of the church. By Tuesday afternoon, Welby acknowledged that mistake. 'It is very clear that I must take personal and institutional responsibility for the long and retraumatizing period between 2013 and 2024,' Welby said in the statement announcing his resignation. 'I believe that stepping aside is in the best interests of the Church of England, which I dearly love and which I have been honored to serve.' Welby’s resignation will send ripples around the world. The Archbishop of Canterbury is the symbolic head of the Anglican Communion, which has more than 85 million members in 165 countries, including the Episcopal Church in the United States. While each national church has its own leaders, the Archbishop of Canterbury is considered first among equals. Welby, a former oil executive who left the industry in 1989 to study for the priesthood, was a controversial figure even before the scandal. A skilled mediator who has worked to resolve conflicts in Nigeria and elsewhere in Africa, he struggled to unite the Anglican Communion, which has been riven by sharply divergent views on issues such as gay rights and the place of women in the church. The Church of England on Thursday released the results of an independent investigation into the late John Smyth, a prominent attorney who the report said sexually, psychologically and physically abused about 30 boys and young men in the United Kingdom and 85 in Africa from the 1970s until his death in 2018. The 251-page report of the Makin Review concluded that Welby failed to report Smyth to authorities when he was informed of the abuse in August 2013, soon after he became Archbishop of Canterbury. Had he done so, Smyth could have been stopped sooner and many victims could have been spared the abuse, the inquiry found. Welby said he didn’t inform law enforcement agencies about the abuse because he was wrongly told that police were already investigating. Even so, he took responsibility for not ensuring that the allegations were pursued as 'energetically' as they should have been. As late as Monday, Welby’s office said he had decided not to resign, even as he expressed his 'horror at the scale of John Smyth’s egregious abuse.' Helen-Ann Hartley, the bishop of Newcastle, said Welby’s position had become 'untenable' after some members of the General Synod, the Church of England’s national assembly, started a petition calling on him to step down because he had 'lost the confidence of his clergy.' But the strongest outcry came from Smyth’s victims. Andrew Morse, who was repeatedly beaten by Smyth over five years, said resigning was a chance for Welby to start repairing the damage caused by the church’s broader handling of historical abuse cases. 'I believe that now is an opportunity for him to resign,’’ Morse told the BBC before Welby stepped down. Welby’s resignation comes against the backdrop of widespread historical sexual abuse in the Church of England. A 2022 report by the Independent Inquiry Child Sexual Abuse found that deference to the authority of priests, taboos surrounding the discussion of sexuality and a culture that gave more support to alleged perpetrators than their victims helped make the Church of England 'a place where abusers could hide.' Welby’s supporters had argued that he should remain on the job because of his role in changing the culture of the church. Church officials were first made aware of Smyth’s abuse in 1982, when they received the results of an internal investigation into complaints about his behavior at Christian summer camps in England. The recipients of that report 'participated in an active cover-up' to prevent its findings from coming to light, the Makin Review found. Smyth moved to Zimbabwe in 1984 and later relocated to South Africa. He abused boys and young men in Zimbabwe, and there is evidence that the abuse continued in South Africa until he died in August 2018, the investigation found. Smyth’s actions weren't made public until a 2017 investigation by Britain’s Channel 4 television station, which led police in Hampshire to start an investigation. Police were planning to question Smyth at the time of his death and had been preparing to extradite him. Stephen Cherry, dean of the chapel at King’s College Cambridge, said Welby could no longer represent the people. 'There are circumstances in which something happens whereby a person in a position of prominent leadership essentially loses the trust and the confidence and the capacity to do that really wonderful thing that someone like an archbishop does, which is represent everyone at a certain moment publicly,’’ Cherry told the BBC before Welby resigned. 'And the pain in the victim community and the history of not listening to people and not responding to people who are profoundly hurt by those in positions of power means that this is no longer a person who can carry the representative role of that office.' ___ Associated Press Writer Jill Lawless contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/justin-welby-resigns-archbishop-of-canterbury-abuse-2ab9cab63572f5062b5a5588698fe492	2024-11-12T05:13:38-08:00	
Doctor accused of criticizing Russia's war in Ukraine is convicted and given over 5 years in prison	TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — A doctor accused of criticizing the war in Ukraine in front of a patient was convicted Tuesday of spreading false information about the Russian military and sentenced to 5 1/2 years in prison, part of an unrelenting Kremlin crackdown on dissent. Dr. Nadezhda Buyanova, 68, was arrested in February after Anastasia Akinshina, the mother of one of her patients, reported the pediatrician to authorities. Akinshina alleged that Buyanova told her and her son that his father, a Russian soldier who apparently was killed in Ukraine, was a legitimate target for Kyiv’s troops and had blamed Moscow for the war. A video of the outraged Akinshina complaining about Buyanova was widely publicized, and chief of Russia’s Investigative Committee Alexander Bastrykin personally demanded a criminal case be brought against the doctor. Buyanova, who was born in western Ukraine, denied the accusation, insisting she never said what she was accused of saying. In a tearful closing statement to the court last week, she had urged it to acquit her. Her defense argued the prosecution failed to present evidence that the purported conversation took place, including any recordings of it, and alleged that her accuser fabricated the story out of animosity toward Ukrainians, according to the independent news site Mediazona, which reported all of the hearings in the trial. In her closing statement to the court, Buyanova said it was 'painful' to read the accusations in the indictment, and broke down. 'A doctor, especially a pediatrician, is not capable of wishing harm to a child, his mother, or traumatizing the child’s psyche. Only a monster is capable of this -- and of the words that I allegedly said to them,' Mediazona quoted her as saying. Buyanova's case drew national attention, with more than 6,500 people signing an online petition demanding her freedom and supporters regularly attending court hearings. As the judge read out the verdict, they shouted, 'Disgrace!' before bailiffs escorted everyone from the courtroom. Her lawyer, Oscar Cherdzhyev, told reporters afterward that the verdict was 'unexpectedly harsh' and 'monstrously cruel.' 'We didn't expect this,' he said. 'Spreading false information' about the army has been a criminal offense since March 2022, when Russia adopted a series of laws prohibiting any public expression about the invasion that deviated from the official narrative. Authorities started actively using them against critics and protesters. According to OVD-Info, one of Russia’s leading rights groups that tracks political arrests, more than 1,000 people have been implicated in criminal cases on charges related to speaking or acting out against the war.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-crackdown-0827790d20cc6e57994a6245c0d72b9b	2024-11-12T04:36:18-08:00	
The Latest: More than a dozen races left to be called to determine control of Congress	Control over the U.S. House of Representatives still hangs in the balance, teetering between a Republican or Democratic majority with more than a dozen races left to be called. Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: Why California takes weeks to count votes, while states like Florida are faster One week after Election Day, control of the U.S. House rests on just over a dozen races where winners haven’t yet been determined. Nine states have at least one uncalled House race, some of which are so close they’re headed to a recount. Then there’s California. About half of the yet-to-be-decided House races are in the state, which has only counted about three-quarters of its votes statewide. This isn’t unusual or unexpected, as the nation’s most populous state is consistently among the slowest to report all its election results. Compare it to a state like Florida, which finished counting its votes four days after Election Day. These differences in how states count — and how long it takes — exist because the Constitution sets out broad principles for electing a national government, but leaves the details to the states. The choices made by state lawmakers and election officials as they sort out those details affect everything from how voters cast a ballot to how quickly the tabulation and release of results takes place. ▶ Read more about how states count votes Trump picks former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee to be ambassador to Israel President-elect Donald Trump will nominate former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee as ambassador to Israel, Trump announced Tuesday. Huckabee is a staunch defender of Israel and his intended nomination comes as Trump has promised to align U.S. foreign policy more closely with Israel’s interests as it wages wars against Iran-backed Hamas and Hezbollah. 'Mike has been a great public servant, Governor, and Leader in Faith for many years,' Trump said in a statement. 'He loves Israel, and the people of Israel, and likewise, the people of Israel love him. Mike will work tirelessly to bring about Peace in the Middle East!' ▶ Read more about Trump’s transition to the White House Vice President Kamala Harris says there’s still work to get done She told a crowd of supporters gathered outside the White House she was grateful for them, as cheers erupted from the staircase at the Eisenhower office building adjacent to the White House. Her arrival for a private lunch with President Joe Biden coincided with Israeli President Isaac Herzog walking out of the West Wing to address reporters and the cheering briefly drowned him out. Harris said: 'Let’s get back to work because we still have work to get done.' She said she was sending 'all my love and thanks.' Trump has promised to ‘save TikTok’. What happens next is less clear After a tumultuous year filled with anxiety and a legal battle about its future in the U.S., TikTok may have just been thrown a lifeline by the man who was once its biggest foe: Donald Trump. President-elect Trump, who tried to ban the social media platform the last time he was in the White House, has repeatedly pledged during his most recent campaign to oppose a ban on the short-form video app, which could happen as soon as mid-January if the company loses a court case that’s currently underway in Washington. For months, TikTok, and its China-based parent company ByteDance, have been embroiled in a legal battle with the U.S. over a federal law that forces them to cut ties for national security reasons or stop operating in one of their biggest markets in the world. The measure, signed by President Joe Biden in April, gives ByteDance nine months to divest its stakes, with a possible three-month extension if a sale was in progress. If that happens, the deadline could be extended into the first 100 days of Trump’s presidency. ▶ Read more about Trump and TikTok Wall Street makes wagers on the likely winners and losers in a second Trump term Wall Street is already making big bets on what take two for a White House led by Donald Trump will mean for the economy. Since Election Day, investors have sent prices zooming for stocks of banks, fossil-fuel producers and other companies expected to benefit from Trump’s preference for lower tax rates and lighter regulation. For retailers, meanwhile, the outlook is murkier because of uncertainty about whether they’ll be able to absorb any of the higher costs created by tariffs. Professional investors are warning about the risk of getting carried away by the momentum. While strong rhetoric on the campaign trail can cause these big swings, not all of the promises turn into actual policy. Plus, the broad U.S. stock market tends to move more on long-term growth in profits than anything else. ▶ Read more about the effect of Trump’s reelection on the stock market Johnson says he expects to be at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate this weekend to talk about a policy roadmap The comment from House Speaker Mike Johnson came in response to a question about whether he’s talked to Trump about funding the federal government beyond the current Dec. 20 deadline. 'My plan is to be at Mar-a-Lago all weekend to iron out details on the plans ahead,' Johnson said. Johnson said it will be an ambitious agenda, but he declined to go into specifics. 'I told President Trump many times, as we’ve all discussed. We believe we could be the most consequential Congress in the modern era, and he’s the most consequential president, because we quite literally have to fix almost every metric of public policy. Everything is a mess. Everything.' Will more House Republicans join Trump’s administration? Speaker Mike Johnson says he doesn’t expect more House Republicans to join President-elect Donald Trump’s administration in the near-term because of the effect it would have on Republicans having enough votes to get priorities passed. But he adds, 'I’ll leave that up to him.' Johnson says he expects Republicans to grow their slim House majority when all the votes are counted, but it would still be a slim one. Johnson addressed the issue after it was disclosed that Trump has asked Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., to be his United Nations ambassador and Michael Waltz, R-Fla., to be his national security adviser. 'Every single vote counts,' Johnson said. Billionaire hedge fund manager John Paulson says he won’t be joining Trump’s administration Paulson said it in a statement Tuesday, nixing speculation that he would serve as Trump’s treasury secretary. 'My complex financial obligations would prevent me from holding an official position,' he said in the statement. 'However, I intend to remain actively involved with the President’s economic team and helping in the implementation of President Trump’s outstanding policy proposals.' Paulson is the founder of the New York-based hedge fund Paulson &amp; Co. The 68-year-old money manager made his fortune betting against subprime mortgages ahead of the Great Recession. He was a major fundraiser for Trump’s latest presidential campaign. Former George Soros money manager Scott Bessent, Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick and Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin are among other names floated for the treasury secretary role. Trump will meet with Speaker Mike Johnson at the Capitol on Wednesday Johnson says he plans to meet with Trump in the morning before Trump goes to the White House. The visit comes on the same day as House and Senate Republicans each have their own elections to determine their leadership in the next Congress. Johnson has kept in close contact with Trump throughout the election cycle, discussing campaign strategy and efforts Republicans would undertake in the first 100 days of a second Trump presidency. Speaker Mike Johnson: Republicans are ‘ready to deliver’ on Trump’s mandate House Speaker Mike Johnson said Tuesday that Republicans are 'ready to deliver' on President-elect Donald Trump’s mandate, ensuring they’re more prepared for a second-term agenda. Standing on the steps of the U.S. Capitol with the House GOP leadership team, the Republican speaker said there would be no time wasted on Trump’s 'America First' agenda of securing the southern border and other priorities in what he expects will be unified government, even though House control is still too early to call. 'We are ready to deliver on America’s mandate,' said Johnson. ▶ Read more about Congress Judge delays ruling on whether to scrap Trump’s conviction in hush money case A judge is postponing a decision on whether to undo President-elect Donald Trump’s conviction in his hush money case because of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity. New York Judge Juan M. Merchan had been set to rule Tuesday. Instead, he told Trump’s lawyers Tuesday he’d delay the ruling until Nov. 19. According to emails filed in court, Trump’s lawyers asked for the delay over the weekend, arguing there are 'strong reasons for the requested stay, and eventually dismissal of the case in the interests of justice.' ▶ Read more about Trump’s hush money case Supreme Court rejects push to move Georgia case against ex-Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows The Supreme Court refused Tuesday to let former Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows move the election interference case against him in Georgia to federal court. Meadows was one of 19 people indicted in Georgia and accused of participating in an illegal scheme to keep then-president Donald Trump in power after he lost the 2020 election. Trump was also charged, though after he won reelection last week any trial appears unlikely, at least while he holds office. Both men have denied wrongdoing. It’s unclear what affect the election results could have on others charged in the case, which is largely on hold after an appeals court agreed to review whether to remove Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis over her romantic relationship with the special prosecutor she had hired to lead the case. ▶ Read more about Mark Meadows’ case The lesser choices of voters for losing candidates could decide a Maine US House seat A ranked choice tabulation to determine the winner of a House race in Maine was beginning Tuesday, after neither Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Golden nor Republican Austin Theriault won more than 50% of first-place votes. Maine voters rank candidates in order of preference on ballots, and if necessary to reach a majority, the lesser choices of the last-place finisher’s supporters are reallocated. Ballots from the 2nd Congressional District were brought to a building in the state capital where election workers will scan them and reallocate any valid votes on the more than 12,000 ballots that didn’t name Golden or Theriault. But that won’t be the end of it. A requested recount will begin after the process determines a majority winner. Election workers will try to complete both tasks before the state’s Nov. 25 certification deadline. South Korean president takes up golf again to forge a bond with Trump South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol has dusted off his golf clubs in an attempt to forge a bond with President-elect Donald Trump, an avid golf lover. The presidential office said Tuesday that Yoon began practicing the game for the first time in eight years in preparation for a possible round of golf with Trump. Since his election, Trump’s 'America first' approach has raised concerns it could negatively affect the U.S. defense commitment to South Korea and hurt the trade interests of the Northeast Asian country in various ways, including increased tariffs. Some experts say it’s important to build a close personal friendship with Trump during the transition period before he formally takes office in January. ▶ Read more about South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol Congress returns to unfinished business and a new Trump era Congress returns to a changed Washington as President-elect Donald Trump’s hard-right agenda is quickly taking shape, buoyed by eager Republican allies eyeing a full sweep of power on Capitol Hill while Democrats are sorting out what went wrong. Even as final election results are still being tallied, the House and Senate leadership is pushing ahead toward a second-term Trump White House and what he’s called a 'mandate' for governing, with mass deportations, industry deregulation and wholesale gutting of the federal government. Trump is already testing the norms of governance during this presidential transition period — telling the Senate to forgo its advise-and-consent role and simply accept his Cabinet nominees — and he is staffing his administration and finding lawmakers willing to bend those civic traditions. ▶ Read more about Congress California Gov. Gavin Newsom will spend part of week in DC as he tries to Trump-proof state policies California Gov. Gavin Newsom plans to meet with the Biden administration this week to discuss zero-emission vehicles and disaster relief — issues that have been targeted in the past by President-elect Donald Trump. The Democratic governor is leaving for Washington on Monday and will return home Wednesday, his office said. Newsom will also meet with California’s congressional delegation. He is seeking federal approval for state climate rules, a $5.2 billion reimbursement for emergency funding during the COVID-19 pandemic and updates to the state’s Medicaid program, along with other priorities. The trip comes days after Newsom called for state lawmakers to convene a special session in December to protect California’s liberal policies ahead of Trump’s return to office in January. ▶ Read more about the governor’s upcoming trip Judge set to rule on whether to scrap Trump’s conviction in hush money case A judge is due to decide Tuesday whether to undo President-elect Donald Trump’s conviction in his hush money case because of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity.

Merchan, who presided over Trump’s historic trial, is now tasked with deciding whether to toss out the jury verdict and order a new trial — or even dismiss the charges altogether. The judge’s ruling also could speak to whether the former and now future commander-in-chief will be sentenced as scheduled Nov. 26. Just over a month after a jury convicted Trump of falsifying business records, the Supreme Court ruled that ex-presidents can’t be prosecuted for actions they took in the course of running the country, and prosecutors can’t cite those actions even to bolster a case centered on purely personal conduct. ▶ Read more about the upcoming ruling	https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-election-kamala-harris-903d0a4532278cace2f4b3c975bb743d	2024-11-12T04:15:02-08:00	
European fake art network involving Banksys, Warhols, Modiglianis uncovered in Italy	ROME (AP) — Italian authorities say a network of European art forgers who painted fake Warhols, Banksys and Picassos and then tried to sell them to unsuspecting buyers with the help of complicit auction houses has been dismantled. Thirty-eight people have been placed under investigation, including six in Spain, France and Belgium. Italian authorities say the network could have done 200 million euros ($212 million) in economic damage by flooding the art market with fake works. Italy’s culture ministry said Monday the seizures in Italy, France, Spain and Belgium netted 2,100 fake works attributed to more than 30 famed artists, including Andy Warhol, Amedeo Modigliani, Banksy, Pablo Picasso, Joan Mirò, Francis Bacon, Wassily Kandinsky, Henry Moore and Gustav Klimt. The operation uncovered a network of forgers in Spain, France and Belgium who produced the works, said Eurojust, the European Union agency for judicial cooperation. Fake Warhols and Banksys were the most commonly forged and the fakes were exhibited at shows in Mestre and Cortona, Italy, with a catalogue published, the authorities said. Eurojust said the network was able to use complicit auction houses in Italy that issued forged certificates and stamps of authenticity, some 500 of which were also seized. The investigation began in March 2023 when Italian authorities discovered 200 fakes during the search of the home of a Pisa businessman that prompted them to monitor e-commerce sites of auction houses to see if others were involved in the network. Those arrested are accused of conspiracy to forge and deal in contemporary art, Eurojust said.	https://apnews.com/article/italy-fake-art-banksy-f655f612e6c2818448f57afb0fc39ab3	2024-11-12T03:12:58-08:00	
Russian parliament advances bill to ban adoptions by gender-transition countries	MOSCOW (AP) — Russia's lower house of parliament on Tuesday passed final reading of a bill to ban adoption of Russian children by citizens of countries where gender transitioning is legal. The measure, which now goes to the upper house of parliament and then to President Vladimir Putin for signing into law, follows an array of measures in recent years suppressing non-traditional sexuality. State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin, who authored the bill, said on the Telegram messaging app that 'it is extremely important to eliminate possible dangers in the form of gender reassignment that adopted children may face in these countries.' He listed at least 15 countries that the law would apply to, most of them in Europe but including Australia, Argentina and Canada. Adoption of Russian children by U.S. citizens was banned in 2012. Putin and other top officials in recent years have increasingly called for observing so-called 'traditional values' as a counter to Western liberalism characterized as degenerate. Russia last year banned gender-transition medical procedures and its Supreme Court declared the LGBTQ+ 'movement' to be extremist. In 2022, Putin signed a law prohibiting the distribution of LGBTQ+ information to people of all ages, expanding a ban issued in 2013 on disseminating the material to minors. The parliament is also considering a measure that would criminalize 'propaganda' that discourages people from having children.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-lgbtq-adoptions-36c28270553f511aef6ec914642a925c	2024-11-12T03:11:30-08:00	
Britain's Queen Camilla returns to public duties after chest infection	LONDON (AP) — Britain’s Queen Camilla is set to return to public duties Tuesday after missing weekend events commemorating the nation’s war dead because she was recovering from a chest infection. Camilla, 77, plans to attend a reception for the finalists in the annual Booker Prize for fiction writing, but will spend less time with guests than originally planned. She is also scheduled to attend a reception for the television and film industry, but will cut that one short too. The queen has pulled out of an appearance at the premiere of the film 'Gladiator II' on Wednesday night as doctors advise Camilla to focus on her recovery. King Charles III’s spouse was advised against joining other members of the royal family at a 'Festival of Remembrance' on Saturday at London’s Royal Albert Hall in London and the Remembrance Sunday ceremony at the Cenotaph war memorial, a major event for Britain’s royals. The events are held every year on the weekend before Armistice Day to honor those who died serving Britain in the world wars and all the conflicts that have followed.	https://apnews.com/article/britain-royals-queen-camilla-returns-to-duties-81dc872b6527999b4b8a9282cd6b7898	2024-11-12T03:10:07-08:00	
Danish police close investigation into Old Stock Exchange fire	COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — Danish police said Tuesday that they were closing the investigation into the devastating fire that destroyed more than half of Copenhagen’s Old Stock Exchange, saying nothing points at the blaze being the result of a criminal act. Despite extensive forensic investigations, review of surveillance and the questioning of a large number of witnesses, 'it is not possible to determine the cause of the fire in the historic stock exchange building,' said Brian Belling, the Copenhagen police officer in charge of the investigation. 'Our assessment is that we have explored all relevant investigative possibilities in the case,' Belling told a press conference, adding that no one has been charged in the case. Belling said the video material included hours of footage from inside the Stock Exchange that had not been damaged by the fire. He added that no inflammable liquid has been found. In the early morning of April 16, a violent fire tore through the 400-year-old building, a major tourist attraction. The blaze toppled its green copper roof and iconic dragon-tail spire. Two days later, a large section of the building’s outer wall collapsed inwards. As the fire raged, many, including ordinary people, ventured in to rescue artworks and around 90% of the cultural objects were rescued from the building. One of the hypotheses was that the fire started in connection with the renovation, Belling said. He said that the fire is believed to have started under the roof, which had been wrapped in scaffolding because of ongoing renovation work to be completed for its anniversary in 2024. 'There is guidance regarding listed buildings when renovating them. It is our opinion that they have been followed to the letter,' Tim Ole Simonsen, a senior member of the Greater Copenhagen Fire Department, told the same news conference. 'Then you can discuss whether they are good enough.' On Sept. 24, King Frederik X of Denmark laid the 'foundation stone' within part of a red brick wall that survived the mid-April blaze, marking the commencing of a yearslong reconstruction plan. The owner of the downtown exchange, the Denmark’s Chamber of Commerce, has said that they will rebuild the landmark, which is considered a leading example of Dutch Renaissance style in Denmark. Construction started in 1615 and it first opened in 1624. The fire was reminiscent of the April 2019 blaze at the 800-year-old Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris.	https://apnews.com/article/denmark-old-stock-exchange-fire-investigation-april-c48b64356465e40c74cdaf4b5863728a	2024-11-12T02:57:38-08:00	
Police officer arrested over deadly 2023 suicide bombing at Pakistan mosque	PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) — A police officer has been arrested in connection with facilitating a suicide bomb attack at a mosque on the premises of a police compound in northwest Pakistan. Provincial police chief Akhtar Hayyat announced the arrest of police constable Mohammad Wali at a news conference in Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, on Tuesday. Wali, who worked with the Peshawar police, is alleged to have shared a map of the compound with the suicide bomber who carried out an attack on the mosque on Jan. 29, 2023, killing 101 people, mostly police officers, and wounding 250 others. Hayyat said Wali had joined the outlawed Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, a breakaway faction of the Pakistani Taliban, which orchestrated the attack, in 2023. The arrest was made in a raid on Monday and Wali had confessed to his role in the attack, the chief added. Police last year released CCTV images from the blast scene showing the suicide bomber in a police uniform approaching the site pushing a motorcycle, giving the impression it had broken down. Hayyat said it is alleged that the uniform had been provided by Wali. The assault on the mosque inside the police facility was one of the deadliest attacks on security forces in recent years.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-arrest-peshawar-suicide-bombing-bc056da2cd2c598b9bf781815a8ea597	2024-11-12T02:28:04-08:00	
Middle East latest: Israeli strikes kill 11 in Gaza, hit Beirut suburbs; US aid deadline expires	Palestinian medical officials said two Israeli strikes in Gaza killed at least 14 people, including two children and a woman. The deaths came as eight international aid groups said in a report on Tuesday that Israel has failed to meet U.S. demands that it allow greater humanitarian access to the war-ravaged Gaza Strip, where conditions are worse than at any point in the 13-month-old war. A late Monday strike hit a cafeteria in the so-called Muwasi humanitarian zone west of the Gaza city of Khan Younis, killing at least 11 people, including two children, according to officials at Nasser Hospital, where the casualties were taken. Another strike early Tuesday hit a house in the urban Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, killing three people including a woman, according to al-Awda Hospital, which received the casualties. The Biden administration last month called on Israel to 'surge' more food and other emergency aid into Gaza, setting a 30-day deadline that was expiring Tuesday. It warned failure to comply could trigger U.S. laws requiring it to scale back American military support as Israel wages war against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Israel has announced some steps toward improving the situation. But in recent days, U.S. officials signaled Israel still isn’t doing enough, though they have not said if they will take action against it. The Israel-Hamas war began after Palestinian militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. Israel’s military response in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 people, Palestinian health officials say. The officials do not distinguish between civilians and combatants, but say more than half of those killed were women and children. In Lebanon, to the north, the Iran-backed militant Hezbollah group, began firing into Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, in solidarity with Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Since the conflict erupted, more than 3,200 people have been killed and more than 14,000 wounded in Lebanon, the country's Health Ministry reported. ___ Here's the latest: Israel announces the opening of a fifth crossing point for aid into Gaza TEL AVIV, Israel — The Israeli military announced on Tuesday the opening of a fifth crossing for humanitarian aid into Gaza, one of key demands by the United States for Israel to increase humanitarian aid to Gaza. The crossing, across from Kibbutz Kissufim, and closest to the city of Deir al Balah in Gaza, will allow for the delivery of food, water, medical supplies, and shelter equipment to central and southern Gaza, the military said. The aid will undergo a security check at the Kerem Shalom crossing and then be brought into Gaza via the new crossing. Trucks picking up aid at Kerem Shalom have repeatedly been attacked and supplies stolen as they travel to distribution hubs inside Gaza, according to an Israeli official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with military briefing rules. Israel has come under intense criticism from the aid groups and the international community for failing to allow enough aid into Gaza, creating famine conditions in the northern part of the coastal strip. Israel has announced a series of steps toward improving the situation. But U.S. officials have signaled that Israel still is not doing enough, though they have not said if they will take any action against it. —Melanie Lidman in Tel Aviv, Israel; Israeli warplanes strike Beirut's southern suburbs BEIRUT — Israeli airstrikes set off large explosions on Tuesday in Beirut’s southern suburbs — an area known as Dahiyeh where Hezbollah has a significant presence — soon after the Israeli military issued evacuation orders for 11 houses there. There was no immediate word on casualties. The military said the houses contained Hezbollah installations, but the claim could not be independently confirmed. Late Monday night, a strike hit the village of Ain Yaacoub in northern Lebanon, killing at least 16 people, the Lebanese civil defense said. Four of the killed were Syrian refugees, and there were another 10 people wounded. There was no Israeli military comment on the strike. Israel has been carrying out intensified bombardment of Lebanon, vowing to cripple Hezbollah and put a stop to more than year of cross-border fire by the Lebanese militant group onto northern Israel. Israel's military says it delivered aid to northern Gaza on a US-imposed deadline TEL AVIV, Israel — The Israeli military said on Tuesday that hundreds of packages of food and water were brought to a besieged area in northern Gaza where the military has been carrying out a concentrated operation since October. COGAT, the Israeli military body in charge of humanitarian aid to Gaza said aid trucks were brought to the areas of Jabaliya and Beit Hanoun, where the military has carried out an intense operation since Oct. 6. On Monday night, the Israeli security Cabinet approved more aid for Gaza, which will increase the number of trucks that enter the battered enclave each day, according to an official familiar with the matter. At least 700 Palestinians have been killed in northern Gaza since the operation began, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, and tens of thousands have been displaced. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its counts. An Israeli official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with military briefing rules, said the army estimates there are approximately 5,000–10,000 Palestinians still living in northern Gaza. The aid was delivered on a U.S.-imposed deadline that called on Israel to 'surge' more food and other emergency aid into Gaza. It warned that failure to comply could trigger U.S. laws requiring it to scale back military support as Israel wages war against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Aid groups have accused Israel of falling short on aid distribution, especially in northern Gaza. —Melanie Lidman in Tel Aviv, Israel; Israel denied or impeded 85% of aid convoys to northern Gaza last month, UN says UNITED NATIONS — The U.N. humanitarian office says 85% of its attempts to coordinate aid convoys and humanitarian visits to northern Gaza — where hunger is acute and Israel is carrying out a major offensive — were denied or impeded last month. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs made 98 requests to Israeli authorities for authorization to go through the checkpoint along Wadi Gaza but only 15 made it, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Monday. The humanitarian office, known as OCHA, 'is worried about the fate of Palestinians remaining in North Gaza, as the siege there continues, and urgently calls on Israel to open up the area to humanitarian operations at the scale needed, given the massive needs.' Dujarric said. In a new report published Monday, OCHA said humanitarian organizations submitted 50 requests to the Israeli authorities to enter North Gaza governorate in October and 33 were rejected while eight were accepted but faced impediments including delays that prevented their completion, he said. Over the past three days, Dujarric said, teams from OCHA, the U.N. human rights and de-mining agencies and other humanitarian groups visited nine sites in Gaza City to assess the needs of hundreds of displaced families, many from North Gaza. The teams say that some were in shelters, abandoned homes, destroyed clinic and some were sleeping in the streets or open fields where they feared stray dogs at night, Dujarric said. In a severely damaged structure, the team found more than a dozen families — including people with disabilities and some in urgent need of medical care — sheltering in the basement which had no electricity and was full of sewage, he said,. ___ For more Middle East news: https://apnews.com/hub/middle-east	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-hezbollah-mideast-latest-12-november-2024-16e57642f460d28e6a5e4f5fe7088a41	2024-11-11T23:49:14-08:00	
For nearly a decade, climate talks have been hashing out so-called Article 6. But what is it?	BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) — After nearly a decade of negotiations, leaders during the United Nations climate conference's first day decided on some of the finer points of much-debated sticking point aimed at cutting planet-warming emissions from coal, oil and gas. Known as Article 6, it was set up as part of the 2015 Paris Agreement to help nations work together to reduce climate-causing pollution. Part of that was a system of carbon credits, allowing nations to put planet-warming gasses in the air if they offset emissions elsewhere. But the gaveling through of Article 6 late Monday was criticized by climate justice groups, who said carbon markets allow major polluters to keep emitting at the expense of people and the environment. COP29, as this year’s summit is known, has brought together world leaders to discuss ways to limit and adapt to the climate crisis. Scientists agree that the warming of the atmosphere caused primarily by human-burned fossil fuels is fueling deadlier and increasingly catastrophic droughts, flooding, hurricanes and heat. Here's a look at Article 6 and the carbon credits system it aims to implement. What is Article 6? Article 6 first made an appearance at the Paris climate talks in 2015, where world leaders agreed to try to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) from pre-industrial levels. Its aim is to outline how countries and companies can trade emissions reductions to remove and stop more carbon pollution reaching the atmosphere. The idea is to set up carbon trading markets, allowing higher polluters to offset some of the pollution they produce by buying carbon credits from less polluting countries. Article 6 offers two ways for countries to do this. The first is for two nations to set their own rules and standards for carbon credit trades. Some countries are already signing deals to do this, including Singapore with the Philippines, Costa Rica and Sri Lanka, Switzerland with Ghana, Peru and Ukraine, among others. The second option creates an international, U.N.-governed market that anyone can purchase credits through. Isa Mulder, an expert on global carbon markets with the research group Carbon Market Watch, said the idea behind Article 6 is for countries to find the cheapest way to cut emissions. By trading carbon credits, it makes cutting global pollution cheaper and more efficient. But Article 6 is contentious, leading to years of delays. At COP28, negotiations crumbled after disagreements on transparency, rules on credits that could be traded, and what makes a good carbon removal credit. 'There are other problems like when local communities don't have a say in the project and are forced to resettle,' said Mulder, referring to how some tree-planting carbon credit schemes can happen on inhabited Indigenous lands. 'So there’s a lot of human rights concerns.' United Nations secretary-general Antonio Guterres urged negotiators to 'agree to rules for fair, effective carbon markets' and 'leave no space for greenwashing or land-grabbing.' How might it help red uce carbon pollution? The hope of Article 6 is that it incentivizes countries to collaborate to reach their climate goals. Countries could generate carbon credits based on projects aimed to meet their own climate goals, such as protecting existing forests from development or shutting coal-fired plants. Private-sector players or other high carbon polluter countries could then buy the credits, which would allow them to emit a certain amount of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gas. Heavy-polluting companies would be important customers. Each credit would equal a ton of CO2 or the equivalent of other greenhouse gases that can be reduced in the air, sequestered, or avoided by using green energies instead. Money from the credits generated would go to local projects. The per-ton price of carbon would fluctuate in the market, meaning that the higher it rises, the more green projects could fetch through new credits generated. Under carbon markets, countries that lower their emissions by installing clean energy projects like solar or wind power or electrifying public transportation systems can sell carbon credits. But critics question whether it will be effective and worry it could lead to similar problems seen with the Kyoto Protocol, a 1997 pact for developed nations to reduce their heat-trapping gas emissions to 1990 levels and below. The deal was dealt a hammer blow when the then U.S. administration withdrew from it. 'There’s a lot of concerns about whether that credit actually represents what it stands for,' said Mulder from Carbon Market Watch. What could happen at Baku climate talks? Monday's decision signaled early momentum on establishing Article 6, which the COP29 presidency said it would prioritize this year. But leaders still need to agree on other sections of the issue, including rules on two-nation carbon credit trading and the final details of the international, U.N.-governed market. Once finalized, Article 6 could reduce the cost of implementing national climate plans by $250 billion annually according to U.N. estimates. The COP29 presidency will then encourage countries to participate in carbon trading. On Monday, COP29 President Mukhtar Babayev said Article 6 'will be a game-changing tool to direct resources to the developing world.' But concerns remain about how it will work, given how it was developed. 'Communities' consent and ownership over these initiatives are not just essential, but also a matter of respect and inclusion,' said David Nicholson, chief climate officer at Mercy Corps, a nonprofit that works on poverty, climate and other issues. 'We are concerned that the agreement lacks adequate protections to human rights and undermines the goals of the Paris Agreement, rather than supporting them. If these concerns aren’t addressed, the decision could allow carbon trading to take the place of genuine, much-needed climate finance commitments,' Nicholson added. ___ AP Science writer Seth Borenstein contributed to this report.

Dutch appeals court overturns landmark climate ruling against Shell	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — A Dutch appeals court on Tuesday overturned a landmark ruling that ordered energy company Shell to cut its carbon emissions by net 45% by 2030 compared to 2019 levels, while saying that 'protection against dangerous climate change is a human right.' The decision was a defeat for the Dutch arm of Friends of the Earth and other environmental groups, which had hailed the original 2021 ruling as a victory for the climate. Tuesday's civil ruling can be appealed to the Dutch Supreme Court. 'This hurts,' Friends of the Earth director in the Netherlands Donald Pols said. 'At the same time, we see that this case has ensured that major polluters are not immune and has further stimulated the debate about their responsibility in combating dangerous climate change. That is why we continue to tackle major polluters, such as Shell.' Outside court, Pols said the fight against climate change 'is a marathon, not a sprint, and the race has just begun.' The ruling upholding Shell’s appeal came as a 12-day U.N. climate conference was entering its second day in Azerbaijan where countries are discussing how to fund cutting planet-warming emissions and adapt to ever-increasing weather extremes. It marked a stinging defeat for climate activists after several courtroom victories. A court in The Hague in 2015 ordered the government to cut emissions by at least 25% by the end of 2020 from benchmark 1990 levels. The Dutch Supreme Court upheld the ruling five years ago. Earlier this year, a U.N. tribunal on maritime law said that countries are legally required to reduce greenhouse gas pollution. The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea found that carbon emissions qualify as marine pollution and said that countries must take steps to mitigate and adapt to their adverse effects. And in April, Europe’s highest human rights court ruled that countries must better protect their people from the consequences of climate change. In December the top U.N. legal body, the International Court of Justice, is holding public hearings on climate change after the world body requested a nonbinding advisory opinion on 'the obligations of States in respect of climate change.' Dozens of countries are set to present arguments at two weeks of hearings. In a written summary of Tuesday's ruling, the court said that Shell has a duty of care to limit its emissions, but it annulled the lower court's decision because it was 'unable to establish that the social standard of care entails an obligation for Shell to reduce its CO2 emissions by 45%, or some other percentage. 'There is currently insufficient consensus in climate science on a specific reduction percentage to which an individual company like Shell should adhere.' Shell has emitted 36,528 million tons of carbon dioxide, or CO2, since 1854, which is 2.1% of global emissions, according to an April report by the Carbon Majors Database. Presiding Judge Carla Joustra said that Shell already has targets for climate-warming carbon emissions that are in line with demands of Friends of the Earth — both for what it directly produces and for emissions produced by energy the company purchase from others. The court then ruled that 'for Shell to reduce CO2 emissions caused by buyers of Shell products ... by a particular percentage would be ineffective in this case. Shell could meet that obligation by ceasing to trade in the fuels it purchases from third parties. Other companies would then take over that trade.' Joustra said that, 'The court’s final judgment is that Friends of the Earth's claims cannot be granted. The court therefore annuls the district court’s judgment.' Climate activists sitting outside on the courthouse steps hugged, and some appeared close to tears after the decision. 'To be honest I was just really disappointed,' Neele Boelens said. I was almost crying. I was in there in the court and it was just like... At first it looked really good for us but then it just went down hill.' Shell, meanwhile, welcomed the ruling. 'We are pleased with the court’s decision, which we believe is the right one for the global energy transition, the Netherlands and our company,' Shell plc Chief Executive Officer Wael Sawan said in a written statement. 'Our target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 remains at the heart of Shell’s strategy and is transforming our business.' ___ Read more of AP’s climate coverage at http://www.apnews.com/climate-and-environment	https://apnews.com/article/shell-climate-court-netherlands-51e84d215df13f9c92edf84f301a673f	2024-11-11T23:09:13-08:00	
A hollow and limited apology.' New Zealand survivors of abuse in care speak in their own words	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Hundreds of survivors of abuse in state, foster and faith-based care arrived at New Zealand's Parliament in Wellington on Tuesday, each representing thousands more. They came to hear the government formally apologize for the 'unimaginable' horrors they suffered as children and vulnerable adults, after a long-running inquiry made its final report about the scale of the abuse in July. 'You deserved so much better and I am deeply sorry that New Zealand did not do better by you,' Prime Minister Christopher Luxon told them in Parliament hours later. Many had T-shirts specially printed. Some used canes or wheelchairs because of the abuse they suffered in hospitals, institutions and care homes after they were taken from their families. A few were familiar faces from decades of advocacy and campaigning, mostly ignored until recent years. The public gallery in New Zealand’s Parliament is small — it seats fewer than 200 people — and a total of 500 had been drawn from a ballot to attend. Many were disappointed that details of financial compensation for their suffering weren't divulged on Tuesday. Luxon promised that a redress system will be 'operating next year.' Survivors spoke in their own words about the day: Tu Chapman, a survivor who advised the inquiry 'Right now I feel alone and in utter despair at the way in which this government has undertaken the task of acknowledging all survivors. Once again, like our decades of fight, we are having to validate our care experiences and our existence. 'We continue living with the decimation of our identities, the raping and pillaging of our cultures through incompetent decision-making and the intentional moves to invalidate our experiences. The clear and utter destruction of lives cannot be downplayed, nor can it be swept under the carpet, as the state, churches and faith-based organizations have done for decades. 'I think it was a hollow and limited apology. It feels like they’re just giving consideration to things they can continue tinkering around with. Stop tinkering around and just get on with it.' Helen Beauchamp, who lived in 20 foster homes from age 4 'In my files, they wrote ‘not intelligent enough’ at age 4. My mum was in a hospital institution at age 12, put there by her dad. So it’s been a generational thing. 'Surviving has been a roller coaster and we still don’t have a picture of the outcome. It’s sad that our system is very slow. That makes it really hard for a lot of us, having the anticipation of just a little bit of closure, a little bit of light. This is a long, drawn-out timeline to continue to be put through. It takes a toll. '189 survivors were picked out of the ballot to sit in the public gallery today and I was one, so I was quite fortunate just in that. Coming here is a wider and significant way to apologize to our children, to our own families.' Jazmine Te Hiwi, a survivor of two camps for troubled young people 'Being acknowledged is the hardest part of being here. How do you accept that after being denied for 40 years of your life? It almost feels like you’re forced to accept the apology. 'What gets me is that we have people in high places who still look down on us, they don’t have any real understanding of why we are like this. There’s a reason why some of our youth are doing crimes. I see myself in that. We were just innocent kids that were taken advantage of. 'When I hear about these youth getting in trouble, all they’re looking for is some kind of attention, some kind of love. But nobody sees that and especially not these people. They think ‘the way to fix them up is to send them to boot camp.’ But that’s what they did to us. And that’s why we’re here today. It’s like it went in one ear and out the other side.'	https://apnews.com/article/survivors-zealand-abuse-state-care-church-foster-730c80e263d01fbdebd730b6833a8ba3	2024-11-11T22:49:37-08:00	
Aid groups say Israel misses US deadline to boost humanitarian help for Gaza	JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel has failed to meet U.S. demands to allow greater humanitarian access to the Gaza Strip, where conditions are worse than at any point in the 13-month-old war, international aid organizations said Tuesday. The Biden administration last month called on Israel to 'surge' more food and other emergency aid into the Palestinian territory, giving it a 30-day deadline that expires Tuesday. The administration warned that failure to comply could trigger U.S. laws requiring it to scale back military support as Israel wages offensives against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Israel has announced a series of steps toward improving the situation. But U.S. officials recently signaled that Israel still isn’t doing enough, though they haven't said if they will take any action. Israel’s new foreign minister, Gideon Saar, appeared to downplay the deadline, telling reporters on Monday that he was confident 'the issue would be solved.' The Biden administration may have less leverage after the reelection of Donald Trump, who was a staunch supporter of Israel in his first term. Tuesday's report, authored by eight international aid organizations, listed 19 measures of compliance with the U.S. demands. It said that Israel had failed to comply with 15 and only partially complied with four. An Oct. 13 letter signed by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin called on Israel to, among other things, allow a minimum of 350 truckloads of goods to enter Gaza each day; open a fifth crossing into the besieged territory; allow people in Israeli-imposed coastal tent camps to move inland before the winter; and ensure access for aid groups to hard-hit northern Gaza. It also called on Israel to halt legislation that would hinder the operations of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA. After the report was published, the Israeli military announced the opening of a fifth crossing Tuesday close to the city of Deir al Balah in Gaza. It will allow for the delivery of supplies to the territory's central and southern regions. Despite Israeli steps to increase the flow of aid, levels remain far below the U.S. benchmarks. Residents are also still crammed in tent camps, access for aid workers to northern Gaza remains restricted, and Israel has pressed ahead with its laws against UNRWA. 'Israel not only failed to meet the U.S. criteria that would indicate support to the humanitarian response, but concurrently took actions that dramatically worsened the situation on the ground, particularly in Northern Gaza,' the report said. 'That situation is in an even more dire state today than a month ago.' The report was co-signed by Anera, Care, MedGlobal, Mercy Corps, the Norwegian Refugee Council, Oxfam, Refugees International and Save the Children. U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said last week that Israel had made some progress, but needs to do more to meet the U.S. conditions. 'What's important when you see all of these steps taken is what that means for the results,' he said. Israel launched a major offensive last month in northern Gaza, where it says Hamas militants had regrouped. The operation has killed hundreds of people and displaced tens of thousands. Israel has allowed almost no aid to enter the area, where tens of thousands of civilians have stayed despite evacuation orders. Aid to Gaza plummeted in October, when just 34,000 tons of food entered, or less than half the previous month, according to Israeli data. U.N. agencies say even less actually gets through because of Israeli restrictions, ongoing fighting and lawlessness that makes it difficult to collect and distribute aid on the Gaza side. In October, 57 trucks a day entered Gaza on average, according to Israeli figures, and 81 a day in the first week of November. The U.N. puts the number lower, at 37 trucks daily since the beginning of October. COGAT, the Israeli military body in charge of humanitarian aid to Gaza, said that the drop in the number of aid trucks in October was because of closures of the crossings for the Jewish high holidays and memorials marking the anniversary of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack that triggered the war. 'October was a very weak month,' an Israeli official said on condition of anonymity in line with military briefing rules. 'But if you look at the November numbers, we are holding steady at around 50 trucks per day to northern Gaza and 150 per day to the rest of Gaza.' Aid distribution is also being hampered by the U.N. and other agencies' failure to collect aid that entered Gaza, leading to bottlenecks, and stealing by Hamas and organized crime families in Gaza, he said. He estimated as much as 40% of aid is stolen on some days. Israel on Monday announced a small expansion of its coastal 'humanitarian zone,' where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have sought shelter in sprawling tent camps. It also has announced additional steps, including connecting electricity for a desalination plant in the central Gaza town of Deir al Balah, and efforts to bring in supplies for the winter. On Tuesday, COGAT announced a 'tactical' delivery of food and water to Beit Hanoun, one of the hardest-hit towns in northern Gaza. Also on Monday night, the Israeli security Cabinet approved increased aid for Gaza, which will increase the number of trucks that enter Gaza each day, according to an official familiar with the matter. The war began last year when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 people. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel's bombardment and ground invasion have killed more than 43,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities, who don't say how many of those killed were militants. Around 90% of the population has been displaced, often multiple times, and hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps, with little food, water or hygiene facilities. The United States has rushed billions of dollars in military aid to Israel during the war and has shielded it from international calls for a cease-fire, while pressing it to allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza. The amount of aid entering Gaza increased under U.S. pressure last spring after Israeli strikes killed seven aid workers before dwindling again. Trump has promised to end the wars in the Middle East without saying how. He was a staunch defender of Israel during his previous term, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says they have spoken three times since his reelection last week. Israeli President Isaac Herzog, whose role is mostly ceremonial, is scheduled to meet with U.S. President Joe Biden on Tuesday. Former U.S. State Department official Charles Blaha, who ran the office in charge of ensuring that U.S. military support complies with U.S. and international law, predicted the Biden administration would find that Israel violated U.S. law by blocking humanitarian aid from reaching Palestinians in Gaza. 'It’s undeniable that Israel has done that,' Blaha said. 'They would really have to torture themselves to find that Israel hasn’t restricted ... assistance.' But he said that the administration would likely cite U.S. national security interests and waive restrictions on military support. 'If the past is prologue — no restrictions, and then kick the can down the road to the next administration.' ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

Israeli strikes set off explosions in Beirut suburbs and kill 14 Palestinians in Gaza, medics say	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli airstrikes hit a cafeteria and a home in Gaza, killing at least 14 people, medical officials said. In Lebanon, warplanes struck the capital Beirut’s southern suburbs on Tuesday after the military ordered a number of houses there to evacuate. The new bombardment on both fronts comes on the verge of a deadline set by the United States for Israel to dramatically ramp up humanitarian aid allowed in Gaza or risk possible restrictions on U.S. military funding. A group of eight international aid agencies said in a report on Tuesday that Israel has failed to meet the U.S. demands. In Lebanon, large explosions shook Beirut’s southern suburbs — an area known as Dahiyeh where Hezbollah has a significant presence — soon after the Israeli military issued evacuation orders for 11 houses there. There was no immediate word on casualties. The military said the houses contained Hezbollah installations, but the claim could not be independently confirmed. Late Monday night, a strike hit the village of Ain Yaacoub in northern Lebanon, killing at least 16 people, the Lebanese civil defense said. Four of the killed were Syrian refugees, and there were another 10 people wounded. There was no immediate Israeli military comment on the strike. Israel has been carrying out intensified bombardment of Lebanon since late September, vowing to cripple Hezbollah and put a stop to more than year of cross-border fire by the Lebanese militant group onto northern Israel. At the same time, Israel has continued its campaign in Gaza, now more than 13 months old, triggered by Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel. An Israeli strike late Monday hit a makeshift cafeteria used by displaced people in Muwasi, the center of a 'humanitarian zone' that Israel’s military declared earlier in the war. At least 11 people were killed, including two children, according to officials at Nasser Hospital, where the casualties were taken. Video from the scene showed men pulling bloodied wounded from among tables and chairs set up in the sand in an enclosure made of corrugated metal sheets. Another strike early Tuesday hit a house in the urban Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, killing three people including a woman, according to al-Awda Hospital, which received the casualties. The strike also wounded 11 others, it said. The Israeli military had no immediate comment on the strikes. Hours earlier, the Israeli military announced a small expansion of the humanitarian zone, where it has told Palestinians evacuating from other parts of Gaza to take refuge. Hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians are sheltering in sprawling tent camps in and around Muwasi, a largely desolate area of dunes and agricultural fields with few facilities or services along the Mediterranean coast of southern Gaza. Israeli forces have also been besieging the northernmost part of Gaza since the beginning of October, battling Hamas fighters it says regrouped there. With virtually no food or aid allowed in for more than a month, the siege has raised fears of famine among the tens of thousands of Palestinians believed still sheltering there. An Oct. 13 letter signed by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin gave Israeli 30 days to, among other things, allow a minimum of 350 truckloads of goods to enter Gaza each day. So far, Israel has fallen short. In October, 57 trucks a day entered Gaza on average, and 70 a day in the 10 days of November, according to Israeli figures. The U.N. puts the number lower, at 37 trucks daily since the beginning of October. Israel has announced a flurry of measures in recent days to increase aid, including opening a new crossing into central Gaza. But so far the impact is unclear. The military said Tuesday it had allowed hundreds of packages of food and water into Jabaliya and Beit Hanoun, two areas under siege in the far north of Gaza. The Palestinian civil defense agency said three trucks carrying flour, canned food and water reached Beit Hanoun. It was only the second delivery allowed into the area since the beginning of October; a smaller cargo was let in last week, though not all of it reached shelters in the north, according to the U.N. The military announced Tuesday that four soldiers were killed in Jabaliya, bringing to 24 the number of soldiers killed in the assault there since it began. Palestinian health officials say hundreds of Palestinians have been killed, though the true numbers are unknown as rescue workers are unable to reach buildings destroyed in strikes. Israel has ordered residents in the area to evacuate. But the U.N. has estimated some 70,000 people remain. Many Palestinians there fear Israel aims to permanently depopulate the area to more easily keep control of it. On Tuesday, witnesses told The Associated Press that Israeli troops had encircled at least three schools in Beit Hanoun, forcing hundreds of displaced people sheltering inside to leave. Drones blared announcements demanding people move south to Gaza City, said Mahmoud al-Kafarnah, speaking from one of the schools as sounds of gunfire could be heard. 'The tanks are outside,' he said. 'We don’t know where to go.' Hashim Afanah, sheltering with at least 20 other people in his family home, said the forces were evicting people from houses and shelters. Israel’s campaign in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities that do not distinguish between civilians and militants in their count but say more than half the dead are women and children. Israel says it targets Hamas militants and blames the militant group for civilian deaths, saying it operates in residential areas and infrastructure, and among displaced people. The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted about 250 as hostages. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, about a third of them believed to be dead. ___ Associated Press reporters Samy Magdy in Cairo and Melanie Lidman in Jerusalem contributed to this report. ___ This story has corrected to show that the span of the war is now 13 months, not 19 months.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-lebanon-hezbollah-iran-news-november-12-2024-095148946dcc1d0dcb75cbd423b1be3a	2024-11-11T21:46:27-08:00	
Theater festival offers solace in Burkina Faso, a nation torn by violence	OUGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) — The last three years have been tough for Fanta Charlotte Dabone, a mother of three from the conflict-battered West African country of Burkina Faso. She fled her village after it was attacked by extremists, leaving her husband and her farm behind. Since then, she has been moving from place to place, struggling to pay rent and to buy enough food for her children, including a 2-year-old toddler. But last month, she got to be a queen. Every day for a week, together with dozens of other Burkinabe men and women who have been displaced by extremist violence, she swirled, danced and chanted for almost two hours in front of captivated audiences at Recreatrales, an international theater festival held in Ouagadougou, the country's capital. 'I was so happy about it,' she said. 'I don't even know how to explain how it felt.' Burkina Faso, a landlocked nation of 23 million in Sahel, an arid strip of land south of the Sahara, used to be known for its bustling arts scene, including renowned film and theater festivals, and its sophisticated craftsmanship. But in recent years, the country has become the symbol of the security crisis in the region. It has been shaken by violence from extremist groups and the government forces fighting them, much of it spilling over the border with Mali, and by two ensuing military coups. The military junta, which took power by force in 2022, failed to provide the stability it promised. Instead, the situation deteriorated: According to conservative estimates, more than 60% of the country is now outside of government control, more than 2 million people have lost their homes and almost 6.5 million need humanitarian aid to survive. The country's leader, Capt. Ibrahim Traore, installed a system of de-facto censorship, where those critical of the regime disappear or get forcefully drafted into the army, and where even friends are afraid to discuss politics with each other. But against all odds, last month the Bougsemtenga district in the capital turned into a festival grounds to host Recreatrales for the 13th time. Bougsemtenga derives its name from 'bougtenga,' which means 'happiness district' in Moore, one of the local languages. True to its origins, this year its streets were transformed into a dreamy universe, resembling a crossover between a traditional village festival and 'Alice in Wonderland.' More than 150 African and European artists performed and over 4,500 theater lovers were able to escape the country's grim reality, if just for a little while. Improvised theater stages were constructed inside people’s courtyards. The streets were decorated with colorful lights and abstract sculptures made by locals from plastic bottles and scraps of wax-printed fabrics. Residents put up hand decorated stands, selling beer and meat sticks to multinational crowds of theatergoers, ranging from Western diplomats to local mechanics. The ticket booth was a giant frog, its mouth wide open. Aristide Tarnagda, the festival’s artistic director, said he was convinced that regardless of the insecurity engulfing the country, the festival had to take place as planned. Theater is an affirmation of 'the primacy of life over death,' Tarnagda said. He added that getting together to perform and watch theatrical productions is a form of resistance against adversity and violence. This is why this year's theme was 'Turning the face to the sun.' 'Humans are capable of love and freedom, but sometimes they forget it,' he said. 'The role of the theater is to remind them about it.' Held every two years, the festival is the culmination of the yearlong work that the organizers do with residents of the Bougsemtenga district, which was home to two theaters and a theater association even before the first Recreatrales in 2002. They run art workshops, including in writing, theater, dance and scenography, for young people from the district and from all of Africa, and organize mentoring sessions and business skills classes for local women. The goal is to get as many people as possible involved, said Odile Sankara, the festival's director. 'It’s a working class district,' Sankara said. 'We want to encourage people to take an interest in art, to get a taste of it.' She added: 'Art is a powerful weapon to fight for more light, more humanity and more love,' especially while her country and the whole Sahel region were going through a security and humanitarian crisis. Claude Ilboudo, a 30-year-old from Bougsemtenga, has performed in the opening ceremonies of Recreatrales as a dancer since its first edition. He used to work as a glazier, and dancing was just his past time. But Ilboudo's life took a turn when five years ago he severely injured his right hand at work and could no longer do his job. It was then that Ilboudo discovered a passion for theater and started working for the Recreatrales association. 'Theater saved me,' he said. 'It made me discover what I could do.' This year, Ilboudo was part of the team that prepared the opening play with the internally displaced actors from scratch, including the concept, scenario and choreography. It was also the first time he personally interacted with people who had to flee their homes because of extremist violence. For internally displaced people, theater is not just a tool for therapy, helping them to process trauma, said Sankara, the artistic director. It's a way for a group that has been marginalized and isolated in Burkinabe society to be seen by others. During the play, Dabone, the displaced mother of three, stood at center stage with her toddler tied to her back and spit out a long, white paper strip. It symbolized all the haunting thoughts leaving her body, she said. But the question remains — for how long. 'Life is very difficult,' she said. 'But when I am on the stage, I feel joy. It’s when I go back home that all these thoughts are catching up with me.' ___ The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

North Korea ratifies major defense treaty with Russia	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea ratified a major defense treaty with Russia stipulating mutual military aid, the North’s state media reported Tuesday, as the U.S., South Korea and Ukraine say North Korea has sent thousands of troops to Russia to support its war against Ukraine. Russia had completed the ratification of the treaty last week after it was signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June. It is considered both countries’ biggest defense deal since the end of the Cold War. The Comprehensive Strategic Partnership treaty will take effect when both sides exchange documents on the ratification, the state-run Korean Central News Agency said. North Korea ratified the treaty through a decree signed Monday by the country's president of state affairs, KCNA said, using one of Kim's titles. North Korea’s rubber-stamp parliament, the Supreme People’s Assembly, has the right to ratify treaties but Kim can unilaterally ratify major ones, according to South Korea’s Unification Ministry. The treaty requires both countries to use all available means to provide immediate military assistance if either is attacked. It also calls for the two countries to actively cooperate in efforts to establish a 'just and multipolar new world order' and strengthen cooperation on various sectors including peaceful atomic energy, space, food supply, trade and economy. Some observers speculate the treaty’s ratification in both countries could signal North Korea could formally enter the Russia-Ukraine war soon. According to U.S., South Korean and Ukrainian intelligence assessments, up to 12,000 North Korean troops have been sent to Russia likely as part of the June treaty. Last week, Ukrainian officials said Ukraine and North Korean troops engaged in small-scale fighting while Ukraine’s army fired artillery at North Korean soldiers in Russia’s Kursk border region. North Korea’s troop dispatch threatens to escalate the almost three-year war. South Korea, the U.S. and their partners also worry about what Russia could give North Korea in return. Possible Russian transfer of sensitive technology to enhance North Korea’s already-advancing nuclear and missile programs would be an alarming development for the U.S. and its allies. North Korea and Russia have been significantly strengthening their military and other cooperation. South Korea’s spy agency said last month that North Korea had sent more than 13,000 containers of artillery, missiles and other conventional arms to Russia since August 2023 to replenish its dwindling weapons stockpiles.	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-russia-ukraine-059d73e4c3492c19b555476b2fb45ca9	2024-11-11T18:06:11-08:00

Ishiba survived a rare runoff to remain Japan's prime minister but will face turmoil	TOKYO (AP) — Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, battered in parliamentary elections last month, has survived a rare runoff vote against the opposition to remain the country's leader but he still faces turmoil ahead. One of his top priorities is dealing with the aftermath of a major corruption scandal in the long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party, in which dozens of lawmakers from the party are alleged to have pocketed profits from event ticket sales as kickbacks. Ishiba also now has a much-emboldened, opposition eager to push through policies long stymied by the LDP. Support ratings for his Cabinet have fallen to about 30%. Here is a look at what's happening in Japan's tumultuous politics, and what it might mean for Ishiba and his government as they prepare to navigate a second term of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Why did the vote in parliament take place? A parliamentary vote for a new leader is mandatory within 30 days of a general election. In the past that was mostly ignored as the head of the LDP usually enjoyed a majority in the Lower House, the more powerful of Japan’s two-chamber parliament. This time, though, because Ishiba's LDP and its junior coalition partner lost its majority in the recent election, the runoff on Monday couldn't be avoided — the first in 30 years. What's next for the prime minister? Opposition's top leader, Yoshihiko Noda, has noted that nearly half of all lower house steering committees are now headed by the opposition. That’s a huge change from the pre-election domination of the LDP, which controlled all but three of the 27 committees. 'We are going to have a new landscape in Japanese politics,' Noda said. Twelve of the committees in key areas, including budget, political reforms, national security and legal affairs, will be headed by Noda’s Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan and two other main opposition groups. What's certain is that the era of LDP’s one-sided rule is over, for now, and the opposition has a chance to achieve policies long opposed by the ruling conservatives, including on issues like gender equality and diversity. Noda last Friday said a legal committee that is now headed by his party’s gender equality chief, Chinami Nishimura, is aiming to achieve a civil code revision to allow married couples the option of keeping separate surnames. That change has been stalled by LDP conservatives for 30 years despite widespread support by the public and a United Nations panel on discrimination against women. Who is the opposition kingmaker? Yuichiro Tamaki is head of the conservative Democratic Party for the People, which quadrupled its seats to 28 in the election. The vote elevated his party from a fringe group to a major player. He is now being cast as a potential key to Ishiba’s survival. A Harvard-educated former Finance Ministry bureaucrat, the 55-year-old Tamaki has seen success by pushing for the raising of a basic tax-free income allowance and an increase of take-home wages. His messages on social media have appealed to younger voters, who have long been ignored by LDP policies catering to conservative elderly. Ishiba apparently seems to find Tamaki’s 28-member DPP an attractive partner to secure a majority. The two parties, which have common ground in some areas — including support for greater nuclear energy use and a stronger military — have started policy talks. Ishiba met with both Tamaki and Noda on Monday but Tamaki may be cautious about moving too close to a scandal-plagued LDP ahead of another election next year. Noda is struggling to form a unified opposition to force a change of government, which he says is his next goal. What does this mean for Ishiba's government? For Ishiba, the 'hung parliament' requires him to win over opposition forces so he can push his policies. While considered unstable, it might also provide a chance for a more consensus-based policy making process, experts say. 'I’m taking the current situation positively as a chance to get our opposition voice heard more carefully,' Tamaki said. Ishiba also faces challenges of restoring unity in his own party. A number of senior LDP lawmakers are waiting to overthrow Ishiba, though their priority is to resolidify their footholds, not infighting — and nobody is eager to do damage control at this difficult time anyway. 'The (Ishiba) administration is quite unstable. ... He will have to get opposition parties' cooperation every time he wants to get a bill approved, which could stall policies,' said University of Tokyo political science professor Yu Uchiyama. And even if Ishiba survives politically in the coming months, there could be a call for his replacement ahead of next elections. 'Japan is likely to return to a period of short-lived government,' Uchiyama said. How does this affect Japan's diplomacy, security and ties with Trump? Ishiba congratulated Trump hours after his victory and in a brief telephone conversation, they agreed to closely work together to further elevate their alliance. While experts say Trump understands the importance of U.S.-Japan relations, he may — as he did in his first administration — pressure Japan to pay more for the cost of 50,000 U.S. troops in Japan or to buy more expensive American weapons. Trump's possible tariff proposals could also hurt Japanese exporters. Ishiba on Saturday renewed his pledge to pursue an ongoing military buildup plan under a strategy that calls for a counter-strike capability with long-range cruise-missiles. He has long advocated a more equal Japan-U.S. security alliance but could face difficulty pursuing those plans. 'It will be a fantastic experiment to see if a national unity government can get Japan through until the next election,' said Michael Cucek, an expert in Japanese politics at Temple University in Japan. ___ Follow AP's Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific	https://apnews.com/article/japan-ishiba-politics-trump-f43d8609e64d42588db7b2b090c54c0c	2024-11-11T16:09:01-08:00	
Trump asks Rep. Mike Waltz, China hawk, to be his national security adviser	WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump has asked U.S. Rep. Michael Waltz, a retired Army National Guard officer and war veteran, to be his national security adviser, a person familiar with the matter said Monday. The nod came despite simmering concerns on Capitol Hill about Trump tapping members of the House, where the final tally is still uncertain and there are worries about pulling any GOP members from the chamber because that would force a new election to fill the empty seat. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the matter before Trump made a formal announcement. The move would put Waltz at the forefront of a litany of national security crises — ranging from the ongoing effort to provide weapons to Ukraine and escalating worries about the growing alliance between Russia and North Korea to the persistent attacks in the Middle East by Iran proxies and the push for a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas and Hezbollah. Waltz, a three-term GOP congressman from east-central Florida, was the first Green Beret elected to the U.S. House, and easily won reelection last week. He has been chairman of the House Armed Services subcommittee on readiness and a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Waltz is an ardent Trump advocate who backed efforts to overturn the 2020 election. He is considered hawkish on China, and called for a U.S. boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing due to its involvement in the origin of COVID-19 and its ongoing mistreatment of the minority Muslim Uighur population. He has been a sharp critic of the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan and has called on the U.S. to hold accountable those who bear responsibility for the deaths of the 13 U.S. service members at Abbey Gate and for 'thousands of Americans and allies behind enemy lines.' He has also repeated Trump’s frequent complaints about a so-called 'woke' military that the former president has derided as soft and too focused on diversity and equity programs. In a statement last year, Waltz said that as head of the readiness subcommittee: 'I am ready to get to work to better equip our military and turn our focus away from woke priorities and back to winning wars. Our national security depends on it.' A graduate of Virginia Military Institute, Waltz was a Green Beret. He served in the active-duty Army for four years before moving to the Florida Guard. While in the Guard he did multiple combat tours in Afghanistan, the Middle East and Africa and was awarded four Bronze Stars, including two with valor. He also worked in the Pentagon as a policy adviser when Donald Rumsfeld and Robert Gates were defense chiefs. 'President-Elect Trump will begin making decisions on who will serve in his second Administration soon,' said Karoline Leavitt, a spokesperson for the Trump transition. 'Those decisions will be announced when they are made.' Richard Goldberg, who served at the National Security Council during Trump’s first term, called Waltz an impressive pick whose background as an elite U.S. service member and experience on Capitol Hill will be of great value to Trump. 'With fires raging across the world right now, Waltz is well positioned to help the President put out those fires,' said Goldberg, who is now a senior adviser at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington. Waltz's selection was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. — AP writers Jill Colvin in New York and Zeke Miller and Aamer Madhani in Washington contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-national-security-adviser-mike-wlatz-0c81d044c9ffe18dfd745202e8351b9c	2024-11-11T15:41:40-08:00	
New Zealand's leader formally apologizes to survivors of abuse in state and church care	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — New Zealand's Prime Minister Christopher Luxon made a 'formal and unreserved' apology in Parliament on Tuesday for the widespread abuse, torture and neglect of hundreds of thousands of children and vulnerable adults in care. 'It was horrific. It was heartbreaking. It was wrong. And it should never have happened,' Luxon said, as he spoke to lawmakers and a public gallery packed with survivors of the abuse. An estimated 200,000 people in state, foster and faith-based care suffered 'unimaginable' abuse over a period of seven decades, a blistering report released in July said at the end of the largest inquiry ever undertaken in New Zealand. They were disproportionately Māori, New Zealand’s Indigenous people. 'For many of you it changed the course of your life, and for that, the government must take responsibility,' Luxon said. He said he was apologizing for previous governments too. In foster and church care — as well as in state-run institutions, including hospitals and residential schools — vulnerable people 'should have been safe and treated with respect, dignity and compassion,' he added. 'But instead, you were subjected to horrific abuse and neglect and in some cases torture.' The findings of the six-year investigation believed to be the widest-ranging of comparable probes worldwide were a 'national disgrace,' the inquiry's report said. New Zealand's investigation followed two decades of such inquiries around the globe as nations struggle to reckon with authorities’ transgressions against children removed from their families and placed in care. Of 650,000 children and vulnerable adults in New Zealand's state, foster, and church care between 1950 and 2019 — in a country that today has a population of 5 million — nearly a third endured physical, sexual, verbal or psychological abuse. Many more were exploited or neglected. 'We will never know that true number,' Chris Hipkins, the leader of the opposition, told Parliament. 'Many people entering into state and faith-based institutions were undocumented. Records were incomplete, they've gone missing, and in some cases, yes, they were deliberately destroyed.' In response to the findings, New Zealand’s government agreed for the first time that historical treatment of some children in a notorious state-run hospital amounted to torture — a claim successive administrations had rejected. 'I am deeply sorry that New Zealand did not do better by you. I am sorry you were not believed when you came forward to report your abuse,' Luxon said. 'I am sorry that many abusers were not made to face justice which meant that other people experienced abuse that could have been prevented.' His government was working on 28 of the inquiry's 138 recommendations, Luxon said, although he did not yet have concrete details on financial redress, which the inquiry had exhorted since 2021 and said could run to billions of dollars. Luxon was decried by some survivors and advocates earlier Tuesday for not divulging compensation plans alongside the apology. He told Parliament a single redress system would be established in 2025. He did not, however, suggest a figure for the amount the government expected to pay. 'There will be a big bill, but it's nothing compared to the debt we owe those survivors and it must not be the reason for any further delay,' said Hipkins, the opposition leader. Survivors began to arrive at Parliament hours before the apology, having won spots in the public gallery — which only seats about 200 people — by ballot. Some were reluctant to accept the state's words, because they said the scale of the horror was not yet fully understood by lawmakers and public servants. Jeering was so loud during an apology from the country's solicitor-general that her speech was inaudible. Others called out or left the room in tears while senior public servants from relevant health and welfare agencies spoke before Luxon's remarks. Survivors invited to give speeches were required to do so before Luxon's apology — rather than in response to it, said Tu Chapman, one of those asked to speak. 'Right now I feel alone and in utter despair at the way in which this government has undertaken the task of acknowledging all survivors,' she told a crowd at Parliament. The abuse 'ripped families and communities apart, trapping many into a life of prison, incarceration, leaving many uneducated,' said Keith Wiffin — a survivor of abuse in a notorious state-run boys' home. 'It has tarred our international reputation as an upholder of human rights, something this nation likes to dine out on.' The inquiry's recommendations included seeking apologies from state and church leaders, among them Pope Francis. It also endorsed creating offices to prosecute abusers and enact redress, renaming streets and monuments dedicated to abusers, reforming civil and criminal law, rewriting the child welfare system and searching for unmarked graves at psychiatric facilities. Its writers were scathing about how widely the abuse — and the identities of many abusers — were known about for years, with nothing done to stop it. 'This has meant you have had to re-live your trauma over and over again,' said Luxon. 'Agencies should have done better and must commit to doing so in the future.' He did not concede that public servants or ministers in his government who had denied state abuse was widespread when they served in previous administrations should lose their jobs. Luxon has also rejected suggestions by survivors that policies he has enacted which disproportionately target Māori — such as crackdowns on gangs and the establishment of military-style boot camps for young offenders — undermine his government's regret about the abuse. Māori are over-represented in prisons and gangs. In 2023, 68% of children in state care were Māori, although they are less than 20% of New Zealand's population. 'It's not enough to say sorry,' said Fa’afete Taito, a survivor of violent abuse at another state-run home, and a former gang member. 'It's what you do to heal the wounds of your actions and make sure it never happens again that really counts.'	https://apnews.com/article/child-abuse-care-zealand-state-faith-foster-294b014a126cb8c067e1da16a94f4cc7	2024-11-11T13:52:28-08:00	
Amsterdam police warn of fresh calls for unrest a day after rioters torch a tram	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — A senior police officer warned Tuesday of calls for more rioting in Amsterdam, after dozens of people armed with sticks and firecrackers set a tram on fire Monday night as the city faces tensions following violence last week targeting fans of an Israeli soccer club. Olivier Dutilh, of the Amsterdam police force, told a court hearing that 'we have signals that there are calls for similar' unrest in the west of the city. Police said the fire Monday was quickly extinguished and riot officers cleared the square. Images online showed people damaging property and setting firecrackers. There were no reports of any injuries. Police said it was not clear who started the unrest and whether it was related to what happened last week. Some rioters could be heard on video shared on social media using slurs against Jewish people. Police noted the tense atmosphere since five people were treated in the hospital and dozens detained Thursday following a Maccabi Tel Aviv-Ajax match. Youths on scooters and on foot went in search of Israeli fans, punching and kicking them and then fleeing to evade police, according to Amsterdam’s mayor. Pro-Palestinian demonstrators were banned by local authorities from gathering outside the stadium. Before the match, Maccabi fans also tore a Palestinian flag off a building in Amsterdam and chanted anti-Arab slogans on their way to the stadium. There were also reports of Maccabi fans starting fights. Dutch police announced five new arrests Monday in their investigation into that earlier violence. The suspects are men aged 18 to 37 and are from Amsterdam or surrounding cities. Four are still in custody; the fifth has been released but remains a suspect. Earlier, police said that four other men who had been arrested last week would remain in custody while the investigation continues. Two of those are minors, a 16-year old and a 17-year old from Amsterdam. The other two men are from Amsterdam and a nearby city. Police said they have identified over 170 witnesses and have taken forensics evidence from dozens. Prime Minister Dick Schoof said they were also examining videos posted to social media. Schoof was meeting with community leaders Tuesday afternoon to discuss antisemitism. Reports of antisemitic speech, vandalism and violence have been on the rise in Europe since the start of the war in Gaza, and tensions mounted in Amsterdam ahead of Thursday night’s match. The mayor has banned all demonstrations in the city and declared several parts of Amsterdam risk zones where police can stop and check anyone. D ozens were detained on Sunday for taking part in a pro-Palestinian demonstration in central Amsterdam that had been outlawed. A small demonstration was ended by police Tuesday outside Amsterdam City Hall during a debate about the unrest, Dutch broadcaster NOS reported.	https://apnews.com/article/netherlands-tensions-tram-israeli-fans-20c8af43b8a72fa6bd9bab938ce7bd89	2024-11-11T11:45:20-08:00	
Thousands rally outside Georgian parliament to demand a new election towards European integration	TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — Thousands of opposition supporters rallied Monday in Georgia’s capital in continuing protests against the ruling party's declared victory in the Oct. 26 parliamentary election amid allegations that Russia helped rig the vote. The protesters waved Georgian and European Union flags and gathered outside the Georgian parliament. They demanded a new parliamentary election under international supervision and an investigation into the alleged election fraud. Giorgi Vashadze, leader of Unity National Movement Coalition, vowed that the opposition will 'fight until the end.' 'Elections were massively rigged, that is why we don’t recognize election results,' he said. 'Our goal is new elections, our goal is to form a new government, which will drive Georgia to European integration.' Opposition leaders have vowed to boycott sessions of parliament and hold regular protests until their demands are met. The Central Election Commission said the governing Georgian Dream party won about 54% of the vote. Its leaders have rejected the opposition claims of vote fraud. European election observers said the election took place in a 'divisive' atmosphere marked by instances of bribery, double voting and physical violence. The opposition has accused Georgian Dream, which was established by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia, of becoming increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow. It has recently adopted laws similar to those used by the Kremlin to crack down on freedom of speech and LGBTQ+ rights. President Salome Zourabichvili, who has rejected the official results, says Georgia has fallen victim to pressure from Moscow against joining the EU. Zourabichvili, who holds a mostly ceremonial position, has urged the United States and EU to support the demonstrations. Officials in Washington and Brussels have urged a full investigation of the election, while the Kremlin has rejected the accusations of interference. Many Georgians viewed the parliamentary election as a pivotal referendum on the country’s effort to join the EU. The EU suspended Georgia’s membership application process indefinitely because of its passage in June of a Russian-style 'foreign influence law.' Lawmakers from several EU nations attended Monday’s rally in a show of solidarity with protesters. 'Somebody is trying to take your freedom, somebody is trying to take your democracy, your country, your membership in EU and NATO,' Zygimantas Pavilionis, a Lithuanian parliament member, said at the rally. 'Don’t give up. Fight for your freedom, fight for your democracy, fight for your country , fight for your membership in EU and NATO.'	https://apnews.com/article/georgia-opposition-protest-election-eu-russia-2ffe964513ec147d6d4e128bd212fd52	2024-11-11T10:51:42-08:00	
Haiti’s main airport shuts down as gang violence surges and a new prime minister is sworn in	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — Haiti’s international airport shut down on Monday after gangs opened fire at a commercial flight landing in Port-Au-Prince, prompting some airlines to temporarily suspend operations as the country swore in a new interim prime minister who promised to restore peace. The Spirit Airlines flight headed from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to Port-Au-Prince was just hundreds of feet from landing in Haiti's capital when gangs shot at the plane striking a flight attendant, who suffered minor injuries, according to the airline, the U.S. Embassy and flight tracking data. The flight was diverted and landed in the Dominican Republic. Photos and videos obtained by The Associated Press show bullet holes dotting the interior of a plane. The shooting appeared to be part of what the U.S. Embassy called 'gang-led efforts to block travel to and from Port-au-Prince which may include armed violence, and disruptions to roads, ports, and airports.' Spirit, JetBlue and American Airlines said Monday they were canceling flights to and from Haiti. In other parts of Haiti’s capital, firefights between gangs and police broke out. Rounds of gunfire echoed through the streets as heavily armed officers ducked behind walls and civilians ran in terror. In other upper class areas, gangs set fire to homes. Schools closed as panic spread in a number of areas. The turmoil comes a day after a council meant to reestablish democratic order in the Caribbean nation fired the interim prime minister Garry Conille, replacing him with businessman Alix Didier Fils-Aimé. The council has been marked by infighting and three members were recently accused of corruption. As he was sworn in, Fils-Aimé said his top priorities were to restore peace to the crisis-stricken nation and hold elections, which haven’t been held in Haiti since 2016. 'There is a lot to be done to bring back hope' he said before a room of suit-clad diplomats and security officials. 'I'm deeply sorry for the people ... that have been victimized, forced to leave everything they own.' The country has seen weeks of political chaos, which observers warned could result in even more violence in a place where bloodshed has become the new normal. The country's slate of gangs have long capitalized on political turmoil to make power grabs, shutting down airports, shipping ports and stirring chaos. The United Nations estimates that gangs control 85% of the capital of Port-au-Prince, while a U.N.-backed mission led by Kenyan police to quell gang violence struggles with a lack of funding and personnel, prompting calls for a U.N. peacekeeping mission. Louis-Henri Mars, executive director of Lakou Lapè, an organization working on peace building in violent areas of Haiti, said the political fighting has 'allowed the gangs to have more freedom to attack more neighborhoods in the city and expand their control of Port-au-Prince.' Civilians, he fears, will suffer the consequences. 'There will be more lives lost, more internal displacement, and more hunger in a country where half the population is on the brink of starvation,' he said. The transitional council was established in April, tasked with choosing Haiti’s next prime minister and Cabinet with the hope that it would help quell violence, which exploded after Haitian President Jovenel Moïse was assassinated in 2021. The council was meant to pave the way to democratic elections, but it has been plagued with politics and infighting, and has long been at odds with Conille, the interim prime minister they hand picked six months ago, who they fired yesterday. Gangs have capitalized on that power vacuum to make their own power grabs. Conille railed against the council's decision to fire him, calling it an illegal overreach of their powers. 'This resolution, taken outside of any legal and constitutional framework, raises serious concerns about its legitimacy and its repercussions on the future of our country,' he wrote in a letter. Organizations including the Organization of American States tried and failed last week to mediate disagreements in an attempt to save the fragile transition. On Monday, U.N. spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric urged all involved in Haiti's democratic transition 'to work constructively together,' although he stopped short of offering an opinion on the move to oust Conille. 'Overcoming their differences and putting the country first remains critical,' he said. 'What is important is that Haitian political leaders put the interests of Haiti first and foremost.' —— Associated Press reporter David Koenig contributed to this report from Dallas and Pierre-Richard Luxama, contributed from Port-au-Prince, Haiti. ——- Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/haiti-airport-gang-violence-5a8a96a179f26fb6cde1265483e5f4b5	2024-11-11T10:30:56-08:00	
Italy's plan to screen migrants in Albania hits another snag with 2nd group returning to Italy	MILAN (AP) — Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni’s program to screen asylum seekers outside of European Union borders in Albania hit another snag on Monday when a court in Rome refused to rule on a formal request to detain seven migrants transferred to the Balkan nation last week. The decision means the seven migrants, hailing from Bangladesh and Egypt, will be brought to Italy by naval ship, just days after their arrival in Albania. It is a repeat of what happened with the first 12 migrants in the program, who also were returned to Italy by another court decision last month shortly after the opening of two migrant screening centers in Albania operated by Italy. In both cases, courts referred the cases to the EU court of justice in Luxembourg to rule if the countries of origin for the migrants are considered safe countries for repatriation. The first 12 were also from Egypt and Bangladesh. The courts’ move has raised the ire of Meloni’s far-right-led government, which has been seeking strategies for easing the strain on Italy of the arrival of migrants seeking a better life in Europe. In the latest decision, the court specified that it was seeking clarification on which countries are designated as safe 'only to identify which procedure to apply.' 'The exclusion of a state from the list of safe countries of origin does not prevent the repatriation and/or expulsion of those migrants whose asylum applications has been rejected,’’ the court said in its ruling. Under a five-year deal, Albania would allow Italy to run two migrant centers on its territory with the capacity to screen up to 3,000 migrants a month to be vetted for asylum or returned to their home countries. Human rights groups and nongovernmental organizations active in the Mediterranean have slammed the agreement as a dangerous precedent that conflicts with international laws. So far, Italy has failed to identify anywhere close to that number for possible screening in Albania, despite thousands of arrivals on Italian shores since the centers opened. Migrants sent to Albania must be adult males, traveling without family members, and come from countries deemed safe.	https://apnews.com/article/italy-albania-migrants-meloni-1a5b74afb20cf6db5e2994047d6e5d92	2024-11-11T10:15:05-08:00	
Anti-government protesters blame rampant corruption for roof crash that killed 14 people in Serbia	BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Anti-government protesters in Serbia on Monday demanded arrests and the resignations of top officials over the deadly collapse of a concrete roof at a railway station that killed 14 people in a northern city this month. The rally in Belgrade blamed the collapse on rampant corruption and sloppy renovation work on the station building in Novi Sad — part of a wider deal with Chinese state companies involved in a number of infrastructure projects in the Balkan country. Borislav Novakovic, a former mayor of Novi Sad, accused the ruling populists of 'filling their bloody pockets while filling cemeteries in Serbia.' The state was 'responsible for the crime that took 14 lives,' he added. The crowd chanted 'jail' in response. The several thousand protesters demanded that Prime Minister Milos Vucevic and his government step down and that those responsible for the collapse be arrested. Authorities have opened an investigation and Serbia’s construction minister submitted his resignation last week, but no one has been charged or detained in connection with Nov. 1 accident. Monday's rally was peaceful, unlike one last week in Novi Sad when masked people threw rocks, bottles and red paint at City Hall after thousands marched peacefully. Police used tear gas against the rioters. Government officials have promised full accountability, but there is widespread skepticism because the populists control both the police and the judiciary. The train station, originally built in 1964, has been renovated twice in recent years and was inaugurated by Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic and his populist ally, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, over two years ago as a major stopover for a planned fast train line between Belgrade and Budapest.	https://apnews.com/article/serbia-roof-collapse-protest-vucic-3b095359268663a4ea77eec0cada6e7b	2024-11-11T09:42:10-08:00	
Here are the people Trump has picked for key positions so far	President-elect Donald Trump is starting to fill key posts in his second administration, putting an emphasis so far on aides and allies who were his strongest backers during the 2024 campaign. Here's a look at who he's selected so far. Susie Wiles, chief of staff Wiles, 67, was a senior adviser to Trump's 2024 presidential campaign and its de facto manager. Wiles has a background in Florida politics. She helped Ron DeSantis win his first race for Florida governor. Six years later, she was key to Trump's defeat of him in the 2024 Republican primary. Wiles’ hire was Trump’s first major decision as president-elect and one that could be a defining test of his incoming administration considering her close relationship with the president-elect. Wiles is said to have earned Trump's trust in part by guiding what was the most disciplined of Trump's three presidential campaigns. Wiles was able to help keep Trump on track as few others have, not by criticizing his impulses, but by winning his respect by demonstrating his success after taking her advice. Tom Homan, ‘border czar’ Homan, 62, has been tasked with Trump’s top priority of carrying out the largest deportation operation in the nation’s history. Homan, who served under Trump in his first administration leading U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, was widely expected to be offered a position related to the border, an issue Trump made central to his campaign. Though Homan has insisted such a massive undertaking would be humane, he has long been a loyal supporter of Trump's policy proposals, suggesting at a July conference in Washington that he would be willing to 'run the biggest deportation operation this country’s ever seen.' Democrats have criticized Homan for his defending Trump's 'zero tolerance' policy on border crossings during his first administration, which led to the separation of thousands of parents and children seeking asylum at the border. Elise Stefanik, United Nations ambassador Stefanik is a representative from New York and one of Trump's staunchest defenders going back to his first impeachment. Elected to the House in 2014, Stefanik was selected by her GOP House colleagues as House Republican Conference chair in 2021, when former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney was removed from the post after publicly criticizing Trump for falsely claiming he won the 2020 election. Stefanik, 40, has served in that role ever since as the third-ranking member of House leadership. Stefanik’s questioning of university presidents over antisemitism on their campuses helped lead to two of those presidents resigning, further raising her national profile. If confirmed, she would represent American interests at the U.N. as Trump vows to end the war waged by Russia against Ukraine begun in 2022. He has also called for peace as Israel continues its offensive against Hamas in Gaza and its invasion of Lebanon to target Hezbollah. Stephen Miller, deputy chief of staff for policy Miller, an immigration hardliner, was a vocal spokesperson during the presidential campaign for Trump's priority of mass deportations. The 39-year-old was a senior adviser during Trump's first administration. Miller has been a central figure in some of Trump's policy decisions, notably his move to separate thousands of immigrant families. Trump argued throughout the campaign that the nation's economic, national security and social priorities could be met by deporting people who are in the United States illegally. Since Trump left office in 2021, Miller has served as the president of America First Legal, an organization made up of former Trump advisers aimed at challenging the Biden administration, media companies, universities and others over issues such as free speech and national security.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-staff-picks-stefanik-wiles-stephen-miller-tom-homan-243d73610b03a3ee18c4d5f68756af7c	2024-11-11T09:18:18-08:00	
The Netherlands follows Germany and others in bringing in extra border checks	THE HAGUE (AP) — The Dutch government said on Monday that it will bring in extra checks at its land borders to combat irregular migration, similar to a policy brought in by Germany in September. It is the latest move by the country’s hard-right government aimed at reining in immigration, as anti-foreigner sentiment surges across Europe. Dutch Migration Minister Marjolein Faber announced the policy in a press release after the move got the green light from the Cabinet. 'It is time to tackle irregular migration and migrant smuggling in a concrete way. That is why we will start reintroducing border controls in the Netherlands from the beginning of December,' she said in a statement. The measure will take effect on Dec. 9. Under European Union law, countries must give Brussels four weeks notice before restricting freedom of movement. Earlier this year, Faber told Brussels the Netherlands also wanted to opt out of EU refugees obligations. Geert Wilders, whose anti-immigration party won the largest share of seats in elections last year, posted on social media that his PVV party 'delivers.' Wilders has been calling for closing Dutch borders for more than a decade. Faber, who represents Wilders’ party in the Cabinet, did not specify how the border controls would be carried out. The move comes with no extra funding for the national policy force response for border checks. The six-month restrictions must be done 'within the existing capacity,' the statement says. The Netherlands has hundreds of land border crossings with neighboring Germany and Belgium. Currently, the police carry out spot checks. Faber says the border controls must be carried out with as little hindrance as possible to traffic. Germany began carrying out similar checks on the border with France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and Denmark last month following several high-profile attacks by extremists. Germany and the Netherlands are both part of the Schengen area, the border-free travel zone which includes most EU member states, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. According to the EU, member states are allowed to temporarily reintroduce controls at the EU’s so-called internal borders in case of a serious threat, such as one to internal security. But it also says border controls should be applied as a last resort in exceptional situations, and must be time-limited.	https://apnews.com/article/netherlands-eu-germany-borders-immigration-schengen-72c920cb3bcbec9890ce2d5215c7c758	2024-11-11T09:11:05-08:00	
35 dead as a driver hits a crowd at sports center in a southern Chinese city	BANGKOK (AP) — A driver killed 35 people and severely injured another 43 when he deliberately rammed his car into people exercising at a sports center in the southern Chinese city of Zhuhai, police said Tuesday. Police had detained a 62-year-old man at the sports center in the southern Chinese city of Zhuhai following the ramming late Monday, on the eve of the country’s premier aviation exhibition by the People’s Liberation Army that's hosted annually in the city. Police identified the man only by his family name of Fan, consistent with the practice by Chinese authorities. Fan was discovered in the car with a knife, with wounds to his neck thought to be self-harm injuries, according to the statement. He is unconscious and receiving medical care. He was dissatisfied with the split of financial assets in his divorce, according to a preliminary investigation, police said. For almost 24 hours after the crime took place, it was unclear what the death or injury toll was. One of the four hospitals that took in people for treatment said it had more than 20 injured, state media reported Monday. AP reporters call to the hospitals in the city were unanswered, or directed towards other hospitals. On Tuesday morning, searches for the incident on Chinese social media were heavily censored on Chinese social media platforms. A search on Weibo for the sports center only turned up a few posts, with only a couple referring to the fact something had happened, without pictures or details. Articles by Chinese media about the incident from Monday night were taken down. Outside of China's Great Firewall, on X, however, videos were able to circulate. They were shared by news blogger and dissident Li Ying, who is better known on X as Teacher Li. His account posts daily news based on user submissions. Dozens of people were lying prone on the running track in the sports center in the videos. In one, a woman says 'my foot is broken.' That same video showed a firefighter performing CPR on a person, as people were told to leave the scene. Chinese internet censors take extra care to scrub social media ahead of and during major events, such as the meeting of the National People’s Congress, where the government announces its major policy initiatives for the coming year. The sports center for the city district of Xiangzhou regularly attracts hundreds of residents, where they can run on the track field, play soccer and social dance. Following the incident, the center announced it would be closed until further notice. China has seen a number of attacks in which suspects appear to target random people such as schoolchildren. In October, a 50-year-old man was detained after he allegedly used a knife to attack children at a school in Beijing. Five people were injured. In September, three people were killed in a knife attack in a Shanghai supermarket. ___ Associated Press reporters Elsie Chen and Didi Tang contributed from Washington, and researcher Yu Bing contributed from Beijing.	https://apnews.com/article/china-crash-crowd-zhuhai-3db25fd49b1313c462bbf4e0214f3834	2024-11-11T08:34:46-08:00	
US top climate negotiator: 'We won't revert back' as Trump prepares to take over	BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) — No matter what kind of U-turn President-Elect Donald Trump will make on climate change, America's clean energy economy won't reverse into the dirty past, a combative but 'bitterly disappointed' top American climate negotiator said Monday. During the first day of the U.N. climate talks, COP29, Climate Adviser John Podesta struck a defiant but realistic tone in a press conference. He said Trump will likely pull the United States out of the landmark Paris Agreement and try to roll back many of the Biden Administration's signature climate moves, including the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act that included $375 billion in climate spending. 'Are we facing new headwinds? Absolutely. But we won’t revert back to the energy system of the 1950s. No way,' Podesta said. 'Setbacks are unavoidable, but giving up is unforgivable,' Podesta said paraphrasing a Biden speech last week. 'This is not the end of our fight for a cleaner, safer planet. Facts are still facts. Science is still science. The fight is bigger than one election, one political cycle in one country. This fight is bigger, still, because we are all living through a year defined by the climate crisis in every country of the world.' During the campaign, Trump said would pull America from the Paris Agreement, rollback parts of the IRA and increase drilling and oil production. He has called emissions regulations part of a 'green new scam' and claimed, without evidence, that offshore wind turbines harm whales. During Trump's first administration, between 2017 and 2021, many environmental regulations were rolled back, later to be reversed by the Biden administration. The incoming Trump administration has signaled it plans to now undo Biden's changes. During his press conference, Podesta ran through a shopping list of climate disasters, starting with the hottest day recorded, July 22, continuing with floods, hurricanes and droughts. 'None of this is a hoax. It is real. It’s a matter of life and death,' Podesta said. 'Fortunately, many in our country and around the world are working to prepare the world for this new reality and to mitigate the most catastrophic effects of climate change.' Podesta said the Biden administration is still negotiating even as it prepares to leave. 'We are here to work, and we are committed to a successful outcome at COP29,' Podesta said. 'We can and will make real progress on the backs of our climate committed states and cities, our innovators, our companies and our citizens, especially young people who understand more than most that climate change poses an existential threat that we cannot afford to ignore.' Another senior U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said other countries are still working with American diplomats because they care what the U.S. thinks and any agreement struck here must be by consensus. Outside analysts had speculated the U.S. would be ignored. 'In January, we’re going to inaugurate a president whose relationship to climate change is captured by the words ‘hoax’ and ‘fossil fuels’,' Podesta said. 'He’s vowed to dismantle our environmental safeguards and once again withdraw United States from the Paris Agreement. That is what he said. And we should believe him.' ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations. AP is solely responsible for all content.

Israel's military is building along UN-patrolled demilitarized zone in Syria, satellite images show	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Israel has begun a construction project along the so-called Alpha Line that separates the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights from Syria, apparently laying asphalt for a road right along the frontier, satellite photos analyzed by The Associated Press show. Israeli troops have entered the demilitarized zone during the work, the United Nations confirmed to the AP, a violation of the cease-fire rules governing the area. The work, which earlier satellite photos show began in earnest in late September, follows the completion by the Israeli military of new roadways and what appears to be a buffer zone along the Gaza Strip's frontier with Israel. The Israel military also has begun demolishing villages in Lebanon, where United Nations peacekeepers have come under fire. So far, there has been no major violence along the Alpha Line, which delineates the demilitarized zone between Syria and Israeli-occupied territory that U.N. peacekeepers have patrolled since 1974. Syria, which has been at war with Israel since its founding in 1948 and relies on Iran for support, has remained silent regarding the construction. But the Golan Heights remain a flashpoint for the two countries — making any changes along the border potentially that much more sensitive. The Israeli military did not respond to requests for comment and Syrian officials in Damascus declined to comment. High-resolution images taken on Nov. 5 by Planet Labs PBC for the AP show over 7.5 kilometers (4.6 miles) of construction along the Alpha Line, starting some 3 kilometers (1.8 miles) southeast of the Israeli-held Druze town of Majdal Shams, where a July rocket strike killed 12 children playing soccer. The images appear to show a trench between two embankments, parts of which appear to have been laid with fresh asphalt. There also appears to be fencing running along it as well toward the Syrian side. The construction follows a southeast route before heading due south along the Alpha Line, and then again cutting southeast. The images show excavators and other earth-moving equipment actively digging along the route, with more asphalt piled there. The area is also believed to be littered with unexploded ordnance and mines from decades of conflict. The United Nations maintains a peacekeeping force in the demilitarized zone called the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, or UNDOF. 'In recent months, UNDOF has observed construction activity being carried out by the IDF along the cease-fire line,' U.N. peacekeeping spokesperson Nick Birnback told the AP, using an acronym for the Israeli military. 'In this regard, UNDOF has observed in some instances, IDF personnel, Israeli excavators, other construction equipment and the construction itself encroach into the area of separation.' Birnback added that 'no military forces, equipment or activity by either Israel or Syria are permitted in the area of separation.' While Israel hasn’t acknowledged the construction, it sent a 71-page letter in June to the U.N. outlining what it described as 'Syrian violations of the Alpha Line and armed presence in the area of separation (that) occur daily.' The letter cited numerous Israeli-alleged violations by Syrian civilians crossing the line. 'Syrian violations of that agreement only heighten tensions in our already volatile region,' the letter added. Syria has repeatedly accused Israel of launching attacks against it from territory it occupies in the Golan Heights. Israel has repeatedly struck Syria over the years, particularly after the start of the Mideast wars following Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, assault on Israel. Syrian President Bashar Assad, who has clung to power despite his country's long war stemming from the 2011 Arab Spring protests, criticized Israel during a summit in Saudi Arabia in which leaders discussed Israel's wars in both the Gaza Strip and Lebanon. 'As for the tools, I believe that we possess them collectively, popularly and officially, Arabs and Muslims, countries and people,' Assad said. 'What we need is the decision to use them if the Israeli entity refuses to respond. ... Without that, we are inciting the continuation of the genocide and becoming indirect partners in it.' Israel seized control of the Golan Heights from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war. After the 1973 Mideast war, the U.N. Secretary Council voted to create UNDOF to patrol a roughly 400 square kilometer (155 square mile) demilitarized zone and maintain the peace there. A second demarcation, known as the Bravo Line, marks the limit of where the Syrian military can operate. UNDOF has around 1,100 troops, mostly from Fiji, India, Kazakhstan, Nepal and Uruguay, who patrol the area. Israel annexed the Golan Heights in 1981 — a move criticized by a U.N. resolution declaring Israel’s action as 'null and void and without international legal effect.' The territory, some 1,200 square kilometers (460 square miles) in size, is a strategic high ground that overlooks both Israel and Syria. The population of around 50,000 Jewish settlers and Arabs who are mostly members of the Druze sect of Shiite Islam. In 2019, President Donald Trump unilaterally announced that the United States would 'fully recognize' Israel’s control of the territory, a decision that has been unchanged by the Biden administration.	https://apnews.com/article/mideast-israel-syria-alpha-line-construction-6f1bf012a39f721ab36f33f1c6bea2b6	2024-11-11T07:04:13-08:00	
Kremlin rejects reports of a conversation last week between Putin and Trump	The Kremlin on Monday rejected reports that President Vladimir Putin spoke last week with President-elect Donald Trump about the war in Ukraine, and a spokesman for Trump refused to comment on what he called his 'private calls' with world leaders. The Washington Post first reported on Sunday, citing anonymous sources, that the two spoke on Thursday, with Trump advising Putin not to escalate the war in Ukraine and cited the sizable U.S. military presence in Europe. In a conference call Monday with journalists, Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov said 'there was no conversation' and the report was 'completely untrue, it is pure fiction.' Asked about the report, Trump's communications director Steven Cheung said, 'We do not comment on private calls between President Trump and other world leaders.' Speaking at a foreign policy forum Thursday in Russia's Black Sea resort of Sochi, Putin offered congratulations to Trump on his election victory and praised him for what he said was 'brave' behavior during an assassination attempt on him in July. Peskov said 'there are no specific plans yet' for a conversation between Putin and Trump. He said previously that contacts between the two before Trump's inauguration 'are not ruled out' and pointed to Trump saying that he would call Putin before the inauguration. He denied, however, that Russia's presidential administration or Foreign Ministry had any contacts with Trump's campaign after the election. During his campaign, Trump repeatedly said he could quickly end the fighting in Ukraine but did not offer details of how he would accomplish that. Russia has intensified strikes on civilian areas in Ukraine as the war approaches its 1,000-day mark. For its part, Ukraine over the weekend sent a massive wave of drones that rattled Moscow and its suburbs.	https://apnews.com/article/putin-trump-ukraine-russia-fbd7df1a924cb9c343d426370416086e	2024-11-11T05:44:21-08:00	
Vatican, Microsoft create AI-generated St. Peter's Basilica to allow virtual visits, log damage	VATICAN CITY (AP) — The Vatican and Microsoft on Monday unveiled a digital twin of St. Peter’s Basilica that uses artificial intelligence to explore one of the world’s most important monument’s while helping the Holy See manage visitor flows and identify conservation problems. Using 400,000 high-resolution digital photographs, taken with drones, cameras and lasers over four weeks when no one was in the basilica, the digital replica is going online alongside two new on-site exhibits to provide visitors -- real and virtual -- with an interactive experience. 'It is literally one of the most technologically advanced and sophisticated projects of its kind that has ever been pursued,' Microsoft's president Brad Smith told a Vatican press conference. The project has been launched ahead of the Vatican's 2025 Jubilee, a holy year in which more than 30 million pilgrims are expected to pass through the basilica’s Holy Door, on top of the 50,000 who visit on a normal day. 'Everyone, really everyone should feel welcome in this great house,' Pope Francis told Smith and members of the project's development teams at an audience Monday. The digital platform allows visitors to reserve entry times to the basilica, a novelty for one of the world’s most visited monuments that regularly has an hours-long line of tourists waiting to get in. But the heart of the project is the creation of a digital twin of St. Peter’s Basilica through advanced photogrammetry and artificial intelligence that allows anyone to 'visit' the church and learn about its history. The ultra-precise 3D replica, developed in collaboration with digital preservation company Iconem, incorporates 22 petabytes of data — enough to fill five million DVDs — Smith said. The images have already identified structural damage and signs of deterioration, such as missing mosaic pieces, cracks and fissures invisible to the naked eye, with a speed and precision far beyond human capabilities. Francis has called for the ethical use of AI and used his annual World Message of Peace this year to urge an international treaty to regulate it, arguing that technology lacking human values of compassion, mercy, morality and forgiveness were too great. On Monday, he thanked the Microsoft team and basilica workers responsible for the project and marveled at how modern technology was helping spread an ancient faith and preserve a piece of world patrimony, which celebrates the 400th anniversary of its consecration in 2026. 'This house of prayer for all peoples has been entrusted to us by those who have preceded us in faith and apostolic ministry,' he told Smith and the delegation. 'Therefore, it is a gift and a task to care for it, in both a spiritual and material sense, even through the latest technologies.' Smith declined to give a price tag for Microsoft’s investment in the project, saying only it was 'substantial' and was borne of Francis’ initiative in 2018 to bring tech companies together to promote ethnically minded AI. He said Microsoft had done similar AI projects at Mont Saint-Michel in France and Ancient Olympia, in Greece. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Trump chooses New York Rep. Elise Stefanik as ambassador to the United Nations	NEW YORK (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump has chosen Rep. Elise Stefanik to serve as his ambassador to the United Nations, picking a loyal ally with little foreign policy experience to represent the U.S. at the international organization. 'Elise is an incredibly strong, tough, and smart America First fighter,' Trump said in a statement Monday announcing his pick for the role — his first selection that will require Senate confirmation. Stefanik, 40, who serves as House Republican Conference Chair, has long been one of Trump's most loyal allies in the House, and was among those discussed as a potential vice presidential choice. She will be thrown into the world body’s deep divisions from the wars in the Mideast and Ukraine to reining in nuclear programs in North Korea and Iran. She will also come face-to-face almost daily in the U.N. Security Council with the ambassadors of Russia and China whose countries are now strongly allied and looking warily at a second Trump presidency – and sometimes with their counterparts from North Korea and Iran. Stefanik will succeed U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, a career diplomat and former assistant secretary of state for Africa who has held the job through the entire Biden administration and has been a member of his Cabinet. Stefanik also will be a member of Trump's Cabinet, he said in the statement. In Trump’s first administration, he chose former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, who had little foreign experience except for some trade missions, for the U.N. post. She resigned after two years and then challenged Trump for the GOP nomination. Haley was succeeded by then U.S. ambassador to Canada Kelly Craft, wife of a Kentucky coal magnate, who in 2023 was unsuccessful in her bid for the GOP nomination for governor of the state. John Bolton, a former U.S. national security adviser under Trump and ambassador to the U.N. during the Bush administration, told The Associated Press that he sees Stefanik as the 2024 version of Haley. 'She wants to run for president in 2028. She realizes she has no foreign policy experience so what better way than to become U.N. ambassador,' Bolton said. 'She stays two years, and then away we go.' Born and raised in upstate New York, Stefanik graduated from Harvard and worked in former President George W. Bush’s White House on the domestic policy council and in the chief of staff’s office. In 2014, at 30, she became the youngest woman ever elected to Congress, representing upstate New York. She later became the youngest woman to serve in House leadership. Stefanik was known early in her tenure as a more moderate conservative voice. But she soon attached herself to the former president, quietly remaking her image into that of a staunch MAGA ally — and seeing her power ascend. She became the House Republican Conference Chair in 2021. Stefanik spent years positioning herself as one of Trump’s most trusted allies and confidants on the Hill. She endorsed him in the 2024 race before he had even launched his bid, and aggressively campaigned on his behalf during the GOP primary. She saw her profile rise after her aggressive questioning of a trio of university presidents over antisemitism on their campuses led to two of their resignations — a performance Trump repeatedly praised. She also defended him vigorously in both of his impeachment trials and railed against his four criminal indictments, including filing an ethics complaint in New York against the judge who heard his civil fraud case. While she is a member of the House Armed Services Committee and serves on the coveted House committee that oversees national intelligence, her pick further solidifies Trump’s preference for unconditional loyalty in his second administration over career experience. One area of foreign policy that Stefanik has been vocal about is Israel. Since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, Stefanik has focused much of her attention on the United Nations, accusing the world body and international organizations of antisemitism for their criticism of Israel’s bombardment of Gaza, which has resulted in the death of more than 43,000 Palestinians, according to their Health Ministry. She has gone as far as calling last month for a 'complete reassessment' of U.S. funding for the United Nations, while helping push for the blocking of American support for the U.N. agency that provides humanitarian aid to Palestinians in the region. Her departure for the United Nations would also mean that Republicans, who are on track to have a razor-thin majority in the House, would be down one crucial vote. But Stefanik’s district is located in a deeply red part of upstate New York, where Republicans are likely guaranteed to win the special election that would take place after she leaves office. 'Republicans will hold this safe Republican seat as part of a Republican majority in the House that will help deliver on President Trump’s historic mandate,' Ed Cox, the chair of the New York Republican party, said in a statement Monday. Trump did not say much about the U.N. during his campaign, but has generally advocated for a less interventionist foreign policy. He also has repeatedly questioned the utility of international alliances, including NATO, and he has threatened allies with higher tariffs and said he will not protect them unless they contribute more to their own defense. Trump also has talked about how he initially wanted to select his eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump, for the role after he was elected the first time. ''You would be a great ambassador to the United Nations, United Nations secretary.' There’d be nobody to compete with her, I tell you,' he said at a Moms for Liberty Summit in August. 'She may be my daughter, but nobody could have competed with her.' ___ Amiri reported from Washington.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-united-nations-elise-stefanik-ambassador-2b482fb39a8d6f03d389d27cc8820056	2024-11-11T04:27:53-08:00	
Today in History: November 17, the NFL’s infamous 'Heidi Game'	Today is Sunday, Nov. 17, the 322nd day of 2024. There are 44 days left in the year. Today in history: On Nov. 17, 1968, the last minutes of a tense NFL matchup on NBC between the New York Jets and the Oakland Raiders were preempted by the children’s film 'Heidi.' The network received thousands of calls from angry viewers and formally apologized. Also on this date: In 1800, Congress held its first session in the partially completed U.S. Capitol building in Washington, D.C. In 1869, the Suez Canal opened in Egypt. In 1973, President Richard Nixon told a gathering of Associated Press managing editors at a televised news conference in Orlando, Florida: 'People have got to know whether or not their president is a crook. Well, I’m not a crook.' In 1989, an estimated 10,000-15,000 Czechoslovakian students demonstrated in Prague against Communist rule; hundreds of thousands joined the protests in the following days. Dubbed the 'Velvet Revolution' for its nonviolent nature, the protests led to the resignation of the Communist Party’s leadership on Nov. 28. In 1997, 62 people, most of them foreign tourists, were killed when militants opened fire at the Temple of Hatshepsut (haht-shehp-SOOT’) in Luxor, Egypt; the attackers were killed by police. In 2003, Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Austrian-born actor who had become one of America’s biggest movie stars of the 1980s and ’90s, was sworn in as the 38th governor of California. In 2020, President Donald Trump fired the nation’s top election security official, Christopher Krebs, who had refuted Trump’s unsubstantiated claims of electoral fraud and vouched for the integrity of the vote.

Russian glide bombs, drones and a ballistic missile kill 6, injure 30 in Ukraine	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russian glide bombs, drones and a ballistic missile smashed into cities in southern and eastern Ukraine on Monday, officials said, killing at least six civilians and injuring about 30 others. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Russia has recently intensified strikes that have long tormented civilian areas, in an apparent effort to unnerve Ukrainians and wear down their willingness to keep up a war that is approaching its 1,000-day milestone. 'Every day, every night, Russia commits the same terror,' Zelenskyy said in a post on the Telegram messaging app. 'Except that an increasing number of civilian objects are becoming targets.' Both Russia and Ukraine are waiting to see how Washington will change its policy on the war after Donald Trump takes office as the U.S. president in January. The U.S. is the biggest provider of military help to Ukraine, but Trump has chided the Biden administration for giving Kyiv tens of billions of dollars of aid. The Ukrainian army intends to expand its mobile units, which are primarily tasked with shooting down drones, in the regions most frequently targeted by Russian strikes, Zelenskyy said on Telegram. He also said that Ukraine is working on producing its own glide bombs as part of a domestic missile program. Russian glide bombs have significantly impacted the battlefield, as their destructive power reduces settlements to rubble and makes it increasingly difficult for Ukrainian forces to hold their defensive fortifications. Ukrainian forces are being slowly pushed backward in the eastern Donetsk region, where Russia is bringing its greater military might to bear. Zelenskyy said Ukraine would conduct a 'substantial reinforcement' in areas near the Donetsk settlements of Kurakhove and Pokrovsk, where Ukraine’s army is in danger of being overrun. Zelenskyy added that Ukraine is holding its positions in Russia’s Kursk border region, where Western and Ukrainian officials say Russia is being helped by thousands of newly arrived North Korean troops. He said Russia has deployed some 50,000 troops to Kursk. Also in Donetsk, near the recently captured settlement of Hirnyk, the Russians have damaged a dam at the Kurakhove reservoir, regional Gov. Vadym Filashkin said. The local water level in the Vovcha River has risen by 1.2 meters, though no homes have been affected, and possible flooding threatens both the Donetsk and Dnipropetrovsk regions, he said. 'We continue to monitor the water level in the river and are prepared for any developments,' Filashkin said. The development revived memories of the collapse of the Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine in June 2023, killing hundreds of people. An Associated Press investigation found the collapse was likely caused by Russian forces. The major cities struck Monday by Russia are close to the approximately 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line. Russian drones hammered the southern city of Mykolaiv, killing five people and injuring a 45-year-old woman, local authorities said. Around two dozen people sought psychological help following the attack that damaged houses and stores, officials said. Mykolaiv, about 60 kilometers (40 miles) northwest of the front line in the Kherson region, frequently comes under Russian attack. An overnight attack on Zaporizhzhia, also in the south, with three powerful glide bombs killed one person and injured 21, including a 4-year-old boy, Ukraine’s National Police said. The strikes partially destroyed a two-story apartment building and damaged a dormitory. A five-story apartment building in Kryvyi Rih, Zelenskyy’s hometown in central Ukraine, was hit by a Russian ballistic missile, injuring at least eight people. The missile destroyed all five stories in one part of the building, said Oleksandr Vikul, head of Kryviy Rih Military Administration. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s intelligence agency claimed in a statement it destroyed a Russian Mi-24 assault helicopter parked at the Klin-5 airfield in the Moscow region. The claim could not be independently verified. The Russian Defense Ministry said Monday that 17 Ukrainian drones were destroyed over the Russian regions of Kursk, Belgorod and Voronezh overnight and in the morning. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-drones-bombs-missiles-c10b8419748e8874f331ea185439c8b5	2024-11-11T02:32:35-08:00	
17 Chadian soldiers and 96 rebels killed in a Boko Haram attack, army says	N'DJAMENA, Chad (AP) — Boko Haram insurgents killed 17 Chadian soldiers in a weekend attack on a military post that also left 96 of the assailants dead in the country's west, Chad's army said. The attack in the Lake Chad region happened on Saturday, army spokesperson Gen. Issakh Acheikh said on national television Sunday night. He did not provide details. The Lake Chad region has been plagued this year by frequent attacks from insurgents, including Boko Haram and the Islamic State in West Africa. It has revived fears of violence after a period of peace following a successful operation launched in 2020 by the Chadian army to destroy the extremist groups' bases. Last month, 40 soldiers were killed during an attack on a military base, prompting President Mahamat Deby Itno to launch an operation to dislodge Boko Haram militants from Lake Chad. In March, an attack the government blamed on Boko Haram killed seven soldiers. Boko Haram, which launched an insurgency more than a decade ago against Western education, seeks to establish Islamic law in Nigeria’s northeast. The insurgency has spread to West African neighbors including Cameroon, Niger and Chad. Chad, a country of nearly 18 million people, has been reeling from political turmoil before and after a controversial presidential election that resulted in Deby Itno’s victory. He had led the country as interim president during the period of military rule that followed the death of his father in 2021.	https://apnews.com/article/chad-boko-haram-attack-lake-chad-ab1759cb14e8d0b98d533c60cc6170d5	2024-11-11T00:50:33-08:00	
Remembering Armistice Day: Starmer joins Macron to celebrate Franco-British friendship in Paris	PARIS (AP) — British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is joining French President Emmanuel Macron at a Paris ceremony marking the 106th anniversary of the Armistice on Monday. It's a celebration of their countries' friendship, as nations across the world pay tribute to their fallen soldiers in World War I. This is the first time a British leader has done so since Winston Churchill was hosted by Gen. Charles de Gaulle in 1944, Starmer's office said. The Paris ceremony echoes Franco-British commemorations 80 years ago, when Allied troops liberated most of France's territory from Nazi occupation, Macron's office said. This year also marks the 120th anniversary of the Entente Cordiale, the historic agreement between France and the United Kingdom. On Monday morning, Starmer and Macron will first meet at the Elysee presidential palace, before heading toward the Champs-Elysees avenue to lay wreaths at the nearby statues of Georges Clemenceau, French prime minister at the time of the Armistice, and Churchill. They will then lead the traditional ceremony at the Arc de Triomphe monument where they will relight the flame of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. The French Army Choir is to sing France’s national anthem, 'La Marseillaise,' and the British anthem, 'God Save the King.' 'I am honored to be in Paris to stand united with President Macron in tribute to the fallen of the First World War who made the ultimate sacrifice for the freedom we enjoy today,' Starmer said. The prime minister also announced that the British government has earmarked more than 10 million pounds for next year’s 80th anniversary of the Allied victory in Europe and the subsequent defeat of Japan ending World War II.	https://apnews.com/article/armistice-wwi-commemorations-france-britain-50917f6b1af41a27cfc84417def76fe8	2024-11-10T23:16:56-08:00	
Middle East latest: Israeli strike kills 3 people in central Gaza, Palestinian officials say	Palestinian medical officials say an Israeli strike hit a tent sheltering a displaced family in the central Gaza Strip, killing at least three people, including the parents of twins. The strike late Sunday in the urban Nuseirat refugee camp wounded the two children, aged 10, who were being treated for serious injuries at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the nearby city of Deir al-Balah. The details of the casualties were listed in hospital records and an Associated Press reporter saw two of the bodies. The Israeli military says it only targets militants and accuses them of hiding among civilians. Palestinians reported heavy bombing late Sunday in the western areas of Nuseirat camp, which dates back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation. At least 24 people were wounded and taken to the Awda hospital in Nuseirat, said Mohamed Muhareb, head of the hospital’s ambulance service. The Israel-Hamas war began after militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. Israel’s military response in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 people, Palestinian health officials say. They do not distinguish between civilians and combatants, but say more than half of those killed were women and children. Hezbollah began firing into Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, in solidarity with Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Since the conflict erupted, more than 3,100 people have been killed and nearly 13,900 wounded in Lebanon, the Health Ministry reported. ___ Here's the latest: UN says more than 200 children have been killed in war in Lebanon BEIRUT — The United Nations children’s agency says the war between Israel and Hezbollah has killed more than 200 children in Lebanon. They include seven children who were among 23 people killed in an Israeli airstrike in northern Lebanon on Sunday. UNICEF said protecting children from harm during war is a legal obligation and called for a cease-fire. Lebanon’s Health Ministry says at least 3,189 people have been killed and over 14,000 wounded in Lebanon in more than a year of conflict between Israel and the Hezbollah militant group. Some 1.2 million people have been displaced. On the Israeli side, 68 soldiers and 41 civilians have been killed in the fighting since October 2023, according to the prime minister’s office. More than 60,000 people have been displaced from their homes. Hezbollah began firing rockets, missiles and drones into Israel, and drawing retaliatory strikes, the day after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack out of Gaza ignited the war there. Hezbollah and Hamas are allies backed by Iran. Hezbollah acknowledged the killing of nearly 500 of its fighters in the first 11 months of the conflict but stopped updating that toll after all-out war erupted in September. Yemen's Houthi rebels say they launched a missile targeting Israel DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Yemen’s Houthi rebels on Monday claimed they launched a missile targeting Israel. Houthi military spokesman Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree made the claim in a prerecorded video message, claiming that the rebels launched a Palestine-2 ballistic missile he described as a 'hypersonic' toward a military base. The Israeli military said it 'intercepted one projectile that approached Israel from the direction of Yemen.' The Israelis also said the fire did not enter Israeli territory. The Houthis have launched missiles and targeted ships through the Red Sea corridor over the ongoing Mideast wars. The rebels separately said sites in the country came under attack in likely U.S. airstrikes early Monday morning, something not immediately acknowledged by the Americans. Senior UAE diplomat calls for de-escalation in Mideast wars DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — A senior diplomat for the United Arab Emirates called on the world to focus on the plight of civilians and de-escalate the ongoing Mideast wars. Anwar Gargash’s remarks Monday, made at the Abu Dhabi Strategic Debate, followed the pattern of comments made by the UAE amid the Mideast wars. The UAE, a federation of seven sheikhdoms home to Dubai, diplomatically recognized Israel in 2020. 'The complexities of the region require a steady hand and a clear and consistent vision,' Gargash said. 'The recent cycle of escalation between Israel and Iran cannot become a permanent feature of the strategic landscape of our region. This must be addressed through a political framework.' He called for 'pragmatism' and a 'serious political horizon' to resolve the wider Israeli-Palestinian conflict and reach a two-state solution. He described the war in the Gaza Strip as being 'driven by extremists on both sides, from the Israeli and Arab side.' Yet he also called the 'systemic violence' faced by Palestinians in Gaza 'criminal and unacceptable.' He added: 'At the present time, it is vital to identify that not all crises stem from the Palestinian issue, yet it undeniably remains central to the conflict in our region.' The UAE has provided aid for both the Gaza Strip and Lebanon in the wars, while maintaining its diplomatic ties with Israel. The UAE has, however, strenuously criticized Israel’s conduct at times in public in the wars. Gargash also offered criticism of governance in both the Palestinian territories and Lebanon. 'In both Palestine and Lebanon, a drastic reform is essential for the world to step in and provide considerable support,' Gargash said. ___ For more Middle East news: https://apnews.com/hub/middle-east	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-hezbollah-mideast-latest-11-november-2024-8c59ef1c325baf6267bedd8ca4bf4aa6	2024-11-10T22:11:49-08:00	
Round 2 in the Trump-vs-Mexico matchup looks ominous for Mexico	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico is facing a second Donald Trump presidency, and few countries can match its experience as a target of Trump's rhetoric: There have been threats to close the border, impose tariffs and even send U.S. forces to fight Mexican drug cartels if the country doesn’t do more to stem the flow of migrants and drugs. That’s not to mention what mass deportations of migrants who are in the U.S. illegally could do to remittances — the money sent home by migrants — that have become one of Mexico’s main sources of income. But as much as this second round looks like the first round — when Mexico pacified Trump by quietly ceding to his immigration demands — circumstances have changed, and not necessarily for the better. Today, Mexico has in Claudia Sheinbaum a somewhat stern leftist ideologue as president, and Trump is not known for handling such relations well. Back in 2019, Mexico’s then-President Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador was a charismatic, plain-spoken, folksy leader who seemed to understand Trump, because both had a transactional view of politics: You give me what I want, I’ll give you what you want. The two went on to form a chummy relationship. But while López Obrador was forged in the give-and-take politics of the often-corrupt former ruling party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, Sheinbaum grew up in a family of leftist activists and got her political experience in radical university student movements. 'Claudia is more ideological than López Obrador, and so the problem is that I see her potentially responding to Trumpian policies, whether it’s, you know, organized crime or immigration or tariffs with a much more nationalistic, jingoistic view of the relationship,' said Arturo Sarukhan, Mexico’s former ambassador to the U.S. from 2007 to 2013. Sheinbaum made a point of being one of the first world leaders to call Trump on Thursday to congratulate him after the election, but during the call Trump did two things that may say a lot about how things will go. First, Sheinbaum said, Trump quickly brought up the border to remind her there were issues there. Then he asked Sheinbaum to send his greetings to López Obrador, with whom Trump said he had 'a very good relationship.' That might suggest that Trump believes that López Obrador — the new president's political mentor — is still in charge, a view shared by some analysts. Sarukhan said he believes the fact that Sheinbaum is a woman and is from Mexico will be 'a very important challenge, an issue out there as both of them get going in their relationship.' Not everything has changed for the worse: C ross-border trade has topped $800 billion per year and U.S. companies are more dependent than ever on Mexican plants. But the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, or USMCA, is coming up for review, and Mexico has made legal changes that Trump could seize on to demand a re-negotiation of parts of the deal. Sheinbaum has suggested Mexico won't give in even if backed into a corner, saying 'we obviously are going to address any problems that come up with dialogue, as a collaborative process, and if not, we are going to stand up, we are prepared to do that with great unity.' Standing up hasn’t worked particularly well before. In 2018, Marcelo Ebrard was Mexico’s top diplomat; former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Ebrard basically bent to U.S. demands to keep asylum seekers in Mexico and accept migrants back even if they weren’t Mexicans. Ebrard just asked that the deal not be made public to avoid embarrassing López Obrador, Pompeo wrote. (Ebrard later claimed he had avoided signing a much worse ‘safe third country’ agreement.) Today, Ebrard is Mexico’s economy secretary, and would lead Mexico’s delegation in the scheduled 2026 review of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement, something that Trump has greeted with mirth ('I've never seen anybody fold like that,' Trump once said of Ebrard.) Ebrard on Thursday downplayed any risks this time around, saying e conomic ties between the two countries would keep Trump from closing borders or imposing tariffs. 'I am optimistic. Unlike other countries, we are the largest trading partner (of the U.S.), so, if you put up a tariff, that will have repercussions in the United States,' Ebrard said. 'I’m not saying it is going to be easy, because it is not at all easy, but the relationship with President Trump will be good because, what unites us? These numbers, this gigantic economy.' But some former diplomats say any argument that Mexico can avoid friction with the Trump administration is overconfident, and that 2025 is not necessarily going to be like 2019. Martha Bárcena, Mexico’s ambassador to the U.S. from 2018 to 2021, said she doesn't think Trump would back away from campaign promises to deport migrants who are in the country illegally. She said Mexican officials who believe Trump might temper his 'campaign promises because Mexican migrants are necessary for the U.S. economy' are being overly optimistic. 'Mexico is looking at it through the lens of economic logic. The logic that the Trump campaign applies on immigration is a logic of national security and cultural identity issues,' Bárcena said. Some of Trump's biggest policy concerns – restoring U.S. jobs and the increasing rivalry with China — also run through Mexico. U.S. and foreign automakers have set up dozens of plants in Mexico, and some in the U.S. worry that Chinese companies could do the same to take advantage of existing trade rules to export Chinese cars or auto parts to the United States. It doesn’t help that Sheinbaum has pushed through López Obrador’s policies aimed at eliminating independent regulatory and oversight bodies, and laws the U.S. government says could reduce the independence of the judiciary, both of which are required under the USMCA trade agreement. 'If they go ahead with the elimination of independent regulators and autonomous bodies, that’s going to be a further violation of the USMCA,' Sarukhan said. 'And then that’s going to make things even worse. Obviously, the big piece is going to be China and the Chinese footprint in Mexico.' That could lead Trump to demand the re-negotiation of all auto industry agreements under the trade pact. As far as efforts to jointly combat the illegal drug trade — such cooperation fell to historic lows in 2019 and 2020 — there have been some modestly encouraging signs. Last week, Mexico announced the seizure in Tijuana of over 300,000 fentanyl pills after months when t he country’s entire seizures had amounted to as little as 50 grams — a couple of ounces — per week. Sheinbaum, who took office on Oct. 1, also appears to be tacitly abandoning López Obrador’s strategy of not confronting drug cartels. But neither she nor her predecessor and political mentor could ever accept any Trump plan to send U.S. forces to operate independently on Mexican soil. It remains to see how far Trump might go; he often makes only token gestures to carry through on threats. But Sarukhan noted, 'I do think that he will talk loudly and carry a big stick.'	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-donald-trump-threats-tariffs-border-closing-deportations-b9f11e55911613cf72ac1d5695bba5ec	2024-11-10T21:06:10-08:00

Research reveals China has built prototype nuclear reactor to power aircraft carrier	Bangkok (AP) — China has built a land-based prototype nuclear reactor for a large surface warship, in the clearest sign yet Beijing is advancing toward producing the country’s first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, according to a new analysis of satellite imagery and Chinese government documents provided to The Associated Press. There have long been rumors that China is planning to build a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, but the research by the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California is the first to confirm it is working on a nuclear-powered propulsion system for a carrier-sized surface warship. Why is China's pursuit of nuclear-powered carriers significant? China’s navy is already the world’s largest numerically, and it has been rapidly modernizing. Adding nuclear-powered carriers to its fleet would be a major step in realizing its ambitions for a true 'blue-water' force capable of operating around the globe in a growing challenge to the United States. Nuclear carriers take longer to build than conventional carriers, but once in operation they are able to stay at sea for much longer because they do not need to refuel, and there is more room on board for fuel and weapons for aircraft, thus extending their capabilities. They are also able to produce more power to run advanced systems. Right now, only the United States and France have nuclear-powered carriers. The U.S. has 11 in total, which allows it to keep multiple strike groups deployed around the world at all times, including in the Indo-Pacific. But the Pentagon is growingly increasingly concerned about China’s rapid modernization of its fleet, including the design and construction of new carriers. China currently has three carriers, including the new Type 003 Fujian, which was the first both designed and built by China. It has said work is already underway on a fourth, but it has not announced whether that will be nuclear or conventionally powered. The modernization aligns with China’s 'growing emphasis on the maritime domain and increasing demands' for its navy 'to operate at greater distances from mainland China,' the Defense Department said in its most recent report to Congress on China’s military. How did researchers conclude China has built a prototype reactor for a carrier? Middlebury researchers were initially investigating a mountain site outside the city of Leshan in the southwest Chinese province of Sichuan over suspicions that China was building a reactor to produce plutonium or tritium for weapons. Instead they said they determined that China was building a prototype reactor for a large warship. The conclusion was based upon a wide variety of sources, including satellite images, project tenders, personnel files, and environmental impact studies. The reactor is housed in a new facility built at the site known as Base 909, which is under the control of the Nuclear Power Institute of China. Documents indicating that China’s 701 Institute, which is responsible for aircraft carrier development, procured reactor equipment 'intended for installation on a large surface warship.' as well as the project’s 'national defense designation' helped lead to the conclusion the sizeable reactor is a prototype for a next-generation aircraft carrier. What does China say? Chinese President Xi Jinping has tasked defense officials with building a 'first-class' navy and becoming a maritime power as part of his blueprint for the country’s great rejuvenation. The country’s most recent white paper on national defense, dated 2019, said the Chinese navy was adjusting to strategic requirements by 'speeding up the transition of its tasks from defense on the near seas to protection missions on the far seas.' Sea trials hadn’t even started for the new Fujian aircraft carrier in March when Yuan Huazhi, political commissar for China’s People’s Liberation Army Navy, confirmed the construction of a fourth carrier. Asked if it would be nuclear-powered, he said at the time that would 'soon be announced,' but so far it has not been. Neither China's Defense Ministry nor Foreign Affairs Ministry responded to requests for comment. Even if the carrier that has been started will likely be another conventionally-powered Type 003 ship, experts say Chinese shipyards have the capability to work on more than one carrier at a time, and that they could produce a new nuclear-powered vessel concurrently. ___ Tang reported from Washington D.C.	https://apnews.com/article/china-nuclear-aircraft-carrier-glance-8863fefa646e4a9d89c45d91c068696d	2024-11-10T20:18:35-08:00	
Satellite images and documents indicate China working on nuclear propulsion for new aircraft carrier	BANGKOK (AP) — China has built a land-based prototype nuclear reactor for a large surface warship, in the clearest sign yet Beijing is advancing toward producing its first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, according to a new analysis of satellite imagery and Chinese government documents provided to The Associated Press. China’s navy is already the world’s largest numerically, and it has been rapidly modernizing. Adding nuclear-powered carriers to its fleet would be a major step in realizing its ambitions for a true 'blue-water' force capable of operating in seas far from China in a growing global challenge to the United States. 'Nuclear-powered carriers would place China in the exclusive ranks of first-class naval powers, a group currently limited to the United States and France,' said Tong Zhao, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, D.C. 'For China’s leadership, such a development would symbolize national prestige, fueling domestic nationalism and elevating the country’s global image as a leading power.' Researchers at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California said they made the finding while investigating a mountain site outside the city of Leshan in the southwest Chinese province of Sichuan, where they suspected China was building a reactor to produce plutonium or tritium for weapons. Instead they concluded that China was building a prototype reactor for a large warship. The project at Leshan is dubbed the Longwei, or Dragon Might, Project and is also referred to as the Nuclear Power Development Project in documents. Neither China’s Defense Ministry nor Foreign Affairs Ministry responded to requests for comment. Satellite images and public documents helped identify likely carrier project There have long been rumors that China is planning to build a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, but the research by the Middlebury team is the first to confirm that China is working on a nuclear-powered propulsion system for a carrier-sized surface warship. 'The reactor prototype at Leshan is the first solid evidence that China is, in fact, developing a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier,' said Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at Middlebury and one of the researchers on the project. 'Operating a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier is an exclusive club, one that China looks set to join.' Drawing on satellite images and public documents including project tenders, personnel files, environmental impact studies — and even a citizen’s complaint about noisy construction and excessive dust — they concluded a prototype reactor for naval propulsion was being built in the mountains of Mucheng township, some 70 miles (112 kilometers) southwest of Sichuan's provincial capital Chengdu. The reactor, which procurement documents indicate will soon be operational, is housed in a new facility built at the site known as Base 909, which houses six other reactors that are operational, decommissioned or under construction, according to the analysis. The site is under the control of the Nuclear Power Institute of China, a subsidiary of the China National Nuclear Corporation, which is tasked with reactor engineering research and testing. Documents indicating that China’s 701 Institute, formally known as China Ship Research and Design Center, which is responsible for aircraft carrier development, procured reactor equipment 'intended for installation on a large surface warship' under the Nuclear Power Development Project as well as the project’s 'national defense designation' helped lead to the conclusion the sizable reactor is a prototype for a next-generation aircraft carrier. Satellite mages from 2020 to 2023 have shown the demolition of homes and the construction of water intake infrastructure connected to the reactor site. Contracts for steam generators and turbine pumps indicate the project involves a pressurized water reactor with a secondary circuit — a profile that is consistent with naval propulsion reactors, the researchers say. An environmental impact report calls the Longwei Project a 'national defense-related construction project' that is classified 'secret.' 'Unless China is developing nuclear-powered cruisers, which were pursued only by the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War, then the Nuclear Power Development Project most certainly refers to a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier development effort,' researchers wrote in a detailed 19-page report on their findings shared exclusively with the AP. Jamie Withorne, an analyst at the Oslo Nuclear Project who was not involved in the research and reviewed the findings, said Middlebury's team made a 'convincing argument.' 'From the identifying reports, co-location with other naval reactor facilities, and correlating construction activity, I think it can be said that it is likely the Longwei Project is housed at Base 909, and it could potentially be located at the identified building,' she said. The research does not, however, provide clues as to when a Chinese nuclear-powered carrier could be built and become operational, she said. Sarah Laderman, a senior analyst with Open Nuclear Network, a program of the U.S.-based NGO PAX sapiens foundation, said the findings were 'carefully conducted and thoroughly researched.' 'Given the evidence presented here, I see a compelling case made that China seems to be working towards building a nuclear propulsion system for its naval surface ships (likely aircraft carriers) at this location,' said Laderman, who is based in Vienna and was not involved in Middlebury’s research. Pursuit of a nuclear-powered carrier China’s first carrier, commissioned in 2012, was a repurposed Soviet ship, and its second was built in China but based upon the Soviet design. Both ships — named the Liaoning and the Shandong — employ a so-called 'ski-jump' type launch method, with a ramp at the end of a short runway to help planes take off. The Type 003 Fujian, launched in 2022, was the country's third carrier and its first to be indigenously designed and built. It employs an electromagnetic-type launch system like those developed and used by the U.S. Navy. All three carriers are conventionally powered. Sea trials hadn’t even started for the Fujian in March when Yuan Huazhi, political commissar for China’s People’s Liberation Army Navy, confirmed the construction of a fourth carrier. Asked if it would be nuclear-powered, he said at the time that would 'soon be announced,' but so far it has not been. There has been speculation that China may begin producing two new carriers at once — one Type 003 like the Fujian and one nuclear-powered Type 004 — something that it has not attempted before but that its shipyards have the capacity to do. Matthew Funaiole, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies’ China Power Project, said he doubts China's next carrier will be nuclear-powered. Instead, he said, he would expect the People's Liberation Army Navy's fourth carrier to focus on optimizing the existing design of the Fujian carrier with 'incremental improvements.' Nick Childs, senior fellow for naval forces and maritime security at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said the Chinese 'have taken an incremental approach to their carrier development with a number of ambitions that will evolve over time.' 'For now, their deployments have been relatively cautious, remaining largely within range of shore support, but projecting influence and to some extent coercion within their near waters.' Eventually, however, 'larger carriers more akin to their U.S. counterparts will give them more options to project power,' Childs said. It takes several years to build a carrier and bring it into operation, but developing nuclear propulsion for its next generation of warships would eventually give China more power to run advanced systems, such as electromagnetic launchers, radars and new technology weapons, Childs said. 'As well as obviating the need for the ship to refuel regularly and therefore giving it much greater range, nuclear power means that without the need to carry fuel oil for the ship there will be room aboard for fuel and weapons for its aircraft, extending their capabilities,' Childs said. 'Much will depend on what overall size the next carrier is, but the addition of nuclear power will represent a significant step further in China’s carrier development with a vessel more comparable to the U.S. Navy’s carriers.' Zhao, of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said nuclear-powered carriers would provide the Chinese military 'with greater flexibility and endurance to operate around strategic hotspots, especially along the First Island Chain, where most territories disputed by China are located,' said Zhao. The First Island Chain includes the self-governed island of Taiwan, which China claims as its own and vows to annex it by force if necessary. The U.S. is obligated by a domestic law to supply Taiwan with sufficient weapons to deter invasion, and it could provide assistance to the island from its bases in the Pacific in the event of an invasion or blockade. Tensions also have risen in the South China Sea between China and neighboring nations over territorial disputes and maritime claims. 'These carriers could also extend Chinese operations deeper into the Western Pacific, further challenging the U.S. military’s ability to ‘intervene’ in regional matters that China views as best resolved by countries from the region only,' Zhao said. U.S.-China rivalry Chinese President Xi Jinping has tasked defense officials with building a 'first-class' navy and becoming a maritime power as part of his blueprint for the country’s rejuvenation. The country’s most recent white paper on national defense, dated 2019, said the Chinese navy was adjusting to strategic requirements by 'speeding up the transition of its tasks from defense on the near seas to protection missions on the far seas.' The People's Liberation Army Navy is already the world’s largest navy with more than 370 ships and submarines. The country also boasts powerful shipbuilding capabilities: China’s shipyards are building many hundreds of vessels each year, whereas the U.S. is building five or fewer, according to a U.S. congressional report late last year. However, the Chinese navy lags behind the U.S. Navy in many respects. Among other advantages, the U.S. currently has 11 carriers, all nuclear powered, allowing it to keep multiple strike groups deployed around the world at all times, including in the Indo-Pacific. But the Pentagon is growingly increasingly concerned about China’s rapid modernization of its fleet, including the design and construction of new carriers. That aligns with China's 'growing emphasis on the maritime domain and increasing demands' for its navy 'to operate at greater distances from mainland China,' the Defense Department said in its most recent report to Congress on China's military. And China's 'growing force of aircraft carriers extend air defense coverage of deployed task groups beyond the range of land-based defenses, enabling operations farther from China’s shore,' the report said. ___ Tang reported from Washington D.C.	https://apnews.com/article/china-nuclear-aircraft-carrier-3e693365eb914324cc5e6b7dd33df73b	2024-11-10T20:12:17-08:00	
Traumatized by war, hundreds of Lebanon's children struggle with wounds both physical and emotional	BEIRUT (AP) — Curled up in his father ’s lap, clinging to his chest, Hussein Mikdad cried his heart out. The 4-year-old kicked his doctor with his intact foot and pushed him away with the arm that was not in a cast. 'My Dad! My Dad!' Hussein said. 'Make him leave me alone!' With eyes tearing up in relief and pain, the father reassured his son and pulled him closer. Hussein and his father, Hassan, are the only survivors of their family after an Israeli airstrike last month on their Beirut neighborhood. The strike killed 18 people, including his mother, three siblings and six relatives. 'Can he now shower?' the father asked the doctor. Ten days after surgery, doctors examining Hussein's wounds said the boy is healing properly. He has rods in his fractured right thigh and stitches that assembled his torn tendons back in place on the right arm. The pain has subsided, and Hussein should be able to walk again in two months — albeit with a lingering limp. A prognosis for Hussein's invisible wounds is much harder to give. He is back in diapers and has begun wetting his bed. He hardly speaks and has not said a word about his mother, two sisters and brother. 'The trauma is not just on the muscular skeletal aspect. But he is also mentally hurt,' Imad Nahle, one of Hussein’s orthopedic surgeons, said. Israel said, without elaborating, that the strike on the Mikdad neighborhood struck a Hezbollah target. In the war that has escalated since September, Israeli airstrikes have increasingly hit residential areas around Lebanon. Israel accuses the Lebanese militant group of hiding its capabilities and fighters among civilians. It vows to cripple Hezbollah, which began firing into northern Israel after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack triggered the war in Gaza. But children have been caught in the midst. With more strikes on homes and in residential areas, doctors are seeing more children affected by the violence. More than 100 children have been killed in Lebanon in the past six weeks and hundreds injured. And of the 14,000 wounded since last year, around 10% are children. Many have been left with severed limbs, burned bodies, and broken families — scars that could last for a lifetime. Ghassan Abu Sittah, a renowned British-Palestinian surgeon who is also treating Hussein, sees that long road ahead. This is his worry: 'It leaves us with a generation of physically wounded children, children who are psychologically and emotionally wounded.' ‘What do they want from us?’ At the American University of Beirut Medical Center, which is receiving limited cases of war casualties, Nahle said he operated on five children in the past five weeks — up from no cases before. Most were referred from south and eastern Lebanon. A few miles away, at the Lebanese Hospital Geitaoui, one of the country’s largest burns centers increased its capacity by nearly 180% since September so it could accommodate more war wounded, its medical director Naji Abirached said. About a fifth of the newly admitted patients are children. In one of the burn center’s ICU units lies Ivana Skakye. She turned 2 in the hospital ward last week. Ivana has been healing from burns she sustained following an Israeli airstrike outside their home in southern Lebanon on Sept. 23. Israel launched hundreds of airstrikes that day in different parts of Lebanon, making it the deadliest day of the war so far. More than 500 people were killed. Six weeks later, the tiny Ivana remains wrapped in white gauze from head to toe except her torso. She sustained third-degree burns over 40 percent of her body. Her hair and head, her left side all the way to her legs, both her arms and her chest were burned. Her family home was damaged, its ceiling set afire. The family’s valuables, packed in their car as they prepared to leave, were also torched. Ivana’s older sister, Rahaf, 7, has recovered faster from burns to her face and hands. Fatima Zayoun, their mother, was in the kitchen when the explosion hit. Zayoun jumped up to grab the girls, who were playing on the terrace. It was, Zayoun said, 'as if something lifted me up so that I can grab my kids. I have no idea how I managed to pull them in and throw them out of the window. She spoke from the ICU burns unit. 'They were not on fire, but they were burned. Black ash covered them. ... (Ivana) was without any hair. I told myself, `That is not her.'' Now, Ivana's wound dressings are changed every two days. Her doctor, Ziad Sleiman, said she could be discharged in a few days. She’s back again to saying 'Mama' and 'Bye — shorthand for wanting to go out. Like Hussein, though, Ivana has no home to return to. Her parents fear collective shelters could cause an infection to return. After seeing her kids 'sizzling on the floor,' Zayoun, 35, said that even if their home is repaired, she wouldn’t want to return. 'I saw death with my own eyes,' she said. Zayoun was 17 last time Israel and Hezbollah were at war, in 2006. Displaced with her family then, she said she almost enjoyed the experience, riding out of their village in a truck full of their belongings, mixing with new people, learning new things. They returned home when the war was over. 'But this war is hard. They are hitting everywhere,' she said. 'What do they want from us? Do they want to hurt our children? We are not what they are looking for.' Attacks at home can be hard for kids to deal with Abu Sittah, the reconstructive surgeon, said most of the children's injuries are from blasts or collapsing rubble. That attack on a space they expect to be inviolable can have lingering effects. 'Children feel safe at home,' he said. 'The injury makes them for the first time lose that sense of security — that their parents are keeping them safe, that their homes are invincible, and suddenly their homes become not so.' One recent morning, children were playing in the courtyard of a vocational school-turned-shelter in Dekwaneh, north of Beirut, where nearly 3,000 people displaced from the south are now living. The parents were busy with an overflowing bathroom that serves one floor in a building that houses nearly 700 people. Only playtime brings the children, from different villages in the south, together. They were divided in two teams, ages ranging between 6 and 12, competing to get the handkerchief first. A tiny girl hugged and held hands with strangers visiting the shelter. 'I am from Lebanon. Don't tell anyone,' she whispered in their ears. The game turned rowdy when two girls in their early teens got into a fist fight. Pushing and shoving began. Tears and tantrums followed. The tiny girl walked away in a daze. Maria Elizabeth Haddad, manager of the psychosocial support programs in Beirut and neighboring areas for the U.S.-based International Medical Corps, said parents in shelters reported signs of increased anxiety, hostility and aggression among kids. They talk back to parents and ignore rules. Some have developed speech impediments and clinginess. One is showing early signs of psychosis. 'There are going to be residual symptoms when they grow up, especially related to attachment ties, to feeling of security,' Haddad said. 'It is a generational trauma. We have experienced it before with our parents. ... They don’t have stability or search for (extra) stability. This is not going to be easy to overcome.' New phases of life begin Children represent more than a third of over 1 million people displaced by the war in Lebanon and following Israeli evacuation notices, according to U.N. and government estimates (more than 60,000 people have been displaced from northern Israel). That leaves hundreds of thousands in Lebanon without schooling, either because their schools were inaccessible or have been turned into shelters. Hussein's father says he and his son must start together from scratch. With help from relatives, the two have found a temporary shelter in a home — and, for the father, a brief sense of relief. 'I thank God he is not asking for or about his mother and his siblings,' said Hassan Mikdad, the 40-year-old father. He has no explanation for his son, who watched their family die in their home. His two sisters — Celine, 10, and Cila, 14 — were pulled out of the rubble the following day. His mother, Mona, was pulled out three days later. She was locked in an embrace with her 6-year-old son, Ali. The strike on Oct. 21 also caused damage across the street, to one of Beirut’s main public hospitals, breaking solar panels and windows in the pharmacy and the dialysis unit. The father survived because he had stepped out for coffee. He watched his building crumble in the late-night airstrike. He also lost his shop, his motorcycles and car — all the evidence of his 16 years of family life. His friend, Hussein Hammoudeh, arrived on the scene to help sift through rubble. Hammoudeh spotted young Hussein Mikdad’s fingers in the darkness in an alley behind their home. At first he thought they were severed limbs — until he heard the boy’s screams. He dug out Hussein with glass lodged in his leg and a metal bar in his shoulder. Hammoudeh said he didn’t recognize the boy. He held the child's almost-severed wrist in place. In the hospital now, Hussein Mikdad sipped a juice as he listened to his father and his friend. His father turned to him, asking if he wanted a Spider-Man toy — an effort to forestall a new outburst of tears. He said he buys Hussein a toy each day. 'What I am living through seems like a big lie. ...The mind can’t comprehend,' he said. 'I thank God for the blessing that is Hussein.'	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-children-wounded-hezbollah-92c8dc4495304af8125172b28278580c	2024-11-10T20:11:20-08:00	
Stock market today: Most of Wall Street rolls higher as bitcoin bounces above $86,000	NEW YORK (AP) — Most U.S. stocks are rising Monday and adding to the gains made during their best week of the year. The S&amp;P 500 was up 0.1% in afternoon trading, and two out of every three stocks in the index were climbing. It's coming off a 4.7% spurt last week spurred by Donald Trump’s presidential victory and a cut to interest rates by the Federal Reserve to bolster the economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 322 points, or 0.7%, as of 1:59 p.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.1% lower. Tesla was the strongest force pushing the S&amp;P 500 higher after rising 8.1%. Its leader, Elon Musk, has become a close ally of Trump’s, and its stock jumped nearly 15% the day after the election and has kept rising. Several pieces of what’s known as the 'Trump trade' also helped drive the market, as investors try to identify which kinds of companies will be winners under a second Trump term. JPMorgan Chase rose 1.2%, and bank stocks broadly continue to benefit from expectations for stronger economic growth, less regulation from Washington and an increase in mergers and acquisitions. A White House more friendly to big tie-ups has helped Wall Street speculate about a merger between insurers Cigna Group and Humana, for example. It’s been so feverish that Cigna said Monday it isn’t pursuing a deal with Humana. Cigna’s stock rose 7.7%, and Humana’s sank 2%. Stocks of companies more focused on the U.S. economy were also rising more than the rest of the market, including a 1.5% rally for the smaller stocks in the Russell 2000 index, because they’re seen as benefiting more from Trump’s America First policies than big multinational companies. Companies are also continuing to deliver earnings reports showing they made more in profit during the summer than analysts expected. Aramark gained 0.8% after it reported broad-based growth during the latest quarter, including for food at stadiums and among customers around the world. They helped offset a drop of 1.9% for Nvidia, which was the heaviest weight on the market and helped drag the Nasdaq composite in particular. AbbVie tumbled 12% after saying trials investigating its treatment for some adults with schizophrenia failed to show statistically significant improvement compared with a placebo group at week six. Some of the sharpest swings were in the crypto market, where bitcoin rose above $86,000 for the first time. Trump has embraced cryptocurrencies generally and pledged to make his country the crypto capital of the world. Bitcoin hit a record of $86,375, according to CoinDesk. Another Trump trade has been a rise in Treasury yields, as traders anticipate potentially higher economic growth, U.S. government debt and inflation because of Trump’s policies. But trading in the bond market is closed Monday in observance of Veterans Day. Treasury yields been generally climbing since September, in large part because the U.S. economy has remained much more resilient than feared. The hope is that it can continue to stay solid as the Federal Reserve continues to cut interest rates in order to keep the job market humming, now that it’s helped get inflation nearly down to its 2% target. But Trump’s win has scrambled expectations for coming cuts to rates. Traders have already begun paring forecasts for how many the Fed will deliver next year. While lower rates can boost the economy, they can also give inflation more fuel. Stock markets abroad have swung following Trump’s election amid worries about increased tariffs and disruptions to global trade. Indexes were mixed Monday, with European markets rising while South Korea’s and Hong Kong’s sank. __ AP Writer Zimo Zhong in Hong Kong contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/stock-markets-interest-rates-china-inflation-72c7ecb237655a0f88b45ac90643fcd2	2024-11-10T18:47:15-08:00	
Japan's parliament reelects struggling leader Ishiba as prime minister	TOKYO (AP) — Japan's parliament reelected Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on Monday after his governing coalition suffered the worst election loss in more than a decade, forcing the struggling leader to form his second Cabinet in just over a month since taking office. Ishiba’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party and its junior partner Komeito together lost their majority in the 465-seat Lower House, the more powerful of Japan’s two-house parliament, in the Oct. 27 election due to continued voter outrage over financial misconduct by his party and its lukewarm response. A special parliamentary session convened Monday to pick a new leader in a vote required within 30 days of a general election. Ishiba beat top opposition leader Yoshihiko Noda 221-160 in the first runoff in 30 years. Ishiba reappointed most of his previous Cabinet members, including Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya, Defense Minister Gen Nakatani and Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi, but had to replace three who lost seats or were affected by the election results. Ishiba is expected to hold a news conference to explain his new Cabinet and policies. Ishiba has refused to step down and showed willingness to cooperate with additional coalition partners to boost stability and help him pursue his party’s policies. Ishiba will struggle in the coming months as he must gain consent from the opposition on policies including the budget and other legislation, experts say. He is eyeing a rising smaller, conservative opposition, the Democratic Party for the People, whose seats quadrupled to 28 under its popular leader Yuichiro Tamaki, whose proposal for raising the basic tax-free income allowance and increasing take-home wages garnered support from low income and younger voters. Tamaki only wants to cooperate with Ishiba’s party on policy — not as part of a coalition — since he wants to use his leverage to increase his party’s standing ahead of the next election. However, Tamaki was recently stung by a magazine article exposing an extramarital affair, which he admitted to on Monday. Ishiba’s government is preparing for his trip later this month to Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation and Group of 20 summits, as well as a possible meeting with President-elect Donald Trump on his way home. ___ This story has been corrected to show the summit is Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation, not ASEAN.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-politics-ishiba-cabinet-5945feb06a07730a98ebb3e0b46905bd	2024-11-10T18:38:43-08:00	
Storm-weary Philippines forcibly evacuates thousands of villagers as latest typhoon blows near	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Thousands of people were being forcibly evacuated from 2,500 villages in the northern Philippines on Monday as another typhoon threatened the region already devastated by floods and landslides from three storms in less than a month. Typhoon Toraji was forecast to blow over the mountainous Luzon region, where President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. — just the day before — inspected the damage from the last storm and led the distribution of food packs to residents. Marcos skipped this week’s Asia-Pacific Cooperation forum in Peru to oversee recovery efforts from back-to-back storms. The fast-moving Toraji was about 100 kilometers (62 miles) east of Casiguran town in northeastern Aurora province Monday morning with sustained winds of up to 130 kilometers (81 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 180 kph (112 mph). It’s expected to barrel northwestward across Luzon, weaken as it crosses a mountain range and then blow into the South China Sea. Interior Secretary Jonvic Remulla on Sunday ordered the forcible evacuation of people in 2,500 villages expected to be lashed by Toraji, locally named Nika, warning that the rain-soaked Luzon mountains, valleys and plains were more susceptible to flash floods and landslides. With the typhoon approaching fast, there was little time to move large numbers of people to safety, he said. 'We understand if some would want to stay, but we have to get them out,' Remulla told reporters. The last two typhoons and a tropical storm caused more than 160 deaths, damaged thousands of houses and farmlands and affected more than 9 million people, including hundreds of thousands who fled to emergency shelters, after dumping from one to two months’ worth of rain in just 24 hours in some cities and towns. Overwhelmed, the Philippines received help from Southeast Asian countries led by Singapore, along with longtime treaty ally the United States, to transport food, water and other aid to hard-hit northern provinces. The Philippine archipelago is often battered by typhoons and earthquakes and has more than a dozen active volcanoes, making it one of the most natural disaster-prone countries in the world. In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest recorded tropical cyclones, left more than 7,300 people dead or missing, flattened entire villages and caused ships to run aground and smash into houses in the central Philippines.	https://apnews.com/article/philippines-typhoon-toraji-389519dbf4a4aa68223617181f96fda9	2024-11-10T16:38:52-08:00	
Yiannis Boutaris, winemaker and maverick former mayor of the Greek city of Thessaloniki, has died	THESSALONIKI, Greece (AP) — Yiannis Boutaris, a winemaker who served two terms as mayor of Thessaloniki, Greece’s second largest city, and shook its conservative image, died Saturday evening, his company Kir-Yianni announced on social media. No cause of death was given, but his health had been declining. A couple weeks ago he had undergone a hip operation, was discharged but readmitted to hospital a few days before his death. The announcement, written by his two sons, who run the winemaking company, called him 'larger than life, visionary, charismatic, innovator, maverick.' Maverick he undoubtedly was. Politicians across the spectrum paid tribute to Boutaris, emphasizing his passionate and non-conformist personality. Boutaris, a progressive man who eschewed party labels, was involved in local politics late in life, being elected municipal councilor at age 60. He first ran for mayor in 2006, coming third, before running a successful campaign in 2010. His supporters ranged from leftists to moderate conservatives, and he won by a whisker in a city where hardline conservatives had held the mayor’s office for 24 years. In 2014, he won reelection with 58% of the vote. After a four-year hiatus, he was elected municipal councilor again in 2023, serving until his death. 'He was the daring visionary who fought with all his might to bring the city back in touch with its rich multicultural, colorful and cosmopolitan past,' said current Thessaloniki mayor Stelios Angeloudis. As mayor of a city close to other Balkan countries, Boutaris worked on good neighborly relations. He sought to attract Turkish tourists to the city where the Turkish Republic’s founder, Kemal Ataturk, was born. He invited Zoran Zaev, the prime minister of what was then The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, to dinner on New Year’s Day 2017, paving the way for an agreement between the countries that ended a decades-long dispute over the name Macedonia, and after which Greece’s northern neighbor adopted the name North Macedonia. He also emphasized the city’s strong Jewish heritage, playing an important role in building the Holocaust Museum. These moves were sometimes resented by the city’s nationalist element, including the Orthodox Church. Boutaris did not shy from confrontation, leading the city’s archbishop, Anthimos, to name-call him during a church service in October 2010, telling him that without the Church’s support he could not hope to be elected mayor. Nineteen days later, he was. In May 2018, a gang of nationalists attacked Boutaris, slightly injuring him. Nine persons, including a police officer, were convicted for the attack five years later. 'My views on gay pride and North Macedonia caused great enmity and personal hatred,' he had said in an interview. Before he delved into politics, Boutaris had made his name in the winemaking business founded by his grandfather. Business differences with his brother led him to quit the family business in 1996 and start his own, Kir-Yianni ('Mr. Yiannis') winery. Boutaris was also an active environmentalist, founding an NGO, Arktouros, initially aiming to protect the country’s brown bears, but whose sanctuary eventually took on many other species. He was also involved in his beloved Aris Thessaloniki sports club. The club’s professional basketball team said he was a major provider of funds during the club’s golden era in the 1980s and 1990s. In 2021, he published a well-received memoir, '60 Years of Harvests,' in which he was open about his struggles with alcoholism. He had stayed sober since 1991. Besides his two sons, his survivors include a daughter and six grandchildren. His family announced that he will be cremated Tuesday. No religious service will take place. ——— Nellas reported from Athens, Greece	https://apnews.com/article/yiannis-boutaris-mayor-thessaloniki-winemaking-bc705186b303af22599bab61af11313e	2024-11-10T13:38:26-08:00	
Haiti replaces its prime minister, marking more turmoil in the democratic transition process	PORT-AU-PRINCE (AP) — A transitionary council created to reestablish democratic order in Haiti signed a decree Sunday firing interim Prime Minister Garry Conille and replacing him with Alix Didier Fils-Aimé, a businessman who was previously considered for the job. The decree, set to be published on Monday, was provided to The Associated Press by a government source. It marks even more turmoil in an already rocky democratic transition process for Haiti, which hasn’t held democratic elections in years in a large part due to the soaring levels of gang violence plaguing the Caribbean nation. Fils-Aimé is the former president of Haiti’s Chamber of Commerce and Industry and in 2015 ran an unsuccessful campaign for Senate. The businessman studied at Boston University and was previously considered for the position as a private sector candidate for the post before Conille took the seat. Conille, a longtime civil servant who has worked with the United Nations, served as prime minister for only six months. The transitional council was established in April, tasked with choosing Haiti’s next prime minister and Cabinet with the hope that it would help quell turmoil Haiti. But the council has been plagued with politics and infighting, and has long been at odds with Conille. Organizations like the Organization of American States tried and failed last week to mediate disagreements in an attempt to save the fragile transition, according to reporting from The Miami Herald. The process suffered another blow in October when a three of members on the council faced corruption accusations, from anti-corruption investigators alleging that they demanded $750,000 in bribes from a government bank director to secure his job. The report was a significant blow to the nine-member council and is expected to further erode people’s trust in it. Those same members accused of bribery, Smith Augustin, Emmanuel Vertilaire and Louis Gérald Gilles, were among those to sign the decree. Only one member, Edgard Leblanc Fils, did not sign the order. The move by the transitional council came under fire by some in Haiti like former Justice Minister Bernard Gousse, who told local media that Conille's dismissal was 'illegal' because the council was over-extending its powers and because of the corruption allegations levered against them. —— Associated Press reporter Megan Janetsky contributed to this report from Mexico City.	https://apnews.com/article/prime-minister-haiti-alix-didier-fils-aime-garry-conille-bacb06217008ad0c735c22b72fb72235	2024-11-10T12:23:00-08:00	
6.8 magnitude earthquake shakes Cuba after hurricanes and blackouts	HAVANA (AP) — An earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 6.8 shook eastern Cuba on Sunday, after weeks of hurricanes and blackouts that have left many on the island reeling. The epicenter of the quake was located about 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of Bartolome Maso, Cuba, according to a report by the U.S. Geological Survey. Rumbling was felt across the eastern stretch of Cuba, including in bigger cities like Santiago de Cuba, as well as Holguin and. Guantanamo. Local media in Jamaica also reported that the island felt the tremors. There were no immediate reports of major damage or injuries in Cuba. Residents in Santiago, Cuba's second-largest city, were left shaken on Sunday. Yolanda Tabío, 76, said that people in the city flocked to the streets and were still nervously sitting in their doorways. She said that she felt at least two aftershocks following the quake, but that among friends and family she hadn't heard of any damages. 'You had to see how everything was moving, the walls, everything,' she told The Associated Press. Others reported hearing screams, adding that the quake was strong and stretched on. On social media, residents in the small town of Pilon reported minor damage, posting photos of crumbling roofs and cracks on building walls, not uncommon in Cuba where many structures are older and in need of repair. The earthquake comes during another tough stretch for Cuba. On Wednesday, Category 3 Hurricane Rafael ripped through western Cuba, with strong winds knocking out power island-wide, destroying hundreds of homes and forcing evacuations of hundreds of thousands of people. Days after, much of the island was still struggling without power. Weeks before in October, the island was also hit by a one-two punch. First, it was hit by island-wide blackouts stretching on for days, a product of the island’s energy crisis. Shortly after, it was slapped by a powerful hurricane that struck the eastern part of the island and killed at least six people. The blackouts and wider discontent among many struggling to get by has stoked small protests across the island.	https://apnews.com/article/cuba-earthquake-hurricanes-natural-disaster-c28bbf4496a1bbe27a39f80728d63b2d	2024-11-10T09:02:58-08:00	
Alitalia will lay off over 2,000 remaining employees as liquidation nears	ROME (AP) — Italy’s former national carrier Alitalia has started procedures for the collective dismissal of its remaining 2,059 employees, its administrators told unions. The move comes as the successor to bankrupt Alitalia, ITA Airways, faces hurdles in its merger plans with German Lufthansa. According to Italian media reports, merger talks stalled after the Italian Economy Ministry refused Lufthansa’s suggestions to adjust the price for a 41% stake in ITA Airways. Lufthansa is arguing that the government-owned Italian airline would lose value due to its poor performance in the fourth quarter of the year. Lufthansa said it would adhere to the 2023 terms of the contract for its investment in ITA, adding it 'had signed the necessary remedy package by the agreed deadline.' Meanwhile, Alitalia, which is under the special administration and moving toward final liquidation, plans to fire its remaining employees until the end of the year. The final cuts include more than 1,100 flight attendants and 82 pilots and become effective in January, according to a letter sent this past week by the administration to the airline unions.	https://apnews.com/article/italy-alitalia-layoffs-ita-airways-lufthansa-2bcec35d566b19f7022281e23cd94fa4	2024-11-10T07:50:20-08:00	
Taylor Swift wins big and Rita Ora pays tribute to Liam Payne at the MTV EMAs	MANCHESTER, England (AP) — Taylor Swift came out on top at the 2024 MTV EMAs on Sunday, walking away with best artist, best U.S. act, best live act and best video for 'Fortnight' (featuring Post Malone). Swift, who is finishing up her Eras tour on the other side of the Atlantic, thanked the fans for the bounty of prizes via video message. The U.K. show opened with an acrobatic Benson Boone suspended in the air on a gold grand piano performing his viral hit 'Beautiful Things' and latest release 'Slow it Down.' Boone also accepted his first EMA for best new act. South African newcomer Tyla gave Swift a run for her money picking up three awards for best afrobeats, best R&amp;B and best African act. Tyla performed her smash hit 'Water' for the EMA audience at the Co-op Live, Manchester, flanked by a host of dancers, as well as singing energetic new track 'Push 2 Start.' British singer Rita Ora, who hosted the show for a record third time, paid tribute to former One Direction star Liam Payne, who died last month after falling from a balcony in Buenos Aires. Ora had a close relationship with the singer and the pair recorded a song together in 2018, 'For You (Fifty Shades Freed).' She addressed the audience saying, 'I want to take a moment to remember someone. Liam Payne was one of the kindest people I knew.' Her voice broke as she asked the crowd to take a moment to remember Liam saying, 'He had the biggest heart and he left such a mark on this world.' Hip-hop legend Busta Rhymes was awarded the EMAs global icon award from British rapper Little Simz telling the crowd that in 34 years of professionally recording this was his first award from MTV and it felt incredible. The 12-time Grammy Award nominee, who has more than 10 million album sales under his belt, performed a mega medley of his greatest hits 'Break ya Neck,' 'Touch it' and 'Put Your Hands Where the Eyes can See' accompanied by dancers wearing tracksuits with giant dragon heads. Shawn Mendes gave an intimate and heartfelt performance and also received the award for best Canadian act. Sabrina Carpenter picked up the honors for best song for her hit 'Espresso,' while Ariana Grande was crowned best pop act and Eminem took away best hip hop act.

Paris to deploy 4,000 police officers for France-Israel soccer match following violence in Amsterdam	PARIS (AP) — Paris police said Sunday that 4,000 officers and 1,600 stadium staff will be deployed for a France-Israel soccer match to ensure security in and around the stadium and on public transportation a week after violence against Israeli fans in Amsterdam. France and Israel are playing in a UEFA Nations League match on Thursday that French President Emmanuel Macron will attend, the Elysee presidential palace said. 'There's a context, tensions that make that match a high-risk event for us,' Paris police chief Laurent Nuñez said on French news broadcaster BFM TV, adding authorities 'won't tolerate' any violence. Nuñez said that 2,500 police officers would be deployed around the Stade de France stadium, north of the French capital, in addition to 1,500 others in Paris and on public transportation. 'There will be an anti-terrorist security perimeter around the stadium,' Nuñez said. Security checks will be 'reinforced,' he added, including with systematic pat-downs and bag searches. Nuñez said that French organizers have been in contact with Israeli authorities and security forces in order to prepare for the match. Israeli fans were assaulted last week after a soccer game in Amsterdam by hordes of young people apparently riled up by calls on social media to target Jewish people, according to Dutch authorities. Five people were treated at hospitals and dozens were arrested after the attacks, which were condemned as antisemitic by authorities in Amsterdam, Israel and across Europe. On Sunday, Dutch police detained several people for taking part in a demonstration in central Amsterdam that had been outlawed following the violence targeting Israeli fans, a local broadcaster reported. French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau confirmed Friday that the France-Israel match would go ahead as planned. 'I think that for a symbolic reason we must not yield, we must not give up,' he said, noting that sports fans from around the world came together for the Paris Olympics this year to celebrate the 'universal values' of sports. Macron’s expected attendance not only is a show of support for the French team, but also aims as sending 'a message of fraternity and solidarity following the intolerable antisemitic acts that followed the match in Amsterdam,' an official in Macron's entourage said. The official couldn't be named in line with the Elysee's customary practices.	https://apnews.com/article/france-israel-soccer-match-police-violence-amsterdam-b8af08c49988d19eb1daa7ae935f0597	2024-11-10T06:25:05-08:00	
Amsterdam police detain pro-Palestinian protesters at banned demonstration	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — Police detained dozens of people Sunday for taking part in a demonstration in central Amsterdam that had been outlawed following violence targeting fans of an Israeli soccer club, local media reported. Amsterdam Mayor Femke Halsema banned all demonstrations over the weekend in the aftermath of the grim scenes of youths on scooters and on foot attacking Maccabi Tel Aviv supporters on Thursday and Friday in what was widely condemned as a violent outburst of antisemitism in the Dutch capital. Late Sunday afternoon, the municipality, together with Amsterdam police and public prosecutor's office, extended the ban on demonstrations until Thursday morning. Israel’s ambassador to the Netherlands said that 2,000 Israelis were brought home on special flights from Amsterdam over the past few days. Before the match against Ajax, Maccabi fans also tore a Palestinian flag off a building in Amsterdam and chanted anti-Arab slogans on their way to the stadium. There were also reports of Maccabi fans starting fights. Amsterdam newspaper Het Parool reported that about 100 people were detained, and media said they were taken away in buses. Police confirmed they were detaining demonstrators, but didn't give numbers. The protesters yelled slogans including 'Free, free Palestine.' Amsterdam Municipality said on X that police had begun arresting demonstrators who refused to leave the square, which is in the heart of the city's downtown shopping area and close to the historic canal network. Organizers of the protest went to court on Sunday morning seeking an injunction to allow the demonstration, but a judge upheld the ban imposed by the municipality. At the hearing, senior Amsterdam police officer Olivier Dutilh said that there were again incidents overnight targeting people thought to be Jewish, including some being ordered out of taxis and others being asked to produce their passports to confirm their nationality. Police launched a large-scale investigation Friday after gangs of youths conducted what Amsterdam’s mayor called 'hit and run' attacks on fans that were apparently inspired by calls on social media to target Jewish people. Five people were treated at hospitals and more than 60 suspects were arrested. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar rushed to the Netherlands on Friday and offered Israel’s help in the police investigation. He met on Saturday with Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof and said in a statement that the attacks and demands to show passports 'were reminiscent of dark periods in history.' In France, Paris police said Sunday that 4,000 officers and 1,600 stadium staff will be deployed for a France-Israel soccer match on Thursday to ensure security in and around the stadium and on public transportation.	https://apnews.com/article/amsterdam-israel-palestinians-violence-demonstration-1d38014f40c0bc04250113add3ca9cbf	2024-11-10T05:44:42-08:00	
Opponents of ousted Bangladesh ex-premier Sheikh Hasina foil attempts to hold rally in Dhaka	DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — Rival political groups of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Sunday thwarted a plan by her Awami League party to hold a rally in Bangladesh’s capital, seen as a potential first effort to make a comeback on the streets since she fled the country in August amid a mass uprising. The rally in Dhaka by Hasina’s party was to commemorate the death of a party activist on Nov. 10, 1987, which had sparked a mass protest against former military dictator H.M. Ershad. He was eventually ousted from office, ending his nine-year rule in 1990. The day is commemorated as 'democracy day.' In 1991, Bangladesh switched to a parliamentary democracy from a presidential form of government, and since then Hasina and her rival, former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, became the most powerful political figures in the country. On Sunday, activists of the party headed by Zia, Hasina’s main rival, and also members of the conservative Jamaat-e-Islami party took to the streets of Dhaka, filling up much of the area where the rally was scheduled to take place. Others, including hundreds of student protesters, also announced that they wouldn't allow Hasina’s supporters to stand on the streets and hold the rally. The protesters said that they think Hasina’s party was trying to make a comeback by holding a rally on the streets on Sunday. The protesters from the Anti-discrimination Student Movement, a group that led the mass uprising in July-August, aggressively hunted for supporters of Hasina. Groups of people surrounded the Awami League party’s headquarters near the Noor Hossain Square in Dhaka where Hasina’s supporters were supposed to gather to hold the rally. Security was tight in the area, but witnesses and local media said that the protesters attacked several supporters of Hasina when they attempted to reach there and chanted slogans in favor of the fallen leader. The Awami League party said that many of their activists were detained by police as they came under attacks. Tensions ran high throughout Sunday with the anti-Hasina protesters saying that they wouldn't allow the party to hold any public rally under any circumstances. The Awami League party posted a number of videos on Facebook on Sunday showing its supporters being manhandled. Its party headquarters had earlier been vandalized following Hasina’s fall on Aug. 5, and on Sunday it was empty and there were signs of destruction. Outside, control was in the hands of Hasina’s opponents. The political chaos in the South Asian nation went on as Zia’s party was seeking quick reforms and a new election from an interim government headed by Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus. The party believes it will be able to form the new government in the absence of Hasina’s party, while its other allies are also struggling. The Yunus-led government said it would seek extradition of Hasina and her close associates as they face charges of crimes against humanity involving deaths of hundreds of protesters during the uprising.	https://apnews.com/article/bangladesh-sheikh-hasina-khaleda-zia-muhammad-yunus-3e022c6bd6939bb13f0e93e49781268f	2024-11-10T04:44:17-08:00	
FIFA and IOC hold different track records with Trump ahead of World Cup and Olympics in US	GENEVA (AP) — The two biggest events in world sports are coming to America. And if President-elect Donald Trump is not thinking about them yet, organizers of the 2026 World Cup and 2028 Los Angeles Olympics certainly are. The World Cup and the Summer Games are rare globally shared cultural moments with potential for unifying people. But there are questions around issues like granting visas and providing security that will cross Trump's desk. And that requires diplomacy. Soccer body FIFA seems in a better place to resume warm relations with Trump from his first administration compared to the International Olympic Committee based on public reactions this week and previous interactions. FIFA President Gianni Infantino used his Instagram account to congratulate Trump even before the Electoral College win early Wednesday. There has been a public silence from the IOC, though it follows a more formal protocol code. IOC President Thomas Bach made one visit to the White House in June 2017 that is part of Olympic lore for how badly it went. 'Pray for our world,' Bach was heard to say on a cellphone call later that day in Washington D.C. This summer, at a campaign rally, Trump falsely labeled two female Olympic champion boxers as men and pledged to ' keep men out of women’s sports.' It's the type of issue that could arise from the Trump administration despite top-tier Olympic sports track and field, swimming and cycling already excluding from women's competitions any athletes who went through male puberty. FIFA, meanwhile, seems to have an open line of communication with Trump to talk through potential challenges such as Iran's probable qualification to the men's World Cup and the political implications it may bring. Trump called Infantino ' my great friend ' at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January 2020. Infantino also recently moved to Miami, just 70 miles south of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate. The tradition for the head of state of a host nation is to present the trophy at the World Cup final and formally open the Summer Games. Ceremonial duties for Trump at the World Cup — which the US is co-hosting with Mexico and Canada — and LA Olympics — held after Bach leaves office — in moments watched by hundreds of millions of viewers worldwide, are in some ways the easy bit. 'My personal view would be that Trump has a very astute appreciation of being on the world stage,' Michael Payne, an IOC insider since the 1984 LA Summer Games as a marketing executive and consultant, told The Associated Press. 'The challenge will be the year counting down to the events — how that doesn’t compromise the agenda of everybody turning up,' Payne said in a telephone interview. Asking for and getting permission from the IOC and FIFA to host their sprawling, multi-billion dollar events requires federal government guarantees on security and letting athletes, team officials and fans enter the country. Trump’s first administration was involved in the bid campaigns — won in 2017 by LA and in 2018 by U.S. soccer officials bidding jointly with Canada and Mexico — and likely was made aware that FIFA, the IOC and fans see the events as belonging to everyone. 'The World Cup and the Olympics, I was responsible for getting both of them, actually,' Trump told Bill Belichick this month on the Let's Go podcast. During those campaigns, when both American bid teams faced questions about a backlash by global voters against Trump’s rhetoric, U.S. soccer and Olympic bid officials noted he wasn’t expected to be in office when the sports events opened. Even Trump, in a meeting with Infantino at the White House in August 2018, didn’t factor in the possibility of losing the 2020 election, which opened the door for him to run again four years later and return to office in time for the 2026 World Cup. '2026, I won’t be here,' said at the time. Hosting games and races that make the world stop to watch, that create a rare sense of shared global experience, is seen as a privilege. Even when the athletes and teams come from countries that were insulted by President Trump, whose politics include travel bans and deportations. 'That responsibility extends to making people feel welcome and that the visa regime is open,' said Piara Powar, executive director of anti-discrimination group Fare that works with FIFA to monitor offensive incidents at World Cup games. Iran, a power in Asian soccer, is on track to qualify in March for its fourth straight World Cup. The Palestinian national team is still contesting one of the eight guaranteed places from Asia in the 48-nation tournament lineup. Trump has a history of support for Israel though has vowed to bring peace to the Middle East. Africa, demeaned by Trump in his first term, has nine guaranteed entries. Track records 'Congratulations Mr President!' Infantino wrote about the man he visited twice at the White House, and also joined in Davos for a dinner event at the high-end Swiss ski resort. The post predicted 'a great FIFA World Cup. Football Unites the World!' In contrast to Trump's kind words for Infantino at Davos, there was no such public warmth exchanged with Olympic leader Bach. Trump and Bach met once at the White House just over seven years ago. Then, the IOC was moving toward making winners of both 2024 Olympics bid rivals Los Angeles and Paris by bringing 2028 into play. The meeting did not go well. That was suspected at the time but only confirmed years later in private conversations. No photos, nor a readout, ever were published of Trump hosting the Olympic delegation that came from Switzerland, Los Angeles and Colorado Springs. The U.S. president was apparently dismissive of Paris and questioned why the IOC wanted the city, which hosted an acclaimed Olympics this year. Asked why there was no formal acknowledgment of Trump's win this week, the IOC cited its tradition of neutrality and not taking political sides. Still, in May 2017, within days of French President Emmanuel Macron first being elected, his telephone call with Bach was reported by the IOC to have included praise for a 'brilliant' win. Macron was on the field in Moscow in July 2018 for the World Cup-winning France team to receive the trophy in torrential rain. Only one umbrella was provided, held over the head of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The next day, Putin met with Trump in Helsinki in neighboring Finland. Infantino was closely tied to Putin ahead of and during that World Cup and they were in an iconic photograph at the opening game, Russia’s 5-0 win over Saudi Arabia. The other man in the photo, Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman, also is now close with Infantino and Saudi Arabia’s hosting of the 2034 World Cup will be confirmed in Zurich on Dec. 11. When a Middle East diplomatic deal, known as the Abraham Accords, was signed at the Trump White House in September 2020, Infantino was there on the South Lawn during the COVID-19 pandemic. 'If FIFA and Gianni Infantino have a good relationship with Donald Trump then we hope that could be used for the good of the World Cup,' the London-based Powar said in a telephone interview, 'and to ensure that it’s an open and inclusive World Cup. That is the risk at the moment.' At the past two World Cups a match ticket counted as a visa and, Powar noted, in Qatar in 2022 'everybody did have the opportunity to travel there with a ticket, there were no restrictions.' Russia and Qatar — and 2022 Winter Olympics host China — know well that sports fans, administrators and media often see domestic events and legislation through their own lens. 'It puts a magnifying glass on the issues,' said Payne, a close-up observer of Olympic Games for 40 years. 'They take on a profile and political dimension with greater impact because everyone is watching.' ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer	https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-fifa-ioc-world-cup-olympics-7601f2041ff5e75afeae1f43b88dc958	2024-11-10T04:31:14-08:00	
UN nuclear head to visit Iran for talks on country's nuclear program as next Trump presidency looms	VIENNA (AP) — The head of the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog said Sunday he will travel to Iran in the coming days to hold talks regarding the country's nuclear program. The visit comes amid wider tensions gripping the Mideast over the Israel-Hamas war and uncertainty over how U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will approach Iran after his inauguration in January. Specifically, the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mariano Grossi, will have high level meetings with the Iranian government and will hold technical discussions on all aspects related to the joint statement agreed with Iran in March 2023. It is intended as a path forward for cooperation between the IAEA and Iran on how to expand inspections of the Islamic Republic’s rapidly advancing atomic program. The 2023 statement included a pledge by Iran to resolve issues around sites where inspectors have questions about possible undeclared nuclear activity, and to allow the IAEA to 'implement further appropriate verification and monitoring activities.' The meetings in Tehran will build on Grossi's discussions with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in September, a statement by the IAEA said. 'It is essential that we make substantive progress in the implementation of the joint statement agreed with Iran in March 2023,' Grossi said. 'My visit to Tehran will be very important in that regard.' Iran is rapidly advancing its atomic program and continues to increase its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels in defiance of international demands, according to recent reports by the IAEA. Grossi, has warned that Tehran has enough uranium enriched to near-weapons-grade levels to make 'several' nuclear bombs if it chose to do so. He has acknowledged the U.N. agency cannot guarantee that none of Iran’s centrifuges may have been peeled away for clandestine enrichment. Iran’s 2015 landmark nuclear deal with world powers had put limits on its nuclear program — which the West fears could be used for making nuclear weapons although Tehran insists is only for peaceful purposes — while lifting punitive economic sanctions imposed on Iran. But the deal collapsed after the Trump administration in 2018 pulled the United States out of the agreement, leading Iran to abandon all limits the deal had put on its program and enrich uranium to up to 60% purity. That is just a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. By IAEA’s definition, around 42 kilograms (92.5 pounds) of uranium enriched to 60% is the amount at which creating one atomic weapon is theoretically possible. As Trump is to take office again in a few weeks, Iranians are divided on what his next presidency will bring. Some foresee an all-out war between Tehran and Washington, particularly as other conflicts rage in the region. Others hold out hope that America’s 47th president might engage in unexpected diplomacy as he did with North Korea.	https://apnews.com/article/iaea-grossi-iran-nuclear-negotiations-efa8ad94a3424135eb21261cccaf4641	2024-11-10T02:38:32-08:00	
The Taliban will attend a UN climate conference for the 1st time	KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — The Taliban will attend a U.N. climate conference for the first time since their takeover of Afghanistan in 2021, the country's national environment agency said Sunday. The conference, known as COP29, begins Monday in Azerbaijan and is one of the most important multilateral talks to include the Taliban, who do not have official recognition as the legitimate rulers of Afghanistan. The National Environmental Protection Agency posted on social media platform X that a technical delegation had gone to Baku to participate. Matiul Haq Khalis, the agency’s head, said the delegation would use the conference to strengthen cooperation with the international community on environmental protection and climate change, share Afghanistan’s needs regarding access to existing financial mechanisms related to climate change, and discuss adaptation and mitigation efforts. Experts told The Associated Press that climate change has led to numerous and negative impacts on Afghanistan, creating serious challenges because of the country’s geographical location and weak climate policies. ' Climate change has resulted in higher temperatures, which reduce water sources and cause droughts, significantly affecting agricultural activities,' said Hayatullah Mashwani, professor of environmental science at Kabul University. 'The reduction in water availability and frequent droughts pose severe threats to agriculture, leading to food insecurity and challenges to livelihoods.' In August, the international aid agency Save the Children published a report saying that Afghanistan is the sixth most vulnerable country to the impacts of climate change and that 25 of its 34 provinces face severe or catastrophic drought conditions, affecting more than half the population. Afghanistan also had the highest number of children made homeless by climate disasters of any country as of the end of 2023, according to the report. Professor Abid Arabzai, from Kabul University, said the climate conference would help to secure international assistance and funding to address Afghanistan’s climate challenges. 'Afghanistan can clarify its climate actions and commitments to the global community, enhancing its international reputation,' said Arabzai.	https://apnews.com/article/afghanistan-taliban-climate-un-cop29-6695d30562689e0eac0f537818f12992	2024-11-10T01:47:24-08:00	
Drones strike Moscow as top UK official highlights Russian casualties in Ukraine	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A massive drone strike rattled Moscow and its suburbs overnight into Sunday, injuring several people and temporarily halting traffic at some of Russia's busiest airports, officials reported. Meanwhile, a huge nighttime wave of Russian drones targeted Ukraine. This came after Russian President Vladimir Putin signed into law a pact with North Korea Saturday night, obliging the two countries to provide immediate military aid using 'all means' if either is attacked. The agreement marks the strongest link between Moscow and Pyongyang since the end of the Cold War. Earlier this week, Ukraine reported that its troops engaged for the first time with North Korean units. U.S. officials earlier confirmed the deployment of at least 3,000 North Korean troops to Russia, while Kyiv has repeatedly said the number is far higher. This has fueled concerns of a marked escalation in Moscow's war on Ukraine, and tensions spilling over into the Asia-Pacific. U.K. estimates Russian troop losses at 700,000 Both Moscow and Kyiv have kept a tight lid on casualty figures since the start of the full-scale war despite regular reports of Russian forces taking huge losses following 'human wave' attacks that aim to exhaust Ukrainian defenses. However, the chief of the U.K. defense staff, Tony Radakin, told the BBC that Russian forces had suffered their worst month of casualties in October since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. He said Moscow’s troops suffered an average of 1,500 dead and wounded per day, bringing their total losses in the war to 700,000. According to Radakin, ordinary Russians were paying 'an extraordinary price' for the war, even as a grueling, monthslong Russian offensive in Ukraine’s industrial east continues to eke out gains. He did not say how U.K. officials had calculated the Russian casualty figures. 'There is no doubt that Russia is making tactical, territorial gains and that is putting pressure on Ukraine,' he said. But he added that they were 'tiny increments of land,' and Moscow’s mounting defense and security spending was putting an increasing strain on the country. Radakin insisted that Ukraine’s Western partners should stand by it for 'as long as it takes' to beat back Russian aggression, even as allies of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump have signaled that Kyiv may have to cede territory to seek peace. Russia is cautiously optimistic about Trump’s forthcoming presidency On Sunday, the Kremlin’s official spokesman voiced cautious optimism about Trump’s upcoming presidency, saying: 'At least he talks about peace. … He does not talk about confrontation.' 'The signals are positive. Trump, during his election campaign, said that he perceives everything through deals, that he can make deals that will lead everyone toward peace,' Dmitry Peskov told reporters at a briefing. 'He does not talk about a desire to inflict a strategic defeat on Russia, and this favorably distinguishes him from the current (U.S.) administration,' Peskov said. But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday insisted that 'strong decisions' from Kyiv’s Western partners are needed to stop the 'terror' of Russian drone and missile strikes, and secure 'reliable peace' for Ukraine. 'The killing of children, the loss of family members cannot simply be forgotten,' Zelenskyy said in a post on the Telegram messaging app. 'Without strong decisions, there is no security from terror, and this is equally clear in every country. There is no reliable peace without justice,' he said. Continuing fighting causes damage and casualties on both sides Fierce fighting has continued near the eastern Ukrainian cities of Toretsk and Kurakhove, Ukraine’s General Staff reported Sunday. Between 700 and 1,000 residents remain in Kurakhove, a front-line city surrounded on three sides and battered into ruin. Most of them live underground with no running water, heating or electricity. Meanwhile, Russia’s Defense Ministry said a total of 84 Ukrainian drones were shot down overnight in Russian territory, following what it called a 'mass strike on civilian infrastructure.' A man died under rubble after drones struck his apartment block in Russia’s Belgorod region, just kilometers from the Ukrainian border, local Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov reported. Five other people were injured in the Moscow suburb of Ramenskoe and a nearby village, according to local officials. Russian channels on the messaging app Telegram carried eyewitness reports of drone debris setting fire to suburban homes. Russia's aviation authority said flights were briefly grounded at major international airports including Sheremetyevo and Domodedovo. At least 14 flights bound for Moscow were rerouted to Nizhnyi Novgorod, a city over 490 kilometers (300 miles) east, airport representatives there reported. Ukraine’s General Staff claimed on Sunday that Ukrainian drones caused a fire at an arms depot in Russia’s southern Bryansk region, near Ukraine and Belarus. The online update featured a photo showing thick plumes of reddish smoke rising into the night sky. The AP could not verify the circumstances in which it was taken, and there was no immediate comment from Russia. Separately, Russia’s emergencies ministry on Sunday said that a major fire broke out at a warehouse outside of Moscow. There were no immediate reports of casualties, and it was not clear whether the blaze was linked to the Ukrainian drone strikes. Russia overnight launched a 'record' 145 drones at Ukrainian territory, according to Ukraine’s air force, 62 of which were shot down. A further 67 were 'lost,' the air force said, a likely reference to electronic jamming that caused the drones to veer off course. At least one person was injured as Russian drones struck residential areas in Ukraine’s southern port of Odesa, local Gov. Oleh Kiper reported. And at least five civilians, including a 17-year-old girl and 10-year-old boy, were injured by falling drone debris and shelling in Ukraine’s northeastern Kharkiv region Sunday, its Gov. Oleh Syniehubov and local prosecutors said. Russia later on Sunday said that it had struck a large deployment of Ukrainian soldiers in the Kharkiv province with thermobaric rockets, but didn't immediately provide evidence. ___ Joanna Kozlowska reported from London. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-moscow-drones-204fd4df47c4fa4be50441f5e9c047c3	2024-11-10T00:47:28-08:00	
As Russian forces close in on Kurakhove, hundreds of residents remain in the front-line city	KURAKHOVE, Ukraine (AP) — Set on Ukraine's eastern front, Kurakhove is surrounded on three sides, with Russian forces just under 2 miles (3 kilometers) from the devastated city center. Yet between 700 and 1,000 local residents remain, most of them living in the basements of apartment buildings, without running water, heating or electricity. The only place to charge phones is in the basement of the building now housing the city administration. The exact number of people is impossible to determine because, since mid-October, no humanitarian volunteers have come to Kurakhove. Under attack from artillery, multiple rocket launchers, aerial bombs and drones, Kurakhove has become the new Bakhmut, as Russia continues its drive westward to capture all of the Donbas region. On Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the situation in Kurakhove, as well as the key city of Pokrovsk, 'the most challenging.' The hospital, schools, kindergartens, water treatment plant, refugee center, post office, technical school and cultural center have all been destroyed. Smoke hangs in the air as bombed-out apartment buildings burn against a backdrop of artillery fire and drones. Artillerymen of the 33rd Brigade say they are firing around 50 shells per day on the Kurakhove front, indicating critical activity in the Russian army’s offensive operations and the brigade's desperate attempts to stop Russian forces from encircling the city. Local authorities remain in the city, as well as representatives of the police and local Territorial Defense Forces. For Artem Shchus, head of police in Kurakhove, there is little hope of defending the city if it becomes surrounded. 'I don’t think it is possible, considering the reality of modern war and modern technologies. In that case, the logistics could be performed only by drones,' he says. Shchus calls the road to Kurakhove, which is lined with burned-out civilian vehicles, the 'road of death,' due to persistent Russian drone attacks. Five civilians have been killed while trying to leave. The road of death No supplies would enter the city without the 'White Angels' evacuation group, made up of local police officers and volunteers. They provide first aid to the wounded and remove the bodies of those killed in shelling, all while operating the city's only functioning food store. The White Angels bring in vital supplies in an armored vehicle kitted out with electronic warfare equipment — the only way to enter the city, and still a journey fraught with risk. 'Without REB (jammers) it is just a lottery. With it, you might still have a chance to survive,' Shchus says. The only way to escape the city is to travel with the White Angels. Each day, they risk their lives to evacuate between six and 12 people from different parts of the city and surrounding villages. Although children are meant to have been evacuated, parents often hide them, both from the bombs and from law enforcement officers. Among the White Angels' key missions is to find children and persuade their parents to evacuate. When this mission is successful and children are removed from the basements, many are shocked by the state of the destroyed city, suggesting that they have been hiding underground for quite some time. After dressing the children in bulletproof vests and helmets, the White Angels take them to the nearby city of Kostiantynopil, from where other volunteers transport them to refugee registration points in the regional centers of Dnipro or Zaporizhzhia. 'We evacuate people every day without stopping. We just dropped people off in Kostiantynopil, and we still have addresses to go through today,' Shchus explains. Asked about adapting to work in such challenging and dangerous conditions, the police chief worries about the impact on his team. 'I think everyone has already adapted. I wouldn’t even call it ‘adaptation.’ It's more like an unhealthy state of mind. I don’t know how this will influence them socially in the future,' he says. 'These people are living in inhumane conditions, and they're surviving on adrenaline. The war is their life. These are hard conditions to work in, but everyone is working.' ___ Associated Press writers Yehor Konovalov in Kyiv and Elise Morton in London also contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/kurakhove-donbas-drones-evacuation-offensive-afb121bfbb276f8bb3789960f7076331	2024-11-10T00:37:25-08:00	
Israeli strikes kill dozens in Lebanon and isolated northern Gaza while Netanyahu and Trump speak	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli strikes killed dozens of people including children on Sunday in Lebanon and isolated northern Gaza, as the world watched for signs of how the U.S. election might affect the war against Iranian-backed militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he has spoken three times with Donald Trump since Tuesday’s election and they 'see eye-to-eye regarding the Iranian threat and all of its components.' Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, is scheduled to meet with U.S. President Joe Biden on Tuesday. The Israeli airstrike in Lebanon killed at least 23 people including seven children in Aalmat village north of Beirut, far from the areas in the east and south where Hezbollah militants have a major presence. Lebanon's Health Ministry said another six people were wounded. There was no Israeli evacuation warning. There was no immediate Israeli comment. Hezbollah began firing rockets, drones and missiles into Israel after war broke out in Gaza, in solidarity with the Palestinians and Hamas. Israel retaliated, and a series of escalations have led to all-out war. In northern Gaza, an Israeli strike on a home sheltering displaced people in the urban refugee camp of Jabaliya killed at least 17 people including nine women, according to Dr. Fadel Naim, director of Al-Ahly Hospital in Gaza City. Israel's military said it targeted a site where militants were operating, without providing evidence. It said the details of the strike are under review. A separate strike hit a house in Gaza City, killing Wael al-Khour, a minister in the Hamas-run government, as well as his wife and three children, according to the Civil Defense, first responders who operate under the government. Israel strikes deeper into Lebanon Israel has struck deeper inside Lebanon since September, when it killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah as well as most of his top commanders. Hezbollah has expanded its rocket fire from northern to central Israel. The fighting has killed over 3,000 people in Lebanon, according to the Health Ministry, and more than 70 people in Israel. After Israel's strike in Aalmat, some 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of Beirut, legislator Raed Berro denied that any Hezbollah personnel or assets were in the building that was hit, adding: 'The important people are on the front line resisting … It is impossible for them to be among people in civilian life.' Hassan Ghaddaf, who lived next door and was lightly wounded, said displaced people were in the house that was struck. 'I had seen them and got to know them the other day,' Ghaddaf said. 'They were peaceful. On the contrary, they had someone from the Lebanese Internal Security Forces that works for the state, and we saw their garb and clothes in the rubble.' In Syria, an Israeli airstrike hit a residential building in the Damascus suburb of Sayyida Zeinab and the Defense Ministry said seven civilians were killed, state news agency SANA reported. Britain-based opposition war monitor The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights suggested Hezbollah was targeted. Israel did not immediately comment. Fears of famine in northern Gaza The mid-month deadline is approaching for an ultimatum the Biden administration gave Israel to allow more aid into Gaza or risk possible restrictions on U.S. military funding. Israeli forces have encircled and largely isolated Jabaliya and the nearby northern Gaza towns of Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun for the past month, allowing only a trickle of humanitarian aid. Experts from a panel that monitors food security say famine is imminent or may already be happening. The northern third of Gaza, including Gaza City, has suffered the heaviest destruction of the 13-month war that was triggered by Hamas' attack into southern Israel. Israel has sent forces back in after repeated operations, saying Hamas has regrouped. Israeli strikes often kill women and children. The military says it only targets militants, whom it accuses of hiding among civilians. Also Sunday, Israel's military released what it said was video footage of Hamas abusing detainees. The soundless footage, dated from 2018 to 2020, appears to show hooded detainees chained in stress positions. In some clips, men beat or poke them with batons. It was not possible to independently verify the videos, which the military said it recovered during operations in Gaza. Rights groups have long accused the Hamas-run government in Gaza and the Western-backed Palestinian Authority in the occupied West Bank of abusing detainees and violently quashing dissent. Israel has been accused of similar abuses, especially since the start of the war. Israeli prison authorities say they follow relevant laws and investigate any allegations of wrongdoing. The toll of war The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. They killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, about a third believed to be dead. Israel's offensive has killed over 43,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities who do not distinguish between civilians and militants in their count but say over half the dead were women and children. Israeli bombardment and ground invasions have left vast areas of Gaza in ruins and displaced around 90% of the population of 2.3 million people, often multiple times. Hundreds of thousands of people live in tent camps with few if any services. Cease-fire talks mediated by the United States, Qatar and Egypt have repeatedly stalled, as have parallel efforts by the U.S. and others to halt the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah.

King Charles III and Kate attend remembrance event as both slowly return to duty	LONDON (AP) — King Charles III led the nation Sunday in a two-minute silence in remembrance of fallen service personnel in central London as the Princess of Wales looked on, a further sign that the royal family is slowly returning to normal at the end of a year in which two of the most popular royals were sidelined by cancer. Remembrance Sunday is a totemic event in the U.K., with the monarch leading senior royals, political leaders, including Prime Minister Keir Starmer and his eight living predecessors, and envoys from the Commonwealth countries in laying wreaths at the Cenotaph, the Portland stone memorial that serves as the focal point for honoring the nation’s war dead. The service is held on the second Sunday of November to mark the signing of the armistice to end World War I 'on the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month' in 1918. Across the U.K., services are conducted at the same time in memory of the dead. After the two-minute silence, buglers from the Royal Marines played the 'Last Post,' and Charles led the wreath-laying part of the service. The 75-year-old king, dressed in his Royal Navy uniform of the Admiral of the Fleet, laid a wreath of poppies at the base of the Cenotaph in recognition of the fallen from conflicts dating back to World War I. His eldest son and the heir to the throne, Prince William, left his own floral tribute — featuring the Prince of Wales’ feathers and a new ribbon in Welsh red. Dressed in somber black, his wife, Kate, watched on from a balcony of the nearby Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office, as is tradition. Queen Camilla, who would normally be standing next to the princess, wasn't present as she recovered from a chest infection. It's the first time since the start of the year that Kate carried out two consecutive days of public official engagements. On Saturday, she attended the Royal British Legion Festival Of Remembrance at the Royal Albert Hall. Following the wreath-laying, around 10,000 veterans, including those who have fought in wars this century, notably in Afghanistan and Iraq, marched past the Cenotaph. With the passage of time, there were only a handful of World War II veterans present. 'It’s always a great honor to be back on occasions like this, but I remember the guys that never came home on my ship when it was torpedoed,' said 99-year-old Stan Ford, who has had to walk with leg calipers ever since the ship that he was serving on — HMS Fratton — was sunk off France's Normandy coast in August 1944 at the cost of 31 lives. 'They never came home, and I always feel it’s my duty to put in an appearance and thank God for those that did survive, and to pray for the ones who didn’t,' said Ford, who was one of 38 survivors. Charles’ ceremonial role as commander in chief of the armed forces is a holdover from the days when the monarch led his troops into battle. But the link between the monarchy and the military is still very strong, with service members taking an oath of allegiance to the king and members of the royal family supporting service personnel through a variety of charities. Charles and William served on active duty in the military before taking up full-time royal duties. Charles was diagnosed with an undisclosed form of cancer in February, forcing him to step away from public appearances for two months as he focused on his treatment and recovery. Just a few weeks later, Kate announced her own cancer diagnosis, which sidelined her for much of the year as she underwent chemotherapy. The king has been in good form in recent months and recently completed a taxing trip to Australia and Samoa. Kate, who made her first post-diagnosis public appearance during the monarch's birthday parade in June, is slowly returning to public duties. Prince William reflected this week on the strain that the cancer scare has placed on the royal family. 'I’m so proud of my wife, I’m proud of my father, for handling the things that they have done,' William told reporters on Thursday as he wrapped up a four-day trip to South Africa. 'But from a personal family point of view, it’s been, yeah, it’s been brutal.' While the Cenotaph was the focus of the national remembrance service, communities throughout the U.K. held their own ceremonies on Sunday. Needham-Crofton, who served with the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers before a truck accident ended his military career, planned to attend a local service in Eastbourne on the south coast of England. He has spent much of his time honoring veterans and trying to help them, including 20 years as a volunteer for the Taxi Charity for Military Veterans. Like some of his army tasks, raising cash was rather grueling as it involved standing in front of London subway stations collecting coins to help fund the group’s efforts. 'I like to respect all the veterans and do what I can for them,' he told The Associated Press. 'It’s a brotherhood really. Even if you don’t know a veteran that you meet, you feel a kinship toward them. That is very important to me. I shall be like that for the rest of my life.'	https://apnews.com/article/britain-remembrance-sunday-veterans-kate-king-charles-670d06dfdda6fb32a1725980932e3870	2024-11-09T20:39:39-08:00	
Soldier with Yemen's exiled government opens fire, killing 2 Saudi troops and wounding another	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — A soldier for Yemen’s exiled government opened fire on Saudi troops as they exercised in eastern Yemen, killing two of them and wounding another in a rare insider attack during the kingdom's nearly decadelong war there, officials said Saturday. The assault in eastern Hadramawt province comes as a yearslong cease-fire between Saudi Arabia and Yemen's Houthi rebels largely has held despite the militants' ongoing attacks against shipping in the Red Sea corridor. While the Houthis did not claim the attack, at least one Houthi official praised it as being 'the beginning and an indication of a harsh future awaiting the invaders.' Meanwhile, U.S. warplanes carried out new strikes targeting Houthi positions that lasted into early Sunday morning, the American military said. The strikes come after the militants likely shot down yet-another American reconnaissance drone over the country. The attack on the Saudi troops took place Friday night in Seiyun, a city some 500 kilometers (310 miles) east of Sanaa. As troops worked out at a Saudi-led base there, the soldier opened fire, killing an officer and a noncommissioned officer, the state-run Saudi Press Agency said, citing a military statement. 'The Joint Forces Command underscores that this ‘Lone Wolf’ cowardly attack does not represent the honorable members of the Yemeni Ministry of Defense,' the statement added. The dead and the other wounded Saudi solider have been brought back to the kingdom, it added. Aidarous al-Zubaidi, the leader of Yemen's successionist Southern Transitional Council, identified the soldier who carried out the attack as belonging to the First Military Region, which is based out of Seiyun. Police in the area published pictures of the soldier, saying there was a 30-million-Yemeni-rial reward for information leading to the soldier's arrest. That's worth around $15,000 on the black market. Authorities offered no motive for the attack. Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, the militant group's Yemen branch, long has operated around Hadramawt. However, the group did not immediately claim the attack. A recent United Nations expert report has said that the al-Qaida group and the Houthis have begun to 'coordinate operations directly with each other.' The Houthis meanwhile did not claim the attack either. However, Houthi official Hamid Rizq praised the attack in a message on the social platform X, claiming it came from 'the feeling of oppression' over Saudi troops being stationed in the area. 'The heroic operation is the beginning and an indication of a harsh future awaiting the invaders,' Rizq wrote. Yemen has been mired in a decadelong war since the Houthis swept into Sanaa from their northern strongholds in September 2014. A Saudi-led coalition entered the war on behalf of Yemen's exiled government in 2015. The war further internationalized, with Iran backing the Houthis with weapons and support that cemented the conflict into a yearslong stalemate. The war has killed more than 150,000 people, including fighters and civilians, and created one of the world’s worst humanitarian disasters, killing tens of thousands more. A cease-fire that expired in October 2022 largely has held in the time since, however, even as the Houthis have seized on the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip and Israel's invasion of Lebanon. On Saturday night, Houthi-run media reported U.S. airstrikes targeting areas around Sanaa. The airstrikes continued into Sunday morning and also included sites in Amran province just outside of the capital, the Houthis said. The rebels offered no immediate damage assessment from the strikes. The U.S. military later told The Associated Press on Sunday it conducted airstrikes 'on numerous Iran-backed Houthi weapons storage facilities within Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen.' It described the sites as housing advanced conventional weapons used to target military and civilian ships in the Red Sea corridor, but offered no other immediate details. The U.S. military has targeted radar stations, military bases and drone and missile launch sites since beginning its ongoing airstrike campaign against the Houthis in January. ___ Associated Press writer Baraa Anwer in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/yemen-saudi-arabia-soldiers-killed-houthis-war-79eb16222c28985a98b77995b4a30149	2024-11-09T17:32:57-08:00	
Mexico and US reach agreement to address Mexico's habit of falling behind in water-sharing payments	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico and the U.S. said they reached an agreement they hope will address Mexico’s habit of falling behind on water-sharing payments in the Rio Bravo watershed, also known as the Rio Grande. The agreement announced Saturday provides Mexico with tools and flexibility to deliver water earlier in a five-year cycle under the 1944 U.S.-Mexico water treaty, according to the bilateral International Border and Water Commission. The proposed tools include better coordination on water conservation, re-use, alternative water sources and other measures. The treaty moves in five-year cycles and allows Mexico to run a water debt in the first four years, if it can make it up in the fifth. That has led Mexico to fall behind, hoping a hurricane or other heavy rains will dump water in the border area. That has frustrated Texas farmers, who need a predictable supply of water. When a hurricane or tropical storm hits the region, Mexico can play catch-up but at that point, the water isn't needed, and that doesn't always happen. Mexico has long used that wait-and-hope strategy, but it has led to problems in the past, both at home and in the U.S. Mexico is obliged to deliver 350,000 acre-feet (430 million cubic meters) of water per year, or about 1.75 million acre-feet (2.15 billion cubic meters) over 5 years. An acre-foot of water is enough to flood a field with one foot of water. The United States, in return, gives Mexico even more water from other water sources farther west. But in the current cycle which began in 2020, Mexico has so far delivered only about 425,000 acre-feet (525 million cubic meters) overall, only about one quarter of what it owes for the five-year period, which ends in October 2025. Mexico has to release water from dams on tributaries feeding into the Rio Grande but that angers Mexican farmers, who want it for themselves and call it 'our water.' The treaty gives the United States rights to one-third of the flows from six Mexican tributaries. In 2020, a dispute over water payments to the United States boiled over into violence, with angry farmers pushing back National Guard troops guarding a dam, because Mexico had fallen behind on payments in that cycle and had to deliver water quickly to the United States. Mexico dispatched National Guard officers to protect the La Boquilla dam in that 2020, but hundreds of farmers pushed and shoved them back hundreds of yards in a failed bid to take over the dam’s control room. Before that, farmers took over another dam near the border town of Ojinaga. Both dams are located near the Texas border, west of the Big Bend area. During the 2020 conflict, Mexican farmers also burned vehicles and blocked railway lines. In the end, the United states allowed Mexico to transfer rights to water held in joint international reservoirs, in a face-saving solution.	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-us-rio-bravo-water-agreement-payments-7c67f8fb669b7fa64e29a1f2eb299ea5	2024-11-09T11:45:35-08:00	
Tens of thousands of Spaniards demand the resignation of Valencia leader for bungling flood response	VALENCIA, Spain (AP) — Tens of thousands of Spaniards marched in the eastern city of Valencia on Saturday to demand the resignation of the regional president in charge of the emergency response to last week’s catastrophic floods that left more than 200 dead and others missing. A group of protestors clashed with riot police in front of Valencia's city hall, where the protestors started their march to the seat of the regional government. Police used batons to beat them back. Regional leader Carlos Mazón is under immense pressure after his administration failed to issue flood alerts to citizens’ cellphones until hours after the flooding started on the night of Oct. 29. Many marchers held up homemade signs or chanted 'Mazón Resign!' Others carried signs with messages like 'You Killed Us!' Upon arrival at the regional government seat, some protesters slung mud on the building and left handprints of the muck on its facade. Earlier on Saturday, Mazón told regional broadcaster À Punt that 'there will be time to hold officials accountable,' but that now 'is time to keep cleaning our streets, helping people and rebuilding.' He said that he 'respected' the march. Mazón, of the conservative Popular Party, is also being criticized for what people perceive as the slow and chaotic response to the natural disaster. Thousands of volunteers were the first boots on the ground in many of the hardest hit areas on Valencia’s southern outskirts. It took days for officials to mobilize the thousands of police reinforcements and soldiers that the regional government asked central authorities to send in. In Spain, regional governments are charged with handling civil protection and can ask the national government in Madrid, led by the Socialists, for extra resources. Mazón has defended his handling of the crisis saying that its magnitude was unforeseeable and that his administration didn’t receive sufficient warnings from central authorities. But Spain’s weather agency issued a red alert, the highest level of warning, for bad weather as early as 7:30 a.m. on Tuesday morning as the disaster loomed. Some communities were flooded by 6 p.m. It took until after 8 p.m. for Mazón’s administration to send out alerts to people’s cellphones. Mazón was with Spain’s royals and Socialist prime minister when they were pelted with mud by enraged residents during their first visit to a devastated area last weekend. Sara Sánchez Gurillo attended the protest because she had lost her brother-in-law, 62-year-old Candido Molina Pulgarín. She said his body was found in a field of orange trees after he was trapped by the water in his home in the town of Cheste, west of Valencia. She wanted Mazón to go, but also had harsh words for the country's leaders. 'It’s shameful what has happened,' Sánchez said. 'They knew that the sky was going to fall and yet they didn’t warn anyone. They didn’t evacuate the people. We want them to resign!' 'The central government should have taken charge. They should have sent in the army earlier. The king should have made them send it in. Why do we want him as a symbolic figure? He is worthless. The people are alone. They have abandoned us.' The death toll stood at 220 victims on Saturday, with 212 coming in the eastern Valencia region, as the search for bodies goes on. Thousands more lost their homes and streets are still covered in mud and debris 11 days since the arrival of a tsunami-like wave following a record deluge. ___ Joseph Wilson reported from Barcelona.	https://apnews.com/article/spain-floods-protest-valencia-897877bed9379462c06ea00ec24b7fd7	2024-11-09T09:51:34-08:00	
Rafael weakens to tropical storm over Gulf of Mexico after barreling through Cuba as a hurricane	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Rafael weakened Saturday to a tropical storm and was expected to dissolve over the Gulf of Mexico in the coming days after barreling across Cuba as a Category 3 hurricane. Rafael was located 290 miles (470 km) north-northwest of Progreso, Mexico on Saturday. It had maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 kph) and was moving west-northwest at 6 mph (9 kph), according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami. It was forecast to continue moving south toward southern Mexico in the coming days as it weakens. Forecasters warned that swells from the storm were likely to cause 'life-threatening surf and rip current conditions' in that region. The hurricane tore through Jamaica and the Cayman Islands earlier in the week, knocking out power and fueling mudslides. On Wednesday evening, it barreled into Cuba, causing yet another headache for the island. Rafael’s fierce winds knocked out Cuba’s electric grid, forced the evacuation of 283,000 people and collapsed 461 homes. It also left trees, power lines and rubble strewn across flooded streets. Many were still without power over the weekend, though Cuba's government said it was working to restore power to homes. On Friday, state media in Cuba reported that Russia said it would donate 80,000 tons of diesel to Cuba, and offered a shipment of equipment for $62 million as the communist-led government struggled to pick up the pieces after the hurricane. Rafael followed a rocky few weeks in the Caribbean nation, after island-wide blackouts stretching on for days and another powerful hurricane that killed at least six people.	https://apnews.com/article/rafael-tropical-storm-gulf-of-mexico-cuba-85ac970fc741696609cfea4e78665918	2024-11-09T09:31:12-08:00	
While Syrian refugees don't want to return, officials in Lebanon and Syria see exodus as opportunity	BEIRUT (AP) — Hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees have returned to their country since Israel launched a massive aerial bombardment on wide swathes of Lebanon in September. Many who fled to Lebanon after the war in Syria started in 2011 did not want to go back. But for officials in Lebanon, the influx of returnees comes as a silver lining to the war between Israel and Hezbollah that has killed more than 3,000 people and displaced some 1.2 million in Lebanon. Some in Syria hope the returning refugees could lead to more international assistance and relief from western sanctions. 'I wasn't thinking at all about returning' Nisreen al-Abed returned to her northwest Syrian hometown in October after 12 years as a refugee in Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley. The airstrikes had been terrifying, but what really worried her was that her 8-year-old twin daughters need regular transfusions to treat a rare blood disorder, thalassemia. 'I was afraid that in Lebanon, in this situation, I wouldn’t be able to get blood for them,' al-Abed said. During their dayslong journey, Al-Abed and her daughters were smuggled from government-held to opposition-held territory before reaching her parent’ house. Her husband remained in Lebanon. 'Before these events, I wasn’t thinking at all about returning to Syria,' she said. According to the U.N. refugee agency, more than 470,000 people — around 70% of them Syrian — have crossed the border since the escalation in Lebanon began in mid-September. Lebanon's General Security agency estimates more than 550,000 people have fled, most of them Syrian. Most of the returnees are in government-controlled areas of Syria, according to UNHCR, while tens of thousands have made their way to the Kurdish-controlled northeast and smaller numbers to the opposition-controlled northwest. Political leaders in Lebanon, which was hosting an estimated 1.5 million Syrian refugees before the recent wave of returns, have been calling for years for the displaced to go home, and many don't want the refugees to return. Lebanon's caretaker Minister of Social Affairs Hector Hajjar told Russia's Sputnik News last month that the war in Lebanon could yield 'a positive benefit, an opportunity to return a large number of displaced Syrians to their country, because the situation there is now better than here.' A political opening for Syria? Officials in Damascus point to increasing economic pressure from the masses fleeing Lebanon as an argument for loosening western sanctions on President Bashar Assad's government. Syria was already suffering from spiraling inflation, and the sudden influx of refugees has driven prices up even more, as have Israeli strikes on border crossings that have slowed legal cross-border trade and smuggling. 'Everyone knows that Syria is suffering from difficult economic conditions: hyperinflation, import inflation, and an economic blockade,' said Abdul-Qader Azzouz, an economic analyst and professor at Damascus University. The influx of refugees just 'increases the economic burden,' he said. Alaa al-Sheikh, a member of the executive bureau in Damascus province, urged the U.S. to lift sanctions on Syria because of the huge number of arrivals. 'The burden is big and we are in pressing need of international assistance,' she said. Rights groups have raised concerns about the treatment of returning refugees. The Jordan-based Syrian think tank ETANA estimates at least 130 people were 'arbitrarily arrested at official border crossings or checkpoints inside Syria, either because they were wanted for security reasons or military service,' despite a government-declared amnesty for men who dodged the draft. Joseph Daher, a Swiss-Syrian researcher and professor at the European University Institute in Florence, noted the number of arrests is small and that Assad's government might not view the returnees as a threat because they are mostly women and children. Still, Daher labeled government attempts to show the returning refugees are welcome as 'propaganda,' saying, 'they’re unwilling and not ready in terms of economics or politics to do it.' UNHCR head Filippo Grandi said this week that his agency is working with the Syrian government 'to ensure the safety and security of all those arriving,' and he urged donors to provide humanitarian aid and financial assistance to help Syria recover after 13 years of war. A temporary return UNHCR regional spokeswoman Rula Amin said if people leave the country where they are registered as refugees, they usually lose their protected status. Whether and how that will be applied in the current situation remains unclear, Amin said, underscoring the exodus from Lebanon took place 'under adverse circumstances, that is under duress.' 'Given the current situation, the procedure will need to be applied with necessary safeguards and humanity,' she said. Jeff Crisp, a visiting research fellow at the University of Oxford’s Refugee Studies Center and a former UNHCR official, said he believes Syrians are entitled to continued international protection 'because of the grave threats to their life and liberty in both countries.' Some refugees have entered Syria via smuggler routes so their departure from Lebanon is not officially recorded, including Um Yaman, who left Beirut's heavily bombarded southern suburbs with her children for the city of Raqqa in eastern Syria. 'When I went to Syria, to be honest, I went by smuggling, in case we wanted to go back to Lebanon later when things calm down, so our papers would remain in order in Lebanon,' she said. She asked to be identified only by her honorific ('mother of Yaman') to be able to speak freely. If the war in Lebanon ends, Um Yaman said, they may return, but 'nothing is clear at all.' ___ Associated Press writer Albert Aji in Damascus, Syria, contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-syria-refugees-9a88483256c625661acfadbaac66cbf5	2024-11-09T09:17:07-08:00	
Ecuador's VP suspended for 150 days deepening rift with president as February election looms	QUITO (AP) — Ecuador's Vice President Veronica Abad was suspended Saturday for 150 days accused of 'unjustified abandonment' of her duties. It comes during a public rift between Abad and President Daniel Noboa that could have implications for Ecuador 's February elections. Abad's suspension without pay came at midnight, her lawyer Dominique Dávila told The Associated Press. Dávila called the move 'extremely serious' and claimed it may not have any legal backing. Abad was accused by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of not following an order in September to temporarily transfer her from Israel — where she also serves as ambassador — to Turkey due to the conflict, arriving eight days after the order. Abad had argued that she was not 'properly prepared' for the trip to Turkey and that Ecuador's government suggested 'that I leave my children in Israel to go to Turkey alone.' The move comes at a time of deep tensions between Abad and Noboa who, despite running the government together, have clashed for years establishing a sort of feud, the origins of which are unknown. In August, Abad filed a legal complaint accusing Noboa and other officials of gender-based violence. The suspension was the second sanction against Abad in less than a week. Abad was also fined $8,500 on Tuesday by Ecuador’s Electoral Disputes Tribunal for early election campaigning in 2023 when she was a candidate for mayor of the city of Cuenca. The vice president has previously cited the Israel case and other incidents as government measures to pressure her to resign, while the president has called her 'disloyal.' Dávila, Abad's lawyer, said the suspension was the latest attempt to push Abad out, calling it a 'trick to prevent the presidential succession' and something they planned to appeal. Abad’s fate has special importance for Noboa, who hopes to run for reelection in February 2025, and will have to request a leave of absence to carry out the campaign, according to experts. In that case, Abad would take over the presidency, but with the recent sanctions, the pathway to her taking the reigns would be blocked, according to constitutional lawyer André Benavides. The expert said that while the suspension lacks strong legal backing, any appeals process to reverse the 150 day suspension would take longer than the suspension period.	https://apnews.com/article/ecuador-daniel-noboa-elections-abad-israel-turkey-8016799ca759405486a4889e12359b46	2024-11-09T09:16:53-08:00	
Family of 31-year-old American tourist killed in Hungary's capital mourns loss, suspect in custody	BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — Family members of a 31-year-old American tourist who was killed while on vacation in Hungary’s capital mourned their loss while a 37-year-old suspect was in custody Saturday. The victim, Mackenzie Michalski from Portland, Oregon, was reported missing on Nov. 5 after she was last seen at a nightclub in central Budapest. Police launched a missing person investigation and reviewed security footage from local nightclubs where they observed Michalski with a man later identified as the suspect in several of the clubs the night of her disappearance. The man was detained on Nov. 7 and questioned by police, and later confessed to the killing. Before the confession, Michalski's family and friends had launched an effort to find her, starting a Facebook group to gather tips on her whereabouts. Her parents traveled to Hungary to assist in the search, but while en route learned that she had been killed. At a candlelight vigil in Budapest on Saturday night, the victim's father, Bill Michalski, told The Associated Press that he was 'still overcome with emotion' at the death of his daughter. 'There was no reason for this to happen,' he said. 'I’m still trying to wrap my arms around what happened ... I don’t know that I ever will.' Police detained the suspect, an Irish citizen, on the evening of Nov. 7. Investigators said that Michalski and the suspect met at a nightclub and danced before leaving for the man's rented apartment. The man killed Michalski while they were engaged in an 'intimate encounter,' police said. The suspect, whom police identified by the initials L.T.M., confessed to the killing, but said it had been an accident. Police said that he had attempted to cover up his crime by cleaning the apartment and hiding Michalski's body in a wardrobe before purchasing a suitcase and placing her body inside. He then rented a car and drove to Lake Balaton, around 90 miles (150 kilometers) southwest of Budapest, where he disposed of the body in a wooden area outside the town of Szigliget. Video released by police showed the suspect guiding authorities to the location where he had left the body. Police said the suspect had made internet searches before being apprehended on how to dispose of a body, police procedures in missing person cases, whether pigs really eat dead bodies, and the presence of wild boars in the Lake Balaton area. He also made an internet search inquiring on the competence of Budapest police. Crime scene photographs released by police showed a rolling suitcase, several articles of clothing including a pair of fleece-lined boots, and a small handbag next to a credit card bearing Michalski's name. According to a post by an administrator of a Facebook group called 'Find Mackenzie Michalski,' which was created on Nov. 7, Michalski, who went by 'Kenzie,' was a nurse practitioner who 'will forever be remembered as a beautiful and compassionate young woman.' At the candlelight vigil in Budapest on Saturday, Michalski's father gave brief comments to those who had gathered, and was wearing a baseball cap he said he had received as a gift from his daughter. Michalski had visited Budapest before, and called it her 'happy place,' her father told the AP. 'The history, she just loved it and she was just so relaxed here,' he said. 'This was her city.'	https://apnews.com/article/hungary-suspect-arrested-american-tourist-killed-budapest-da7b6ee0a9aab10a9976a71137f3ff07	2024-11-09T08:06:22-08:00	
5 siblings, some of them deaf, among those killed in Israeli strikes in Lebanon	TYRE, Lebanon (AP) — An Israeli airstrike on the southern Lebanese port city of Tyre left at least seven people dead, among them five siblings, three of whom were deaf and mute, officials and a resident said Saturday. Elsewhere in Lebanon, Israeli airstrikes killed 31 people. The rise in Tyre’s death toll came as Israel’s air force carried out airstrikes on different parts of southern and eastern Lebanon on Saturday hours after Beirut’s southern suburbs were pounded by jets, destroying several buildings, state media reported. The Health Ministry said late Saturday that the airstrikes on towns and villages in the eastern Bekaa Valley and Baalbek-Hermel province left 20 people dead while those in two villages in south Lebanon killed 11 people, including five paramedics. Lebanon’s Hezbollah group said it fired dozens of rockets on northern Israel and shot down a drone over south Lebanon. The group said that Israel’s air force struck the area where the drone crashed. There was no immediate confirmation from the Israeli military. The Health Ministry said the strikes on Tyre late Friday night also wounded 46 people. It added that remains also were found in rubble and DNA tests will be used to identify the victims. Youssef Jundi, a Tyre resident, told The Associated Press that the airstrikes destroyed several buildings in the coastal city. He said that his long-time neighbor and friend, Ghazwa Dabouk, was among those killed. Dabouk’s sisters Elissar, Rabab and Fidaa, who were deaf and mute, were also killed in the airstrike, together with Dabouk's brother Ali, who had autism. The Israeli military said it attacked the Tyre offices of Hezbollah’s intelligence department as well as a command and control center for the group in the city. More than 3,000 people were killed in Lebanon during the 13 months of the Israel-Hezbollah war. Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel the day after Hamas’ surprise attack into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, ignited the war in Gaza. Hezbollah and Hamas are both allied with Iran. For nearly a year, the conflict was mostly contained to the areas along the border between Israel and Lebanon. The conflict dramatically escalated on Sept. 23 with intense Israeli airstrikes on south and east Lebanon as well as Beirut’s southern suburbs, leaving hundreds dead and leading to the displacement of nearly 1.2 million people. Israel began a ground invasion of south Lebanon on Oct. 1, causing wide destruction in border villages but making little advances on the ground inside Lebanon. Israel says it is destroying Hezbollah weapons and command centers near the border, including an extensive tunnel system built by Hezbollah. ____ Mroue reported from Beirut. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-tyre-hezbollah-airstrikes-4670246c9bcb30a5eff31b9575e19ac9	2024-11-09T07:04:35-08:00	
Iranian American human rights activist expresses defiance over Iranian plots to kill her and Trump	BERLIN (AP) — In the middle of a Berlin hotel cafe, Masih Alinejad raises her voice and starts singing at the top of her lungs in Farsi, as waiters turn to watch along with the three German government bodyguards assigned to protect her. 'I blossom through my wounds and my scars,' she translates the lyrics as. 'Because I am a woman. I am a woman. I am a woman.' Alinejad was expressing her defiance and asserting her right to express herself following the news of Iranian murder-for-hire plots to kill her and Donald Trump that were disclosed by the U.S. Justice Department. She said that some Iranian women had been jailed for singing. The Iranian American human rights activist, who was in Berlin on Saturday to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall together with other human rights activists from around the globe, told The Associated Press in an interview that despite the shock of the news, she felt more determination than ever to continue fighting for women's rights in Iran. 'They want to get rid of me. When they want me dead, it means that I’m doing something. I’m hurting them so bad,' Alinejad, 48, said, referring to the Iranian government. 'I’m echoing the voice of powerful women and that scares them.' She raised her hand in a defiant fist repeatedly during the interview. On Friday, the U.S. Justice Department said that it was charging a man who said he had been tasked by a government official before this week’s election with planning the assassination of Trump. Investigators were told of the plan by Farhad Shakeri, an accused Iranian government asset who spent time in American prisons for robbery and who authorities say maintains a network of criminal associates enlisted by Tehran for surveillance and murder-for-hire plots. Shakeri is at large and remains in Iran. Two other men — identified as Jonathan Loadholt and Carlisle Rivera by the U.S. Justice Department — were arrested on charges that Shakeri recruited them to follow and kill Alinejad, who has endured multiple Iranian murder-for-hire plots foiled by law enforcement. The Justice Department alleges that the two men spent months conducting surveillance on her and, during their efforts to locate and kill her, shared messages about their progress and photographs. Around February, they traveled to Fairfield University in Connecticut, where Alinejad was scheduled to appear and took photos of the campus. Around April, Shakeri sent Rivera a series of voice notes discussing their efforts to locate and kill her, the Justice Department said in a statement Friday. In one voice note, Shakeri told Rivera that 'you gotta wait and have patience to catch her either going in the house or coming out, or following her out somewhere and taking care of it,' the statement said. 'It’s scary. But at the same time, I was very pleased that the U.S. law enforcement is protecting me,' Alinejad said, recounting her call with American security officials. 'The same person who was trying to kill President Trump was assigned to kill me as well. I mean, that’s a badge of honor,' she added. In Tehran, Esmail Baghaei, an Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman, rejected the report and called it a plot by Israel-linked circles to make Iran-U.S. relations more complicated, the official IRNA news agency reported. Alinejad is a prominent figure on Farsi-language satellite channels abroad that critically view Iran, and she has worked as a contractor for U.S.-funded Voice of America’s Farsi-language network since 2015. She fled Iran following the country’s disputed 2009 presidential election and became a U.S. citizen in October 2019. Alinejad accused the Iranian government of continuing to oppress women in Iran and make them wear the mandatory headscarf, or hijab, even two years after the death of Mahsa Amini that sparked weekslong mass protests. The fact that the Iranian government has repeatedly tried to kill her, she said, 'makes me more determined to give voice to powerful women inside Iran who are facing the same killers every single day.'	https://apnews.com/article/germany-us-iran-murder-plot-masih-alinejad-72e20558d5f3c2b78e16188c85a88d8d	2024-11-09T06:59:44-08:00	
Tens of thousands celebrate fall of the Berlin Wall 35 years ago with concerts and art installations	BERLIN (AP) — Tens of thousands of people celebrated the fall of the Berlin Wall 35 years ago in Germany's capital on Saturday with open-air concerts, art installations and official events commemorating one of the country's most historic days on Nov. 9, 1989. It was 'a lucky day for which we Germans are still grateful today,' Chancellor Olaf Scholz said. Built in 1961, the Berlin Wall stood for 28 years at the front line of the Cold War between the Americans and the Soviets. It was built by communists to cut off East Germans from the supposed ideological contamination of the West and to stem the tide of people fleeing East Germany. It had carved a 156.4-kilometer (97.2-mile) swath through Berlin’s heart and the surrounding countryside, and through the hearts of many of its people. However, when the border was opened 35 years ago, it took less than a year until the country’s reunification on Oct. 3, 1990. Today only a few stretches of the wall remain, mostly as a tourist attraction. For the anniversary celebrations on Saturday, event organizers created a temporary wall of 5,000 posters designed by children and adults under the motto 'We uphold freedom,' which attracted a steady flow of visitors, including many foreign tourists. It stands along a four-kilometer (2.5-mile ) stretch of the former wall in downtown Berlin. The posters combine the demands of East German protesters against the communist authorities in autumn 1989, such as freedom of expression, freedom of the press and freedom to travel, with current day wishes and were created as part of workshops in schools, church parishes, local art groups and cultural projects. 'Uphold freedom, because without freedom everything else is nothing,' Berlin Mayor Kai Wegner said at an official anniversary event with President Frank-Walter Steinmeier at the Berlin Wall Memorial. 'Freedom and democracy have never been a matter of course,' the mayor said, warning that both were currently under attack from many sides. For Saturday night, 700 professional and amateur musicians were expected to synchronously play songs on different stages along the path of the former wall. Among other songs, they were planning to perform Heroes' by David Bowie and 'Freiheit,' or freedom, by German rockstar Marius Müller-Westernhagen. The lyrics will be shown on screens so that the audience can sing along. The Russian dissident band 'Pussy Riot' is expected to perform on Sunday as the highlight and conclusion of the anniversary celebrations.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-fall-of-berlin-wall-35th-anniversary-6b58354d28bc3a727ccc4334c395e7b7	2024-11-09T06:29:28-08:00	
Tourists in Rome now have a walkway to visit the Trevi Fountain but can't toss coins	ROME (AP) — Tourists in Rome won’t be allowed to toss coins over their shoulders into the Trevi Fountain, following tradition, though an elevated walkway now gives limited access to the monument during maintenance work. Rome Mayor Roberto Gualtieri inaugurated the steel walkway on Saturday, saying it will provide tourists with a close-up view of the fountain and calling it a 'unique experience' that won’t be ruined by overcrowding. The walkway over the fountain’s basin will be able to accommodate about 130 people at a time. But tourists won’t be allowed to toss coins from there, as the fountain is currently drained, and could face a 50-euro fine if they do, the mayor warned. City lore has it that tossing a coin into the Baroque fountain will ensure a return trip to Rome. Gualtieri said a small pool has been set up next to the walkway to collect the coins, which are donated to the Caritas charity to fund meals for people in need. The walkway will remain until the end of the maintenance work, which is expected to finish by year's end. Rome city officials are devising a plan to block off the area around the fountain. Under the plan, visitors will be required to book online and pay 2 euros ($2.20). Once inside, they will have 30 minutes to enjoy the fountain.	https://apnews.com/article/italy-trevi-fountain-coins-tourists-36b23e5dcca6dae53dcf59fcd6b7d5fa	2024-11-09T06:27:34-08:00	
Attacks on Israeli fans in the Netherlands prompts prime minister to cancel climate talks trip	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof on Saturday canceled a trip to United Nations climate talks in Azerbaijan so he can stay in the Netherlands to deal with the fallout from assaults on fans of Maccabi Tel Aviv soccer team in Amsterdam that authorities condemned as antisemitic. The government will discuss the Thursday night violence at a Cabinet meeting on Monday, Schoof posted on X, saying that he would hold talks on tackling antisemitism on Tuesday. Police launched a large-scale investigation after gangs of youths conducted what Amsterdam's mayor called 'hit and run' attacks on fans that were apparently inspired by calls on social media to target Jewish people. Five people were treated at hospitals and more than 60 suspects were arrested. Amsterdam police said that four of the suspects remained jailed Saturday. In addition to the police investigation and an independent inquiry announced by Amsterdam's mayor, Dutch Justice and Security Minister David van Weel said in a letter to lawmakers that the government is investigating whether warnings of possible violence from Israel were overlooked in the lead up to the Europa League match between Ajax and Maccabi. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar rushed to the Netherlands on Friday and offered Israel's help in the police investigation. He met Saturday with Dutch counterpart Caspar Veldkamp. Amsterdam Mayor Femke Halsema said that the Netherlands' counterterror watchdog had reported before the match there was no 'concrete threat' to Israeli fans, and the match wasn't considered a high risk. Even so, Amsterdam authorities banned a pro-Palestinian demonstration outside the Johan Cruyff Arena where Thursday night’s match was played. Video also showed a large crowd of Israeli fans chanting anti-Arab slogans on their way to the game. Afterward, youths on scooters and on foot went in search of Israeli fans, punching and kicking them and then fleeing quickly to evade hundreds of police officers deployed around the city, Halsema said. Schoof returned early from a European Union summit in Hungary and met Friday night with representatives of the Jewish community in the Netherlands. 'It was a compelling conversation about the sadness and uncertainty experienced in the Jewish community. Every day they experience the consequences of growing antisemitism in the Netherlands,' Schoof said on X. A ban on demonstrations was in place throughout Amsterdam over the weekend, and security was beefed up at Jewish sites in the city, which has a large Jewish community and was home to Jewish World War II diarist Anne Frank and her family as they hid from Nazi occupiers.	https://apnews.com/article/amsterdam-soccer-violence-israel-palestinians-bece8281ad2d653e95cb1b3dc0f527cc	2024-11-09T05:40:42-08:00	
Queen Camilla has a chest infection and will miss the UK's annual Remembrance Sunday events	LONDON (AP) — Queen Camilla will miss Britain's annual remembrance weekend events to honor fallen service personnel while she recovers from a chest infection, Buckingham Palace said Saturday. The wife of King Charles III, was due to join the royal family at a 'Festival of Remembrance' at London's Royal Albert Hall on Saturday night. The 77-year-old was also scheduled to honor the war dead at the Remembrance Sunday ceremony at the Cenotaph war memorial, a major event for Britain's royals, the next day. 'Following doctors’ guidance to ensure a full recovery from a seasonal chest infection, and to protect others from any potential risk, Her Majesty will not attend this weekend’s Remembrance events,' the statement said, adding that she was greatly disappointed. Charles and his daughter-in-law Kate, the Princess of Wales, who both announced earlier this year that they had been diagnosed with cancer, are expected to attend the twin events. The king was diagnosed with an undisclosed form of cancer in February but he has gradually returned to public duties after receiving treatment, and recently completed a trip to Australia and Samoa. Kate underwent her own treatment for an unspecified type of cancer that was detected after abdominal surgery earlier in the year. She said in September that it has been a difficult year but expressed relief that she has completed chemotherapy.	https://apnews.com/article/britain-royals-camilla-remembrance-sunday-25831084b44ec868dd84654d712fa7ad	2024-11-09T05:38:36-08:00	
One of 8 migrants sent to Albania returned to Italy	ROME (AP) — One of the eight migrants brought for processing in an Albanian center after being intercepted in international waters has returned to Italy after being deemed 'vulnerable,' a delegation of Italian activists and lawmakers visiting the center said on Saturday. The Egyptian man was diagnosed with 'psychic problems,' which made it impossible for him to remain at the Gjadër reception center, one of the activists said. Currently only seven migrants – five from Bangladesh and two from Egypt – remain at the Albanian center. The group represented the second transfer of migrants since two processing centers started operating in October under a deal sealed between Italy and Albania. Human rights groups and nongovernmental organizations active in the Mediterranean have slammed the agreement as a dangerous precedent that conflicts with international laws. The agreement allows up to 3,000 migrants intercepted by the Italian coast guard in international waters each month to be sheltered in Albania, and vetted for possible asylum in Italy or be sent back to their countries. Italy has agreed to welcome those migrants who are granted asylum, while those whose applications are rejected face deportation directly from Albania. The first group of 16 migrants from Bangladesh and Egypt was transferred to Albania on Oct. 16. Four were taken to Italy the same day because they were minors or had health issues. Twelve others were brought back to Italy three days later, following a ruling by Rome judges who rejected their detention because their countries of origin weren’t safe enough for them to be sent back. The court ruling had shortened the list of countries considered 'safe' by law, meaning that Rome can repatriate migrants from those countries who didn’t win asylum using a fast-track procedure. Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni slammed the decision, noting that deeming countries such as Bangladesh and Egypt unsafe means that virtually all migrants would be barred from the Albania program. On Oct. 21, Italy’s far-right government approved a new decree aimed at overcoming those judicial hurdles that risked derailing the contentious five-year migration deal with Albania. A decision by Rome judges on the detention of the seven migrants currently in Albania is expected for Monday. ___ Follow AP’s global migration coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/migration	https://apnews.com/article/italy-albania-centers-migrants-f514411c7bef176d1ff2d8dc68caf983	2024-11-09T03:49:11-08:00	
Hungry Palestinians in north Gaza search for food, sealed off from aid for a month by Israeli siege	JERUSALEM (AP) — With virtually no food allowed into the northernmost part of Gaza for the past month, tens of thousands of Palestinians under Israeli siege are rationing their last lentils and flour to survive. As bombardment pounds around them, some say they risk their lives by venturing out in search of cans of food in the rubble of destroyed homes. Thousands have staggered out of the area, hungry and thin, into Gaza City, where they find the situation little better. One hospital reports seeing thousands of children suffering from malnutrition. A nutritionist said she treated a pregnant woman wasting away at just 40 kilograms (88 pounds). 'We are being starved to force us to leave our homes,' said Mohammed Arqouq, whose family of eight is determined to stay in the north, weathering Israel’s siege. 'We will die here in our homes.' Medical workers warn that hunger is spiraling to dire proportions under a monthlong siege on north Gaza by the Israeli military, which has been waging a fierce campaign since the beginning of October, saying it's rooting out militants. Hamas, who are still holding hostages inside Gaza, have regrouped in the area and have been carrying out hit-and-run attacks from tunnels and bombed-out buildings. The military has severed the area with checkpoints, ordering residents to leave. Many Palestinians fear Israel aims to depopulate the north long term. On Friday, experts from a panel that monitors food security said famine is imminent in the north or may already be happening. The growing desperation comes as the deadline approaches next week for a 30-day ultimatum the Biden administration gave Israel: raise the level of humanitarian assistance allowed into Gaza or risk possible restrictions on U.S. military funding. The U.S. says Israel must allow a minimum of 350 trucks a day carrying food and other supplies. Israel has fallen far short. In October, 57 trucks a day entered Gaza on average, according to figures from Israel's military agency overseeing aid entry, known as COGAT. In the first week of November, the average was 81 a day. The U.N. puts the number even lower — 37 trucks daily since the beginning of October. It says Israeli military operations and general lawlessness often prevent it from collecting supplies, leaving hundreds of truckloads stranded at the border. U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Israel had made some progress by announcing the opening of a new crossing into central Gaza and approving new delivery routes. But he said Israel must do more. 'It’s not just sufficient to open new roads if more humanitarian assistance isn’t going through those roads,' he said. A desperate daily struggle Israeli forces have been hammering the towns of Beit Lahiya, Beit Hanoun and Jabaliya refugee camp. Witnesses report intense fighting between troops and militants. A trickle of food has reached Gaza City, but as of Thursday, nothing entered the towns farther north for 30 days, even as an estimated 70,000 people remain there, said Louise Wateridge, spokesperson for the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, speaking from Gaza City. The government acknowledged in late October that it hadn't allowed aid into Jabaliya because of military 'operational constraints' in response to a petition by Israeli human rights groups. On Saturday, COGAT said it allowed 11 trucks of food and supplies into Beit Hanoun and Jabaliya. But Alia Zaki, a spokeswoman for the WFP, said Israeli troops at a checkpoint forced the convoy to unload the food before it could reach shelters in Beit Hanoun. It was not clear what then happened to the supplies. Palestinians in the north described to The Associated Press a desperate daily struggle to find food, water and safety, as strikes level buildings, sometimes killing whole families. Arqouq said he goes out at night to search bombed-out buildings: 'Sometimes you find a half-empty package of flour, canned food and lentils.' His family relies on help from others sheltering at a Jabaliya school, he said — but their food, too, is running low. 'We are like dogs and cats searching for their food in the rubble,' said Um Saber, a widow. She said she and her six children had to flee a school-turned-shelter in Beit Lahiya when Israel struck it. Now they live in her father-in-law's home, stretching meager supplies of lentils and pasta with 40 others, mostly women and children. Ahmed Abu Awda, a 28-year-old father of three living with 25 relatives in a Jabaliya house, said they have a daily meal of lentils with bread, rationing to ensure children eat. 'Sometimes we don’t eat at all,' he said. Lubna, a 38-year-old mother of five, left food behind when fleeing as strikes and drone fire pummeled the street in Jabaliya. 'We got out by a miracle,' she said from Beit Lahiya, where they're staying. She spoke on condition her family name not be used for fear of her safety. Her husband scavenged flour from destroyed homes after Israeli forces withdrew around nearby Kamal Adwan hospital, she said. It's moldy, she said, so they sift it first. Her young daughter, Selina, is visibly gaunt and bony, Lubna said. Surrender or starve The offensive has raised fears among Palestinians that Israel seeks to empty northern Gaza and hold it long term under a surrender-or-starve plan proposed by former generals. The Israeli military has denied receiving such orders, but the government hasn't denied the plan outright. Witnesses report Israeli troops going building-to-building, forcing people to leave toward Gaza City. On Thursday, the Israeli military ordered new evacuations from several Gaza City neighborhoods, raising the possibility of a ground assault there. The U.N. said some 14,000 displaced Palestinians were sheltering there. Food and supplies are stretched for the several hundred thousand people in Gaza City, too. Much of the city has been flattened by months of Israeli bombardment and shelling. Dr. Rana Soboh, a nutrition specialist at Gaza City’s Patient Friend Benevolent Hospital, said she sees some 350 cases of moderate to severe acute malnutrition daily, most from the north but also Gaza City. 'The bone of their chest is showing, the eyes are protruding,' she said, and many have trouble concentrating. 'You repeat something a number of times, so they can understand what we are saying.' She cited a 32-year-old woman shedding weight in her third month of pregnancy — when they put her on the scale, she weighed only 40 kilograms (88 pounds). 'We are suffering, facing the ghost of famine that is hovering over Gaza,' Soboh said. A problem long in the making Even before the siege in the north, the Patient Friend hospital saw a flood of children suffering from malnutrition — more than 4,780 in September compared with 1,100 in July, said Dr Ahmad Eskiek, who oversees hospital operations. Soboh said staff get calls from Beit Lahiya and Jabaliya pleading for help: 'What can we do? We have nothing.' She had worked at Kamal Adwan Hospital in the north but fled with her family to Gaza City. Now they stay with 22 people in her uncle's two-bedroom apartment. Thursday, she had had a morsel of bread for breakfast and later a meal of yellow lentils. As winter rains near, new arrivals set up tents wherever they can. Some 1,500 people are in a U.N. school already heavily damaged in strikes that 'could collapse at any moment,' UNRWA spokesperson Wateridge said. With toilets destroyed, people try to set aside a corner of a classroom to use, leaving waste 'streaming down the walls of the school,' she said. Others in Gaza City move into the rubble of buildings, draping tarps between layers of collapsed concrete, she said. 'It’s like the carcass of a city,' she said. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

Russia open to hearing Trump's proposals for ending the war, an official says	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia is open to hearing President-elect Donald Trump’s proposals on ending the war, an official said, as a Russian drone killed one person and wounded 13 in the Ukrainian port city of Odesa and the European Union foreign policy chief held talks in Kyiv on support for Ukraine after the change in U.S. leadership. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Moscow and Washington were 'exchanging signals' on Ukraine via 'closed channels.' He did not specify whether the communication was with the current administration or Trump and members of his incoming administration. Russia is ready to listen to Trump’s proposals on Ukraine provided these were 'ideas on how to move forward in the area of ​​settlement, and not in the area of ​​further pumping the Kyiv regime with all kinds of aid,' Ryabkov said Saturday in an interview with Russian state news agency Interfax. Odesa regional Gov. Oleh Kiper said high-rise residential buildings, private houses and warehouses in the Black Sea port city were damaged by the 'fall' of a drone. He did not specify whether the drone had been shot down by air defenses. A further 32 Russian drones were shot down over 10 Ukrainian regions, while 18 were 'lost,' according to Ukraine’s air force, likely having been electronically jammed. A Russian aerial bomb struck a busy highway overnight in the northeastern Kharkiv province, Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekohov said. No casualties were reported. Russia is mounting an intensified aerial campaign that Ukrainian officials say they need more Western help to counter. However, doubts are deepening over what Kyiv can expect from a new U.S. administration. Trump has repeatedly taken issue with U.S. aid to Ukraine, made vague vows to end the war and has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, however, reassured Ukraine of European support during a visit to Kyiv on Saturday. 'EU support to Ukraine has been my personal priority during my mandate and will remain on top of the EU’s agenda,' he wrote on X. In Russia, the Defense Ministry said 50 Ukrainian drones were destroyed over seven Russian regions — more than half over the Bryansk region, bordering Ukraine. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-odesa-borrell-drone-a16db37ffa75c3cc92c01a6e9d79142f	2024-11-09T01:22:38-08:00	
Israeli strikes in Gaza kill at least 16 people as aid arrives in the north after weeks of hunger	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Three separate Israeli strikes killed at least 16 people, including women and children, in Gaza on Saturday, Palestinian medical officials said, while Israel announced the first delivery of humanitarian aid in weeks to hungry, devastated northern Gaza. There continued to be no end in sight to Israel's campaigns against Hamas militants in Gaza or Hezbollah in Lebanon, where Israel's military said that it struck command centers and other militant infrastructure overnight in Beirut's southern suburbs. One of the strikes in Gaza hit a school-turned-shelter in Gaza City’s eastern Tufah neighborhood, killing at least six people, the territory's Health Ministry said. Two local journalists, a pregnant woman and a child were among the dead, it said. The Israeli army said the strike targeted a militant belonging to the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group, offering no evidence or details. Seven people were killed when an Israeli strike hit a tent in the southern city of Khan Younis where displaced people were sheltering, according to Nasser Hospital. It said the dead included two women and a child. The Israeli army didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. And Palestinian medical officials said an Israeli strike hit tents in the courtyard of central Gaza’s main hospital, including one serving as a police point. At least three people were killed and a local journalist was wounded, Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in Deir al-Balah said. It was the eighth Israeli attack on the compound since March. Israel says aid trucks reach northern Gaza The Israeli military body in charge of humanitarian aid to Gaza, COGAT, said Saturday that 11 aid trucks containing food, water and medical equipment reached the enclave's far north on Thursday. It's the first time any aid has reached the far north since Israel began a new military campaign there last month. But not all the aid reached the agreed drop-off points, according to the the U.N. World Food Program, which was involved in the delivery process. In the urban refugee camp of Jabaliya, Israeli troops stopped one convoy bound for nearby Beit Lahiya and ordered the supplies to be offloaded, WFP spokesperson Alia Zaki said. Israel’s offensive has focused on Jabaliya, where Israel says Hamas had regrouped. Other areas affected include Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun just north of Gaza City. U.S. deadline is looming for Israel The aid announcement came days before a U.S. deadline demanding that Israel improve aid deliveries across Gaza or risk losing access to U.S. weapons funding. The U.S. says Israel must allow a minimum of 350 trucks a day carrying food and other supplies. Meanwhile, a report by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, issued Thursday said there's a strong likelihood that famine is imminent in parts of northern Gaza, the territory's most isolated area. COGAT rejected the IPC's finding and said the report relied 'on partial, biased data and superficial sources with vested interests.' No emergency services functioning north of Gaza City The U.N. estimates that tens of thousands of people remain in northern Gaza. Earlier this week, the Health Ministry said there were no ambulances or emergency crews operating north of Gaza City. The conflict has left 90% of Palestinians in Gaza displaced, according to U.N. figures. Israel's army has struck several schools and tent camps packed with tens of thousands of Palestinians driven from their homes by Israeli offensives and evacuation orders. The military has accused Hamas of operating from within civilian infrastructure in Gaza, including schools, U.N. facilities and hospitals. More than a year of war in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 people, Palestinian health officials say. They don't distinguish between civilians and combatants, but say more than half of those killed were women and children. The war began after Palestinian militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. ___ Samy Magdy reported from Cairo.

100-year-old Royal Air Force veteran will join UK memorial service for the first time	LONDON (AP) — Michael Woods has visited his wife, Mary, every day since she moved into a nursing home two years ago. But on Sunday, the 100-year-old Royal Air Force veteran will skip the daily get-together so he can fulfill another duty — honoring the men he served with during World War II. For the first time since he left the RAF in 1947, Woods will take part in Britain’s national Remembrance Day service, joining thousands of veterans as they march past the Cenotaph war memorial in central London to honor those who died during the world wars and all the conflicts that followed. 'It’s a great privilege for me to do this,' said Woods, a mechanic who kept Lancaster bombers flying during the war. 'And I suppose I’ll never do it again.' The annual ceremony is a solemn event marked every year when the king and envoys from the Commonwealth nations that fought alongside Britain in the two world wars lay wreaths at the Cenotaph. It culminates when up to 10,000 veterans, many with medals gleaming on their chests and regimental berets on their heads, parade past the memorial. Until now, Woods has watched on television from his home in Dunstable, 30 miles (50 kilometers) away. Mary always watched with him. Woods had a lot on his mind before. For many years, he was busy with his family: two daughters, a son, eight grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren. And, more recently, he was looking after Mary, his wife of 68 years. But there was something else holding him back as well. He didn’t feel he deserved the honor, as he was 'just' a mechanic working on the 12-cylinder Rolls-Royce Merlin engines that powered the Lancaster bombers. He changed his mind after he connected with other ex-service members through Blind Veterans UK, the charity that has helped him deal with macular degeneration and glaucoma. He felt it was time to remember the men who didn’t come home after they roared into the sky aboard planes he had certified as airworthy. Each Lancaster carried a crew of seven, most in their early 20s, so the losses — so many at once — were hard to bear. 'It’s very, very upsetting when a Lancaster takes off and it doesn’t return,' Woods told The Associated Press. 'I couldn’t forget it if I wanted to,' he added. 'It’s just imprinted on your mind, you know.' The RAF’s Bomber Command had the highest attrition rate of any Allied unit during World War II, with 44% of aircrew members killed in action, according to the International Bomber Command Centre. Some 55,573 of the 125,000 who served on the aircrews died during the war. Adrian Bell, CEO of Blind Veterans UK, said he’s met many World War II veterans who describe themselves as mere cogs in a massive machine. But that’s what it took to defeat fascism. Everyone was needed. So come Sunday, Woods will be marching.

Death toll rises to 20 in a powerful bombing at a Quetta rail station in southwestern Pakistan	QUETTA, Pakistan (AP) — The death toll from a powerful bombing at a Quetta rail station in restive southwestern Pakistan on Saturday rose to at least 20, officials said. The attack also left more than 40 others wounded, some critically. The bomb exploded when nearly 100 passengers were waiting for a train to travel to the garrison city of Rawalpindi from Quetta, the capital of the restive Balochistan province, said Mohammad Baloch, a senior police officer. A separatist group, the Balochistan Liberation Army, claimed the attack in a statement, saying a suicide bomber targeted troops present at the railway station. The outlawed BLA has long waged an insurgency seeking independence from Islamabad. Shahid Rind, a government spokesperson said the bombing seemed to have been a suicide attack, but an investigation was still ongoing to confirm the BLA's claim TV footage showed the steel structure of the platform's roof blown apart and a tea stall destroyed as luggage littered the place. Ayesha Faiz, a Quetta police official, said some of the critically wounded passengers died at a hospital, raising the deaths. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif denounced the bombing in a statement, saying those who orchestrated the attack 'will pay a very heavy price for it,' adding that security forces were determined to eliminate 'the menace of terrorism.' The oil- and mineral-rich Balochistan is Pakistan’s largest but also least populated province. It is also a hub for the country’s ethnic Baloch minority whose members say they face discrimination and exploitation by the central government. Along with separatist groups, Islamic militants also operate in the province. BLA often targets security forces and foreigners, especially Chinese nationals who are in Pakistan as part of Beijing’s multibillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative, which is building major infrastructure projects. Last month, BLA claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing that targeted a convoy with Chinese nationals outside the Karachi airport, killing two. Since then, Beijing has asked Pakistan to ensure the safety of its citizens working on multiple projects in Balochistan and other parts of the country. ___ Associated Press writer Asim Tanveer contributed to this story from Multan, Pakistan,	https://apnews.com/article/quetta-railway-bombing-pakistan-30457309ca4b4c29bd3a5149509acb2e	2024-11-08T20:03:40-08:00	
UN sanctions 2 generals from Sudan's paramilitary force for key roles in war against the military	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The United Nations Security Council imposed sanctions Friday on two generals in Sudan’s paramilitary force for their key roles in the war against the country’s military that has seen ethnically motivated attacks and atrocities. Sudan plunged into conflict in mid-April 2023, when long-simmering tensions between its military and paramilitary leaders broke out in the capital, Khartoum, and spread to other regions, including Darfur. The U.N. says over 14,000 people have been killed and 33,000 injured, and recently warned that the country has been pushed to the brink of famine. The council’s sanctions committee added Maj. Gen. Osman Mohamed Hamid Mohamed, head of the Rapid Support Forces' operations department, and Maj. Gen. Abdel Rahman Juma Barkalla, the RSF commander in West Darfur, to the sanctions blacklist. Britain’s U.N. Mission tweeted on X that the two generals were added for threatening the peace, security and stability of Sudan, 'including acts of violence and human rights abuses.' The U.N. sanctions order all countries to freeze the asses and impose a travel ban on the generals. The United States Treasury imposed sanctions on both generals earlier in the year, freezing any assets in the U.S. and banning all financial transactions with them. Two decades ago, Darfur became synonymous with genocide and war crimes, particularly by the notorious Janjaweed Arab militias, against populations that identify as Central or East African. Up to 300,000 people were killed and 2.7 million were driven from their homes. That legacy appears to have returned, with the International Criminal Court’s prosecutor, Karim Khan, saying in January there were grounds to believe both sides may be committing war crimes, crimes against humanity, or genocide in Darfur. The RSF was born out of the Janjaweed. Human Rights Watch said in a report in May that attacks by the paramilitary force and its allied militias, which killed thousands in Darfur in 2023, constituted a campaign of ethnic cleansing against the area’s non-Arab population. The rights group said the RSF and its militias targeted the ethnic Masalit and other non-Arab groups in El Geneina, the capital city of West Darfur state. Masalit who were captured were tortured, women and girls were raped and entire neighborhoods were looted and destroyed, Human Rights Watch said. Its report is entitled 'The Massalit Will Not Come Home: Ethnic Cleansing and Crimes Against Humanity in El Geneina, West Darfur, Sudan.' The RSF controls the capitals of four of the five states in Darfur and has intensified its military campaign for control of the lone holdout, North Darfur capital El Fasher.	https://apnews.com/article/un-sudan-sanctions-paramilitary-force-war-darfur-7a4c4cf64f64030e3ca27a591591c610	2024-11-08T19:24:18-08:00	
North Korean GPS manipulation disrupted dozens of planes and vessels, South Korea says	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s military said North Korea disrupted GPS signals from border areas for the second-straight day on Saturday, affecting an unspecified number of flights and vessel operations. Tensions between the rival Koreas have escalated as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un flaunts his advancing nuclear and missile program and engages in electronic and psychological warfare, such as flying thousands of balloons to drop trash and anti-South Korean propaganda leaflets in the South. South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said North Korean operations to manipulate GPS signals were detected from around the western border city of Kaesong and the nearby city of Haeju on Friday and Saturday, and said the activities disrupted dozens of civilian aircraft and several vessels. While warning aircraft and vessels near western border areas, South Korea’s military did not specify how North Korea was interfering with GPS signals or detail the extent of disruptions. 'We urge North Korea to stop GPS interference provocations immediately and strongly warn that it will be held fully accountable for any resulting consequences,' the South’s joint chiefs said in a statement. North Korea’s GPS signal disruptions and balloon campaigns highlight the vulnerability of South Korea’s Incheon International Airport, its main transportation gateway, analyst Sukjoon Yoon recently wrote on the North Korea-focused 38 North website. The airport, which carries 56 million people and 3.6 million tons of cargo annually, is less than 100 kilometers (62 miles) from North Korea. 'No major aviation incidents have resulted to date, but GPS interference can endanger commercial airlines flying in poor visibility, and it is a violation of international conventions on navigational safety,' Yoon wrote. He said that in 2024, North Korean trash balloons halted the airport’s runway operations 12 different times for a total of 265 minutes. Kim has shown more hostility this year toward Seoul’s conservative government — which maintains a hard line on Pyongyang — with the North abandoning its long-standing goals of reconciliation with its war-divided rival and rewriting its constitution to cement South Korea as a permanent adversary. North Korea also blew up sections of its unused road and rail routes linked with the South in October in a symbolic display of anger toward Seoul, and opened November with a flight-test of a new intercontinental ballistic missile to dial up pressure on Washington. South Korean officials say North Korean activities to disrupt GPS signals from western border regions increased as the country began launching trash-carrying balloons toward the South in late May, which the North described as a retaliation against South Korean civilian activists flying anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets across the border. Aside from North Korea’s weapons demonstrations and non-conventional provocations, there’s growing concern over its reported provision of military equipment and troops to Russia to support President Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine. South Korean officials say the deepening military alignment between Moscow and Pyongyang could possibly result in Russian technology transfers that increases the threat posed by Kim’s military nuclear program.	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-gps-interference-jamming-aircraft-nuclear-2f6a345ffd3bcf2875b04a758658c9c7	2024-11-08T18:44:20-08:00	
Trump's deportation plan a key focus for Canada's Cabinet committee on US-Canada relations	TORONTO (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump’s promise to launch a mass deportation of millions of undocumented people is a top focus for Canada, its deputy prime minister said Friday, as the country plans to deal with a possible influx north. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau re-established a special Cabinet committee on Canada-U.S. relations to address his administration’s concerns about another Trump presidency this week. Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, who is chair of the revived committee, said what Trump's deportation plan would mean for Canada is a key priority for the committee. 'I do want Canadians to know it is one of our two central points of focus,' Freeland said after the group met for the first time since Trump's first term in office. Freeland said controlling Canada's border is fundamental. 'Canadians are right to be concerned about it,' she said. Freeland said Canada has a plan, but she did not share any details. She said she spoke to the leaders to Canada's provinces about the issue this week and said it is intentional that the country's immigration and public safety ministers are members of the committee. The deputy prime minister said the committee will meet often including early next week again. Canada saw an increase in the number of irregular border crossings between 2016 and 2023, which the the Royal Canadian Mounted Police attributes in part to the first Trump presidency. The national police service has said they have been working through multiple scenarios in case there is a change in irregular migration - which is trending down this year Trump has talked about creating 'the largest mass deportation program in history.' And Trump has called for using the National Guard and empowering domestic police forces in the effort. Trudeau and U.S. President Joe Biden announced last year a plan to close a loophole to an immigration agreement that allowed thousands of asylum-seeking immigrants to move between the two countries along a back road linking New York state to the Canadian province of Quebec. The policy says asylum seekers without U.S. or Canadian citizenship who are caught within 14 days of crossing anywhere along the 3,145-mile (5,061-kilometer) border will be sent back.	https://apnews.com/article/canada-us-trump-deportations-freeland-faabd10473a10c7ab3a369234334741a	2024-11-08T13:39:38-08:00	
1 killed and 3 wounded after gunmen open fire at Brazil’s largest international airport	SAO PAULO (AP) — Brazilian police said that unidentified gunmen in a black car opened fire at Sao Paulo’s International Airport in Guarulhos on Friday afternoon, killing one person and injuring three others. Police identified the fatal victim as Antônio Vinícius Lopes Gritzbach, who had previously received death threats from the First Command of the Capital, a powerful international criminal group. Gritzbach, who had cryptocurrency businesses, had recently entered into a plea bargain with local prosecutors to speak about his ties to the criminal organization, police said. Police have not yet determined the number of gunmen involved in the attack. Social media footage shows two individuals who appear to have been shot at the airport. One victim is seen lying on the ground at Terminal 2, primarily used for domestic flights, while the other is seen stranded on an access road outside the terminal. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/gunmen-brazil-international-airport-ae6601775a0adfea0fa17a2f4bfec56c	2024-11-08T13:07:24-08:00	
The Pentagon is letting a small number of U.S. defense contractors fix weapons in Ukraine	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Pentagon is easing restrictions to allow a small number of private American defense contactors to work inside Ukraine, helping repair and maintain equipment, U.S. officials said Friday. The contractors will be far away from the front lines during Russia's invasion and will not be taking part in combat, the officials said. The department is soliciting bids now, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal decisions. Ukraine has been receiving billions of dollars worth of American weapons and equipment over the past two years, including a number of sophisticated systems. For much of that time, U.S. and allied troops have been providing real-time maintenance advice using phones and tablets to communicate in encrypted chatrooms with Ukrainian forces. Officials said the Pentagon is allowing the contractors to go because some equipment — including F-16 fighter jets and air defense systems — requires high-tech expertise to repair. Using the contractors, they said, will ensure the weapons are fixed quickly so Ukrainian forces can continue to use them in combat. The decision expands the footprint of U.S. government contractors working in Ukraine. The State Department already has contracted with U.S. companies to work inside the country, including on the energy grid. In addition, a number of American companies have workers in Ukraine under contracts with the Kyiv government. Officials said the companies will be responsible for the safety of their employees.	https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-contractors-pentagon-weapons-repair-c59260ab3db7514dd8930823e0b5adf3	2024-11-08T12:38:23-08:00	
Spanish phone company subsidiary to pay $85M to resolve US probe of Venezuelan bribery scheme	WASHINGTON (AP) — A Venezuelan subsidiary of a Spanish phone company will pay more than $85 million to resolve a U.S. Justice Department investigation into a scheme to bribe Venezuelan government officials, the department said Friday. Telefónica Venezolana, a subsidiary of Telefónica S.A., bribed Venezuelan officials to participate in an auction that allowed it to get U.S. dollars in exchange for Venezuelan bolivars, Justice Department officials said. Telefónica Venezolana bought equipment at inflated prices from suppliers, who then paid the bribes on its behalf in an attempt to hide the illegal scheme, prosecutors said. 'Telefónica Venezolana chose to support a corrupt regime to circumvent the difficulties of conducting legal business in Venezuela,' said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole Argentieri, who leads the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. The subsidiary is charged in U.S. federal court with conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act but will avoid prosecution under an agreement with the Justice Department if it follows certain conditions. Telefónica S.A. officials did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment Friday.	https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-bribery-scheme-phone-company-justice-department-fbb571ecd3cf1ce7c9d023a37fdec4b6	2024-11-08T12:35:35-08:00	
Trump put Elon Musk on phone with Ukraine's Zelenskyy during congratulatory call, official says	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump put billionaire Elon Musk on the line with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy when the Ukrainian leader called to congratulate the incoming U.S. president, according to a Ukrainian official with direct knowledge of the phone call. The person, who was not authorized to comment on the matter publicly, confirmed that Zelenskyy and Musk spoke during the call with Trump, but that Musk did not appear to be on the line for the entire conversation on Wednesday. Trump seemingly handed his phone over to Musk, the person said, and the Ukrainian president thanked the SpaceX owner for assisting his country with access to the Starlink satellite internet platform. The presence of Musk on the call highlights his influence in the president-elect’s circle. Trump has mused that Musk could have a formal role in his administration that focuses on government efficiency, raising questions about potential conflicts of interest given SpaceX’s lucrative government contracts. Trump’s interactions with Zelenskyy are being closely watched as he prepares to take over the presidency on Jan. 20 and has signaled a shift in Washington’s steadfast support for Ukraine against Russia’s nearly three-year-old invasion. Trump has promised to swiftly end the war and suggested that Kyiv should agree to cede some territory to Moscow in return for peace, a condition Zelenskyy has rejected. It was under Trump that the United States first sent weapons to Ukraine in its fight against Russia, in 2017. Those Javelin anti-tank missiles were crucial to Ukraine’s initial ability to fend off the full-scale invasion in 2022. President Joe Biden's administration has sent tens of billions of dollars in military and economic assistance to Ukraine, drawing criticism from Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance, who are wary of U.S. involvement in foreign conflicts and suggested the money could better be spent domestically. Trump has promoted his good relationship with President Vladimir Putin and called the Russian leader 'pretty smart' for invading Ukraine. He characterized Zelenskyy as 'the greatest salesman on earth' for winning U.S. aid. Zelenskyy is one of dozens of world leaders, business executives and political leaders to speak with Trump, who has been at his private club and residence in Florida, in the days since he won the White House. The Trump transition said it would not comment on private meetings. Axios was first to report on Musk's presence on the Trump-Zelenskyy call. ___ Gomez Licon reported from West Palm Beach, Fla. and Miller reported from Washington.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-ukraine-elon-musk-zelenskyy-starlink-f6ab0c5e1c5de1262ae2a1747247819c	2024-11-08T12:32:40-08:00	
International court to launch external probe into misconduct accusations against top prosecutor	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — The International Criminal Court will launch an external probe into sexual misconduct accusations against its top prosecutor, The Associated Press has learned, keeping alive a case that the court’s internal watchdog had closed within five days. Karim Khan has categorically denied the accusations that he tried to coerce a female aide into a sexual relationship, and the claims come amid reports of an ongoing Israeli intelligence campaign to discredit the court’s prosecution of Benjamin Netanyahu for alleged war crimes in Gaza. The external investigation was approved this week at a meeting of the court's oversight body, the Assembly of States Parties to the Rome Statute, according to three people familiar with the matter who spoke to AP on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door deliberations. It was unclear exactly who would conduct the probe, the people said, noting that possibilities included law enforcement officials from Europe and a law firm. The United Nations’ internal watchdog has also been discussed for such a probe but that could be fraught with conflict-of-interest concerns because Karim’s wife, a prominent human rights attorney, had previously worked at the agency in Kenya investigating sexual harassment. Neither Päivi Kaukoranta, a Finnish diplomat currently heading the ICC’s oversight body, nor Khan's attorney immediately responded to requests for comment. An AP investigation found that two court employees in whom the alleged victim confided came forward with the accusation in May, a few weeks before Khan sought arrest warrants against Netanyahu, his defense minister and three Hamas leaders on war crimes charges. A three-judge panel is now weighing that request. AP reported that Khan traveled frequently with the woman after transferring her to his office from another department at the ICC’s headquarters in The Hague. During one foreign trip, Khan allegedly asked the woman to rest with him on a hotel bed and then 'sexually touched her,' according to whistleblower documents shared with the court’s watchdog and seen by the AP. Later, he came to her room at 3 a.m. and knocked on the door for 10 minutes. Other allegedly nonconsensual behavior cited in the documents included locking the door of his office and sticking his hand in her pocket. He also allegedly asked her on several occasions to go on a vacation together. After the two co-workers reported the alleged behavior, the court's internal watchdog interviewed the woman but she opted against filing a complaint due to her distrust of the watchdog, according to the AP investigation. Khan was never questioned and the watchdog's inquiry was closed within five days. While the court’s watchdog could not determine wrongdoing, it nonetheless urged Khan in a memo to minimize contact with the woman to protect the rights of all involved and safeguard the court’s integrity. Under Khan, the ICC has become more assertive in combating crimes against humanity, war crimes and related atrocities. Along the way, it has added to a growing list of enemies. Last September, following the opening of a probe into Russian atrocities in Ukraine, the court suffered a debilitating cyberattack that left staff unable to work for weeks. It also hired an intern who was later criminally charged in the U.S. with being a Russian spy. Israel has also been waging its own influence campaign ever since the ICC recognized Palestine as a member and in 2015 opened a preliminary investigation into Israel's actions. London’s The Guardian newspaper and several Israeli news outlets reported this summer that Israel’s intelligence agencies for the past decade have allegedly targeted senior ICC staff, including putting Khan’s predecessor under surveillance and showing up at her house with envelopes stuffed with cash to discredit her. An external probe would go further than what Khan proposed when, following the AP report, he called on the ICC's internal watchdog to investigate the matter and said he would fully cooperate. ___ Goodman reported from Miami.

Father and daughter win $58,000 in lawsuit against man who claimed Manchester Arena bombing was hoax	LONDON (AP) — A father and daughter crippled by a suicide bomber who killed 22 people after an Ariana Grande concert in England in 2017 were awarded 45,000 pounds ($58,000) Friday in a case against a former television producer who claimed the tragedy was a hoax. Martin Hibbert and his daughter, Eve, won their harassment suit in the High Court in London last month against Richard Hall for videos, a film and a book he produced that falsely claim the Manchester Arena bombing was staged using actors and no one was wounded or killed. Hall, an independent producer, had claimed 'millions of people have bought a lie' about the attack and defended his work, including surreptitiously filming the daughter, as journalism in the public's interest. Justice Karen Steyn called Hall’s conduct a 'negligent, indeed reckless, abuse of media freedom.' She said he used the 'flimsiest of analytical techniques' to dismiss 'the obvious, tragic reality to which so many ordinary people have attested.' Salman Abedi blew himself up with a bomb hidden in a knapsack as fans were leaving the Grande concert on May 22, 2017. In addition to those killed, more than 260 people were wounded and hundreds of others were left with 'deep psychological injuries,' police said. Martin Hibbert was paralyzed from the waist down and his daughter, who was 14 at the time, nearly died and has severe brain damage. The Hibbert's also won an injunction preventing Hall from further harassment, and Hall will have to pay 90% of their legal costs that are currently estimated at 260,000 pounds ($335,000). The award, however, is meager compared to many won in U.S. lawsuits. In a case that also involved denying a major tragedy, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones was ordered to pay $1.5 billion to parents of children killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut in 2012 for falsely claiming it was a hoax. Martin Hibbert said that he never expects to see a penny of the award, but the victory wasn't about money. 'What this was about was bringing him down in public, in front of his own followers, that’s what I’ve done,' he said outside court. Hall said the trial was unfair and continued to insist the bombing didn't happen as he left the court.	https://apnews.com/article/manchester-bombing-lawsuit-fake-claims-hoax-harassment-1b61ec8d880b4a8ac5051f1402f0cf39	2024-11-08T09:24:53-08:00

Justice Department brings criminal charges in Iranian murder-for-hire plan targeting Donald Trump	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department on Friday disclosed an Iranian murder-for-hire plot to kill Donald Trump, charging a man who said he had been tasked by a government official before this week's election with planning the assassination of the Republican president-elect. Investigators were told of the plan to kill Trump by Farhad Shakeri, an accused Iranian government asset who spent time in American prisons for robbery and who authorities say maintains a network of criminal associates enlisted by Tehran for surveillance and murder-for-hire plots. Shakeri told the FBI that a contact in Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard instructed him this past September to set aside other work he was doing and assemble a plan within seven days to surveil and ultimately kill Trump, according to a criminal complaint unsealed in federal court in Manhattan. The official was quoted by Shakeri as saying that 'We have already spent a lot of money' and that 'money’s not an issue.' Shakeri told investigators the official told him that if he could not put together a plan within the seven-day timeframe, then the plot would be paused until after the election because the official assumed Trump would lose and that it would be easier to kill him then, the complaint said. Shakeri is at large and remains in Iran. Two other men were arrested on charges that Shakeri recruited them to follow and kill prominent Iranian-American journalist Masih Alinejad, who has endured multiple Iranian murder-for-hire plots foiled by law enforcement. 'I’m very shocked,' said Alinejad, speaking by telephone to The Associated Press from Berlin, where she was about to attend a ceremony to mark the anniversary of the tearing down of the wall. 'This is the third attempt against me and that’s shocking.' In a post on the social media platform X, she said: 'I came to America to practice my First Amendment right to freedom of speech — I don’t want to die. I want to fight against tyranny, and I deserve to be safe. Thank you to law enforcement for protecting me, but I urge the U.S. government to protect the national security of America.' Lawyers for the two other defendants, identified as Jonathan Loadholt and Carlisle Rivera, did not immediately return messages seeking comment. Iran's U.N. Mission declined to comment. Shakeri, an Afghan national who immigrated to the U.S. as a child but was later deported after spending 14 years in prison for robbery, also told investigators that he was tasked by his Revolutionary Guard contact with plotting the killings of two Jewish-Americans living in New York and Israeli tourists in Sri Lanka. Officials say he overlapped with Rivera while in prison as well as an unidentified co-conspirator. The criminal complaint says Shakeri disclosed some of the details of the alleged plots in a series of recorded telephone interviews with FBI agents while in Iran. The stated reason for his cooperation, he told investigators, was to try to get a reduced prison sentence for an associate behind bars in the U.S. According to the complaint, though officials determined that some of the information he provided was false, his statements regarding a plot to kill Trump and Iran's willingness to pay large sums of money were determined to be accurate. The plot, announced by the Justice Department just days after Trump's defeat of Democrat Kamala Harris, is part of what federal officials have described as ongoing efforts by Iran to target U.S. government officials, including Trump, on U.S. soil. Last summer, for instance, the Justice Department charged a Pakistani man with ties to Iran in a murder-for-hire plot targeting American officials. 'There are few actors in the world that pose as grave a threat to the national security of the United States as does Iran,' Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement Friday. FBI Director Christopher Wray said the case shows Iran's 'continued brazen attempts to target U.S. citizens,' including Trump, 'other government leaders and dissidents who criticize the regime in Tehran.' Iranian operatives also conducted a hack-and-leak operation of emails belonging to Trump campaign associates in what officials have assessed was an effort to interfere in the presidential election and harm Trump's campaign. Intelligence officials have said Iran opposed Trump’s reelection, seeing him as more likely to increase tension between Washington and Tehran. Trump’s administration ended a nuclear deal with Iran, reimposed sanctions and ordered the killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, an act that prompted Iran’s leaders to vow revenge. Trump spokesman Steven Cheung said the president-elect was aware of the assassination plot and nothing will deter him 'from returning to the White House and restoring peace around the world.' ____ Neumeister reported from New York.

Pompeii archaeological park sets daily visitors' limit to combat over-tourism	ROME (AP) — The Pompeii archaeological park plans to limit visitor numbers to 20,000 a day and introduce personalized tickets starting next week in a bid to cope with over-tourism and protect the world heritage site, officials said Friday. The move comes after what authorities called a record summer that saw over 4 million people visiting the world-famous remains of the ancient Roman city, buried under ash and rock following the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 A.D. The park's director Gabriel Zuchtriegel said visitors to the main archaeological site now exceed an average of 15,000 to 20,000 every day, and the new daily cap will prevent the numbers from surging further. 'We are working on a series of projects to lift the human pressure on the site, which could pose risks both for visitors and the heritage (that is) so unique and fragile,' Zuchtriegel said. Starting Nov. 15 tickets to access the park will be personalized to include the full names of visitors. A maximum of 20,000 tickets will be released each day, with different time slots during the peak summer season. The park’s management is also trying to attract more tourists to visit other ancient sites connected to Pompeii by a free shuttle bus under the 'Greater Pompeii' project, including Stabia, Torre Annunziata and Boscoreale sites. 'The measures to manage flows and safety and the personalization of the visits are part of this strategy,' Zuchtriegel said. 'We are aiming for slow, sustainable, pleasant and non-mass tourism and above all widespread throughout the territory around the UNESCO site, which is full of cultural jewels to discover,' he added.	https://apnews.com/article/pompeii-ancient-site-park-tourists-overtourism-tickets-limit-visits-fe569aba8ba48f5b5d7ca64b53f313cd	2024-11-08T07:34:10-08:00	
A Ukrainian medic fell in love with a soldier on the front. They died together in a Russian attack	A crowd of mourners lit torches and intoned a military chant to honor a Ukrainian medic and a soldier who fell in love on the frontline and died together in a Russian shell attack. Valentyna Nahorna, whose call sign was Valkyrie, volunteered as a medic at the start of the war in Ukraine. She and Daniil Liashkevych, known as Berserk, fell in love just a few months ago, their friends and comrades say, but it helped them endure the war. They both worked in the 3rd Assault Brigade, and were killed Nov. 4. Their funerals were held on Friday at Kyiv ’s crematorium, a cavernous and grimly modern building often used for funerals of the war dead. Those gathered gave the chant that Ukrainian soldiers learn by heart when they first start training: 'Burn with fire, life-giving, the weakness in my heart. Let me know no fear, nor doubt.' Kostyl, who like many Ukrainian soldiers agreed to be identified only by his call sign, said meeting Valkyrie helped Berserk emerge from a dark time in his life. 'He finally had a soulmate who also wanted to fight with him and be as close to the war as possible, But this was their last time together, and no one is safe from that,' Kostyl said.

Rafael weakens into a tropical storm as it swirls over the Gulf of Mexico after lashing Cuba	HAVANA (AP) — Hurricane Rafael weakened into a tropical storm Friday as it swirled through the Gulf of Mexico where it was expected to break apart after plowing through Cuba, knocking out the country's power grid and collapsing hundreds of houses. On Friday night, the tropical storm was located 240 miles (390 kms) north of Progreso, Mexico. It had maximum sustained winds of 70 mph (110 kph) and was moving west-northwest at 5 mph (7 kph), according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami. It was forecast to move westward toward Mexico in the coming days and forecasters warned that swells from the hurricane were likely to cause 'life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.' Mexico's government on Friday warned of powerful rain, winds and waves up to 8 feet (2.5 meters) high in the Campeche, Quintana Roo and Yucatan states in the coming hours, asking citizens to take care. Forecasters said they expected the storm to weaken and 'meander' over the center of the Gulf through early next week. The hurricane tore through Jamaica and the Cayman Islands earlier in the week, knocking out power and fueling mudslides. On Wednesday evening, it barreled into Cuba, causing yet another headache for the island. Rafael's fierce winds knocked out Cuba's electric grid, forced the evacuation of 283,000 people and collapsed 461 homes. It also left trees, power lines and rubble strewn across flooded streets. On Friday, the Cuban government said it was able to restore power to approximately 143,000 homes in Havana, though many people were still without power. Rafael followed a rocky few weeks in the Caribbean nation. First, it was hit by island-wide blackouts stretching on for days, a product of the island’s energy crisis. Shortly after, it was slapped by powerful hurricane that struck the eastern part of the island and killed at least six people.	https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-rafael-gulf-of-mexico-cuba-natural-disaster-rip-currents-bace6e930c5b530eadf7f1dce7009ab9	2024-11-08T06:30:06-08:00	
Weather extremes influence illegal migration and return between the U.S. and Mexico, study finds	Extreme weather is contributing to undocumented migration and return between Mexico and the United States, suggesting that more migrants could risk their lives crossing the border as climate change fuels droughts, storms and other hardships, according to a new study. People from agricultural areas in Mexico were more likely to cross the border illegally after droughts and were less likely to return to their original communities when extreme weather continued, according to research this week in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Across the globe, climate change — caused by burning fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas — is exacerbating extreme weather. Droughts are longer and drier, heat is deadlier and storms are rapidly intensifying and dumping record-breaking rain. In Mexico, a country of nearly 130 million people, drought has drained reservoirs dry, created severe water shortages and drastically reduced corn production, threatening livelihoods. Researchers said Mexico is a notable country for studying the links between migration, return and weather stressors. Its mean annual temperature is projected to increase up to 3 degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2060, and extreme weather is likely to economically devastate rural communities dependent on rain-fed agriculture. The U.S. and Mexico also have the largest international migration flow in the world. Scientists predict migration will grow as the planet gets hotter. Over the next 30 years, 143 million people worldwide are likely to be uprooted by rising seas, drought, searing temperatures and other climate catastrophes, according to a U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report. The new migration research comes as Republican Donald Trump was reelected to the U.S. presidency this week. Trump has called climate change a 'hoax' and promised mass deportations of an estimated 11 million people in the U.S. illegally. Researchers said their findings highlight how extreme weather drives migration. Filiz Garip, a study researcher and professor of sociology and international affairs at Princeton University, said advanced nations have contributed far more to climate change than developing countries that are bearing the brunt. Migration 'is not a decision that people take up lightly ... and yet they’re being forced to make it more, and they’re being forced to stay longer in the United States' as a result of weather extremes, Garip said. The researchers analyzed daily weather data along with survey responses from 48,313 people between 1992 and 2018, focusing on about 3,700 individuals who crossed the border without documents for the first time. They looked at 84 agricultural communities in Mexico where growing corn was dependent on weather. They correlated a person's decision to migrate and then return with abnormal changes in temperature and rainfall in their origin communities during the May-to-August corn growing season. The study found communities experiencing drought had higher migration rates compared to communities with normal rainfall. And people were less likely to return to Mexico from the U.S. when their communities were unusually dry or wet. That was true for recent U.S. arrivals and people who had been there longer. People who were better off financially were also more likely to migrate. So were people from communities with established migration histories where friends, neighbors or family members who previously migrated could offer information and help. These social and economic factors that influence migration are well understood, but Garip said the study's findings underscore the inequities of climate adaptation. With extreme weather events, not everybody is impacted or responds in the same way, she said, 'and the typical social and economic advantages or disadvantages also shape how people experience these events.' For Kerilyn Schewel, codirector of Duke University's Program on Climate, Resilience and Mobility, the economic factors highlight that some of most vulnerable people aren't those displaced by climate extremes, but are rather 'trapped in place or lacking the resources to move.' Schewel, who was not involved in the study, said analyzing regions with migration histories could help predict where migrants will come from and who is likelier to migrate because of climate shocks. In 'places where people are already leaving, where there’s a high degree of migration prevalence, ... that’s where we can expect more people to leave in the future,' she said. The survey data used from the Mexican Migration Project makes this study unique, according to Hélène Benveniste, a professor in Stanford University’s department of environmental social sciences. Migration data of its scale that's community specific is 'rarely available,' she said in an email. So is information about a person's full migration journey, including their return. The finding that return migration decisions were delayed by weather stress in origin communities is 'important and novel,' said Benveniste, who studies climate-related human migration and was not involved in the study. 'Few datasets enable an analysis of this question.' But increased surveillance and enforcement along the U.S.-Mexico border make returning home — and moving back and forth — more difficult, said Michael Méndez, assistant professor of environmental policy and planning at the University of California, Irvine. And once undocumented migrants are in the U.S., they often live in dilapidated housing, lack health care or work in industries such as construction or agriculture that make them vulnerable to other climate impacts, he said. Méndez was not involved in the study. As climate change threatens social, political and economic stability around the world, experts said the study highlights the need for global collaboration around migration and climate resilience. 'So much of our focus has been, in a way, on the border and securing the border,' said Schewel from Duke. 'But we need much more attention to not only the reasons why people are leaving, but also the demand for immigrant workers within the U.S.' ——— The Associated Press receives support from the Walton Family Foundation for coverage of water and environmental policy.

The Latest: House remains in the balance as world reaction to Trump victory keeps pouring in	Republican leaders are projecting confidence that they will keep control of the U.S. House as more races were decided in their favor Thursday, while Democrats insist they still see a path toward the majority and sought assurances every vote will be counted. The Republicans won control of the U.S. Senate early Wednesday. Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: Trump speaks with the leader of the Palestinian Authority The office of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas says the leader of the Palestinian Authority has spoken with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump for the first time since his victory in the 2024 campaign. In a statement Friday, Abbas’ office in the occupied West Bank city of Ramallah said that the president congratulated Trump on his victory and wished him success in his upcoming term. It said that Abbas told Trump he was ready to work with him in pursuit of peace and that Trump, in turn, 'emphasized his commitment to the stop the war.' The phone call follows months of resistance by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the Biden administration’s push for a cease-fire that would see Israel end the war against Hamas in Gaza. Over 43,000 people have been killed, according to the Gaza-based Health Ministry, which doesn’t distinguish between militants and civilians. Trump and Abbas had a particularly rocky relationship during Trump’s first term, when his administration reduced outreach to the Palestinians and reversed decades of U.S. policy in the Mideast in Israel’s favor. As right-wing commentators move mainstream, Alex Jones’ Infowars is up for grabs Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones’ Infowars broadcasts could end next week as he faces a court-ordered auction of his company’s assets to help pay the more than $1 billion defamation judgment he owes families of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. Or maybe not. Both opponents and supporters of the bombastic internet show and radio host have expressed interest in bidding on the Infowars properties he has built over the past 25 years. They include Roger Stone, an ally of Jones and Donald Trump, and anti-Jones progressive media groups. If Jones supporters buy the assets, he could end up staying on Infowars. Jones and other right-wing commentators once on the fringe have catapulted in popularity as many people have moved away from traditional news sources. Trump elevated them further during his 2024 campaign by repeating some of their conspiracy theories and appearing on several of their podcasts and shows. On Thursday, Jones, a long-time Trump supporter, even accepted proposals, some perhaps tongue-in-cheek, by Donald Trump Jr. and other conservatives to be the president-elect’s press secretary. ▶ Read more about the possible fate of Infowars How Trump’s victory changed the calculation for migration Trump’s victory instantly changed calculations for millions of migrants or potential migrants across the globe. But perhaps not in the way Trump imagined. Trump has pledged to reduce immigration. But by narrowing the already limited legal pathways into the U.S., migrants will just recalibrate their plans and resort in greater numbers to hiring smugglers, experts say. In many cases that will mean turning to organized crime groups that increasingly profit from migrant smuggling. ▶ Read more about how Trump’s win spurs worry among migrants — but isn’t expected to stop migration What will US leadership look like under Trump on the world stage? U.S. presidents usually pay lip service at least to being leaders of the free world, at the helm of a mighty democracy and military that allies worldwide can rally around and reasonably depend upon for support in return. Not so under President-elect Donald Trump, a critic of many existing U.S. alliances, whose win of a second term this week had close European partners calling for a new era of self-reliance not dependent on American goodwill. 'We must not delegate forever our security to America,' French President Emmanuel Macron said at a European summit Thursday. Based on Trump’s first term and campaign statements, the U.S. will become less predictable, more chaotic, colder to allies and warmer to some strongmen, and much more transactional in picking friends globally than before. America’s place in world affairs and security will fundamentally change, both critics and supporters of Trump say. ▶ Read more about what the U.S. role on the world stage might look like A guide to the key figures in Donald Trump’s orbit Donald Trump will return to the White House accompanied by a crew of longtime friends and aides as well as newfound, splashy allies. The Republican president-elect has barely begun naming key figures in his administration, but he has kept a rotation of associates with him on and off the campaign trail in recent weeks who joined him on stage early Wednesday as he declared victory. ▶ Read more about these key figures Judge cancels court deadlines in Trump’s 2020 election case The judge overseeing Trump’s 2020 election interference case canceled any remaining court deadlines Friday after prosecutors said they need time to assess 'the appropriate course going forward' after the Republican’s presidential victory this week. Special Counsel Jack Smith charged Trump last year with plotting to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and illegally hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate. But Smith’s team has been evaluating how to wind down the two federal cases before the president-elect takes office in light of longstanding Justice Department policy that says sitting presidents cannot be prosecuted, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press. Trump’s victory over Vice President Kamala Harris means that the Justice Department believes he can no longer face prosecution in accordance with department legal opinions meant to shield presidents from criminal charges while in office. In a court filing Friday in the 2020 election case, Smith’s team said it needs 'time to assess this unprecedented circumstance and determine the appropriate course going forward consistent with Department of Justice policy.' Smith’s team said it would inform the judge of 'the result of its deliberations' by Dec. 2. Expect leadership change at the FBI Donald Trump lavished Christopher Wray with praise when he named him FBI director in 2017, introducing him as an 'impeccably qualified individual' and a 'model of integrity.' So much has changed in the seven years since. With Trump poised to reclaim the White House, Wray’s days as director are likely numbered. Though the director’s job carries a 10-year term, Trump’s blistering and repeated criticism of his own appointee throughout his time as president raises the likelihood that Trump would either replace Wray upon taking office or that Wray would leave on his own to avoid being fired. Such a move would give Trump a chance to reshape the FBI’s leadership in his own image at a time when he’s threatened to pursue his own political adversaries. Trump’s transition office did not return an email seeking comment. An FBI official said Wray was continuing to lead the bureau on a day-to-day basis — including visiting the FBI’s election command post multiple times this week — and was planning with his team to lead the bureau into the next year. The official, an executive who interacts with Wray on a day-to-day basis, was not authorized to discuss the details publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. ▶ Read more about the future of the FBI under Trump The election was largely trouble-free, but a flood of misinformation raises future concerns A relatively trouble-free presidential election was good news for those working to restore faith in the system. Less encouraging was a flood of misinformation that sought to undermine trust in voting and sow chaos, something experts say is likely to get worse in the years ahead. The most significant test for officials on Election Day was a series of bomb threats reported in five battleground states, some of which forced polling places to be evacuated temporarily. ▶ Read more about election misinformation FBI thwarts Iranian murder-for-hire plan targeting Donald Trump The Justice Department unsealed criminal charges Friday in a thwarted Iranian plot to kill President-elect Donald Trump before this week’s presidential election. A criminal complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan alleges that an unnamed official in Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard instructed a contact this past September to put together a plan to surveil and ultimately kill Trump. AP VoteCast: Trump boosted his level of support among Catholic voters Among several blocs of religious voters, including his loyal evangelical base, Donald Trump fared roughly as well in his victory over Kamala Harris as he did in his loss to Joe Biden four years ago. One notable difference: He did better this year among Catholic voters, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 120,000 voters. In 2020, the Catholic electorate — one the biggest religious blocs in the nation — was almost evenly split, with 50% backing Trump and 49% favoring Biden, a longtime member of the faith. This year, according to VoteCast, 54% of Catholic voters supported Trump and 44% backed Harris — a shift that was particularly notable in North Carolina, Florida and Texas. VoteCast documented a racial divide. About 6 in 10 white Catholics supported Trump, and about 4 in 10 supported Harris. By contrast, about 6 in 10 Latino Catholics supported Harris, and about 4 in 10 supported Trump. ▶ Read more about AP VoteCast’s findings on religion Trump 2.0 will alter global climate fighting efforts. Will others step up? Global efforts to fight climate change stumbled but survived the last time Donald Trump was elected president and withdrew the United States from an international climate agreement. Other countries, states, cities and businesses picked up some of the slack. But numerous experts worry that a second Trump term will be more damaging, with the United States withdrawing even further from climate efforts in a way that could cripple future presidents’ efforts. With Trump, who has dismissed climate change, in charge of the world’s leading economy, those experts fear other countries — especially top polluting nation China — could use it as an excuse to ease off their own efforts to curb carbon emissions. Trump’s reelection comes as the world is on track to set yet another record hot year, and has been lurching from drought to hurricane to flood to wildfire. ▶ Read more about the future of global climate action Leonard Leo says there’s no rush to replace Alito and Thomas Trump’s election could give him a chance to nominate up to two more Supreme Court justices if Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas retire, but a prominent conservative legal activist says there’s no rush. 'No one other than Justices Thomas and Alito knows when or if they will retire, and talking about them like meat that has reached its expiration date is unwise, uninformed, and, frankly, just crass,' said Leonard Leo, who serves as co-chair of the conservative Federalist Society and has been a driving force in securing nominations of conservative justices. His comments come after Republican judicial advocate Mike Davis, a Trump ally who runs The Article III Project, speculated online that Alito could be 'gleefully packing up his chambers.' Trump rebuilds ‘blue wall’ with red bricks Republicans landed historic victories in Pennsylvania this week, winning the battleground state’s valuable presidential electoral votes, posting a two-seat gain in its U.S. House delegation and sweeping all four statewide offices on the ballot, including a U.S. Senate seat. The strong performance means Donald Trump has won Pennsylvania in two out of three tries, after Republicans had lost six straight presidential elections there. Something similar happened in the other 'blue wall' states of Michigan and Wisconsin, Rust Belt states where Trump prevailed again after losing in 2020. Still, Democrats held on in key Senate races in Wisconsin and Michigan, if just barely, and the results played out differently in each state. ▶ Read more about how Democrats’ 'blue wall' states were painted Republican red Jeffries predicts a closely divided House Hakeem Jeffries, who leads the House Democratic Caucus, is preparing for another narrowly divided Congress, no matter which party wins the majority. In an interview on New York’s Spectrum News, Jeffries insisted that Democrats 'still have a pathway to taking back the majority' if the party can flip a series of seats in Arizona, Oregon and California where votes are still being counted. 'Whatever happens with the majority in the next Congress, Democrats will be no shorter than 212 to 214 votes,' Jeffries said. He added that the race for control will come down to eight seats that Republicans currently hold. However, it has been extraordinarily difficult for either party to flip seats in this election. Across the country, Republicans and Democrats have been able to flip just three seats each so far. Still, Jeffries led House Democrats through an election where they did not suffer the same degree of loss as their counterparts in presidential and Senate races. 'We’ve been able to withstand that presidential wave that broke against us,' he said. House Democratic leader says party should be ‘proud’ of Biden administration’s legislative accomplishments House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who has led the House caucus through an election where Democrats have not suffered the same degree of loss as their counterparts in presidential and Senate races, said Friday that his party should be 'proud' of the legislative accomplishments of the Biden administration. 'It’s a record that both progressives and centrist members of both the House and the Senate supported,' Jeffries said on New York’s Spectrum News, listing legislation like the American Rescue Plan, a largescale infrastructure deal and legislation to address climate change. 'More needs to be done to meet the needs of the American people, to build an economy that works for everyday Americans because there are far too many people that are struggling to live paycheck to paycheck,' Jeffries added. Democrats retain control of Pennsylvania’s House despite banner year for Republicans Democrats retained majority control of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives on Friday by holding onto a Johnstown area district, giving them just enough votes to keep the speakership and determine the chamber’s voting agenda. The win by incumbent Rep. Frank Burns is the final House race to be called in a year when none of the 203 districts are changing hands. It gave Democrats a 102-101 margin and dashed Republican hopes of returning to control after two years in the minority. Burns’ win is some consolation to Democrats in what has otherwise been a banner electoral year in Pennsylvania for the Republican Party. Former President Donald Trump won in the state, Dave McCormick beat Democratic U.S. Sen. Bob Casey, two Democratic congressional seat were flipped and Republican candidates won all three of the state row offices. ▶ Read more about the one-seat majority. AP VoteCast: How Donald Trump built a winning 2024 coalition Big shifts within small groups and small shifts within big groups helped propel Donald Trump’s return to the White House. The Republican candidate won by holding onto his traditional coalition — white voters, voters without a college degree and older voters — while making crucial gains among younger voters and Black and Hispanic men, according to AP VoteCast, a far-reaching survey of more than 120,000 voters nationwide. His Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, made small gains — most significantly with white urban men with a college degree — but it wasn’t enough to offset her losses elsewhere. ▶ Read more about the coalition. Borrowers hoping for student loan forgiveness in limbo Savannah Britt owes about $27,000 on loans she took out to attend college at Rutgers University, a debt she was hoping to see reduced by President Joe Biden’s student loan forgiveness efforts. Her payments are currently on hold while courts untangle challenges to the loan forgiveness program. But as the weeks tick down on Biden’s time in office, she could soon face a monthly payment of up to $250. 'With this new administration, the dream is gone. It’s shot,' said Britt, 30, who runs her own communications agency. 'I was hopeful before Tuesday. I was waiting out the process. Even my mom has a loan that she took out to support me. She owes about $18,000, and she was in the process of it being forgiven, but it’s at a standstill.' President-elect Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans have criticized Biden’s loan forgiveness efforts, and lawsuits by GOP-led states have held up plans for widespread debt cancellation. Trump has not said what he would do on loan forgiveness, leaving millions of borrowers facing uncertainty over their personal finances. ▶ Read more about the fate of student loan borrowers. The view from an Israeli settlement named after Trump Israeli residents of 'Trump Heights' are welcoming the election of their namesake, hoping Donald Trump’s return to the U.S. presidency will breathe new life into this tiny, remote settlement in the central Golan Heights. During his first term, Trump became the first and only foreign leader to recognize Israel’s control of the Golan, which it seized from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war. Israel thanked him by rebranding this outpost after him. But a large-scale influx of new residents never materialized after that 2019 ceremony, and just a couple dozen families live in Trump Heights, or 'Ramat Trump' in Hebrew. Job opportunities are limited, and Israel’s more than yearlong war against Hezbollah militants in nearby Lebanon has added to the sense of isolation. Trump’s election has inspired hope in the community that it will attract more members and also more funding for security improvements. 'President Trump’s return to the White House definitely puts the town in the headlines,' Ori Kallner, head of the Golan’s regional council, said. ▶ Read more from Ramat Trump. How Trump went from diminished ex-president to victor As he bid farewell to Washington in January 2021, deeply unpopular and diminished, Donald Trump was already hinting at a comeback. 'Goodbye. We love you. We will be back in some form,' Trump told supporters at Joint Base Andrews, where he’d arranged a 21-gun salute as part of a military send-off before boarding Air Force One. 'We will see you soon.' Four years later, he’s fulfilled his prophecy. ▶ Read more about his path back to the presidency. Judge strikes down Biden administration program shielding immigrant spouses from deportation A federal judge on Thursday struck down a Biden administration policy that aimed to ease a path to citizenship for some undocumented immigrants who are married to U.S. citizens. The program, lauded as one of the biggest presidential actions to help immigrant families in years, allowed undocumented spouses and stepchildren of U.S. citizens to apply for a green card without first having to leave the country. The short-lived Biden administration initiative known as 'Keeping Families Together' would have been unlikely to remain in place after Donald Trump took office in January. But its early termination creates greater uncertainty for immigrant families as many are bracing for Trump’s return to the White House. ▶ Read more about the decision. Hungary’s Orbán predicts Trump will end support for Ukraine Donald Trump’s biggest European fan, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, is predicting that his administration will cease providing support to Ukraine in its fight against Russia’s full-scale invasion. Orbán’s comments were a signal that Trump’s election could drive a wedge among EU leaders on the question of the war. Hungary’s leader is hosting the second of two days of summits Friday in the capital, Budapest. The war in Ukraine will be high on the agenda for a gathering of the EU’s 27 leaders, most of whom believe continuing to supply Ukraine with weapons and financial assistance are key elements for the continent’s security. The nationalist Hungarian leader has long sought to undermine EU support for Kyiv, and routinely blocked, delayed or watered down the bloc’s efforts to provide weapons and funding and to sanction Moscow for its invasion. 'If Donald Trump had won in 2020 in the United States, these two nightmarish years wouldn’t have happened. There wouldn’t have been a war,' Orbán said. 'The situation on the front is obvious, there’s been a military defeat. The Americans are going to pull out of this war.' ▶ Read more about the comments. Turkey’s president praises Trump Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan praised Donald Trump over his election victory and expressed optimism for stronger relations between Turkey and the United States during his second term. In comments made late Thursday, Erdogan also voiced hope that conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine could come to an end through collaboration with Trump. Erdogan said Trump had won the election despite facing significant challenges, including an assassination attempt and criminal charges. 'Despite this, he continued his election campaign with much strength, tirelessly and with resilience,' Hürriyet newspaper and other media quoted Erdogan as telling journalists during a flight back from trips to Kyrgyzstan and Hungary. Erdogan has said that in the upcoming period, he would raise the issue of a possible withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria with Trump. Election officials say key Maine race must go to ranked choice counting Maine election officials say a pivotal congressional race in the state must go to ranked choice counting to determine a winner. Maine Democratic Rep. Jared Golden, a moderate known for defying his party, led by a thin margin over Republican Austin Theriault on Friday in a race that was still too early to call days after voting ended. Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said late Thursday that neither candidate broke 50% of the total vote, and that means ranked ballots must be counted. The Associated Press has not called the race. Ranked voting typically comes into play in races with more than two candidates on the ballot. Golden and Theriault were the only candidates in the 2nd Congressional District race, but writing in candidates was an option, and some voters used it. Theriault said on Thursday that he was requesting a recount in the election, although the results were not tabulated yet at that time. A spokesperson for the Golden campaign said the recount is reasonable but the ranked counting is unnecessary. 'State Rep. Theriault has asserted his right to a recount by hand and Congressman Golden agrees to it. So let’s just do it, rather than incur the delays and expenses of a ranked-choice run-off,' the campaign said in a statement. The Theriault campaign signaled Friday that it was supportive of the ranked count. 'There is a process in place and we look forward to the process unfolding according to the law,' campaign manager Shawn Roderick said. In ranked choice voting, the second choices of voters who picked a losing candidate are redistributed to the higher finishers. Election night television viewership drops sharply from 2020 and 2016 The idea of grabbing some popcorn and watching television to see who America has chosen for its next president was far less appealing this year than in the past. The Nielsen company said that 42.3 million people watched election night returns between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump pour in Tuesday night. That’s down sharply from the 56.9 million who watched in 2020, when Trump competed against Joe Biden, and the 71.4 million who tuned in on election night 2016, Nielsen said. Election night is often known as the Super Bowl for TV news, but this year even the NFL’s conference championship games were watched by more people. ▶ Read more about election night television viewership Who is Susie Wiles, Donald Trump’s new White House chief of staff?

The deadline for mail ballots to arrive and be counted is Saturday. With tens of thousands of ballots potentially still left to count in the state’s two biggest counties, the races are too early to call. Arizona: Another day of vote counting in Arizona added tens of thousands of votes to the tally on Thursday, but there remain hundreds of thousands of ballots left to count — including nearly half a million in Maricopa County. Officials there are still working their way through advance votes that arrived in October. The races for president and U.S. Senate remain too early to call. GOP picks up more key House seats while Democrats insist they still have a path to a majority Republican leaders projected confidence Thursday that they will keep control of the U.S. House as more races were decided in their favor, while Democrats insisted they still see a path toward the majority and sought assurances every vote will be counted. The GOP picked up two more hard-fought seats in Pennsylvania, which became a stark battlefield of Democratic losses up and down the ticket. Democrats notched another win in New York, defeating a third Republican incumbent in that state. Both parties in the House huddled privately on conference calls to assess the political landscape as Congress prepared to return next week to a changed Washington, where a sweep of MAGA-infused GOP power is within reach for President-elect Donald Trump. ▶ Revisit Thursday’s House calls	https://apnews.com/26e5d077f122ddcc56484437e476df42	2024-11-08T04:13:44-08:00	
Italian President Mattarella meets Chinese leader Xi in Beijing amid complex ties	BEIJING (AP) — Italian President Sergio Mattarella met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping Friday on an official visit to China that came as Russia’s full-on invasion of Ukraine pitted Rome's NATO allies against Beijing's support for Moscow. The two exchanged greetings following a ceremony with full military honors at the Great Hall of the People in the heart of Beijing. In his opening remarks, Xi referred to the 700th anniversary of Italian adventurer and trader Marco Polo's journey to China that encouraged cultural, economic and religious links between Europe and East Asia. Italy is heavily reliant on foreign trade such as luxury products that have a large market in China. It is also a member of NATO, which China has blamed for provoking the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Beijing has provided Moscow with assistance by purchasing its energy exports while selling it technology that can be used in drones and other armaments. Any differences on political issues were not raised in front of the media and the two leaders later oversaw the signing of a series of agreements on matters from culture to technology and trade. Italy has withdrawn from Xi's signature global Belt and Road Initiative that seeks to deepen China's relations with countries in Africa, Asia, Latin American and the Middle East through infrastructure investments. Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni had declined to renew the agreement, but nevertheless visited China in July. Italy became the first G7 country to sign on to the initiative in 2019, when the populist, anti-establishment Five Star Movement party-led government promoted it as a way of increasing trade with China while getting investments in major infrastructure projects. But neither appeared, and investments in Italian ports that were trumpeted in newspaper headlines were never achieved.	https://apnews.com/article/china-italy-trade-president-visit-19737c9fa96d08f0eba6148a0cd2f1e1	2024-11-08T04:07:47-08:00	
Indonesia's Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki continues to unleash towering column of hot clouds	MAUMERE, Indonesia (AP) — Indonesia’s Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki volcano continued to spew towering columns of hot ash high into the air on Friday following the huge eruption that killed nine people and injured dozens of others. Activity at the volcano on the remote island of Flores, in East Nusa Tenggara province, has increased since Monday’s initial eruption, forcing the authorities on Thursday to expand the danger zone. The latest activity has seen the largest column of ash so far recorded at 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) high, Hadi Wijaya, the head of the Center for Volcanology and Geological Disaster Mitigation, told a news conference. Wijaya said volcanic materials, including smoldering rocks, lava and hot, thumb-size fragments of gravel and ash, were thrown up to 8 kilometers from the crater on Friday. There were no casualties reported from the latest eruption. The volcano monitoring agency has increased Lewotobi Laki Laki’s alert status to the highest level. Wijaya said authorities on Thursday expanded the danger zone to a radius of 8 kilometers on the northwest and southwest of the mountain slope as hot clouds of ash 'are currently spreading in all directions.' 'We are still evaluating how far the (danger zone) radius should be expanded,' he said. The volcanic activity has damaged schools and thousands of houses and buildings, including convents, churches and a seminary on the majority-Catholic Island. Experts at the scene have found craters from rocks falling from the eruptions up to 13 meters (43 feet) wide and 5 meters deep. Authorities have warned the thousands of people who fled the area not to return home, as the government planned to evacuate about 16,000 residents out of the danger zone. The series of eruptions this week have already affected more than 10,000 people in 10 villages, with more than half moving into makeshift emergency shelters. A total of 2,384 houses and public facilities were damaged and collapsed after tons of volcanic materials hit the buildings and destroyed a main road connecting East Flores district where the mountain is located to neighboring Larantuka district, said Kanesius Didimus, head of a local disaster management agency. Rescue workers, police and soldiers on Friday continued to search devastated areas to ensure all residents had been moved out from the danger zone, as logistic and relief supplies were provided to nearly 6,000 displaced people in three evacuation sites. The National Disaster Management Agency has said residents of the hardest-hit villages would be relocated within six months, with each family waiting to be rehoused set to receive compensation of 500,000 rupiah ($32) per month. About 6,500 people were evacuated in January after Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki began erupting, spewing thick clouds and forcing the government to close the island’s Fransiskus Xaverius Seda Airport. No casualties or major damage were reported, but the airport has remained closed due to seismic activity. Three other airports in neighboring districts of Ende, Larantuka and Bajawa have been closed since Monday after Indonesia’s Air Navigation issued a safety warning due to volcanic ash. Lewotobi Laki Laki is one of a pair of stratovolcanoes in the East Flores district of East Nusa Tenggara province, known locally as the husband-and-wife mountains. 'Laki laki' means man, while its mate is Lewotobi Perempuan, or woman. The 1,584-meter (5,197-foot) volcano is one of the 120 active volcanoes in Indonesia, an archipelago of 280 million people. The country is prone to earthquakes, landslides and volcanic activity because it sits along the 'Ring of Fire,' a horseshoe-shaped series of seismic fault lines around the Pacific Ocean. ____ Karmini reported from Jakarta, Indonesia.	https://apnews.com/article/indonesia-mount-lewotobi-laki-laki-volcano-eruption-bdf2e898b600b2568cd1ada25c0a3c1b	2024-11-08T03:55:54-08:00	
Middle East latest: Israeli defense minister officially steps down	Israeli defense minister Yoav Gallant officially stepped down Friday in a ceremony that replaced him with Israel Katz, the former foreign minister, after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fired Gallant earlier this week. Israel has been rocked by Gallant’s dismissal, with the news setting off mass protests across the country. Many in Israel view Gallant as the sole moderate voice in a far-right government, and see his removal as a sign that the far-right government of Benjamin Netanyahu has lost interest in returning hostages still held in Gaza. Israel Katz, his replacement, currently serves as foreign minister and is a longtime Netanyahu loyalist and veteran Cabinet minister. The United Nations humanitarian office says Israel's monthlong offensive in northern Gaza is preventing the estimated 75,000 to 95,000 Palestinians in the north from receiving essential items for their survival. On Thursday, the Israeli military says it will allow 300 truckloads of humanitarian aid supplied by the United Arab Emirates to enter the Gaza Strip in the coming days. That’s less than the 350 trucks per day that the United States said it wants to see enter the war-ravaged territory. The Israel-Hamas war began after militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. Israel’s military response in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 people, Palestinian health officials say. They do not distinguish between civilians and combatants, but say more than half of those killed were women and children. Hezbollah began firing into Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, in solidarity with Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Since the conflict erupted, more than 3,100 people have been killed and some 13,800 wounded in Lebanon, the health ministry reported. ___ Here’s the latest: Israeli defense minister officially steps down JERUSALEM — Israeli defense minister Yoav Gallant officially stepped down Friday in a ceremony that replaced him with Israel Katz, the former Foreign Minister, after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed Gallant earlier this week. Israel has been rocked by Gallant’s firing, with the news setting off mass protests across the country. Many in Israel view Gallant as the sole moderate voice in a far-right government, and see his dismissal as a sign that the far-right government of Benjamin Netanyahu has lost interest in returning hostages still held in Gaza by Hamas militants. Gallant thanked the military and warned that the war’s 'mission is not yet complete; we must meet our moral and traditional obligation, and the war’s objective is to bring home the remaining 101 hostages who haven’t yet seen their families and homes.' Israel Katz, his replacement, currently serves as foreign minister and is a longtime Netanyahu loyalist and veteran Cabinet minister. Katz thanked Gallant and said the war’s objectives were to 'stop Iranian aggression and deny its capabilities, continue dismantling Hamas as a governing and military force, and defeat Hezbollah.' He added that returning the hostages was a top 'moral priority.' 'Yoav, we were friends and will remain friends because we believe in the same things that will secure Israel’s security and future, the Jewish state,' he said. 'I promise that the entire State of Israel will emerge from this war and from the pain to much higher places.' Turkey's Erdogan hopes Trump will fulfil promises to end Middle East conflicts ANKARA, Turkey - Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says he hopes US President-Elect Donald Trump will fulfil promises to end the conflict in the Middle East and tell Israel to 'stop' its aggression. Speaking to a group of journalists on a return flight from Hungary, Erdogan also said that cutting off U.S. arms support to Israel 'would be a good start' toward ending the conflict in Lebanon and the Palestinian territories. 'We want that promise to be fulfilled and for Israel to be told to ‘stop,’' Hurriyet newspaper and other media quoted Erdogan as saying on Friday. Turkey has become one of Israel’s most vocal critics, accusing the country of committing genocide in Gaza and strongly criticizing Western nations for backing Israel. ___ For more Middle East news: https://apnews.com/hub/middle-east	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-hezbollah-mideast-latest-8-november-2024-27eb23b8d7aa72ba06ca5ec8c6ba711a	2024-11-08T02:55:57-08:00	
Trump 2.0 will alter global climate fighting efforts. Will others step up?	WASHINGTON (AP) — Global efforts to fight climate change stumbled but survived the last time Donald Trump was elected president and withdrew the United States from an international climate agreement. Other countries, states, cities and businesses picked up some of the slack. But numerous experts worry that a second Trump term will be more damaging, with the United States withdrawing even further from climate efforts in a way that could cripple future presidents' efforts. With Trump, who has dismissed climate change, in charge of the world's leading economy, those experts fear other countries — especially top polluting nation China — could use it as an excuse to ease off their own efforts to curb carbon emissions. 'There's no hope of reaching a safe climate without substantive action from the United States, from China, from Europe,' said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson, who chairs the Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists that tracks countries' carbon dioxide emissions, which have been rising globally. He said he's certain the world is shooting past the internationally accepted threshold of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius since pre-industrial times. That's just a couple tenths of a degree away. Others believe the goal is alive. Trump's reelection comes as the world is on track to set yet another record hot year, and has been lurching from drought to hurricane to flood to wildfire. 'An emboldened Trump would be terrible,' European Climate Foundation CEO Laurence Tubiana said in August. On Wednesday, Tubiana, the former French official who helped forge the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement that Trump pulled out of, called the election result a setback for global climate action. But she added: 'The Paris Agreement has proven resilient and is stronger than any single country’s policy.' The United Nations’ annual climate negotiations to follow on the Paris accord start next week in Baku, Azerbaijan. In the months after, all countries including the U.S. must issue national plans showing how they will increase efforts to limit heat-trapping emissions from coal, oil and natural gas. 'Baku will be the earliest test of the resilience of the global climate regime,' said Asia Society Policy Institute Director Li Shuo, who foresees the European Union and China stepping up to fill the U.S. leadership void, especially economically. 'It should also unite other countries.' It sort of did that in 2017, when Trump announced that the U.S. would abandon the Paris climate agreement. 'Not a single country followed the U.S. out the door,' said Alden Meyer, a longtime climate negotiations analyst with the European think tank E3G. 'We saw the birth and launch of the We Are Still In movement of subnational actors, investors, businesses, governors, mayors and others here in the U.S.' Meyer and others said a more serious step than withdrawing from Paris is possible. That would be pulling out of an underlying treaty from 1992 that set curbing climate change and saving biodiversity as part of global environmental goals for the 21st century, as well as withdrawing from the United Nations climate change fighting system that fosters negotiations, records emissions and what's being done about them. Project 2025, a conservative post-election blueprint that the Trump campaign distanced itself from but was written by his allies, called for withdrawing from both that U.N. framework and the Paris Agreement. In 1992, then-President George H.W. Bush signed the Rio conventions, which set up the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. That eventually led to agreements in Kyoto and Paris. The Rio agreement was unanimously approved by the U.S. Senate, but senators soundly rejected the 1997 Kyoto Protocol and President George W. Bush pulled the U.S. out of it. When negotiators were crafting the 2015 Paris deal, they made it voluntary and made it part of the Rio treaty so no Senate approval was needed. That allowed President Joe Biden in 2021 to immediately rejoin the Paris Agreement without Senate approval. It's not straightforward, but an exit from Rio and the UNFCCC could make it nearly impossible for the U.S. to get back into climate negotiations, Meyer said. David Waskow, international climate director for World Resources Institute, agreed. He said withdrawal from the U.N. agreement 'would not only place the U.S. on the sidelines of international climate discussions but would be like ejecting itself from the stadium.' The Paris agreement calls for nations to submit new and more aggressive plans to reduce emissions of heat-trapping gases every five years. Those are due next February and the Biden administration has promised to submit one before it ends 'to show what should be done, what can be done,' Meyer said. But the assumption is that the new Trump administration won't honor it, he said. Meyer said the United States pulling out of climate agreements in Republican administrations and then trying to lead the world in Democratic ones is like the Peanuts cartoon when Lucy keeps pulling the football away from Charlie Brown. 'The world has gotten tired of this routine,' Meyer said. Joanna Depledge, a historian of international climate negotiations, said she expected Trump's new term will mean four lost years for U.S. climate action. But she added: 'The rest of the world is used to U.S. flip-flopping now and will not be diverted from their own efforts.' Because of the 2020 pandemic and the timing of deadlines created by the Paris Agreement, the three United Nations climate negotiations that took place during the first Trump administration weren’t as ambitious as they could have been. Now, urgent action is needed at the summit this year and next, Depledge and others said. U.N. climate chief Simon Stiell said negotiations continue because 'the fundamental facts remain unchanged: global heating is already hammering every nation, hitting national and households budgets harder every year.' The Biden administration will still represent the United States next week, when crucial negotiations will address financial help that poor nations need to cope with and fight climate change. But Harris' loss undercuts negotiations because 'everyone there knows' the U.S. is unlikely to follow through on any agreement it signs, Stanford's Jackson said. One of the dynamics of past negotiations during Democratic regimes was that any U.S.-China deal usually led to a global one. Usually the United States 'is able to nudge' a more reluctant China to be more ambitious about fighting climate change, Asia Society's Li Shuo said. 'Beijing will read the air in Washington and their conclusion is climate does not enjoy the same level of momentum it had a couple of years ago,' Li said. But despite all this, many in the insular world of climate negotiations somehow keep optimistic. 'There is an antidote to doom and despair,' said former U.N. climate chief Christiana Figueres said. 'It's action on the ground and it's happening in all corners of the Earth.' __ Read more of AP’s climate coverage at http://www.apnews.com/climate-and-environment ___ Follow Seth Borenstein on X at @borenbears ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Philippine president angers China with new laws to demarcate South China Sea territories	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. signed two laws on Friday reaffirming the extent of his country’s maritime territories and right to resources, including in the South China Sea, angering China, which claims the hotly disputed waterway almost in its entirety. China’s foreign ministry said it summoned the Philippines ambassador to China to lodge a 'stern protest.' The ministry condemned the move as an attempt to 'solidify the illegal ruling of the South China Sea arbitration case through domestic legislation.' Confrontations between Chinese and Philippine coast guard and naval forces in the disputed sea passage have spiked alarmingly since last year. That has sparked fears that the United States — Manila’s longtime treaty ally — may get drawn in a major conflict. The laws, called the Philippine Maritime Zones act and the Philippine Archipelagic Sea Lanes act, were signed by Marcos in a nationally televised ceremony attended by top military and national security officials. They further cement Manila’s rejection of China’s claims to virtually the entire sea passage, and stipulate jail terms and stiff fines for violators. 'These signal our resolve to protect our maritime resources, preserve our rich biodiversity and ensure that our waters remain a source of life and livelihood for all Filipinos,' Marcos said. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said the move 'seriously infringes on China’s territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests in the South China Sea.' 'China strongly condemns and firmly opposes it,' she said. In a new national map it released last year the Chinese government demarcated its claim to virtually the entire South China Sea with vague dash lines that drew protests and rejections from rival coastal states and government, including Malaysia, Vietnam, Taiwan, Indonesia and the Philippines. The maritime zones act demarcates key parts of the Philippine archipelago’s territory and outlying waters where it has full sovereignty and sovereign rights under international law and the 1982 U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea, Philippine officials said. Those zones include the country's Exclusive Economic Zone, a 200-nautical-mile (370-kilometer) stretch of water, where a coastal state like the Philippines has exclusive rights to tap energy and other resources. Foreign ships and aircraft have an internationally recognized right known as 'innocent passage' to pass through such a zone, as long as the coastal state’s security would not come under threat. The archipelagic sea lanes act allows the Philippines to designate sea lanes and air routes in the archipelago where foreign ships and aircraft could transit under its regulation and in compliance with international law. 'These legal instruments solidify our territory and enhances our ability to protect our country against any infringement,' National Security Adviser Eduardo Ano said. Marcos said the laws comply with international law and the UNCLOS, but many of their provisions stand in stark contrast to Beijing’s claims in the South China Sea and would likely be rejected and defied by China. It’s unclear how the Philippines could enforce the laws, which take effect 15 days after their publication in the government’s official gazette or in a newspaper, given China's increasingly aggressive actions to push its claims. Copies of the laws signed by Marcos were not immediately available but a final version of the maritime zones bill stated that 'all artificial islands constructed within the Philippine EEZ belong to the Philippine government.' China has transformed seven disputed reefs into what are now missile-protected island bases, including the Mischief Reef, which lies within the Philippines’ Exclusive Economic Zone. The law based the Philippines’ maritime rights on UNCLOS, Philippine laws and a 2016 international arbitration ruling that invalidated China’s extensive territorial claims based on historical grounds. China refused to participate in that arbitration, rejected the ruling and continues to defy it. Its massive coast guard, navy, air force and suspected militia fleets have used water cannons, military grade lasers and dangerous sea and air maneuvers to intimidate rival forces it accuses of straying into what Beijing calls its territory. Washington has repeatedly warned that it's obligated to defend the Philippines, its oldest treaty ally in Asia, if Filipino forces, aircraft or ships come under an armed attack in the disputed waters.	https://apnews.com/article/philippine-maritime-zones-act-archipelagic-sea-lanes-act-south-china-sea-4ecec3f00ab9367d948e5af3959aea21	2024-11-08T00:54:31-08:00	
As EU leaders meet, Hungary's Orbán predicts Trump's administration will end support for Ukraine	BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — A new U.S. administration under Donald Trump will cease providing support to Ukraine in its fight against Russia's full-scale invasion, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán said ahead of a European Union summit on Friday, signaling that Trump's recent election could drive a wedge among EU leaders on the question of the war. Orbán is hosting the second of two days of summits Friday in the Hungarian capital, Budapest, on the heels of Trump's election victory. The war in Ukraine will be high on the agenda for a gathering of the EU's 27 leaders, most of whom believe continuing to supply Ukraine with weapons and financial assistance are key elements for the continent's security. The nationalist Hungarian leader has long sought to undermine EU support for Kyiv, and routinely blocked, delayed or watered down the bloc’s efforts to provide weapons and funding and to sanction Moscow for its invasion. He has sought to use the summits to make his case to other leaders that they should rethink their commitments to Ukraine. In comments to state radio ahead of Friday's summit, Orbán, who is close to both Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, reiterated his long-held position that an immediate cease-fire should be declared, and suggested that Ukraine has already lost its fight. 'If Donald Trump had won in 2020 in the United States, these two nightmarish years wouldn’t have happened. There wouldn’t have been a war,' Orbán said. 'The situation on the front is obvious, there’s been a military defeat. The Americans are going to pull out of this war.' Russian forces have recently made modest gains in the east of Ukraine, although positions on the front lines have remained relatively stable for months. Still, as the duration of the war approaches 1,000 days, Ukraine’s forces are struggling to match Russia’s military, which is much bigger and better equipped. Western support is crucial for Ukraine to sustain the costly war of attrition, and uncertainty over how long that aid will continue deepened this week with Trump's presidential election victory. The Republican has repeatedly taken issue with U.S. aid to Ukraine and declared he would bring a quick end to the conflict without detailing how. At a gathering on Thursday of European leaders in Budapest, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy objected to Trump's claim that Russia’s war with Ukraine could be ended in a day, something he and his European backers fear would mean peace on terms favorable to Putin and involving the surrender of territory. 'If it is going to be very fast, it will be a loss for Ukraine,' Zelenskyy said. EU leaders have largely found workaround solutions to any obstruction to providing Zelenskyy with assistance, and have been able to signal their commitment to supporting Ukraine in its fight, regardless of who occupies the White House. Arriving at Friday's summit, Italy's hard-right Premier Giorgia Meloni, who is aligned with Orbán on many issues but breaks with him sharply on Russia's war, said: 'As long is there is a war, Italy is on the side of Ukraine.' European Council President Charles Michel said the EU must strengthen and support the war-ravaged country, 'because if we do not support Ukraine, this is the wrong signal that we send to Putin, but also to some other authoritarian regimes across the world.' But Orbán has cast himself as the exemplar of some in the EU who are skeptical of providing indefinite support to Ukraine, especially in light of uncertainty over whether U.S. assistance could evaporate under Trump. 'This is a new situation,' he said of Trump's reelection. 'If this is what's going on across the pond, then this is going to affect us Europeans too. Europe cannot finance this war alone.'	https://apnews.com/article/orban-predicts-trump-end-us-support-ukraine-b9ccaa5241410550763a29eaf38b3d20	2024-11-08T00:50:50-08:00	
Greece and Turkey press ahead with talks in effort to smooth often volatile relations	ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Recent efforts to smooth the frequently volatile ties between neighbors and regional rivals Greece and Turkey are bearing fruit, their foreign ministers said Friday, although significant differences remain between the two countries as they seek ways to prevent spats from escalating dangerously. Despite both being members of NATO, Greece and Turkey have been at loggerheads for decades over a long series of issues, including complex maritime boundary disputes that led them to the brink of war in 1987 and in 1996. In 2020, tension over drilling rights led to Greek and Turkish warships shadowing each other in the eastern Mediterranean. Over the past 16 months, the two sides have made concerted efforts to reduce tensions, with the Greek and Turkish leaders meeting six times. Last December, the two countries signed more than a dozen cooperation deals during a meeting in Athens between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis. 'I am not claiming that through the dialogue we have developed, all the problems in the two countries' relations have been magically resolved,' Greek Foreign Minister George Gerapetritis said in statements to the media after a meeting with his Turkish counterpart, Hakan Fidan, in Athens. The ministers didn't take any questions. 'There were indeed difficult moments during the past year,' Gerapetritis said. 'But in all cases, there was an immediate and honest channel that prevented escalation.' With two brutal conflicts raging in the wider region, in Ukraine and in the Middle East, mending ties and preventing flare-ups in tension between the two neighbors has become all the more essential. 'We are working to understand each other better on critical issues. The region we are in has many problems,' Fidan said. 'Turkey and Greece need to be able to act with mutual trust in this difficult geography. Through a win-win approach, we can contribute to the prosperity and peace of our people.' Despite the positive climate, the two sides remain far apart on some of the thornier issues, notably on territorial rights in the Aegean Sea. The two disagree on the delineation of the continental shelf and exclusive economic zone, which determines exploitation rights for resources, as well as on the extent of territorial waters. Turkey has said that any move by Greece to extend its territorial waters around its islands in the Aegean Sea from six nautical miles to 12 nautical miles, which Greece insists it has the right to do at any time, would be a cause for war. Turkey also doesn’t recognize that Greek islands off its borders have a continental shelf, while Greece insists that position is in contravention of international law. Athens insists the issue of the continental shelf and exclusive economic zone is the only dispute it has with Turkey and is willing to bring it to the International Court of Justice in The Hague. Friday’s talks 'included the evaluation of the conditions for the start of a fundamental discussion for the delineation of the continental shelf and the Exclusive Economic Zone in the Aegean and the eastern Mediterranean,' Gerapetritis said. 'It is an initial, honest approach of a difficult but also crucial issue.' Fidan stressed that all areas of disagreement connected to the Aegean, the sea that lies between the two countries, must be tackled. 'There are many problems that are interconnected in the Aegean. These disputes cannot be reduced to the issues of the continent shelf and exclusive economic zones,' Fidan said. 'We must address all issues that have the potential to create tensions and crises on the basis of mutual respect and cooperation.' 'As Turkey, we continue to defend the principle of equitable sharing in the eastern Mediterranean,' he added. Migration has been a source of tension between the two countries for years. Tens of thousands of people make their way each year from Turkey to nearby Greek islands, using European Union-member Greece as a gateway to more prosperous countries in the 27-nation bloc. While thousands of migrants continue to arrive in Greece, risking sometimes fatal sea crossings, the two ministers stressed the need to crack down on illegal migration and smuggling networks. The two 'emphasized the importance of acting together to combat irregular migration,' Fidan said. ___ Suzan Fraser in Ankara, Turkey, and Derek Gatopoulos in Athens, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/greece-turkey-foreign-minister-meetings-fbaffa28b733d2896aa178f803ac4103	2024-11-08T00:22:24-08:00	
European countries are spending more on defense, a think tank says	PRAGUE (AP) — European nations boosted their defenses in response to the annexation of the Crimea Peninsula in 2014 and Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, a London-based think tank said Friday, but much remains to be done for them to be ready to face threats from Russia. That’s the conclusion of a report released by the International Institute for Strategic Studies released as it opened a three-day gathering in the Czech capital to discuss European and transatlantic military capabilities. 'NATO has not just significantly increased its ambitions regarding its deterrence and war-fighting posture, but European members have sought to address critical capability and readiness shortfalls,' the report said. 'Unsurprisingly, however, after decades of neglect and underinvestment, much remains to be done and progress has been mixed.' It was released as European leaders, including NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, were reassessing their trans-Atlantic relations in Budapest, Hungary in the hope that Donald Trump’s second U.S. presidency will avoid the strife of his first administration and maintain a strong common stance on Russia. During his election campaign, Trump threatened actions that could have groundbreaking consequences for nations across Europe, from a trade war with the EU to a withdrawal of NATO commitments and a fundamental shift of support for Ukraine in its war with Russia. During his first 2017-2021 term, Trump pushed NATO's European members to spend more on defense, up to and beyond 2% of gross domestic product, and to be less reliant on U.S. military cover. In that respect, some progress has been made, with 2024 defense spending by NATO’s European members states 50% higher than it was 10 years ago, the report said. But problems remain, the IISS said, naming a lack of stability in public financing that 'ultimately limits (the defense) industry’s ability to invest with confidence.' Moreover, 'regulatory hurdles and application of environmental, social and governance standards will continue to act as barriers to investment,' it said. Europe’s defense industry managed to increase output of some products after 2022, especially those with high demand from Ukraine, such as air defense and artillery. But European countries also donated their own weapons to Ukraine, including F-16 fighter jets, and 'remain dependent on the U.S. for some important aspects of their military capability,' looking also to Brazil, Israel and South Korea to meet their needs due to a lack of their production capacity. Competition with civilian industries for raw materials and skilled professionals makes things harder for the defense industry, the report said. It also warned that many European armies don’t have enough military personnel. A lesson learned from Russia’s war against Ukraine is 'that countries need significant troops to engage with and defeat enemy attack, but also enough forces to regenerate after combat attrition.' By that standard, 'key European armed forces remain under-strength.' Europeans have a long way to go to renovate their defense capabilities, the report said. 'Forces, budgets and defense-industrial capacities were reduced because of political decisions by governments. These same governments now need to rediscover the ‘muscle memory’ of defense and security, ensuring sustained policy attention and investment to meet the new strategic realities in Europe.'	https://apnews.com/article/europe-defense-industry-iiss-nato-a75e44e7ddda8abddfdb5aba64d02f8b	2024-11-07T23:41:39-08:00	
Ship suspected of carrying toxic waste docks in Albania, where its contents will be checked	TIRANA, Albania (AP) — A ship suspected of carrying a large amount of hazardous waste docked Friday at Albania’s main port, where prosecutors have ordered that its contents be tested. The Turkish-flagged Moliva XA443A was kept at an anchorage about 1.5 kilometers (a mile) from the port of Durres, 33 kilometers (20 miles) west of the capital, until authorities found a spot out of the port to store the containers, port and prosecutor's office officials said. The containers are expected to be sent to an agency in Porto Romano, 6 kilometers (4 miles) away. Ten days ago, prosecutors ordered the containers to be seized and stored 'at an environmentally and physically safe place' for monitoring. The prosecutor's office has asked different institutions to conduct lab tests of the material in the containers. Media coverage showed that the containers being unloaded from the ship and headed to the quarantine area. 'The case is under investigation from the Durres prosecutor's office and the Ministry of Tourism and Environment is cooperating for anything that the justice institution asks for,' ministry spokesperson Erjon Uka told The Associated Press. The Seattle-based non-government organization Basel Action Network, or BAN, which focuses on environmental issues, flagged the ship to authorities in August after receiving information from a whistleblower that the containers on board are suspected to be carrying an estimated 2,100 tons of toxic dust from pollution control filters from the steel industry. BAN said the containers left Durres on July 4 on two Maersk-chartered ships with the intended destination of Thailand. The group said it alerted several transit countries and collaborated with EARTH, a Thai environmental organization, and together raised the alarm about the shipment. Thailand refused to accept the shipment, asking authorities in Singapore to stop it. The ships then docked at a Turkish port and the containers were loaded on the Turkish-flagged ship, which briefly stopped at the Italian port of Gioia Tauro before going to Albania, BAN said. The customs documentation stated the containers contained iron oxide, according to local reports. Albania's opposition accused the government in August of taking part in illegally trafficking hazardous material. Prime Minister Edi Rama said in Parliament in September that the shipment’s documents were verified and that iron oxide is 'not considered as toxic waste in the European catalogs on which the environmental and customs procedure of our country is based.' BAN has called on authorities to have a public opening and sampling of the containers to ensure transparency. It is suspected the containers have toxic steel furnace dust collected from pollution control filters at an Albanian company and also illegally smuggled from Kosovo and Germany. Ban said that while Albania is looking to join the European Union and the government has been eager to align its hazardous waste policy with that of the 27-nation bloc, it should ban 'the export of hazardous wastes, household wastes, electronic wastes and plastic wastes to developing countries.' ___ Follow Llazar Semini at https://x.com/lsemini	https://apnews.com/article/albania-toxic-waste-ship-environment-73c1e21858443c6da9f6490f426184f2	2024-11-07T23:01:44-08:00	
Italy sends another 8 migrants to Albania, despite failing to process the first group	SHENGJIN, Albania (AP) — An Italian navy ship docked Friday at the Albanian port of Shengjin with eight migrants who will be processed there after they were intercepted in international waters, a month after another group was turned away for failing the vetting process. It is only the second transfer of migrants since two migrant processing centers started operating in October. The same ship transferred to Albania the first 16 migrants from Bangladesh and Egypt. Four were taken to Italy the same day because they were minors or had health issues. Twelve others were brought back to Italy three days later, following a ruling by Rome judges who rejected their detention because their countries of origin — Bangladesh and Egypt — were not safe enough for them to be sent back. The naval ship Libra, which can carry 200 people besides crew, left Italy’s southernmost island of Lampedusa on Wednesday with eight men on board, according to the Italian media. Italian Interior Ministry spokesperson Francesco Kamel had confirmed the Libra was heading to Albania, but declined to give out any further information until the operation was complete. He didn't say when it would arrive, nor how many people were on board. The Italian media reported that, out of 1,200 migrant arrivals on Lampedusa over the past two days, just eight male adults traveling without families met Albania's screening criteria, including that they come from countries deemed 'safe' for repatriation. The number of people reaching Italy along the central Mediterranean migration route — mainly from Bangladesh, Syria, Tunisia and Egypt — has fallen by 60% in 2024 compared to 2023. As of Nov. 7, according to the Italian Interior Ministry, 57,767 migrants have arrived by sea in 2024. A court ruling out of Rome had shortened the list of countries considered 'safe' by law, meaning that Rome can repatriate migrants from those countries who didn’t win asylum using a fast-track procedure. Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni slammed the Rome court ruling, and said that deeming countries such as Bangladesh and Egypt unsafe means that virtually all migrants would be barred from the Albania program, making it unworkable. On Oct. 21, Italy’s far-right government approved a new decree aimed at overcoming those judicial hurdles that risked derailing a controversial five-year migration deal with Albania, signed in 2023 by Meloni and her Albanian counterpart, Edi Rama. Under the deal, up to 3,000 migrants intercepted by the Italian coast guard in international waters each month will be sheltered in Albania, and vetted for possible asylum in Italy or be sent back to their countries. Italy has agreed to welcome those migrants who are granted asylum, while those whose applications are rejected face deportation directly from Albania. The agreement to outsource the housing of asylum-seekers to a non-European Union member country, defended by Meloni as a new model to handle illegal migration, has been hailed by some countries that, like Italy, are experiencing a high level of migrant arrivals. Visiting Albania in October, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen refused to give her opinion of the agreement, saying only that it was being closely monitored. Human rights groups and non-governmental organizations that are active in the Mediterranean have slammed the agreement as a dangerous precedent that conflicts with international laws. ___ Semini reported from Tirana; Colleen Barry contributed from Milan. ___ Follow Llazar Semini at: https://x.com/lsemini Follow AP’s global migration coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/migration	https://apnews.com/article/albania-italy-migrant-processing-de9379f062f00b96aac6837ea3283bfe	2024-11-07T22:29:31-08:00	
2 suspected rebels and 2 members of government-run militia are killed in Indian-controlled Kashmir	NEW DELHI (AP) — Two suspected militants were killed in a gunfight with government forces in Indian-controlled Kashmir, officials said Friday, while assailants killed two members of a government-sponsored militia elsewhere in the disputed region. The region, divided between India and Pakistan but claimed by both in its entirety, has experienced an increase in violence in recent months. The Indian military said a joint team of soldiers and police raided a village near northwestern Sopore town late Thursday following a tip about the presence of a group of militants. The militants 'fired indiscriminately' at the troops, leading to a gunbattle in which two were killed, the military said in a statement. Troops were continuing to search the area, it said. There was no independent confirmation of the incident. Meanwhile, assailants killed two members of a government-run militia called the 'Village Defense Group' in the remote southern Kishtwar area late Thursday, officials said. Police blamed rebels fighting against Indian rule in Kashmir for the killings. The two, one of them a Hindu and another Muslim, were abducted from a forested area where they had gone to graze cattle on Thursday. On Friday, hundreds of people at several places in Kishtwar and Jammu district took to the streets in protest at the killings, demanding the authorities arrest the culprits. Kishtwar also observed a shutdown on the instruction of a Hindu group, the Sanatan Dharam Sabha. The Village Defense Group was initially formed in the 1990s to protect remote Himalayan villages against anti-India insurgents when government forces could not reach them quickly. As the insurgency waned in their areas and as some militia members gained notoriety for brutality and rights violations, the militia was largely disbanded. However last year, after the killing of seven Hindus in two attacks in a remote mountainous village near the highly militarized Line of Control that divides Kashmir between India and Pakistan, authorities revived the militia and began rearming and training thousands of villagers, including some teenagers. The Kashmir Tigers, which Indian officials say is an offshoot of the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad militant group, claimed responsibility for the killings of the two in a statement on social media. The insurgent group also released photos of the two bloodied bodies. The statement could not be independently verified. Chief Minister Omar Abdullah condemned the attack. 'I expect the security forces to move quickly to plug any gaps in our counter-terror grid &amp; ensure that attacks like this stop completely,' he wrote on social medial platform X. Militants in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir have been fighting New Delhi’s rule since 1989. Many Muslim Kashmiris support the rebels’ goal of uniting the territory, either under Pakistani rule or as an independent country. India insists the Kashmir militancy is Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. Pakistan denies the charge, and many Kashmiris consider it a legitimate freedom struggle. Tens of thousands of civilians, rebels and government forces have been killed in the conflict.	https://apnews.com/article/kashmir-india-pakistan-fighting-killings-rebels-0347955ec25638af367b0fcd4bea0d6a	2024-11-07T22:19:20-08:00	
AP PHOTOS: Tens of thousands of Hindu devotees flock to rivers for prayers to the sun god	NEW DELHI (AP) — Tens of thousands of Hindu devotees flocked to rivers and bodies of water across India to pray to the sun god as part of the Chhath festival this week. In Noida, on the outskirts of the capital New Delhi, families gathered at the Yamuna river, which is covered with white toxic foam as a result of pollutants discharged from nearby industries. Women in brightly colored saris waded into the knee-deep water flecked with blobs of white foam. Some carried a coconut or other fruits as an offering to thank Lord Surya, the god of the sun, for sustaining life on earth as they sought divine blessings. The Yamuna is considered one of India’s most sacred rivers, and Hindu devotees have continued to use it despite warnings about the toxic foam. A court in Delhi on Wednesday forbade worshipers from performing rituals on the bank of the heavily polluted river over health and safety concerns, local media reported, yet thousands gathered on Thursday and Friday at the river banks to immerse themselves in the river and drinks it water. From the financial capital Mumbai to Hyderabad in the south and Guwahati in the east, thousands of men, women and children did the same. The Chhath festival, celebrated after the Hindu festival of Diwali, originated in the country's eastern states, with large celebrations in Bihar and Jharkand, and extends to Nepal. Over the years, it has grown more popular across India, often introduced as migrants from eastern states mark the festival away from home. The rituals, which stretch over four days, include a holy dip in the river and a period of fasting and abstaining from drinking water. On the last two days, devotees stand in the waters to pray to the sun as it rises and sets, with some families camping out overnight along the banks.	https://apnews.com/article/india-hindu-chhath-sun-festival-yamuna-river-21c03117b6906667a4a7d2654dd429d1	2024-11-07T21:45:18-08:00	
The Berlin Wall: A divide that once shaped German women's lives still echoes today	BERLIN (AP) — Like many other young women living in communist East Germany, Solveig Leo thought nothing about juggling work and motherhood. The mother of two was able to preside over a large state-owned farm in the northeastern village of Banzkow because childcare was widely available. Contrast that with Claudia Huth, a mother of five, who grew up in capitalist West Germany. Huth quit her job as a bank clerk when she was pregnant with her first child and led a life as a traditional housewife in the village of Egelsbach in Hesse, raising the kids and tending to her husband, who worked as a chemist. Both Leo and Huth fulfilled roles that in many ways were typical for women in the vastly different political systems that governed Germany during its decades of division following the country’s defeat in World War II in 1945. As Germany celebrates the 35th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall on Nov. 9, 1989 — and the country’s reunification less than a year later on Oct. 3, 1990 — many in Germany are reflecting on how women’s lives that have diverged so starkly under communism and capitalism have become much more similar again — though some differences remain even today. 'In West Germany, women — not all, but many — had to fight for their right to have a career,' said Clara Marz, the curator of an exhibition about women in divided Germany for the Federal Foundation for the Study of the Communist Dictatorship in Germany. Women in East Germany, meanwhile, often had jobs — though that was something that 'they had been ordered from above to do,' she added. Built in 1961, the Wall stood for 28 years at the front line of the Cold War between the Americans and the Soviets. It was built by the communist regime to cut off East Germans from the supposed ideological contamination of the West and to stem the tide of people fleeing East Germany. Today only a few stretches of the 156.4-kilometer (97.2-mile) barrier around the capitalist exclave of West Berlin remain, mostly as a tourist attraction. 'All the heavy industry was in the west, there was nothing here,' Leo, who is now 81 years old, said during a recent interview looking back at her life as a woman under communism. 'East Germany had to pay war reparations to the Soviet Union. Women needed to work our own way out of that misery.' By contrast, Leo said, women in the West didn't need to work because they were 'spoiled by the Marshall Plan' — the United States’ generous reconstruction plan that poured billions of dollars into West Germany and other European countries after the war. In capitalist West Germany, the economy recovered so quickly after the total devastation of WWII that people soon started talking of a Wirtschaftswunder, or 'economic miracle,' that brought them affluence and stability less than 10 years after the war. That economic success, however, indirectly hampered women’s quest for equal rights. Most West German women stayed at home and were expected to take care of their household while their husbands worked. Religion, too, played a much bigger role than in atheist East Germany, confining women to traditional roles as caregivers of the family. Mothers who tried to break out of these conventions and took on jobs were infamously decried as Rabenmütter, or uncaring moms who put work over family. Not all West German women perceived their traditional roles as restrictive. 'I always had this idea to be with my children, because I loved being with them,' said Huth, now 69. 'It never really occurred to me to go to work.' More than three decades after Germany’s unification, a new generation of women is barely aware of the different lives their mothers and grandmothers led depending on which part of the country they lived in. For most, combining work and motherhood has also become the normal way of life. Hannah Fiedler, an 18-year-old high school graduate from Berlin, said the fact that her family lived in East Germany during the decades of the country's division has no impact on her life today. 'East or West — it's not even a topic in our family anymore,' she said, as she sat on a bench near a thin, cobble-stoned path in the capital's Mitte neighborhood, which marks the former course of the Berlin Wall in the then-divided city. She also said that growing up, she had not experienced any disadvantages because she's female. 'I'm white and privileged — for good or worse — I don't expect any problems when I enter the working world in the future,' she said. Some small differences between the formerly divided parts of Germany linger on. In the former East, 74% of women are working, compared to 71.5% in the West, according to a 2023 study by the Hans-Böckler-Stiftung foundation. Childcare is also still more available in the former East than in the West. In 2018, 57% of children under the age of 3 were looked after in a childcare facility in the eastern state of Saxony. That compares with 27% in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia and 44% in Hamburg and Bremen, according to Germany's Federal Statistical Office. Germany as a whole trails behind some other European countries when it comes to gender equality. Only 31.4% lawmakers in Germany's national parliament are female, compared to 41% in Belgium's parliament, 43.6% in Denmark, 45% in Norway and 45.6% in Sweden. Nonetheless, Leo, the 81-year-old farmer from former East Germany, is optimistic that eventually women all over the country will have the same opportunities. 'I can’t imagine that there are any women who don’t like to be independent,' she said. ___ Jan M.

AP Photos: 35 years after the Berlin Wall opened, fragments of East Germany's border remain	BERLIN (AP) — Most of communist East Germany's heavily fortified border was torn down quickly after it was opened in 1989, but there are still places where visitors can see the remains of the Berlin Wall and other sections of the frontier. East Germany closed the border in Berlin on Aug. 13, 1961, and expanded the Wall into an increasingly elaborate fortification snaking through the city and around the capitalist enclave of West Berlin. The Wall plugged the last gap in the border between east and west. East Germany's leadership had already sealed off the country's main frontier with West Germany, snaking from the Baltic Sea to Czechoslovakia, in 1952. It stayed that way until the border was opened on Nov. 9, 1989. The Bornholmer Strasse crossing in Berlin was the first to open that night. Border guards, who hadn't received orders to let anyone pass, gave way under pressure from a large crowd demanding to be let through after an off-handed announcement of new regulations by Politburo spokesperson Günter Schabowski. Today, a section of Wall slabs with photos of those events and a series of plaques marking the night's main developments — including an alert sent by The Associated Press’ German service — stands at the former crossing. The longest section of Wall remaining in Berlin is the East Side Gallery, where the once-gray concrete slabs are covered with murals that were painted by 118 artists after the opening of the border. Otherwise, the Wall has largely disappeared now and much of the former 'death strip' — between the exterior wall that faced West Berlin and an interior wall that faced east — has been built over. Among the exceptions is a strip of the former border at the Bernauer Strasse memorial site in downtown Berlin, and there are fragments dotted around elsewhere in the city and on its edges. In most cases, the main East-West German border outside Berlin consisted of heavily fortified fences rather than walls. There were a few exceptions, however: most famously in the village of Moedlareuth, divided between Bavaria and the eastern region of Thuringia, which earned the nickname 'Little Berlin.' Part of Moedlareuth's border can still be seen today. Germany was reunified on Oct. 3, 1990, less than a year after the border opened.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-berlin-wall-35th-anniversary-photos-638cb701a1405edd8bea7cd3059d2a0e	2024-11-07T20:12:47-08:00	
In an Israeli settlement named after Trump, residents see opportunity after the election	RAMAT TRUMP, Golan Heights (AP) — Israeli residents of 'Trump Heights' are welcoming the election of their namesake, hoping Donald Trump's return to the U.S. presidency will breathe new life into this tiny, remote settlement in the central Golan Heights. During his first term, Trump became the first and only foreign leader to recognize Israel’s control of the Golan, which it seized from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war. Israel thanked him by rebranding this outpost after him. But a large-scale influx of new residents never materialized after that 2019 ceremony, and just a couple dozen families live in Trump Heights, or 'Ramat Trump' in Hebrew. Job opportunities are limited, and Israel’s more than yearlong war against Hezbollah militants in nearby Lebanon has added to the sense of isolation. Trump’s election has inspired hope in the community that it will attract more members and also more funding for security improvements. 'Maybe it can raise more awareness and maybe some support to help here and help our kids here,' said Yarden Freimann, Trump Heights’ community manager. Ori Kallner, head of the Golan’s regional council, showed off dozens of plots of land, replete with new asphalt roads, lampposts and utility lines, that residents have prepared for future housing developments. 'President Trump’s return to the White House definitely puts the town in the headlines,' he said. Hanging on while war rages nearby Kallner stood next to a metal statue of an eagle and a menorah, symbolizing the United States and Israel, as Israeli warplanes flew overhead. Two explosions from rockets fired from Lebanon punched the hills nearby, and just across the border in Lebanon, plumes of smoke rose into the air from Israeli airstrikes. An enormous sign with the settlement’s name in Hebrew and English gleamed in the sun, while two large sunbaked metal flags of Israel and the United States were faded almost beyond recognition. Surrounded by ashen ruins of villages fled by Syrians in the 1967 war, the town is perched above the Hula Valley, where Israel has amassed tanks, artillery and troops for its fight in Lebanon. Most towns in the valley have been evacuated. Trump Heights sends its kids to a makeshift daycare in a nearby settlement after the government shuttered all schools in the region in the wake of the Oct. 1 invasion of Lebanon. 'We find ourselves hanging by our fingernails to be in our own community, not be evacuated, and on the other hand, we cannot work, we cannot send our kids to any kind of an education system,' said Freimann. Trump Heights is only about 7 miles (12 kilometers) from Lebanon and Syria. Alerts for incoming fire gives residents about 30 seconds' head start to get to a bomb shelter. Trump broke with other leaders on the Golan Heights Israel annexed the Golan, a strategic plateau overlooking northern Israel, in 1981 in a move that is not internationally recognized. That changed in March 2019 when Trump, without notice, tweeted that the U.S. would 'fully recognize' Israel’s control of the territory. His announcement drew widespread condemnation from the international community, which considers the Golan to be occupied Syrian territory and Israel’s settlements to be illegal. The Biden administration left the decision intact, but the U.S. remains the lone country to recognize the Israeli annexation. Kallner said he hopes Trump will now persuade European countries to recognize Israeli sovereignty there. According to Israeli figures, the Golan is home to about 50,000 people — roughly half of them Jewish Israelis and the other half Arab Druze, many of whom still consider themselves Syrians under occupation. Israel has encouraged and promoted settlements in the Golan, and the Druze residents operate farms and a tourism and restaurant sector popular with Israelis. But the area has struggled to develop because of its remoteness, several hours from Israel’s economic center in Tel Aviv. That economic hardship has only worsened during the war as the hospitality sector cratered. On July 28, a rocket killed 12 Druze children on a soccer field in the city of Majdal Shams, about 12 miles (20 kilometers) away. Israel invaded Lebanon months later. In June 2019, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu led an inauguration ceremony for Trump Heights. The U.S. ambassador at the time, David Friedman, noted that the ceremony came days after Trump’s birthday and said: 'I can’t think of a more appropriate and a more beautiful birthday present.' As president, Trump was close with Netanyahu The Golan recognition was among a series of diplomatic gifts that Trump delivered to Israel during his first term. They included recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and moving the American embassy to the contested city, and a series of diplomatic agreements with Arab countries known as the Abraham Accords. He has vowed to bring peace to the tumultuous region during his second term, but has not said how. Netanyahu enjoyed a close relationship with Trump during his first term but ran afoul of the former president when he congratulated Joe Biden on his 2020 victory. The Israeli prime minister announced Tuesday that he was one of the first foreign leaders to call the president-elect and congratulate him on his victory. An official in his office, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal communications, said aides were upbeat and giddy. 'Congratulations on history’s greatest comeback!' the Israeli leader said in a statement. 'Your historic return to the White House offers a new beginning for America and a powerful recommitment to the great alliance between Israel and America.' At Trump Heights, Kallner was optimistic too: 'The Golan community is strong and resilient, and people that want to come and live here are from the same material. I believe we will overcome these challenging times and won’t stop growing.'	https://apnews.com/article/trump-heights-golan-settlement-israel-syria-lebanon-e0ca8d2720524d92f423fbe212354909	2024-11-07T20:04:54-08:00	
Trump victory spurs worry among migrants abroad, but it's not expected to halt migration	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election instantly changed calculations for millions of migrants or potential migrants across the globe. But perhaps not in the way Trump imagined. Trump has pledged to reduce immigration. But by narrowing the already limited legal pathways into the U.S., migrants will just recalibrate their plans and resort in greater numbers to hiring smugglers, experts say. In many cases that will mean turning to organized crime groups that increasingly profit from migrant smuggling. Those potentially affected come from dozens of countries and many have already sold their homes and their possessions to fund the trip. Venezuelans continue arriving at the U.S. southern border in reduced, but still large numbers. Mexicans made up half of U.S. Border Patrol arrests in September. Chinese come through Ecuador and make their way up through the Americas. Senegalese buy multi-stop flights to Nicaragua, then move north. The U.N.’s International Organization for Migration estimates there are around 281 million international migrants in the world, or 3.6% of the global population. An increasing number of people will be displaced for political, economic and violence reasons, and more migrants will seek asylum, according to its annual report. It warns that when people cannot find regular pathways, they start looking for 'irregular channels that are extremely hazardous.' During Trump's first administration, Mexican border cities were saturated with migrants. Cartels preyed on them, kidnapping them, extorting their families for ransoms and forcibly recruiting them into their ranks. There were hundreds of arrivals every day, as well as thousands who were made to wait out the potentially yearslong U.S. asylum application process in Mexico. A U.S. program called CBP One brought some order after it was introduced by the Biden administration in early 2023. Migrants no longer have to come to the border to schedule an appointment and can do it on their smartphones. Once overflowing border shelters have emptied and many families are making every effort to go the legal route. Trump has pledged to end CBP One. He also wants to again restrict refugee resettlement and warned throughout his campaign of mass deportations. While his victory was deflating and worrisome to those en route to the United States, it was not a deal-breaker. On Tuesday night, Bárbara Rodríguez, a 33-year-old Venezuelan, should have been sleeping after walking more than eight miles through southern Mexico's tropical heat with some 2,500 others from at least a dozen countries. Instead, she was watching U.S. election results on her cellphone. Back in Caracas, Rodríguez helped monitor a polling place for the opposition during Venezuela's July election. After President Nicolas Maduro claimed reelection, his supporters began to harass her family. 'Either my family’s lives were going to be at risk or I had to leave the country,' she said. In September, she sold her house and left her three children with her mother. Now her plan of waiting for a CBP One appointment to request asylum at the U.S. border has an expiration date. 'Plans changed. We have until Jan. 20,' she said, referring to inauguration day. She has not ruled out hiring a smuggler, she added. Martha Bárcena, Mexico’s former U.S. ambassador during most of Trump’s first administration, said migrants were the losers from his immigration policies and that could happen again. 'Organized crime is the big beneficiary, because the income from illegal human trafficking is already equal to or greater than the income from drugs,' she said. Estefanía Ramos of Guatemala woke up worried Wednesday in a Ciudad Juarez shelter across from El Paso, Texas. 'We’re trying to figure out what’s going to happen to us,' the 19-year-old said. 'This wasn’t the plan.' She and her husband left Guatemala after a gang threatened to harm him and kidnap her, she said. They have been waiting for three months for a CBP One appointment. Two months ago they had a baby girl. 'If we can keep waiting for an appointment we will,' Ramos said, adding that she doesn’t want to risk an illegal crossing with the baby. On Wednesday in Ciudad Juarez, a few dozen asylum seekers with appointments waited patiently to be called across the international bridge. Gretchen Kuhner, director of IMUMI, a nongovernmental legal services organization in Mexico, was in the southern Mexican city of Tuxtla Gutierrez last week, where she found migrant families with young children living in the streets waiting for CBP One appointments. 'They are getting their cellphones charged every day at some makeshift place on the street so they can check their CBP One appointments ... while they’re breastfeeding and sleeping in a tent without any water,' she said. 'People who need protection are really trying to do it the right way.' Further restrictions on the already difficult process would leave vulnerable populations with few options, said Mark Hetfield, CEO of the U.S.-based refugee support organization HIAS. 'It would mean they have no place to go because there are many, many countries in the hemisphere where there is effectively no asylum system or where even if you could get asylum, you’re not necessarily safe,' he said. And then there's the specter of massive deportations. Trump made a similar threat before and didn't deliver, but there's real concern. Deportations to countries like Cuba and Venezuela could be complicated by icy relations, though Venezuela’s Maduro issued a conciliatory message congratulating Trump Wednesday. Advocates in Haiti on Thursday demanded countries, including the U.S., halt deportations because of the country's domestic crisis. And no country stands to be more impacted than Mexico. There are some 11 million Mexicans living in the U.S., about 5 million of whom don’t have legal status. Mexicans sent home more than $63 billion in remittances last year, mostly from the United States. Mass deportations would shake the finances of millions of families and the Mexican economy would struggle to absorb them. Migrant advocates and shelter directors in Mexico said they've heard of no government plans to deal with large numbers of deportees. Mexican aid groups are 'not in a position to receive that quantity of people and let's be honest, it's civil society that carries on its shoulders most of the humanitarian response toward those who are deported or in transit,' said Rafael Velásquez García, Mexico director for the International Rescue Committee. Mexico needs to prepare itself for all manner of pressures coming from a Trump administration, said Carlos Pérez Ricart, a professor of international relations at Mexican public research center CIDE. 'What Mexico has to accept is that our country is going to be a holding country for migrants, whether they want it or not,' he said. 'Trump is going to deport thousands, if not millions of people and he's going to impede the flow of migrants.' ___ Pesce reported from Ciudad Juarez, Mexico.

Leader of the free world has never been a role Trump has embraced. The world has gotten the message	WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. presidents usually pay lip service at least to being leaders of the free world, at the helm of a mighty democracy and military that allies worldwide can rally around and reasonably depend upon for support in return. Not so under President-elect Donald Trump, a critic of many existing U.S. alliances, whose win of a second term this week had close European partners calling for a new era of self-reliance not dependent on American goodwill. 'We must not delegate forever our security to America,' French President Emmanuel Macron said at a European summit Thursday. Based on Trump’s first term and campaign statements, the U.S. will become less predictable, more chaotic, colder to allies and warmer to some strongmen, and much more transactional in picking friends globally than before. America’s place in world affairs and security will fundamentally change, both critics and supporters of Trump say. His backers say he simply will be choosier about U.S. alliances and battles than previous presidents. When it comes to the U.S. role on the world stage, no more talk of the country as leader of the free world, said Fiona Hill, a former Russia adviser to Trump and preceding U.S. presidents. Maybe 'the free-for-all world, his leadership?' Hill suggested in a recent European Council for Foreign Relations podcast. 'I mean, what exactly is it that we’re going to be leading here?' Trump, with varying degrees of consistency, has been critical of NATO and support for Ukraine and Taiwan, two democracies under threat that depend on U.S. military support to counter Russia and China. Trump has shown little interest in the longstanding U.S. role as anchor of strategic alliances with European and Indo-Pacific democracies. Before the election, partners and adversaries already were reevaluating their security arrangements in preparation for Trump's possible return. European allies in particular bolstered efforts to build up their own and regional defenses, rather than rely on the U.S. as the anchor of NATO, the mutual-defense pact both Trump and running mate JD Vance have spoken of scathingly. Within hours of Trump’s win over Vice President Kamala Harris this week, defense chiefs of France and Germany scheduled talks to address the impact. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Russian President Vladimir Putin have appeared to shape war strategies with hopes that Trump could allow them freer rein. Victoria Coates, a security adviser to Trump in his first term, rejects any portrayal of him as isolationist. 'I think he is extremely judicious about the application of the American military, and about potentially getting embroiled in conflicts we can’t resolve,' she said recently on a security podcast. As evidence of his engagement globally, Coates pointed to Trump's support of Israel as it wages wars against Iranian-backed militant groups in Gaza and Lebanon. She called Iran's nuclear program the 'greatest concern' abroad and suggested its progress toward the possibility of nuclear weapons meant Trump might have to act more forcefully than in his first term, when he surged sanctions on Iran in what he called a 'maximum pressure' campaign. Trump, long an open admirer of Putin, has been most consistent in pointing to U.S. support of Ukraine for possible policy change. Philip Breedlove, a former Air Force general and top NATO commander, said he can see both positive expectations and deep concerns for Ukraine and NATO in the next four years under Trump. While Trump’s NATO rhetoric during his first administration was often harsh, it didn’t lead to any actual U.S. troop reductions in Europe or decreased support for the alliance, Breedlove said. And 23 NATO nations are spending at least 2% of their gross domestic product on defense, compared with 10 in 2020 — a showing that now negates a persistent Trump complaint. More concerning, Breedlove said, is Trump’s vow to end the war in Ukraine right away. While that goal is noble, 'ending wars on terms that are appropriate is one thing. Capitulating to an enemy in order to stop a conflict is a different thing. And that’s what worries me,' Breedlove said. He and others have warned that an end to the war that gives Russia additional territory in Ukraine will set a bad precedent. European nations fear it will embolden Putin to come after them. So do supporters of Taiwan, a democratically run island that China has said it will one day annex, by force if necessary. Trump has ranged from saying Taiwan should pay the U.S. for its defense support to claiming he could charm Chinese President Xi Jinping out of threatening Taiwan. 'One thing that does make me nervous about Trump vis-à-vis the Taiwan Strait is his reliance on unpredictability, his reliance on being something of a chaotic actor in a situation that is finely balanced,' said Paul Nadeau, an assistant professor of international affairs and political science at Temple University's Japan campus. The situation is one 'that requires a profound reading of very subtle signals between Taiwan, between the United States, between China,' Nadeau said. The world that Trump will face has changed, too, with Russia, North Korea, Iran and China further consolidating in a loose, opportunistic alliance to counter the West, and particularly the U.S. In places where the U.S. has withdrawn, Russia, China and at times Iran have been quick to extend their influence, including in the Middle East. During his first term, Trump repeatedly vowed to pull all U.S. forces out of Iraq and Syria, at times blindsiding Pentagon officials with sudden statements and tweets that left officials fumbling for answers. A backlash from some Republican lawmakers and counterproposals by U.S. military leaders slowed those plans, including suggestions that some U.S. troops should remain in Syria to protect oil sites. The U.S. still has about 900 troops in Syria, which could plunge under Trump. The number of U.S. forces in Iraq is already dwindling based on a new agreement between the Biden administration and Baghdad. The plan would wrap up the U.S.-led coalition’s mission to fight the Islamic State group by next year but likely shift at least some U.S. troops to northern Iraq to support the fight against IS in Syria. Trump's first term — followed by Joe Biden's foreign policy increasingly becoming consumed by unsuccessful efforts to reach cease-fires in the Middle East — already have spurred allies to speak of building up their own military strength and that of smaller regional alliances for security. 'Factored into calculations is there’s going to be less United States than before' on the world stage, Hill said.

Runway fire breaks out at Sydney Airport after emergency landing	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — An engine failure on a passenger plane taking off from Sydney, Australia on Friday prompted the aircraft to circle before a safe emergency landing, the airline Qantas said. At the same time, a grass fire broke out along one side of a runway, Sydney Airport said in a statement. It was not known if the two events were linked. The fire has been brought under control, but flight delays are expected. Qantas did not say how many passengers were on board the twin jet Boeing 737-800 bound for Brisbane when the engine failed with a loud bang. No injuries were reported. 'We understand this would have been a distressing experience for customers and we will be contacting all customers this afternoon to provide support,' Qantas Chief Pilot Captain Richard Tobiano said in a statement. 'We will also be conducting an investigation into what caused the engine issue.' Sydney Airport said its main runway was still in service. The grass fire broke out along the side of a parallel runway which was being inspected before it could be used again, the airport said in a statement. It said delays were expected and advised travelers to check their flight's status with the airline. Mark Willacy, an Australian Broadcasting Corp. reporter, told the news outlet that an off-duty pilot who was a passenger on the plane had helped the Qantas pilot during the emergency landing. A flight tracking website shows the aircraft was airborne for about 20 minutes, flying in circles above the airport.	https://apnews.com/article/sydney-airport-fire-qantas-plane-engine-failure-australia-fd1e7095e0242073de7f272da5106ec7	2024-11-07T19:47:51-08:00	
The Temple of Satan gains ground in Chile as faith in traditional religions wanes	SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) — It’s Friday night in Downtown Santiago, the capital of Chile, and a group of 15 people gather around a table, sharing a bottle of wine as the smell of tobacco and incense fill the air. Black candles burn on top of an altar decorated with chalices and knives. The members of the Temple of Satan are about to start a ritual. Five years after the Satanic Temple of the United States made headlines — and unleashed a wave of panic — when it was designated a church, a similar organization in Chile, a conservative country where half of its population of 18 million identifies as Catholic, is asking the government to recognize them legally as a religious association. Scholars, believers and residents consulted by The Associated Press note that Chile, where a long-lasting tradition of Catholicism has played a leading role in public discussions, is experiencing a crisis of faith, following revelations of multiple sexual abuse scandals within the Catholic church over the years. 'These types of organizations now feel that they have greater support to challenge what was virtually impossible before,' said Luis Bahamondes, a professor at the Center for Judaic Studies at the University of Chile. And that’s because, 'until very recently, the Catholic Church enjoyed an unprecedented power. It had an opinion on everything: politics, economics, geopolitics, sexuality and education.' Despite its name, The Temple of Satan: Satanists and Luciferians of Chile does not embark on sacrifices nor asks its congregants to worship the devil. Among its 100 members are people who work as publicists, firefighters, police officers, lawyers and psychologists, who have found in the organization a way to defy moral norms, dogmas and religious impositions. While they embrace the term Satanist, they don’t revere or believe in Satan. Instead, they worship rationality, individualism, pleasure and the mundane life. Rather than gods, they praise humankind. 'You are the owner of your present and future, there is no God that makes decisions for you,' said Haborym, a spokesperson for the group, during a walk through tombs and mausoleums at the General Cemetery of Santiago. He notes that the figure of Satan is purely symbolic and their rituals are performed 'to bring out the emotions and leave the intellect aside.' Haborym and other members of the Temple of Satan in Chile spoke on condition their real names not be used, particularly with many hold public-facing jobs, citing growing threats. While Hollywood movies like 'Rosemary’s Baby' and TV series such as 'True Detective' helped to portray the idea of Satanists as linked to sacrifice, evil, pain and death, modern groups like Chile’s Temple of Satan are strongly against animal abuse, prohibit the affiliation of people with criminal records, see pleasures as a delight rather than a sin, and do not express their opinions unless asked. 'We don’t want people killing in the name of Satan,' said Haborym. In order to join Chile’s Temple of Satan, applicants are requested to go through a lengthy process that includes filling out a form, showing proof of not having a criminal record, being interviewed by a special commission and, finally, being evaluated by a psychologist. Once they are accepted, members can choose a new name — normally that of a demon or fallen angel — with which they will be identified inside the Temple and among other associates. Founded in 2021, Chile’s Temple of Satan has 100 members, and more than 400 people applied to join in the past few weeks, said Haborym. The interest spiked at the end of July, when the group formally requested the country’s Ministry of Justice to legally recognize it as a religious association. A media frenzy followed, unleashing a heated debate and causing a stir among Chile’s main religious denominations. 'The history of Satanism is well known (and) it has often been the cause of tragedies,' the leaders of several churches in Chile, including the Catholic, Anglican, Jewish and Evangelical, said in a joint statement. Following the steps of the Church of Satan founded in 1966 by Anton Szandor LaVey, modern Satanists praise skepticism and logic over celestial or supernatural beings. Its followers are free to formulate their own beliefs, rites and spiritual practices. Many self-described Satanists and Luciferians are atheists, others are witches or believe in the power of magic. 'We do accept that there are certain bases, both academic and esoteric, that give meaning to our existence and reality,' said Azazel, who quit Judaism four years ago and, one year later, founded the Temple of Satan of Chile. His words resonate in the darkness of the chamber and are interspersed with chants, clapping, mantras and readings of passages from the Satanic Bible and the Bible of the Adversary, the main guidelines of the group. Just like Azazel, others have turned to the Temple of Satan out of disappointment with traditional religions. The new congregants include not only occultists and esotericists, but also Catholics, Jews, Protestants and Evangelicals. 'In Satanism there are no solutions or absolute truths. You are your own god and you create your own reality,' said Kali Ma, a dentistry student who was born and raised in a Jehovah’s Witness family. 'If we compare both, Jehovah’s Witnesses are the real sect,' she said. 'They don’t let you do certain things, they tell you how to dress, what to do, how to behave, whether or not to grow a beard.' Néstor da Costa, an expert in secularism and religion at the Catholic University of Uruguay, said the influx of people seeking answers through different perspectives might be linked to the search for less dogmatic approaches. 'It may be a readjustment of the religious side of people who leave Catholicism but continue to believe in something,' he said. It is unclear if the Chilean government will legally recognize the Temple of Satan as a legitimate religious association, but its very existence has already helped to spark a discussion that until recently was unthinkable in this conservative society. Demanding recognition is the ultimate expression of everything praised by Satanic aesthetics: the rebellion against the status quo and the breakup with deep-rooted traditions. 'We comply with everything that is requested of us as a religious entity,' says Haborym. 'So there would be no reason to reject us beyond the fact that we’re a controversial figure.' ___ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/chile-satan-temple-religious-recognition-2bf57ed268b6f9d3056e20ccab985a6e	2024-11-07T19:36:35-08:00	
Typhoon floods villages, rips off roofs and damages 2 domestic airports in northern Philippines	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Typhoon Yinxing battered the northern Philippines with floods and landslides before blowing away from the country on Friday, leaving two airports damaged and aggravating a calamity caused by back-to-back storms that hit in recent weeks. There were no immediate reports of casualties from Yinxing, the 13th major storm to hit the disaster-prone Southeast Asian archipelago this year. The typhoon, locally called Marce, was last tracked over the South China Sea about 100 kilometers (62 miles) west of the northern Philippine province of Ilocos Norte with sustained winds of up to 150 kilometers (93 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 205 kph (127 mph), according to government forecasters. It is expected to weaken further before hitting Vietnam. The typhoon flooded villages, toppled trees and electricity poles, and damaged houses and buildings in Cagayan province, where Yinxing made landfall Thursday afternoon, provincial officials said. More than 40,000 villagers were evacuated to safer ground in the province. In the northernmost island province of Batanes, Gov. Marilou Cayco said Yinxing’s fierce winds and rain blew away roofs of houses and damaged seaports and two domestic airport terminals. More details of damage, including in two northern mountain towns hit by landslides, were expected after provinces battered by the typhoon complete an assessment, officials said. The new damage will complicate recovery efforts from two powerful storms that lashed the northern region in recent weeks. Tropical Storm Trami and Typhoon Kong-rey left at least 151 people dead in the Philippines and affected nearly 9 million others, mostly in the northern and central provinces. More than 14 billion pesos ($241 million) in rice, corn and other crops and infrastructure were damaged. Trami dumped one to two months’ worth of rain in just 24 hours in some regions. In the hardest-hit province of Batangas, south of Manila, at least 61 people died in floods and landslides. More than 630,000 people were still displaced due to Trami and Kong-rey as of Thursday, officials said, including 172,000 who remained in emergency shelters as Yinxing blew across the country's mountainous north. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. decided not to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Peru next week to focus on recovery efforts, Communications Secretary Cesar Chavez said. In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest recorded tropical cyclones, left more than 7,300 people dead or missing, flattened entire villages and caused ships to run aground and smash into houses in the central Philippines. The archipelago also lies in a region often hit by earthquakes and has more than a dozen active volcanoes, making it one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world.	https://apnews.com/article/philippines-typhoon-yinxing-51b689a712c6bb793cc7d08929eb3143	2024-11-07T19:31:38-08:00
