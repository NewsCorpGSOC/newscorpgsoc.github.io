Dominican Republic will deport up to 10,000 Haitians a week, citing an 'excess' of immigrants	SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) — The Dominican Republic announced Wednesday that it would start massive deportations of Haitians living illegally in the country, expelling up to 10,000 of them a week. Government spokesman Homero Figueroa told reporters that the government took the decision after noticing an 'excess' of Haitian migrants in the Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti. Figueroa said officials have seen an increase in Haitian migrants as a U.N.-backed mission in Haiti to fight gang violence flounders. He said authorities also agreed to strengthen border surveillance and control, but he did not provide details. Last year, the Dominican Republic deported more than 174,000 people it says are Haitians, and in the first half of the year, it has expelled at least 67,000 more. Activists have long criticized the administration of President Luis Abinader for what they say are ongoing human rights violations of Haitians and those of Haitian descent born in the Dominican Republic. Abinader has denied any mistreatment. Wednesday's announcement comes a week after Abinader announced at the U.N. General Assembly that he would take 'drastic measures' if the mission in Haiti fails. It is led by nearly 400 police officers from Kenya, backed by nearly two dozen police and soldiers from Jamaica and two senior military officers from Belize. The U.S. has warned that the mission lacks personnel and funding as it pushes for a U.N. peacekeeping mission instead. Gangs in Haiti control 80% of the Port-au-Prince capital, and the violence has left nearly 700,000 Haitians homeless in recent years, while thousands of others have fled the country. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/dominican-republic-haiti-immigrants-deportations-25a82fdefe7a51bff32e8215d10089f4	2024-10-02T12:58:46-07:00	
Five Chinese nationals charged with covering up midnight visit to Michigan military site	DETROIT (AP) — U.S. authorities charged five Chinese nationals with lying and trying to cover their tracks, more than a year after they were confronted in the dark near a remote Michigan military site where thousands of people had gathered for summer drills. The five, who were University of Michigan students at the time, were not charged for what happened at Camp Grayling in August 2023. Rather they are accused of misleading investigators about the trip and conspiring to clear their phones of photos, according to a criminal complaint filed in federal court. The FBI noted in the Tuesday court filing that there have been instances of college students from China taking photos of vital defense sites in the United States. There was nothing in the file revealing the whereabouts of the five men. 'The defendants are not in custody. Should they come into contact with U.S. authorities, they will be arrested and face these charges,' Gina Balaya, a spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Detroit, said Wednesday. In summer 2023, the five were confronted after midnight near a lake by a sergeant major with the Utah National Guard. One said, 'We are media,' before they collected their belongings and agreed to leave the area, the FBI said. The FBI learned that the men had booked a room at a nearby motel a week before they were spotted outside Camp Grayling, 200 miles (321.8 kilometers) north of Detroit. Four months later, one of the men was interviewed by border officers at the Detroit airport before traveling to South Korea and China. He told investigators that he and others had taken a trip to northern Michigan 'to see shooting stars,' the FBI said. A check of his external hard drive revealed two images of military vehicles taken on the same night of the encounter with the National Guard officer, the FBI said. The other four men were interviewed last March after arriving in Chicago on a flight from Iceland. They acknowledged being in northern Michigan in August 2023, but they said it was to see a meteor shower, the FBI said. They mentioned the National Guard officer but referred to him only as 'the soldier,' a camper or 'nice guy,' according to the criminal complaint. The men last December communicated on WeChat about clearing photos from their cameras and phones, investigators said. The FBI said all five men graduated last spring from the University of Michigan. They were part of a joint program between the university and the Shanghai Jiao Tong University in Shanghai, China. In 2020, two Chinese nationals who were pursuing master's degrees at the University of Michigan were sentenced to prison for illegally photographing sites at a naval air station in Key West, Florida. ___ Follow Ed White at https://twitter.com/edwritez	https://apnews.com/article/chinese-students-michigan-military-camp-0f757785eb5eecb9e92ac89f99e96c2d	2024-10-02T10:55:11-07:00	
Days after being suspended Emi Martinez has Prince William celebrating in the Champions League	Days after being suspended by FIFA, Argentina goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez produced heroics in front of the watching Prince William as Aston Villa sealed another famous win against Bayern Munich. The Prince of Wales was among the ecstatic crowd at Villa Park to watch his beloved soccer team win 1-0 in the Champions League on Wednesday. Substitute Jhon Duran struck a 79th-minute winner, but two brilliant late saves from Martinez held off a fightback from six-time European champion Bayern to leave William celebrating. 'This is the loudest Villa Park that I’ve heard since I joined the club. That’s for sure. It was hurting my ears at some point,' said Martinez, who was suspended last week by FIFA for two upcoming international matches because of unspecified incidents in Argentina’s World Cup qualifiers against Chile and Colombia. 'I love playing here. I love the fans. This is a win for them.' Martinez denied Serge Gnabry in a one-on-one in stoppage time and then acrobatically kept out Harry Kane's header. Villa's win came more than 42 years after beating Bayern 1-0 to lift the European Cup in 1982, the same year William was born. This was only the second time the teams had met. It was also Villa's first home game in European soccer's elite competition since losing to Juventus as defending champion in the quarterfinals in 1983. William, who is a lifelong Villa fan, met members of the European Cup winning team and posed for pictures before the match. '42 years on, our 1982 European Cup winning legends are here on an historic night,' he wrote on X. 'Ready for the first game on home turf in this year’s European adventure...' William, who is also patron of the English Football Association, sat in an executive box, dressed casually in a dark blue button-up coat over a maroon sweater and blue shirt — Villa's colors. He was seen hugging another fan sat with him as the home crowd savored its latest triumph over German giant Bayern. He also was up and cheering in the first half when Pau Torres appeared to have fired Villa into a 23rd-minute lead only for the goal to be ruled out by VAR for offside. There was no reprieve for Bayern when Duran struck to continue his remarkable scoring record this season. Coming on in the 70th, he lashed in a first time shot from around 25 yards to beat Bayern keeper Manuel Neuer. It was the Colombian forward's sixth goal in nine games this season, having come on as a substitute in eight of them. Villa now has back-to-back wins in the revamped Champions League. Defeat for Bayern was its first under manager Vincent Kompany, who took over in the offseason. ___ James Robson is at https://twitter.com/jamesalanrobson ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer	https://apnews.com/article/prince-william-aston-villa-champions-league-e6be59fbf4a332f48ad07a7de1a7ac0c	2024-10-02T10:16:48-07:00	
US bans new types of goods from China over allegations of forced labor	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Department of Homeland Security announced Wednesday that it would ban the import of goods from a Chinese steel manufacturer and a Chinese maker of artificial sweetener, accusing both of being involved in the use of forced labor from China's far-west region of Xinjiang. The action broadens the scope of the U.S. effort to counter products from entering the country that the government says are tied to human rights abuses. The additions to the entity list under the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act marks the first time a China-based steel company or aspartame sweetener business have been targeted by U.S. law enforcement, DHS said. 'Today’s actions reaffirm our commitment to eliminating forced labor from U.S. supply chains and upholding our values of human rights for all,' said Robert Silvers, undersecretary of Homeland Security for policy. 'No sector is off-limits. We will continue to identify entities across industries and hold accountable those who seek to profit from exploitation and abuse.' The federal law that President Joe Biden signed at the end of 2021 followed allegations of human rights abuses by Beijing against members of the ethnic Uyghur group and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang. The Chinese government has refuted the claims as lies and defended its practice and policy in Xinjiang as fighting terror and ensuring stability. The new approach marked a shift in the U.S. trade relationship with China to increasingly take into account national security and human rights. Beijing has accused the U.S. of using human rights as a pretext to suppress China’s economic growth. Enforcement of the law initially targeted solar products, tomatoes, cotton and apparel, but over the last several months, the U.S. government has identified new sectors for enforcement, including aluminum and seafood. 'That’s just a reflection of the fact that sadly, forced labor continues to taint all too many supply chains,' Silvers told a trade group in June when marking the two-year anniversary of the creation of the entity list. 'So our enforcement net has actually been quite wide from an industry-sector perspective.' He said the law 'changed the dynamic in terms of putting the onus on importers to know their own supply chains' and that its enforcement had showed that the U.S. could 'do the right thing' without halting normal trade. Since June 2022, the entity list has grown to a total of 75 companies accused of using forced labor in Xinjiang or sourcing materials tied to that forced labor, Homeland Security said. Baowu Group Xinjiang Bayi Iron and Steel Co. Ltd and Changzhou Guanghui Food Ingredients Co. Ltd. were the Chinese companies newly added to the list.	https://apnews.com/article/china-forced-labor-united-states-trade-8ec1637835bc9388c84796f77f218c2c	2024-10-02T09:31:27-07:00	
Biden won't support a strike on Iran nuclear sites as Israel weighs response to Iran missile attack	JOINT BASE ANDREWS, Md. (AP) — President Joe Biden said Wednesday he will not support an Israeli strike on sites related to Tehran’s nuclear program in response to Iran's missile attack on Israel. 'The answer is no,' Biden told reporters when asked if he would support such retaliation after Iran fired about 180 missiles at Israel on Tuesday. Biden’s comments came after he and fellow Group of Seven leaders from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom spoke by telephone about coordinating new sanctions against Iran. The U.S. and allies are scrambling to keep the Mideast conflict — sparked by Iran-backed Hamas militants' in Gaza's Oct. 7 attack on Israel — from spreading further. They are urging Israel to show restraint as it weighs retaliation against Iran for Tuesday's attack. Israel is now carrying out what it has described as limited ground operations across its northern border with Lebanon to dig out Hezbollah, another Iran-backed group, after carrying out a series of massive air strikes that killed the group's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and decimated its leadership. Last month, thousands of explosives hidden in pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah detonated, killing dozens of people and maiming thousands, including many civilians. Israel is widely believed to be behind the attack Biden stated his opposition to Israel hitting Iranian nuclear facilities as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu weighed a range of options in how to respond to Tuesday’s attack. It was the second such attack by Iran on Israel in less than six months. Israel's choices range from a largely symbolic strike — similar to how Israel responded after Iran launched a barrage of missiles and attack drones in April — to hitting oil facilities and other infrastructure. Targeting Iran’s controversial nuclear program is seen as perhaps the most provocative action that Israel could take. It's one that the Democratic president believes could further enflame a Mideast conflict that he already worries could develop into a broader regional conflict. The White House said in a statement that G7 leaders 'unequivocally condemned Iran’s attack against Israel' and that Biden reaffirmed America's 'full solidarity and support to Israel and its people.' Biden added that he supports Israel's right to defend itself and 'there are things that have to be done' in response to the Iranian barrage. He said he expected sanctions from the G7 nations to be announced soon. 'We will be discussing with the Israelis what they are going to do,' Biden told reporters before heading to the Carolinas to see the devastation caused by Hurricane Helene. 'All seven of us agree that they have a right to respond.' The office of Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni said in a statement that the leaders expressed 'strong concern for the escalation of these last hours' and emphasized that 'a conflict on a regional scale is in no one’s interest.' Italy holds the rotating presidency of the G7 group of industrialized democracies. Biden said that he planned to speak with Netanyahu 'relatively soon.' Biden's administration has signaled that it is urging Israel to display restraint in how it responds to Iran’s missile attack, which Biden said was 'ineffective and defeated.' The U.S. military helped Israel defend against the attack that Iran carried out in retaliation for the killing of Tehran-backed leaders of Lebanese Hezbollah. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell said there 'must be a return message' to Iran. He said the U.S. and Israel officials continue to discuss their response. 'At the same time, I think we recognize as important as the response of some kind should be, there is a recognition that the region is really balancing on a knife’s edge,' Campbell said at a forum hosted by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Washington think tank. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke on Wednesday with his counterparts Britain, France, Germany, and Italy to discuss the situation in the Middle East. ___ Associated Press writer Colleen Barry in Rome and White House Correspondent Zeke Miller in Washington contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/biden-israel-iran-hezbollah-nuclear-sites-846c8779b2b95a3bebcf955c4e69cf6c	2024-10-02T08:56:59-07:00

Vatican bank fires newlywed couple for violating a new workplace marriage ban	ROME (AP) — The Vatican bank confirmed Wednesday it has fired two employees on the grounds that their recent wedding violates a new ban on workplace marriages. The Institute for Religious Works said it took the 'difficult decision' to fire the couple, who have three children, after neither one agreed to resign voluntarily to allow the other to continue working. Their attorney, Laura Sgro, immediately challenged the firings in a letter to the bank chiefs and warned she would take the case to the Vatican civil court within 30 days. Sgro said the bank's notification of dismissal was 'null, illegitimate and gravely harmful of the fundamental rights of people and employees, and therefore devoid of any effect.' The couple had met at the IOR while working in different departments, and had informed the bank of their plans to marry in February, Sgro said. In May, a new personnel regulation went into effect barring workplace marriages. The bank said it in no way meant to question the right of employees to get married – a sacrament Francis frequently urges young couples to undertake in the face of dwindling numbers of Catholic weddings. But the bank said it needed to avoid any possible conflicts of interest in a small bank with just 100 employees in one location, and ensure impartiality in its operations. 'The formation of a married couple among the employees is in fact blatantly contradictory to the current regulations within the institute, the primary objective of which is to avoid the reputational risk of accusations of familism and consequently ensure impartial treatment among employees,' the IOR said in a statement. The couple had appealed to Pope Francis, seeking a dispensation in the enforcement of the new regulation, which went into effect once wedding plans were already under way and the official Catholic announcement made, Sgro said. They received no reply. They were married in August and on Oct. 1 were notified that they no longer fulfilled the requirement to be bank employees, and told to turn in their Vatican ID cards and return their IOR bank cards, Sgro said in a statement. Employment at the Vatican is often highly sought-after by Romans, since it usually involves income tax-free salary and benefits that can include below market-rate housing and access to the Vatican's health service and tax-free supermarket, department store, gas station and pharmacy. The Vatican bank has long been mired in scandal but has spent the past decade cleaning up its books and ridding itself of its reputation as an offshore tax haven. Years of reform have slimmed down its client list to Vatican offices, employees, religious congregations and embassies. It currently has some 5.4 billion euros in assets under management and reported 30 million euros in net profits last year. The bank had previously donated around 50 million euros a year of its profits to the pope to pay for the Vatican bureaucracy, but profits have fallen in recent years.	https://apnews.com/article/vatican-bank-pope-marriage-ban-230bdf13d30da06a6599ee9281a24b8b	2024-10-02T06:32:33-07:00	
More than 100 people missing after boat capsizes in northern Nigeria	ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — More than 100 people, mostly women and children, were missing after an overloaded boat bringing them back from an Islamic festival at night capsized in northwestern Nigeria, authorities said Wednesday. The locally made boat, whose capacity was 100 passengers, had about 300 people onboard along the Niger River when it overturned in Niger state’s Mokwa district on Monday night, according to the Niger State Emergency Management Agency. Such boat disasters are common in Nigeria, especially in remote communities where the lack of good roads leaves many with no alternative routes. This is the fourth tragedy involving more than 100 passengers in northern Nigeria since mid-2023, many of them never accounted for. Local media reported that 11 bodies, nine men and two women, have been recovered from the river so far. At least 150 people had been rescued by Wednesday morning amid a frantic search operation that is being supported by local divers and volunteers, according to Abdullahi Baba-Arah, head of Niger state's emergency services. 'The boat was not supposed to carry more than 100 persons, but there were almost 300 people on it. And that was what resulted in the breakage of the boat,' said Salihu Garba, director of relief and rehabilitation at the state emergency services. Experts say most of the boat disasters in Nigeria in recent years increasingly point to regulatory failures and are often attributed to overloading or poorly maintained boats.	https://apnews.com/article/nigeria-boat-capsizing-niger-river-7f69c5bbde8b4c0c5eb27dc1c543bb60	2024-10-02T06:29:38-07:00	
4 Russian journalists accused of working for a Navalny group go on trial in Moscow	TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — Four Russian journalists went on trial in Moscow on Wednesday after being accused of working for an anti-corruption group founded by the late Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny, which was designated by authorities as an extremist organization in 2021. Antonina Favorskaya, Artyom Kriger, Sergey Karelin and Konstantin Gabov were arrested earlier this year and charged with involvement with an extremist group, a criminal offense punishable by up to six years in prison. All four have rejected the charges. The trial, which is being held behind closed doors, is the latest step in the Kremlin's unrelenting crackdown on dissent that has reached unprecedented levels after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine more than two years ago. The authorities have targeted opposition figures, independent journalists, rights activists and ordinary Russians critical of the Kremlin with criminal and misdemeanor charges, jailing hundreds and prompting thousands to leave the country, fearing prosecution. The four journalists were accused of working with Navalny's Foundation for Fighting Corruption, which was designated as extremist and outlawed by the Russian authorities in 2021. That designation has been widely seen as politically motivated. Navalny was President Vladimir Putin's fiercest and most prominent foe and relentlessly campaigned against official corruption in Russia. In February, Navalny died in a remote Arctic prison while serving a 19-year sentence on a number of charges, including running an extremist group, which he had rejected as politically driven. Favorskaya and Kriger worked with SotaVision, an independent Russian news outlet that covers protests and political trials. Gabov is a freelance producer who has worked for multiple organizations, including Reuters. Karelin is a freelance video journalist, he has done work for Western media outlets, including The Associated Press. As they were led into the courtroom on Wednesday, a crowd of supporters greeted them with applause. In the courtroom, the four smiled at their loved ones from a glass defendant's cage. Addressing reporters from behind the glass, Kriger cast the case against him and his fellow journalists as a cautionary tale and urged journalists still in Russia to leave the country: 'It is not a joke, any person can be charged with anything.' Favorskaya, in turn, spoke about hope: 'Everything that is happening now, the darkness that surrounds us, it is not forever, and we will definitely see the country that Alexei (Navalny) dreamed of, we will definitely live in a country where rights and freedoms will be (respected) and journalists and other people will not be jailed for their views.' Shortly after the hearing began, the judge ordered to hold the proceedings behind closed doors upon a request from the prosecution, even though the defense objected to it.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-crackown-journalists-navalny-trial-df7e06de5c8e76634ece67c2139af6ff	2024-10-02T06:11:47-07:00	
The Latest: Trio of crises loom over final the campaign's final stretch	In a debate that evoked a calmer era in American politics, Tim Walz and JD Vance went after each other’s running mates Tuesday and sought to shore up their campaigns’ vulnerabilities at a time of renewed fears of a regional war in the Middle East and sadness over devastation from Hurricane Helene. Meanwhile, those new trials — along with a dockworkers strike that threatens the U.S. economy — are looming over the final weeks of the presidential campaign and could help shape the public mood as voters decide between Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump. Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: Harris and Biden are fanning out across the Southeast amid Helene's devastation Over the past four years, President Joe Biden has jetted off to survey damage and console victims after tornadoes, wildfires and tropical storms. It’s not a role Kamala Harris has played as vice president. But on Wednesday, they'll both fan out across the Southeast to grapple with the damage from Hurricane Helene, seeking to demonstrate commitment and competence in helping devastated communities after Donald Trump’s false claims about their administration’s response. Biden is heading to North and South Carolina, while Harris is going to Georgia. Harris’ stop will also serve as a political test in the midst of a humanitarian crisis. She’s trying to step into the role for which Biden is best known — showing the empathy Americans expect in times of tragedy — in the closing stretch of her campaign for president. Pennsylvania town grapples with Trump assassination attempt ahead of his return Former President Donald Trump is going back to Butler, Pennsylvania, where the world saw him pump his fist and beseech followers to 'fight,' even as blood streaked his face from a would-be assassin’s bullet. In announcing his return, the current Republican nominee said he planned to 'celebrate a unifying vision for America’s future in an event like the world has never seen before.' The question is: Is Butler ready? While many are predicting a large crowd to hear Trump speak back at the very Farm Show property where a bullet grazed his right ear on July 13, there's also apprehension in town, along with a sense that Butler is still healing.	https://apnews.com/article/harris-trump-vance-walz-election-f0400b64e7e632e39e0704b07b415b48	2024-10-02T03:27:41-07:00	
Are LGBTQ Jews welcome in Orthodox communities? This is how they are building spaces of their own	It was a heart-wrenching choice. But when Daniel Gammerman decided to never set foot back in an Orthodox synagogue, he thought of it as an act of love. Not toward the Jewish community he was born into, but to himself. 'A synagogue is a spiritual place, but it’s also a community place,' said Gammerman, 47, from his home in Miami. 'If I have to basically check at the door half of my identity in order to come in, I don’t feel that’s welcoming enough for me.' Dozens of LGBTQ+ Jews like him have struggled to find support and acceptance within their Orthodox communities. Most were raised with little knowledge of what being gay or queer meant. They just felt different, but found it hard to ask their rabbis: 'This is who I am, is there still room for me here?' 'The way it mostly works is invisibility,' Gammerman said. 'There’s no addressing the existence of LGBT people among us. And, whenever you hear something about it, of course it’s negative.' He can’t put his finger on a specific date in which he realized he was gay. But he remembers clearly what happened to him when the news got out. 'I used to get enormous texts from different people trying to explain to me how this was wrong,' Gammerman said. 'It was a bombardment of people trying to fix me.' Grandson to Eastern European Jews who fled during World War II, Gammerman was born in Brazil. He moved to the U.S. after finishing high school in the 1990s and continued his studies at a Jewish Orthodox university. At age 21, he got married. He and his wife — who he still thinks of as a friend — raised four children together. 'We built a perfect family,' he said. 'I checked all the boxes of what a nice Jewish Orthodox family is supposed to be.' Afraid to destroy his future and his children’s lives, he shut down his feelings for years, until he could do it no more. He initially traveled to Brazil and met with a therapist who counseled gay men in heterosexual marriages. That helped, Gammerman said, but something was missing. What about his life within an Orthodox religious community that didn’t even acknowledge that LGBTQ+ people exist? Embracing his true identity felt easier after meeting Steven Greenberg, an openly gay rabbi who founded Eshel, a U.S.-based organization focused on connecting LGBTQ+ Orthodox Jewish communities. According to Miryam Kabakov, Eshel's executive director, most of the people who reach out share similar concerns: I’m coming out and I’ve been part of this community my whole life. Can I still belong? What will happen to me now? Can you find a rabbi who can help me? 'We guide them toward religious leaders who will tell them that there’s still a place for them,' Kabakov said. 'That they still have the religious obligations and expectations that they’ve always had and that they should stay true to their heart and their tradition if that’s what they want.' Ely Winkler, a 37-year-old LGBTQ+ Orthodox Jew from Brooklyn, will soon be back at an Orthodox synagogue after years of distancing himself from his community. 'After the war broke out between Israel and Gaza, I felt a deeper calling,' he said. 'I didn’t feel strong enough to stand up for myself, for my beliefs, and I knew that I needed to strengthen my Judaism, to remember who I was.' Abrielle Fuerst, 32, moved from Texas to Philadelphia six years ago. Eshel helped her to connect with a local rabbi and an inclusive synagogue. 'Here it’s not: ‘Oh, come because you are Jewish and gay, we’ll accept you.’ It's just: ‘Hello, you’re Jewish, thanks for being in this space and it’s nice to meet you.’' One of Eshel’s projects, named the 'Welcoming Shuls,' enlists more than 200 rabbis who work across North America to make their synagogues hospitable for LGBTQ+ people. Many of them consent to being publicly identified; others ask to keep a low profile, foreseeing hostile reactions within their Orthodox communities. 'A lot of rabbis are very afraid to be public because they’ll get ostracized,' Kabakov said. 'But we know they’re there.' The group also counsels Orthodox LGBTQ+ Jews who wish to keep a distance from their religion. 'People who don’t want to be religious anymore are torn up about it,' Kabakov said. 'But we try to help them through the struggle and let them know that they can be gay and be religious. It might be hard to find a place, but we’re working on that.' Gammerman has tried to go back to Orthodox synagogues since he came out. Until now, none in Miami have made him feel truly accepted. 'I’ve tried many times, but it’s like wearing a costume,' he said. 'At some point I was able to live with that. But the more you accept yourself, the more you love yourself, you just cannot do it.' His Orthodox community did not prevent him from attending religious services after he came out, but rejection was still there. People stopped greeting him, and he was no longer allowed to officiate services at his synagogue. Once, during a speech, the rabbi looked at him and said: 'Homosexuality is destroying humanity and if this continues like this, there’ll be no more children in the world.' 'I lost friendships, relationships, participation and community,' Gammerman said. 'It was all gone really, really fast.' Meeting Greenberg, who is married to another man and has a child, helped him realize he could still live a happy, fulfilling life. After their encounter, Gammerman decided to talk to his wife. The couple separated and found a way to break the news to their children. 'Since then, I have rebuilt my life,' he said. 'I remarried. I have a husband. My children are part of my life and they understand.' In time, he realized that not only his family, but his approach toward his religion would also need to change. At first he tried to attend liberal Reform synagogues, some of which fully embrace LGBTQ+ worshippers, but having been raised an Orthodox Jew, he still felt out of place. 'Being LGBT is a whole identity,' Gammerman said. 'And I want to be embraced in a place where there are no buts or ifs.' He’d rather not label his current religious observance, but Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur still bear huge significance for him. So, every year, during the High Holy Days, he wakes up early, dresses nicely and opens his prayer book. 'I say the prayers from beginning to end,' Gammerman said. 'I call to all the praises as if I was in a synagogue, but I do it by myself in my house.' He was once taught that Jewish prayer required at least 10 men to be conducted, but he has learned a few things since. 'If I was given a switch that I could press to change who I am, I would not do it,' he said. 'God made me like this, so it’s not up for me to switch. I have to love myself for who I am.' ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

The fall of Vuhledar is a microcosm of Ukraine's wartime predicament	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The fall of a front-line town nestled atop a tactically significant hill is unlikely to change the course of Ukraine’s war against Russia. But the loss underscores Kyiv’s worsening position, in part the result of firm Western red lines, military officials and analysts said. Vuhledar, a town Ukrainian forces fought tooth and nail to keep for two years, is the latest urban settlement to fall to the Russians. It follows a vicious summer campaign along the eastern front that saw Kyiv cede several thousand square kilometers (miles) of territory. Ukraine’s military said they were withdrawing their troops from Vuhledar to 'protect the military personnel and equipment' in a statement on Wednesday. Vuhledar's fall is a microcosm of Ukraine’s predicament in this chapter of the nearly three-year war. It reflects the U.S.'s refusal to grant Ukraine permission to strike targets deep inside Russian territory, preventing Kyiv from degrading Moscow’s capabilities. Meanwhile, Russia's dominance of the skies allows it to develop and advance devastating aerial glide bombs for which Ukraine has no effective response, while a controversial mobilization drive has failed to produce a new class of Ukrainian fighters capable of holding the line. The Ukrainians' retreat from the town comes after a much-anticipated visit by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the U.S. last week. The Biden administration so far has refused Kyiv’s request to use Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS, to strike Russian airfields and other key targets, and Zelenskyy’s 'victory plan,' was dismissed by some as more of a wish list than a plan of action. In the meantime, Russian fighter jets continued to drop aerial bombs on Vuhledar, which precipitated the retreat, soldiers there said. '(The Russians') main tactic was to encircle us from the flanks, and they did this constantly for six to seven months with constant aerial attacks — due to this tactic they managed to exhaust our resources, because we don’t have as much as they have,' said Arsenii Prylipka, the head of the press office of the 72nd Brigade, which had been defending Vuhledar since August 2022. THE FIGHT FOR VUHLEDAR After two years of failed attempts to capture Vuhledar, Russian forces switched tactics earlier this year. The town’s pre-war population of 14,000 dwindled to less than 100 during the heat of the fighting. Russian soldiers began mounting sophisticated attacks from the north and southern flanks, powered by superior electronic warfare capabilities and an array of infantrymen on motorcycles, artillery fire, drones and aerial glide bombs. Moscow suffered heavy causalities. Ukrainians have been pressuring the U.S. to relax restrictions on the use of Western weapons to strike targets deep inside Russia. Lawmakers said they expected a green light from the U.S. months ago, but it didn’t come: The Biden administration refused to waver on this red line. It has meant that Russian command and control centers, logistics hubs and airfields from which Russian fighter jets carry deadly aerial glide bombs, are out of reach of Ukrainian forces. Russia fires nearly 120 aerial bombs a day on average, about 3,000 a month. The bombs are Soviet-era weapons refitted with navigational technology. 'We cannot change the dynamics, and the Russians are pushing,' said Pavel Narozhnyi, founder of the non-profit Reactive Post, which sources spare parts for artillery. Month after month of constant attacks eventually eroded Ukrainian defenses. After two years of intense fighting, the 72nd Brigade — which never rotated out due to the intensity of the fight and the lack of a demobilization strategy from Ukrainian military leaders — withdrew from the patch of land many of their comrades died to defend. Prylipka had said the brigade would stay until the very last moment when defending Vuhledar became impossible. That scenario unfolded this week. 'The Russians searched for weak spots in our defenses, a constant probe to find routes to penetrate the town and as they advanced they tried to destroy the entire town. All the time we are under fire,' said Prylipka. Vuhledar served as a defensive stronghold, a fortress town atop a hill surrounded by open fields and near two major roads. From there, Ukrainian soldiers were able to observe approaching Russian forces at a distance. From that vantage point, it was easy to coordinate counter-attacks. That advantage now falls to Russian forces. While tactically significant, Vuhledar isn’t a crucial logistics hub for Kyiv, and Russian forces already controlled most of the main roads through the town before capturing it, the U.S.-based Institute for the Study of War said. Ukraine’s access to other critical supply lines remains intact. THE ROAD TO POKROVSK The capture of Vuhledar is part of Moscow’s pursuit of the strategic logistics hub of Pokrovsk, just 30 kilometers (19 miles) north. Its fall would severely compromise Ukrainian defenses. The next step for Russian forces will be to drive Ukrainian forces out of the nearby city of Kurakhove. 'This line is interconnected and the enemy will not be able to enter Pokrovsk and come close to Pokrovsk unless it can drive our troops out of Kurakhove,' said Ivan Tymochko, chairman of the Council of Reservists of Ukraine’s ground forces. 'Otherwise, (the Russians) would have exposed their fronts to the flanks and would have received a serious blow to the side.' 'On the other hand, the enemy understands that if it does not take Kurakhove, it will not be able to seriously influence the course of events around Vuhledar,' he added.	https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-russia-war-vuhledar-2403780647659883a203feda35dd8ccc	2024-10-02T02:22:40-07:00	
Israel's multilayered air-defense system passes another test in fending off Iranian missile strike	JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel's multilayered air-defense system appears to have passed another test after fending off Iran's latest missile barrage. In Tuesday's night's strike, Iran fired over 180 missiles toward Israel. The attack set off air raid sirens across the country and sent residents scrambling for shelter, but caused only a handful of minor injuries and limited damage, in large part because many were intercepted or landed in open areas. It was the latest success for an air-defense system that over the past year has intercepted projectiles fired from Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Iran. They have ranged from short-range rockets to medium-range missiles to attack drones to long-range ballistic missiles like those fired Tuesday night. In Tuesday's attack, the U.S. and Britain said they assisted in shooting down the incoming missiles. Explosions also were seen over the skies of Jordan, though it remains unclear who carried out the interceptions. But the vast majority of Israel's air defense over the past year has been carried out by Israel itself. Over the decades, Israel has developed a sophisticated system capable of detecting incoming fire and deploying only if the projectile is headed toward a population center or sensitive military or civilian infrastructure. Israeli leaders say the system isn't 100% guaranteed, but credit it with preventing serious damage and countless casualties. Here’s a closer look at Israel’s multilayered air-defense system: The Arrow This system developed with the U.S. is designed to intercept long-range missiles, including the types of ballistic missiles Iran launched on Tuesday. The Arrow, which operates outside the atmosphere, has also been used in the current war to intercept long-range missiles launched by Houthi militants in Yemen. David’s Sling Also developed with the U.S., David’s Sling is meant to intercept medium-range missiles, such as those possessed by Hezbollah in Lebanon. It has been deployed on multiple occasions throughout the war. Iron Dome This system, developed by Israel with U.S. backing, specializes in shooting down short-range rockets. It has intercepted thousands of rockets since it was activated early last decade – including thousands of interceptions during the current war against Hamas and Hezbollah. Israel says it has a success rate of over 90%. Iron Beam Israel is developing a new system to intercept incoming threats with laser technology. Israel has said this system will be a game changer because it would be much cheaper to operate than existing systems. According to Israeli media reports, the cost of a single Iron Dome interception is about $50,000, while the other systems can run more than $2 million per missile. Iron Beam interceptions, by contrast, would cost a few dollars apiece, according to Israeli officials — but the system is not yet operational.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-defense-iron-dome-iran-hezbollah-hamas-326cd1e9484dd38c430d62739b7f2ef3	2024-10-02T02:13:07-07:00	
4 candidates to lead Britain's defeated Conservatives bash Labour, and each other	BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) — The four contenders to lead Britain’s Conservative Party took turns in the spotlight on Wednesday, each claiming to be the one who can lead the right-of-center party back from a catastrophic election defeat. Former Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick, ex-Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch, former Foreign Secretary James Cleverly and ex-Security Minister Tom Tugendhat each made impassioned speeches aimed at persuading party members that they have what it takes to turn around public opinion, trounce the Labour Party of Prime Minister Keir Starmer and return the Conservatives to power at the next election, due by 2029. That’s a tall order. After years of division, scandal and economic tumult, U.K. voters comprehensively rejected the Tories in a July election, leaving the party that had governed since 2010 with just 121 seats in the 650-seat House of Commons. The center-left Labour Party won more than 400. Jenrick, a former centrist who has shifted to the right with tough talk on migration, and the energetic libertarian Badenoch are considered the front-runners, though Cleverly's upbeat appeal for unity went down well with delegates in the auditorium. An initial field of six candidates was whittled down by Conservative lawmakers to four before the conference. Legislators will eliminate two more in voting next week. Party members across the country will then vote to pick a winner, who will be announced Nov. 2. The candidates agreed that they want a smaller state and a more vibrant economy and that they all revere the late Margaret Thatcher, whose 11 years in power transformed the U.K. They differed on how far to emulate Reform U.K., the hard-right, anti-immigrant party led by populist politician Nigel Farage. Though Reform won only five seats in the election, it came second in many more, and its rapid rise has scared some Conservatives into moving to the right. Jenrick leaned furthest towards embracing Reform, saying Britain needed a 'New Conservative Party' — an echo of the 'New Labour' project that returned that party to power under Tony Blair in the 1990s. He pledged to take Britain out of the European Court of Human Rights, scrap the U.K.’s own Human Rights Act, end mass migration, abolish carbon-emissions targets and 'stand for our nation and our culture, our identity and our way of life.' Nigeria-raised Badenoch cast herself as a fearless truth-teller, declaring that 'the system is broken,' arguing for a low-tax, free-market economy and pledging to 'rewire, reboot and reprogram' the British state. 'In government, we did not always keep our promises,' she said. 'We promised to lower taxes, they went up. We promised to lower immigration, it went up. ' Cleverly, who comes from a centrist section of the party, said there would be 'no mergers, no deals' with Reform if he won. He warned that the party must not 'wallow in self-pity' or veer to extremes. He also struck a note of humility, arguing that the party let the electorate down. Before the Conservative Party can reboot, he said, 'there’s something we need to say: Sorry.' 'Let’s be more normal,' said Cleverly, who urged Conservatives to emulate the optimism of 'my political hero,' Ronald Reagan. Tugendhat, widely seen as a longshot, accused his higher-profile rivals of a 'lack of substance … petty point scoring, and self-service' and said his past as a soldier gave him the leadership qualities to 'reconnect with the British people … restore trust … win again.' Delegate Belinda Williams said that she went into the speeches with an open mind and came out backing Cleverly. 'Such passion,' she said. 'He came out with some fantastic ideas.' Another party member, Steven Stanbury, thought Badenoch had best diagnosed 'what went wrong' for the party. 'We said one thing and we failed total and utterly to deliver,' he said. The slogan of the four-day conference in the central English city of Birmingham was the subdued 'review and rebuild.' But the leadership contest gave the event something of the buzz of a U.S. convention, with huge banners bearing the candidates’ faces, and branded merchandise including giant foam fingers for Tugendhat, 'We want Bobby J' baseball caps for Jenrick and T-shirts urging people to 'Be more Kemi.' Though all the candidates took potshots at Labour, the party’s time-consuming leadership contest has weakened its ability to capitalize on the new government’s missteps. Starmer’s personal approval rating has plunged amid his gloomy pronouncements about the economy and revelations about his acceptance of freebies from a wealthy Labour donor. Keiran Pedley, director of U.K. politics at pollster Ipsos, said the Conservative Party 'faces an uphill battle' whoever leads it. In an Ipsos poll released Tuesday, 64% of respondents said they didn’t care who became Conservative leader, while 31% said they cared a great deal or a fair amount. The pollster surveyed 1,100 British adults and the margin of error is plus or minus three percentage points. 'The public is largely indifferent to the leadership race, and the candidates are relatively unknown,' Pedley said.	https://apnews.com/article/uk-conservative-party-leadership-candidates-speeches-conference-edec89b2a7f02bb49bf2987bf3b54264	2024-10-02T02:06:15-07:00	
Ukraine's military will pull out of Vuhledar in the east after 2 years of intense fighting	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian forces are withdrawing from the front-line town of Vuhledar, perched atop a tactically significant hill in eastern Ukraine, after more than two years of grinding battle, military officials said Wednesday. Vuhledar, a town Ukrainian forces fought tooth and nail to keep, is the latest urban settlement to fall to the Russians as the war stretches deep into its third year and the Ukrainian army is gradually being pushed backward in the eastern Donetsk province. It follows a vicious summer campaign along the eastern front that saw Kyiv cede several thousand square kilometers (square miles) of territory as the Russian army hacks its way westward, obliterating towns and villages with missiles, glide bombs, artillery and drones. Ukraine’s Khortytsia ground forces formation, which commands eastern regions including Donetsk, said in a statement posted on Telegram it was withdrawing troops from Vuhledar to 'protect military personnel and equipment.' 'In an attempt to take control of the city at any cost, (Russian) reserves were directed to carry out flanking attacks, which exhausted the defense of the units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. As a result of the enemy’s actions, there arose a threat of encircling the city,' the statement said. The tactical significance of the town, situated at the confluence of two major roads, is two-fold. Dominant heights and proximity to railway lines offer Moscow greater protection for their own logistics routes, and a better vantage point for attacks against Ukrainian forces and supply lines feeding the south. Its capture is another notch in Moscow’s belt, bringing it closer to the key logistics hub of Pokrovsk. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-russia-war-vuhledar-186ac647ae5ac93d6007e31a82a5e1ae	2024-10-02T01:06:22-07:00	
The UK and EU vow to mend their Brexit battered ties. They will set a new agenda and hold summits	BRUSSELS (AP) — The United Kingdom and the European Union agreed on Wednesday to strengthen their relationship after the damage caused by Brexit and to hold a series of meetings, including at the highest level, on issues like economic growth, energy, security and migration. In a statement issued after talks in Brussels, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen agreed on 'the importance of the unique relationship' they share and vowed to 'ambitiously' strengthen their cooperation. The leaders both recommitted to the Withdrawal Agreement and other pacts reached on the terms of Brexit as Britain left the world’s biggest trade bloc four years ago, the first country to do so, creating a deep rift between them. They also reaffirmed their commitment to uphold international law and to the European Convention on Human Rights. Hard-line Brexiteers want the U.K. to leave the convention so that asylum-seekers can be deported without the intervention of rights courts. Britons voted to leave the EU during the 2016 Brexit referendum, when a key promise of the campaign to exit was that it would give the U.K. more control over its borders. But immigration figures have gone up, not down, since then. Von der Leyen and Starmer underlined the shared challenges that they face, notably because of Russia's full-fledged invasion of Ukraine, and they both 'reiterated their unwavering support for Ukraine’s sovereignty.' They said that 'a stable, positive and forward-looking relationship was in their mutual interests and provided the basis for long term cooperation.' An agenda for their cooperation will be established in coming months. It would start by 'defining together the areas in which strengthened cooperation would be mutually beneficial, such as the economy, energy, security and resilience, in full respect of their internal procedures and institutional prerogatives.' The two said they would meet again in the fall, and that the first of what should become a regular series of EU-U.K. summits should be held early next year. Earlier, standing alongside von der Leyen, Starmer told reporters that he believes 'the British public want to return to pragmatic, sensible leadership when it comes to dealing with our closest neighbors, to make Brexit work and to deliver in their interests, to find ways to boost economic growth, strengthen our security and tackle shared challenges like irregular migration and climate change.' Von der Leyen welcomed his visit and the opportunity to strengthen EU-U.K. relations. 'We have a set of solid agreements in place,' she said. 'We should explore the scope for more cooperation while we focus on the full and faithful implementation' of the Brexit agreements underpinning their painful and costly divorce. Starmer also held talks with the other leaders of the bloc’s main institutions: European Council President Charles Michel and European Parliament President Roberta Metsola. The EU, for its part, wants to build bridges between young people on either side of the English Channel by introducing a program that would allow young EU and U.K. citizens to study, work and live for short periods in the U.K. and the EU, respectively. Supporters of Brexit oppose it. Since his center-left Labour Party’s resounding election win on July 4, Starmer has sought a larger role for the United Kingdom on the global stage after years of soured relations with Europe over Brexit. He has vowed to reduce some of the post-Brexit barriers for people and goods that have undermined ties between Britain and the bloc. Starmer insists, though, that he won’t reverse Brexit, or rejoin the EU’s single market and customs union. ___ Pan Pylas contributed to this report from London.	https://apnews.com/article/eu-britain-uk-brexit-starmer-leyen-brussels-0936054bb4cf4991534a1ce437643a58	2024-10-02T00:25:08-07:00	
Women's role in Catholic Church tops agenda as Pope Francis opens second phase of big reform project	ROME (AP) — Pope Francis opened the second phase of his big Catholic reform project Wednesday, with widespread calls for women to take up more positions of responsibility in the church topping the agenda but ordained ministry still ruled out. Francis presided over an opening Mass in St. Peter’s Square with the 368 bishops and laypeople who will meet behind closed doors for the next three weeks to discuss the future of the church and how to make it more responsive to the needs of Catholics today. Several of the most contentious issues are officially off the table, after they encountered resistance and objections during the first session of the synod, or meeting, last year. They include ministering to LGBTQ+ Catholics and allowing women to serve as deacons. Francis has entrusted these topics to 10 study groups that are working in parallel to the synod, raising questions about what exactly will come out of the gathering when it concludes Oct. 26 with a final set of proposals for Francis to consider. Francis launched the reform process in 2021 to put in practice his goal of creating a church that is more inclusive, humble and welcoming, where ordinary Catholics have a greater say in decision making than the all-male priestly hierarchy. The process, and the two-year canvassing of rank-and-file Catholics that informed it, sparked both hopes and fears that real change was afoot. In his marching orders Wednesday, Francis urged delegates to leave aside their long-held and self-interested positions and truly listen to one another to 'give life to something new.' 'Otherwise, we will end up locking ourselves into dialogues among the deaf, where participants seek to advance their own causes or agendas without listening to others and, above all, without listening to the voice of the Lord,' he said in his homily. The first phase of the synod process ended last year by concluding it was 'urgent' to guarantee fuller participation by women in church governance positions, and calling for theological and pastoral research to continue about allowing women to be deacons. Deacons perform many of the same functions as priests, such as presiding over baptisms, weddings and funerals, but they cannot celebrate Mass. Advocates say allowing women to be deacons would help offset the Catholic priest shortage and address longstanding complaints that women have a second-class status in the church: barred from the priesthood yet responsible for the lion’s share of the work educating the young, caring for the sick and passing the faith onto next generations. Opponents say ordaining women to the deaconate would signal the start of a slippery slope toward ordaining women to the priesthood. The Catholic Church reserves the priesthood for men, saying Christ chose only men as his 12 apostles. Francis has repeatedly reaffirmed the all-male priesthood and as recently as this weekend sharply criticized 'obtuse' agitators pressing for a female diaconate. After a contentious visit to Belgium where he was challenged by female students, Francis said such calls were an attempt to 'make women masculine.' His arguments have outraged proponents of women’s ordination, who have organized a series of events outside the synod this month in Rome to press their case. 'It’s so insulting to keep on saying that the only valid role that will get the approval of this pope is to be nurturing, is to be a mother, while you can be nurturing and mothering and be a priest,' said Miriam Duignan, a trustee at the Wijngaards Institute for Catholic Research. 'He is putting a spiritual stamp of approval on sexism,' she said at a prayer event this week co-organized by the Women’s Ordination Conference. 'It is so irresponsible and dangerous for him to constantly criticize, belittle, dismiss and demonize women who are just saying ‘Stop lying. Stop hiding and stop trying to relegate us to second-class citizenship.’' While ordained ministry for women is out of the question, a host of other proposals are being discussed, including calls for women to have greater positions of responsibility in seminaries and sit as judges on canonical courts that decide everything from marriage annulments to priest discipline cases. There are 368 members of the synod, including 272 bishops and 96 non-bishops. In all, 85 women are participating, including 54 with the right to vote. In addition to delegates who were selected by their respective bishops conferences, Francis named a few members himself to participate, including two bishops from mainland China, many of his closest cardinal advisers and the exiled Nicaraguan Bishop Rolando Jose Alvarez. Also on the list of pontifically nominated members is the retired prefect of the Vatican’s doctrine office, Cardinal Gerhard Mueller, who has been critical of the synod process and Francis’ pontificate as a whole. In an essay this week on German Catholic site kath.net, Mueller took particular aim at the penitential liturgy that Francis celebrated Tuesday during which he begged forgiveness for a host of sins as a way to atone for the church’s transgressions before the start of the meeting. Mueller blasted what he called 'newly invented sins' -– including sins against the synod itself and the sin 'of using doctrine as stones to be hurled,' a reference to how conservatives have criticized Francis’ reform efforts as undermining traditional church doctrine. Mueller said such a laundry list of invented sins 'reads like a checklist of woke and gender ideology, somewhat laboriously disguised as Christianity.' Non-bishop members named by the pope include the Rev. James Martin, an American Jesuit who runs an LGBTQ+ outreach ministry. Martin has a sympathetic ear in both Francis, who approved same-sex blessings unilaterally after the first session of the synod ended, and the Rev. Timothy Radcliffe, who is one of the 'spiritual assistants' for the synod. In an essay this week in the Vatican newspaper L’Osservatore Romano, Radcliffe argued strongly for even doubters in the church to recognize the good in LGBTQ+ Catholics and their relationships, and why the church ought to welcome them. 'The acceptance of gay people is seen in some parts of the church as evidence of Western decadence,' he wrote. 'But the church must fight for the lives and dignity of gay people, still liable to capital punishment in 10 countries and criminal prosecution in 70. They have the right to live,' he said. At the same time, those opposed to a pastoral approach to gays have gifts the Western church should appreciate, including a deep sense of the divine life in all of creation, he said. 'The Body of Christ needs all our gifts,' he concluded. ___ AP visual journalist Silvia Stellacci contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/vatican-pope-reform-women-lgbtq-f8b42b57dcf7ef77dbd3f406780217ed	2024-10-01T23:53:05-07:00	
Two predawn explosions rock the area around the Israeli Embassy in Copenhagen but no one is injured	COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — Police in the Danish capital said two predawn explosions took place Wednesday in the vicinity of the Israeli Embassy in Copenhagen, prompting the nearby Jewish school to close for the day. Police said no one had been injured and they were investigating whether there was a link between the blasts at around 3:20 a.m. and the Israeli diplomatic mission, which is close to several other embassies. They declined to say whether anyone had been arrested. Heavily armed officers, search dogs and forensic teams were inspecting the area which had been cordoned off. Copenhagen's Jewish school, Carolineskolen, which is just down the street from the embassy, was already due to remain closed on Thursday and Friday for the Jewish New Year holidays, Michael Rachlin, a spokesperson for Denmark’s Jewish community told The Associated Press. There will also be extra security around the main synagogue in downtown Copenhagen, the Jewish community said in a statement. Community chairman Henrik Goldstein wrote that he 'would like to encourage people to be aware when moving in public spaces.' 'And be critical of what you hear on social media and rumors,' he wrote, adding that 'there is no reason to refrain from participating in Jewish life.' Police refused to give details about the intensity of the reported blasts or the damage they may have caused. Denmark’s Justice Minister Peter Hummelgaard told broadcaster TV2 that the incident was 'inherently serious,' adding it was too early to say anything about a motive. On Tuesday night, the area around the Israeli Embassy in Stockholm was also closed off after a loud bang was reported. Police later announced that findings from the scene indicated that the embassy was hit by bullets. No one has been arrested, they said. Swedish broadcaster TV4 said that a weapon and an empty shell casing had been found at or near the embassy. Sweden's domestic security agency told the AP that it was not conducting a preliminary investigation linked to Tuesday's incident in Stockholm and referred to the ordinary police.	https://apnews.com/article/copenhagen-blasts-israel-denmark-embassy-security-jewish-491344e2f65f834f0ddbb7ae65c6851d	2024-10-01T23:05:07-07:00	
Pakistani security forces kill 6 insurgents in a raid in the southwest	ISLAMABAD (AP) — Pakistani security forces have killed at least six insurgents in a raid on their hideout in the country's restive southwest, officials said Wednesday. The raid targeted members of the Baloch Liberation Army in Harnai, a district in Balochistan province, which borders Iran and Afghanistan. It wasn’t immediately clear when the raid took place. Balochistan has for years been the scene of a long-running insurgency, with several separatist groups staging attacks that target mainly security forces in their quest for independence. The province also has an array of militant groups that are active there. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi praised security forces for the raid. The outlawed Baloch Liberation Army killed dozens of civilians and security forces in attacks across the province in August. On Sunday, gunmen stormed a camp of construction workers in the province's Musa Khel district, torching bulldozers and other machinery. Initially, police said the attackers kidnapped 20 laborers but later it turned out they were unharmed and had fled the scene to escape the assailants.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-raid-balochistan-insurgents-c8e4f6683f95d471b5e6fd012e541fef	2024-10-01T22:49:09-07:00	
Under fire and using old equipment, Lebanon's rescuers struggle to respond to Israeli offensive	BEIRUT (AP) — When Israel bombed buildings outside the southern Lebanese city of Sidon, Mohamed Arkadan and his team rushed to an emergency unlike anything they had ever seen. About a dozen apartments had collapsed onto the hillside they once overlooked, burying more than 100 people. Even after 17 years with the civil defense forces of one of the world's most war-torn nations, Arkadan was shocked at the destruction. By Monday afternoon — about 24 hours after the bombing — his team had pulled more than 40 bodies, including children's, from the rubble, along with 60 survivors. The children's bodies broke his heart, said Arkadan, 38, but his team of over 30 first responders' inability to help further pained him more. Firetrucks and ambulances haven’t been replaced in years. Rescue tools and equipment are in short supply. His team has to buy their uniforms out of pocket. An economic crisis that began in 2019 and a massive 2020 port explosion have left Lebanon struggling to provide basic services such as electricity and medical care. Political divisions have left the country of 6 million without a president or functioning government for more than two years, deepening a national sense of abandonment reaching down to the people the country depends on in emergencies. 'We have zero capabilities, zero logistics,' Arkadan said. 'We have no gloves, no personal protection gear.' War has upended Lebanon again Israel’s intensified air campaign against Hezbollah has upended the country. Over 1,000 people have been killed in Israeli strikes since Sept. 17, nearly a quarter of them women and children, according to the Health Ministry. Hundreds of thousands of people have fled their homes, sleeping on beaches and streets. The World Health Organization said over 30 primary health care centers around Lebanon’s affected areas have been closed. On Tuesday, Israel said it began a limited ground operation against Hezbollah and warned people to evacuate several southern communities, promising further escalation. Lebanon is 'grappling with multiple crises, which have overwhelmed the country’s capacity to cope,' said Imran Riza, the U.N.'s humanitarian coordinator for Lebanon, who said the U.N. had allocated $24 million in emergency funding for people affected by the fighting. Exhausted medical staff are struggling to cope with the daily influx of new patients. Under government emergency plans, hospitals and medical workers have halted non-urgent operations. Government shelters are full In the southern province of Tyre, many doctors have fled along with residents. In Nabatiyeh, the largest province in southern Lebanon, first responders say they have been working around the clock since last week to reach hundreds of people wounded in bombings that hit dozens of villages and towns, often many on the same day. After the bombing in Sidon nearly 250 first responders joined Arkadan's team, including a specialized search-and-rescue unit from Beirut, some 45 kilometers (28 miles) to the north. His team didn't have the modern equipment needed to pull people from a disaster. 'We used traditional tools, like scissors, cables, shovels,' Arkadan said. 'Anyone here?' rescuers shouted through the gaps in mounds of rubble, searching for survivors buried deeper underground. One excavator removed the debris slowly, to avoid shaking the heaps of bricks and mangled steel. Many sought refuge in the ancient city of Tyre, 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of the border with Israel, thinking it was likely to be spared bombardment. More than 8,000 people arrived, said Hassan Dbouk, the head of its disaster management unit. He said that there were no pre-positioned supplies, such as food parcels, hygiene kits and mattresses, and moving trucks now is fraught with danger. Farmers have been denied access to their land because of the bombings and the municipality is struggling to pay salaries. The humanitarian situation is catastrophic Meanwhile, garbage is piling up on the streets. The number of municipal workers has shrunk from 160 to 10. 'The humanitarian situation is catastrophic,' Dbouk said. Wissam Ghazal, the health ministry official in Tyre, said in one hospital, only five of 35 doctors have remained. In Tyre province, eight medics, including three with a medical organization affiliated with Hezbollah, were killed over two days, he said. Over the weekend, the city itself became a focus of attacks. Israeli warplanes struck near the port city’s famed ruins, along its beaches and in residential and commercial areas, forcing thousands of residents to flee. At least 15 civilians were killed Saturday and Sunday, including two municipal workers, a soldier and several children, all but one from two families. It took rescuers two days to comb through the rubble of a home in the Kharab neighborhood in the city’s center, where a bomb had killed nine members of the al-Samra family. Six premature babies in incubators around the city were moved to Beirut. The city’s only doctor, who looked after them, couldn’t move between hospitals under fire, Ghazal said. One of the district’s four hospitals shut after sustaining damage from a strike that affected its electricity supply and damaged the operations room. In two other hospitals, glass windows were broken. For now, the city’s hospitals are receiving more killed than wounded. 'But you don’t know what will happen when the intensity of attacks increases. We will definitely need more.' Making do with what they have Hosein Faqih, head of civil defense in the Nabatiyeh province, said that 'we are working in very difficult and critical circumstances because the strikes are random. We have no protection. We have no shields, no helmets, no extra hoses. The newest vehicle is 25 years old. We are still working despite all that.' At least three of his firefighters’ team were killed in early September. Ten have been injured since then. Of 45 vehicles, six were hit and are now out of service. Faqih said he is limiting his team’s search-and-rescue missions to residential areas, keeping them away from forests or open areas where they used to put out fires. 'These days, there is something difficult every day. Body parts are everywhere, children, civilians and bodies under rubble,' Faqih said. Still, he said, he considers his job to be the safety net for the people. 'We serve the people, and we will work with what we have.'	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-hezbollah-rescue-emergency-services-cc0e211c73d8f033387574a69e14a32f	2024-10-01T22:05:19-07:00	
Typhoon bringing heavy rain slowly heads toward Taiwan, where 4,000 have evacuated	KAOHSIUNG, Taiwan (AP) — A typhoon bringing strong winds and torrential rainfall slowly advanced Wednesday toward Taiwan, where thousands of people have been evacuated from vulnerable low-lying or mountainous terrain. At least 93 centimeters (3 feet) of rain has fallen in the coastal Taitung County in the past four days and 29 centimeters (11.4 inches) in the major port city of Kaohsiung ahead of Typhoon Krathon. The typhoon, packing maximum sustained winds near the center of 173 kph (108 mph) and gusts of 209 kph (130 mph), is expected to make landfall early Thursday on Taiwan’s densely populated west coast, according to the island's Central Weather Administration. Typhoons rarely hit Taiwan’s west coast, affecting instead the mountainous, eastern side of the island. Authorities shut schools and government offices across the island and canceled all domestic flights. In the eastern Hualien County, more than 3,000 people were evacuated from townships vulnerable to landslides. Almost 200 people in the southwestern city of Tainan and more than 800 residents of the southern Pingtung County were also evacuated. Before noon Wednesday, the center of the typhoon was around 130 kilometers (81 miles) southwest of Kaohsiung, moving northeastward at around 8 kph (5 mph). It has been weakening and will continue to do so after landfall, the weather administration said. Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chi-mai earlier warned residents against approaching areas prone to flooding and landslides near rivers, the sea and the mountains. He likened Krathon’s intensity to that of Typhoon Thelma, which in 1977 devastated Kaohsiung and caused 37 deaths. In Kaohsiung, most stores and restaurants remained closed for a second consecutive day. Shoppers emptied supermarket shelves of essentials including bread, meats and instant noodles. Almost 40,000 troops were on standby to help with rescue efforts. The typhoon on Monday lashed northern Philippine islands, where four people were killed and at least 5,000 were displaced, officials said.	https://apnews.com/article/typhoon-krathon-taiwan-1a3d7b4ecf5031ebed065774ca6dcfe4	2024-10-01T21:09:19-07:00	
Mexico's Sheinbaum will keep doing mañanera briefings, though her style is unlike her predecessor's	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico's new President, Claudia Sheinbaum, will start her day Wednesday much like her political mentor, ex-President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, began most of his: with an early morning press briefing from the National Palace. How the briefings, known in Mexico as mañaneras, will pan out remains to be seen. Under López Obrador, they were marathon affairs, featuring folksy dialogue, verbal jousting with the press and, frequently, long history lessons from the charismatic and indefatigable López Obrador. His oratorial skills turned his briefings into a powerful political weapon. Analysts agree that Sheinbaum will try to create her own personal brand, but she will inevitably be compared to the man who set the standard. It’s no surprise Sheinbaum decided to continue the successful formula of her mentor — she has promised to continue virtually everything he did. She will hope to set the press' daily agenda just as López Obrador did throughout his presidency. After her June 2 election victory, the former Mexico City mayor began holding midday press conferences that concluded within half an hour. Sheinbaum would open with announcements and then take questions from journalists. She has not shared details of how her mañaneras will be, but the expectation is for something abbreviated and more suited to her data-focused personality. During his presidency, which concluded Monday, the 70-year-old López Obrador held daily conferences Monday through Friday. The briefings lasted between two and three hours, then he would take questions from journalists, many of them pro-government. He also used the platform to frequently bash critical media and his adversaries. That's how he achieved the strategic objective of 'winning the battle for control of reality,' said communication consultant Luis Antonio Espino in his book, 'López Obrador: The Power of Populist Discourse.' But Sheinbaum, a 62-year-old scientist-turned-politician, has another style. 'As a communicator she’s different,' said Roy Campos, president of the polling company Consulta-Mitofsky. He said Sheinbaum has a 'spare' speaking style. She transmits an image of 'a university professor who tries to demonstrate seriousness and truth through science,' he added. That's a far cry from the folksy López Obrador. The former president would speak for hours, with lots of colloquial language, and he enjoyed publicly confronting his adversaries. According to Espino, the charismatic former president used his speeches to create 'emotional bonds to achieve his true goal.' Through his powerful speeches, López Obrador managed to leave office with an approval rating still above 60%. His legacy makes him one of Mexico’s most popular presidents in recent history. Now the question arises as to whether Sheinbaum will be able to capture the attention and win the empathy that López Obrador consolidated during his six-year term. Campos said it all depends on how she will come across in front of the cameras. 'She will try to create that empathy that López Obrador created,' he said. 'We’re going to see if this daily presence will give her control of the press agenda or popularity.'	https://apnews.com/article/sheinbaum-mananera-lopez-obrador-mexico-president-472598f0eb3ab5a5003b3499fa47af4b	2024-10-01T20:57:43-07:00	
Swine fever sweeps Italy's north, threatening production of prized prosciutto and livelihoods	CORTELEONA E GENZONE, Italy (AP) — One of Giovanni Airoli’s sows turned up positive for African swine fever in late August. Within a week, all 6,200 sows, piglets and fattening pigs on his farm south of Milan were slaughtered under strict protocols to halt the disease threatening Italy’s 20-billion-euro prosciutto, cured sausage and pork industry. Since swine fever appeared on the peninsula in January 2022, Italy has killed nearly 120,000 pigs — three-quarters of those over the past two months alone as the emergency intensified. 'It’s a desolation,' Airoli said outside his farm in the northern Lombardy region that is ground zero for Italy’s swine fever epidemic. No one is allowed in and out except for employees, and then under strict hygiene protocols that require clean coveralls and boots for use only inside the premises. 'It happened to us despite applying all of the safety measures required. There was obviously a failure. We don’t understand what it could have been,' Airoli said. The disease spiked with 24 outbreaks in early September, most of those in Lombardy. The area of greatest concern, where the infection has been confirmed in domestic pigs, extends 4,500 square kilometers (nearly 1,740 square miles) and includes neighboring Piedmont and Emilia Romagna, a region world-renowned for its prized Parma prosciutto. The impact of the swine fever outbreak goes further. Farmers in the 23,000-square-kilometer (8,880-square-mile) area also face restrictions due to infected wild boars, or falling in a buffer zone. The disease, which is nearly always fatal to swine, first infected wild boars and quickly spread to domestic pigs. It does not affect humans. Coldiretti, Italy’s powerful agricultural lobby group, estimates damage to the industry so far at 500 million euros ($554 million), partly due to import bans, and warns that some farmers risk losing their livelihoods. According to its calculation, the sector generates 20 billion euros ($22 billion) along the supply chain, from farms where the pigs are raised to factories where ham is cured. 'The spread of swine fever has reached alarming levels, putting at risk not just the health of the animals but of the entire pork sector,' Confindustria President Ettore Prandini warned in a recent letter to the agricultural minister. The government appointed a new special commissioner to tackle the epidemic over the summer, tapping Giovanni Filippini, a trained veterinarian and longtime Italian animal health authority director who eradicated swine fever from the island of Sardinia. Two previous commissioners focused efforts on dispatching the army to hunt wild boar, hitting resistance from sport hunters and the European Union, which underscored that hunting risked sending infected animals into new areas. Instead, Filippini has imposed new restrictions on accessing farms and transferring animals, and enlarged the buffer zones, measures that seem to be having an impact. In Lombardy, just one new outbreak was reported during the last full week of September. 'It is a positive sign, but not yet a victory,' said Giovanni Loris Alborali, director of the animal health institute for Lombardy and Emilia Romagna. 'We must keep the sanitation high and this will help the animals’ health with better growth rates for farmers and fewer antibiotics for consumers in the future.' As soon as the swine fever was confirmed in Italy, 12 countries, including China, Taiwan, and Mexico, put an immediate ban on importing Italian pork delicacies, like prosciutto crudo, no matter if they were produced in an area where swine fever was detected or not. Japan, South Korea and four other countries limited imports. That brought an immediate loss of 20 million euros ($22 million) a month in exports to a sector that recorded 2.1 billion euros ($2.3 billion) in sales last year, according to the Assica association of Italian meat industries. Markets like the United States and Canada did not stop their imports of pork products, as long as they came from areas not affected by swine fever. Airoli, who produces ham for both San Daniele and Parma prosciutto, like many other farmers, does not expect to restart his business raising some 13,000 pigs a year until swine fever is brought under control. And there is no indication when that might be. That's having an impact on Italy's prosciutto production. 'The limited availability of fresh pork legs is generating strong production limitations,' according to a statement by the Parma Prosciutto Consortium, which produces prosciutto with the certificate of origin designed to protect high-quality foods made by traditional methods. It added that a spike in prices of the raw materials due to the emergency was also 'unsustainable.' Farmers who are still outside the areas of concern are taking extra measures in a bid to ensure the disease does not reach them. Once detected, all pigs on the farm, even if healthy, must be killed. Sergio Visini, who runs the antibiotic-free Piggly farm in the eastern Mantova province of Lombardy, requires trucks transporting pigs to be sanitized a second time when they enter the sterile zone where the pigs are held. 'We do another detailed sterilization of all of the wheels and any part of the truck that could bring contamination,' said Visini, who opened the farm in 2017 with the aim of raising pigs with less stress and more space. He hopes more farmers will adopt his methods. 'This outbreak can also turn into an opportunity to improve animal health and welfare,' he added. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

Gaza health officials say death toll from a large Israeli operation has climbed to 51	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Gaza’s Health Ministry says at least 51 people have been killed and another 82 wounded in a large Israeli air and ground operation in the southern city of Khan Younis. Israel’s military has yet to comment on the operation, which began early Wednesday. Palestinian residents say ground forces pushed into three neighborhoods. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below. DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli strikes killed at least 32 people in southern Gaza overnight, mostly women and children, as the military launched ground operations in the hard-hit city of Khan Younis, Palestinian medical officials said Wednesday. Israel has continued to strike what it says are militant targets across Gaza nearly a year after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack ignited the war, even as attention has shifted to Lebanon, where Israel has launched ground operations against Hezbollah, and to Iran, which launched a ballistic missile attack on Israel late Tuesday. In a separate development, Hezbollah said its fighters clashed with Israeli troops in the Lebanese border town of Odaisseh, forcing them to retreat. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military or independent confirmation of the incident, which would mark the first ground combat since Israeli troops crossed the border this week. Israeli media reported infantry and tank units operating in southern Lebanon after the military sent thousands of additional troops and artillery to the border. The military warned residents to evacuate another 24 villages in southern Lebanon after making a similar announcement the day before. Hundreds of thousands have already fled their homes as the conflict has intensified. Palestinians describe massive raid in Gaza The European Hospital in Khan Younis said it received the bodies after heavy Israeli airstrikes and ground operations in the city. Hospital records show that seven women and 12 children as young as 22 months old were among those killed. Another 19 people, including two children, were killed in separate strikes late Tuesday in central Gaza, according to hospitals there that received the bodies. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Residents said Israel had carried out heavy airstrikes as its ground forces staged an incursion into three neighborhoods in Khan Younis. Mahmoud al-Razd, a resident who said four relatives were killed in the raids, described heavy destruction and said first responders had struggled to reach destroyed homes. 'The explosions and shelling were massive,' he told The Associated Press. 'Many people are thought to be under the rubble and no one can retrieve them.' Israel carried out a weekslong offensive earlier this year in Khan Younis that left much of Gaza's second largest city in ruins. Over the course of the war, Israeli forces have repeatedly returned to areas of Gaza where they have previously fought Hamas and other armed groups as the militants have regrouped. Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, on Oct. 7 and took around 250 hostage. Around 100 are still in captivity in Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed over 41,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not say how many were fighters but say a little more than half were women and children. The military says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. Iran fires missiles to avenge attacks on militant allies Iran launched at least 180 missiles into Israel on Tuesday in what it said was retaliation for a series of devastating blows Israel has landed in recent weeks against Hezbollah, which has been firing rockets into Israel since the war in Gaza began. Israelis scrambled for bomb shelters as air raid sirens sounded and the orange glow of missiles streaked across the night sky. The Israeli military said it intercepted many of the incoming Iranian missiles, though some landed in central and southern Israel and two people were lightly wounded by shrapnel. Several missiles landed in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where one of them killed a Palestinian worker from Gaza who had been stranded in the territory since the war broke out. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to retaliate against Iran, which he said 'made a big mistake tonight and it will pay for it.' President Joe Biden said his administration is 'fully supportive' of Israel and that he’s in 'active discussion' with aides about what the appropriate response should be. Iran said it would respond to any violation of its sovereignty with even heavier strikes on Israeli infrastructure. Hezbollah and Hamas are close allies backed by Iran, and each escalation has raised fears of a wider war in the Middle East that could draw in Iran and the United States, which has rushed military assets to the region in support of Israel. Iran said it fired Tuesday’s missiles as retaliation for attacks that killed leaders of Hezbollah, Hamas and the Iranian military. It referenced Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and Revolutionary Guard Gen. Abbas Nilforushan, both killed in an Israeli airstrike last week in Beirut. It also mentioned Ismail Haniyeh, a top leader in Hamas who was assassinated in Tehran in a suspected Israeli attack in July. The U.N. Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting for Wednesday morning to address the escalating situation in the Middle East. Israel says its forces are operating in Lebanon Israel is meanwhile carrying out what it says are limited ground incursions into southern Lebanon. Israeli airstrikes and artillery have been pounding southern Lebanon as Hezbollah fires dozens of rockets, missiles and drones into Israel, where there have been few casualties. Israel has said it will continue to strike Hezbollah until it is safe for tens of thousands of its citizens displaced from homes near the Lebanon border to return. Hezbollah has vowed to keep firing rockets into Israel until there is a cease-fire in Gaza with Hamas. Israel has warned people in southern Lebanon to evacuate to the north of the Awali River, some 60 kilometers (36 miles) from the border and much farther than the Litani River, which marks the northern edge of a U.N.-declared zone intended to serve as a buffer between Israel and Hezbollah after their 2006 war. The border region has largely emptied out over the past year as the two sides have traded fire. Israeli strikes have killed over 1,000 people in Lebanon over the past two weeks, nearly a quarter of them women and children, according to the Health Ministry. Hundreds of thousands have fled their homes. Hezbollah is a widely seen as the most powerful armed group in the region, with tens of thousands of fighters and an arsenal of 150,000 rockets and missiles. The last round of fighting in 2006 ended in a stalemate, and both sides have spent the past two decades preparing for their next showdown. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

Middle East latest: Iran and Israel swap threats following Tehran's missile barrage	The Middle East moved closer to a long-feared regional war the day after Iran fired a barrage of missiles at Israel and Israel said it began limited ground incursions into Lebanon targeting the Iran-backed Hezbollah militia. Israel said it intercepted many of the missiles, and officials in Washington said U.S. destroyers assisted in Israel's defense. Iran said most of its missiles hit their targets. There were no immediate reports of casualties. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed late Tuesday to retaliate against Iran, which he said 'made a big mistake tonight and it will pay for it.' An Iranian commander threatened wider strikes on infrastructure if Israel retaliates against Iran's territory. The United Nations Security Council called an emergency meeting for Wednesday to address the spiraling conflict. Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire across the Lebanon border almost daily since Oct. 8, the day after Hamas’ cross-border attack on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed 1,200 Israelis and took 250 others hostage. Israel declared war on the militant group in the Gaza Strip in response. More than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in the territory, and just over half the dead have been women and children, according to local health officials. ___ Here is the latest: The Israeli military warns Lebanese to evacuate 24 villages in the south JERUSALEM — The Israeli military has warned people to evacuate another 24 villages across southern Lebanon. The warning on Wednesday came days after the military launched what it said were limited ground operations near the border to combat the Hezbollah militant group. The villages are in a U.N.-declared buffer zone established after Israel and Hezbollah fought their last war in 2006. Spain will send 2 military planes to evacuate 350 Spanish citizens from Lebanon MADRID — Spain’s Defense Minister Margarita Robles says that her government will send two military planes to evacuate 350 Spanish citizens from Lebanon. Robles said the planes will depart Spain on Thursday 'if conditions in the airspace allow it.' The announcement came a day after Spanish Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares urged Spaniards in Lebanon to leave the country and for Israel to stop its assault. Spain also has 676 soldiers in Lebanon deployed under a United Nations peacekeeping mission. Macron says France is committed to Israel's protection PARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron reiterated France’s commitment to Israel’s protection and said Paris has 'mobilized its military resources in the Middle East to counter the Iranian threat,' according to a statement from the French presidency on Wednesday. French military spokesman Col. Guillaume Vernet would not comment on military resources deployed after Iran has fired a barrage of missiles at Israel Tuesday. In April, France said its forces in the Middle East have intercepted Iranian missiles and drones targeting Israel. Macron condemned Iran’s attack on Israel 'in the strongest terms' and called on all countries involved in 'the dangerous escalation of tensions' in the Middle East 'to show the greatest restraint.' He reiterated France’s demand that 'Hezbollah cease its terrorist actions against Israel and its population,' according to the statement. The French president also called on Israel 'to end its military operations (in Lebanon) as soon as possible' because 'too many civilians have already become victims.' He said he hoped that Lebanon’s 'sovereignty and territorial integrity' would be restored after Israel’s military operations 'in strict compliance' with the United Nations Security Council resolution that ended the Israel-Hezbollah war in 2006. India says it's deeply concerned over Mideast escalation, advises Indians not to travel to Iran NEW DELHI — India on Wednesday said it was deeply concerned at the escalation of the security situation in the Middle East and reiterated its call for restraint by all concerned and protection of civilians. 'It is important that the conflict doesn’t take a wider regional dimension, and we urge that all issues be addressed through dialogue and diplomacy,' said a statement issued by the External Affairs Ministry. 'We are closely monitoring the recent escalation in security situation in the region,' the ministry said. It advised Indian nationals to avoid all non-essential travel to Iran. ``Those currently residing in Iran are requested to remain vigilant and stay in contact with the Indian Embassy in Tehran. Iran's foreign minister claims the ballistic missile attack on Israel was an act of self-defense TEHRAN, Iran — Iran’s foreign minister has described his nation’s ballistic missile attack on Israel as self-defense. Abbas Araghchi made the comments in a television interview on Wednesday in Tehran. 'We sent a message to the American side through the Swiss Embassy suggesting them not to get involved in the story,' Araghchi said. 'We will confront and answer any third party that enters any operation against us in support of the Zionist regime and we will have a crushing response.' He also reiterated that Iran’s response to Israel will be 'harsher' if Israel attacks Iran in response. South Korea to send military aircraft to evacuate its citizens from conflict areas in the Middle East SEOUL, South Korea – South Korea plans to send military aircraft to evacuate its citizens from conflict areas in the Middle East as he called a meeting to discuss the impact of intensified fighting in the region, President Yoon Suk Yeol said. Yoon’s government on Wednesday didn’t immediately provide more details about its evacuation plan, including how and when it would be carried out or the possible number of Koreans who could be flown home. There are reportedly about 480 South Korean nationals living in Israel, 130 in Lebanon and 110 in Iran. There’s increasing concern about a broader regional war in the Middle East after Iran on Tuesday fired a barrage of missiles at Israel and Israel began limited ground incursions into Lebanon targeting the Iran-backed Hezbollah group. During the government meeting in Seoul, Yoon instructed officials to operate a 24-hour monitoring system to track the Mideast developments and assess the impact on South Korea’s security and economy, including possible affects on energy supplies, trade logistics and supply chains. Germany's chancellor calls on Iran and Hezbollah to stop their attacks on Israel BERLIN — German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is calling on Iran and Hezbollah to stop their attacks on Israel and says Tehran is risking a wider regional conflagration. Scholz issued a statement on Wednesday strongly condemning Iran’s missile barrage against Israel the previous evening. He said that 'with this, Iran is risking setting the whole region on fire — that must be prevented under all circumstances. Hezbollah and Iran must cease their attacks on Israel immediately.' The chancellor added that Germany will continue to push for a cease-fire between Israel and the Hezbollah militant group, which he said must lead toward full implementation of a U.N. Security Council resolution that calls for Hezbollah to withdraw from the area near the Israeli border. Scholz said that would 'clear the way for people to return to the north of Israel and at the same time open a prospect of consolidating Lebanon’s statehood.' Israeli airstrikes on southern Gaza kill 32 people, Palestinian medics say KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip — At least 32 people have been killed in Israeli strikes in southern Gaza overnight and into Wednesday, Palestinian medical officials said. The European Hospital in the hard-hit city of Khan Younis said it received the bodies after heavy Israeli airstrikes and ground operations in the city. It said the dead include several women and children, and that dozens of people were wounded. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. Israel has continued to strike what it says are militant targets across Gaza nearly a year after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack ignited the war there, even as attention has shifted to Lebanon, where Israel is battling Hezbollah, and to Iran, which launched a ballistic missile attack on Israel late Tuesday. Dr. Saleh al-Hams, head of the nursing department at the European Hospital, said dozens of dead and wounded people were brought to his facility and the Nasser Hospital starting at around 3 a.m. Some of the wounded were in critical condition, meaning the death toll could rise, he said. He said Israel had carried out heavy airstrikes as its ground forces staged an incursion into three neighborhoods in Khan Younis. Israel carried out a massive offensive earlier this year that left large parts of the city in ruins. Denmark police report 2 explosions overnight near Israeli Embassy COPENHAGEN — Police in Denmark said two explosions took place overnight in the vicinity of the Israeli Embassy in Copenhagen. In a post on X, the police said no one had been injured and an investigation was underway. Police had cordoned off the area while police with search dogs and forensic teams were inspecting the area. Addressing local media on Wednesday morning, police refused to give details about the intensity of the reported blasts or the damage they may have caused, and said it was too early to say if the explosion was aimed at the embassy. On Tuesday night, the area around the Israel embassy in Stockholm was also closed off after a loud bang was reported. Police later announced that findings from the scene indicated that the embassy was hit by bullets, according to the TT news agency. UK helped Israel repel Iranian missiles LONDON — The U.K. defense chief said Britain’s military helped Israel repel a missile attack from Iran. Writing on X, Defense Secretary John Healey said British forces 'played their part in attempts to prevent further escalation in the Middle East.' He did not give details of U.K. involvement. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the U.K. supports Israel’s right to self defense, stating that 'Iran has menaced the Middle East for far too long.' In a televised statement after the missile attack on Tuesday night, Starmer said Iran’s missile attack had left the region 'on the brink' and he was 'deeply concerned about the risk of miscalculation.' Starmer said he spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Tuesday as part of efforts to prevent a wider conflict. Starmer’s office said he was on the phone with Netanyahu when the Iranian attack began. Chinese citizens evacuate from Lebanon BEIJING — China’s official Xinhua news agency said 146 Chinese nationals and five members of their families arrived in Beijing on Wednesday after being evacuated from Lebanon on a charter flight. The report said that all Chinese citizens who wanted to evacuate have left the country, while the Chinese Embassy in Lebanon will continue its duties. Australian PM condemns Iranian attack MELBOURNE, Australia — Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese condemned Iran’s missile attack on Israel and called for de-escalation. 'We’re very concerned about Iran’s actions, which is why we condemn them,' Albanese told reporters in Melbourne, Australia, on Wednesday. 'It is a good thing that it would appear that the defense of Israel, supported by the United States, has ensured that there is no loss of civilian life, it would appear, at this stage. There’s been too much loss of life in that region,' Albanese added. Albanese said Israel had a right to defend itself. 'What we have called for consistently is for a de-escalation in the region, along with our friends in the United States and others,' Albanese said. UN says main Yemeni ports operational after Israeli airstrikes but power stations damaged UNITED NATIONS — Yemen’s two main ports remain operational following Israeli airstrikes, but the strikes damaged power stations, the United Nations says. U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Tuesday that the U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Yemen went to assess the situation at Yemen’s main port of Hodeida and nearby port of Ras Isa following Sunday’s Israeli strikes targeting sites used by Houthi rebels in the ports in western Yemen. Israel said it was retaliating for a Houthi missile fired at central Israel on Saturday which was shot down. The Houthis said it was aimed at Ben Gurion Airport, where Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s plane had just arrived from New York where he addressed the annual meeting of world leaders at the United Nations. Dujarric said the U.N.’s humanitarian partners reported Tuesday that 'after conducting an initial assessment, both ports remain operational and able to receive commercial and humanitarian supplies.' 'Power stations throughout Hodeida city are, however, running at a very limited capacity,' the U.N. spokesman said. Top Iranian commander warns Israel not to retaliate or risk attacks on infrastructure TEHRAN, Iran — A top Iranian military commander has warned that his country will hit Israel’s infrastructure if it takes any action against its territory. Iran’s armed forces joint chief of staff Gen. Mohammad Bagheri said Wednesday that the Revolutionary Guard was prepared both defensively and offensively to repeat its missile attack with 'multiplied intensity.' 'If the Zionist regime, that has gone insane, is not contained by America and Europe and intends to continue such crimes, or do anything against our sovereignty or territorial integrity, tonight’s operation will be repeated with much higher magnitude and we will hit all their infrastructure,' he said. Bagheri said Iran avoided targeting Israeli civilians although it was 'completely feasible.' Israeli ambassador says his country's response to Iranian missile attack will be ‘painful’ UNITED NATIONS — Israel’s U.N. ambassador says his government will decide when and how to respond to Iran’s barrage of close to 200 ballistic missiles that forced Israel’s 10 million population into bomb shelters. 'But I can tell you one thing, it will be noticed,' he said. 'It will be painful.' Danny Danon reacted to a statement from Iran’s U.N. Mission that any new Israeli action would be met with a 'crushing response,' saying: 'I would not advise Iran to challenge our determination, our capabilities. In the past, we have proved it. We will prove it again.' 'We have no desire for war or escalation, but we cannot sit idly by when our civilians are being attacked in such manner,' the Israeli ambassador said. 'Iran used to send boxes but now, when they send almost 200 ballistic missiles, that’s something that I don’t think any other nation in the world will ignore.'	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-hamas-latest-mideast-2-october-2024-9e71114e59ce259511eba59833c84426	2024-10-01T20:00:24-07:00	
Sex workers find themselves at the center of Congo's mpox outbreak	KAMITUGA, Congo (AP) — It's been four months since Sifa Kunguja recovered from mpox, but as a sex worker, she said, she's still struggling to regain clients, with fear and stigma driving away people who've heard she had the virus. 'It’s risky work,' Kunguja, 40, said from her small home in eastern Congo. 'But if I don’t work, I won't have money for my children.' Sex workers are among those hardest-hit by the mpox outbreak in Kamituga, where some 40,000 of them are estimated to reside — many single mothers driven by poverty to this mineral-rich commercial hub where gold miners comprise the majority of the clientele. Doctors estimate 80% of cases here have been contracted sexually, though the virus also spreads through other kinds of skin-to-skin contact. Sex workers say the situation threatens their health and livelihoods. Health officials warn that more must be done to stem the spread — with a focus on sex workers — or mpox will creep deeper through eastern Congo and the region. Mpox causes mostly mild symptoms such as fever and body aches, but serious cases can mean prominent, painful blisters on the face, hands, chest and genitals. Kunguja and other sex workers insist that despite risks of reinfection or spreading the virus, they have no choice but to keep working. Sex work isn't illegal in Congo, though related activities such as solicitation are. Rights groups say possible legal consequences and fear of retribution — sex workers are subject to high rates of violence including rape and abuse — prevent women from seeking medical care. That can be especially detrimental during a public health emergency, according to experts. Health officials in Kamituga are advocating for the government to shutter nightclubs and mines and compensate sex workers for lost business. Not everyone agrees. Local officials say they don't have resources to do more than care for those who are sick, and insist it's sex workers' responsibility to protect themselves. Kamituga Mayor Alexandre Bundya M’pila told The Associated Press that the government is creating awareness campaigns but lacks money to reach everyone. He also said sex workers should look for other jobs, without providing examples of what might be available. Sex work is a big part of the economy Miners stream into Kamituga by the tens of thousands. The economy is centered on the mines: Buyers line streets, traders travel to sell gold, small businesses and individuals provide food and lodging, and the sex industry flourishes. Nearly a dozen sex workers spoke to AP. They said well over half their clients are miners. The industry is well organized, according to the Kenyan-based African Sex Workers Alliance, composed of sex worker-led groups. The alliance estimates that 13% of Kamituga's 300,000 residents are sex workers. The town has 18 sex-worker committees, the alliance said, with a leadership that tries to work with government officials, protect and support colleagues, and advocate for their rights. But sex work in Congo is dangerous. Women face systematic violence that's tolerated by society, according to a report by UMANDE, a local sex-worker rights group. Many women are forced into the industry because of poverty or because, like Kunguja, they're single parents and must support their families. Getting mpox can put sex workers out of business The sex workers who spoke to AP described mpox as an added burden. Many are terrified of getting the virus — it means time away from work, lost income and perhaps losing business altogether. Those who recover are stigmatized, they said. Kamituga is a small place, where most everyone knows one another. Neighbors whisper and tell clients when someone is sick — people talk and point. Since contracting mpox in May, Kunguja said she's gone from about 20 clients daily to five. When she was sick, the lesions on her genitals were so painful she could hardly walk, hunched over and wobbling to get around. Her 9-year-old son caught it from her, she said — he’s out of the hospital but still has lesions. She's been supporting her 11 children through sex work for nearly a decade, but said she now can't afford to send them to school. To compensate, she's selling alcohol by day, but it's not enough. She said she wants the government to subsidize her income so she doesn't have to put herself or others at risk. Experts say information and awareness are key Disease experts say a lack of vaccines and information makes stemming the spread difficult. Some 250,000 vaccines have arrived in Congo, but it’s unclear when any will get to Kamituga. Sex workers and miners are among those slated to receive them first. Community leaders and aid groups are trying to teach sex workers about protecting themselves and their clients via awareness sessions where they discuss signs and symptoms. They also press condom use, which they say isn't widespread enough in the industry. Sex workers told AP that they insist on using condoms when they have them, but that they simply don't have enough. Kamituga’s general hospital gives them boxes of about 140 condoms every few months. Some sex workers see up to 60 clients a day — for less than $1 a person. Condoms run out, and workers say they can’t afford more. Dr. Guy Mukari, an epidemiologist working with the National Institute of Biomedical Research in Congo, noted that the variant running rampant in Kamituga seems more susceptible to transmission via sex, making for a double whammy with the sex industry. Even health experts admit the lack of information about the virus makes it unclear how effective condoms are. Lesions are usually found around the base of the penis, an area that condoms don’t cover, they note. Some women resort to flimsy plastic bags when they can't find condoms, sex worker Irene Mabwidi said. As a leader in her local sex industry group, she said she tries to advise women on other protection measures, such as inspecting clients’ bodies for lesions, though that's far from foolproof. Erin Kilbride of Human Rights Watch said it’s crucial that sex workers are in the room when the government designs outreach programs. 'The government should proactively reach out to sex worker organizations, at the local and national level, who are experts in what their communities need,' Kilbride said. Mines also lack safety measures Health experts say miners are also key to containing the virus. While mpox is spread mainly through close contact, it can also occasionally spread from the environment via objects or surfaces touched by an infected person, according to the World Health Organization. There's little awareness of that in mines, where conditions are often unsanitary. Mines have few, if any, handwashing stations, and sometimes miners don’t shower for days. Infected miners might urinate or openly defecate in mines and contaminate water sources, health officials say. Miners told AP more information and advocacy is needed in mines. Debus Bulambo said he got mpox in February, but sees most fellow miners failing to take the virus seriously. People want to spend cash on sex, even during an epidemic, sometimes paying five times more to go without a condom, he noted. And miners earn a lot — up to about $120 a month, more than double the country’s average annual income. Bulambo said he occasionally paid for sex in the past but stopped, though he realizes he's the exception. 'People aren’t afraid,' he said bluntly. 'I don’t understand.' ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

Japan's Kojima, with its proud Jeans Street, draws fans of vintage, deep-blue denim	KOJIMA, Japan (AP) — Denim, that All-American fabric, is all about being Japanese in the town of Kojima, where the main road is named Jeans Street, with real pairs of pants flapping like flags overhead. Some would call this spot in southwestern seaside Okayama Prefecture a mecca of jeans, where fans from around the world make pilgrimage. The soda vending machines at the train station are plastered with the image of jeans. The roads are painted blue, with the lines at the edges pink and white, the trademark of Kojima jeans’ seams. With some 40 jeans manufacturers and stores, including denim-themed cafes, the area draws about 100,000 visitors a year, according to the Japan National Tourism Organization. Japanese jeans tend to be high-end, dark and durable. Although a tiny part of the global jeans market, they have carved out a niche with a reputation for craftsmanship. Kojima gave birth to popular brands like Big John, with roots dating to the 1940s, and now supplies international fashion brands, including Gucci. 'The Japanese industry has established a way of looking at denim from a much more connoisseurship and collecting approach' than a mass marketing one, says Emma McClendon, assistant professor of fashion studies at St. John’s University in New York. The ‘art of making things’ applies to jeans, too In Kojima, you might be in for a disappointment if you expect the glamour of a fashion center. Jeans Street is quaint and uncrowded. Each company in the region is relatively small, hiring about 100 people. What you will find are people taking pride in 'monozukuri,' or 'making things,' connoting a devoted, laborious attention to detail. It’s an ethic entrenched throughout Japan, from big carmakers to the local tofu store. 'More like making a kimono' is the way Yoshiharu Okamoto, a dyeing craftsman at Kojima-based manufacturer Momotaro Jeans, puts it. His hands and nails are tinged blue from dipping threads of Zimbabwean cotton into a big pail of dye. He knows by smell and feel the right state of the indigo, which he compares to a living thing. He swears it’s a 365-days-a-year job, as the dye has to be checked and mixed every day. 'It’s not that easy to get this special color,' Okamoto told The Associated Press during a recent tour of the production facilities. 'It’s my life.' The dark indigo hue of Made-in-Japan denim, much of it hailing from Kojima, is so distinctive it has earned the name 'Japan blue,' also known as 'tokuno blue,' which translates to 'especially concentrated blue.' Expect to pay more for Kojima denim Jeans made here aren’t cheap, ranging in price from a relatively affordable 33,000 yen ($230) per pair to those made by top craftsmen, which go for 200,000 yen ($1,400) or more. Thomas Stege Bojer, founder of Denimhunters, an online site devoted to denim, says Japanese brands use 'raw denim' that ages well and lasts a long time. He echoed the ' slow clothing' movement that has arisen in reaction to cheaper, mass-produced clothes. 'We just make too many clothes. The cycle is too fast, I think, and we need to slow down,' Bojer said from his home near Copenhagen, Denmark, where the walls are decorated with jeans. As McClendon, the fashion professor, put it, the Japanese industry is 'shifting the conversation around jeans to be about heritage elements, about educating consumers on historical details as a form of quality.' Momotaro Jeans, for instance, come with a lifetime warranty: Tears and other problems get fixed for free, within reason. Japan Blue Co., which runs Momotaro, a brand that debuted in 2006, said annual sales totaled about 1.6 billion yen ($11 million) for the latest year. About 40% of sales come from outside Japan. A region with a sewing and industrial history Like craftsman Okamoto, Shigeru Uchida, a loom specialist, and Naomi Takebayashi, who works at a sewing machine, believe they have special skills they must guard and hand to the next generation. They spoke while leading a group of younger sewers. The two say they have a special relationship with their machines. They listen to the machines' sounds to make daily adjustments. The clattering power looms are vintage Toyodas, from the weaving company that preceded automaker Toyota. Spare parts are hard to find. There is one loom operated by hand, used for products that the company says boast a unique texture. Masataka Suzuki, president and chief operating officer at Japan Blue, says the industrial history of the region is a source of strength, centered around sewing heavy fabrics, including military clothes and obi sashes for kimonos, as well as the cotton and indigo-dyeing native to the area. That’s why the jeans are for life, Suzuki said, fading and creasing, depending on how they’re worn and how the wearer lives. 'We want to create a product that is a testament to a person’s life,' he said. ___ Yuri Kageyama is on X: https://x.com/yurikageyama	https://apnews.com/article/japan-jeans-denim-kojima-indigo-291d243b88d5c8b67108e2641f739569	2024-10-01T19:44:41-07:00	
Thai police arrest driver and work to identify victims of the school bus fire that killed 23	BANGKOK (AP) — Thai police have arrested the driver of a bus carrying young students and teachers that caught fire and killed 23 in suburban Bangkok, as families arrived in the capital Wednesday to help identify their loved ones. The bus carrying six teachers and 39 students in elementary and junior high school was traveling from Uthai Thani province, about 300 kilometers (186 miles) north of Bangkok, for a school trip in Ayutthaya and Nonthaburi provinces Tuesday. The fire started while the bus was on a highway north of the capital and spread so quickly many were unable to escape. Trairong Phiwpan, head of the police forensic department, said 23 bodies were recovered from the bus. The recovery work and confirmation of the total dead had been delayed earlier because the burned vehicle, which was fueled with natural gas, remained too hot to enter for hours. The families were driven from Uthai Thani in vans to the the forensic department at the Police General Hospital in Bangkok on Wednesday to provide their DNA samples for the identification process. Kornchai Klaiklung, assistant to the Royal Thai Police chief, told reporters the forensics team was working as fast as it could to identify the victims. The driver, identified by the police as Saman Chanput, surrendered Tuesday evening several hours after the fire. Police said they have charged him with reckless driving causing deaths and injuries, failing to stop to help others and failing to report the accident. The driver told investigators he was driving normally until the bus lost balance at its front right tire, hit another car and scraped a concrete highway barrier, causing the sparks that ignited the blaze, Chayanont Meesati, deputy regional police chief, told reporters. The driver said he ran to grab a fire extinguisher from another bus that was traveling for the same trip but he could not put out the fire, and ran away because he panicked, Chayanont said. Police said they are also investigating whether the bus company followed all safety standards. In an interview with public broadcaster Thai PBS, bus company owner Songwit Chinnaboot said the bus was inspected for safety twice a year as required and that the gas cylinders had passed the safety standards. He also said he would compensate the victims’ families as best as he could. Three students are hospitalized, and the hospital said two of them were in serious condition. A 7-year-old girl suffered burns on her face, and a surgeon said doctors were doing their best to try to save her eyesight.	https://apnews.com/article/thailand-school-bus-fire-56780d1c64bc4474fb3157a6740cf938	2024-10-01T19:32:11-07:00	
Harris, Trump's approach to Mideast crisis, hurricane to test public mood in final weeks of campaign	WASHINGTON (AP) — A trio of new trials — a devastating hurricane, expanding conflict in the Mideast and a dockworkers strike that threatens the U.S. economy — are looming over the final weeks of the presidential campaign and could help shape the public mood as voters decide between Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump. How events shake out — and how the candidates respond — could be decisive as they claw for votes in battleground states. The sitting president, Joe Biden, is still the steward of a U.S. economy and foreign policy at this tumultuous moment and may well bear ultimate responsibility for how they play out. But how Harris and Trump approach the three disparate issues could have rippling impact on how Americans perceive their two choices this November. 'Unfortunately, there are going to be events like this, and this is where you see the leadership of a president show up,' White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Tuesday. 'I think this should send a message to Americans: It matters. It matters who sits behind the Resolute Desk.' Harris, with Biden's help, is trying to display steady calm as a flurry of difficult problems arise all at once. She and Biden on Tuesday toggled between directing Hurricane Helene recovery and rescue response work and huddling with aides in the White House Situation Room to watch as the U.S. helped Israel defend against a massive attack by Iran in retaliation for the killing of Tehran-backed leaders of Lebanese Hezbollah. All the while, they were keeping close contact with economic advisers as dockworkers took to the picket line Tuesday, a walkout stretching from ports in Maine to Texas that threatens to snarl supply chains and cause shortages and higher prices if it stretches on for more than a few weeks. Trump, for his part, lashed out at Harris as in over her head, while claiming that this sort of crush of problems never would have happened under his watch. 'We have been talking about World War III, and I don’t want to make predictions,' Trump said at a campaign event in Wisconsin. 'The whole world is laughing at us. That’s why Israel was under attack just a little while ago. Because they don’t respect our country anymore.' Yet voters cast Trump aside four years ago in large part because of how they viewed his handling of the swirling economic, social and public health challenges that emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic. Biden, in comments to reporters before meeting with aides Tuesday to discuss the ongoing hurricane response, seemed to acknowledge the growing frustration with the federal response to the massive storm. 'I’ve been in frequent contact with the governors and other leaders in the impacted areas, and we have to jumpstart this recovery process,' Biden said. He will travel to the Carolinas on Wednesday to get a closer look at the hurricane devastation. He is also expected to visit hurricane-impacted areas in Georgia and Florida later this week. 'People are scared to death. People wonder whether they’re going to make it.' Harris, meanwhile, is headed to Georgia on Wednesday and North Carolina in the coming days to do the same. Tuesday's vice presidential debate offered a sampling of how the two campaigns were reacting to new developments to bolster their own messages and sharpen their attacks on their rivals. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz promised 'steady leadership' under Harris while Ohio Sen. JD Vance pledged a return to 'peace through strength' if Trump is returned to the White House. Biden has stayed off the campaign trail since announcing in July that he was ending his reelection effort amid sliding public approval ratings. His conspicuous absence underscores that Democrats see him as more of a liability than an asset in making the case for Harris, said Christopher Borick, director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion in Pennsylvania. But how well Biden deals with the three latest emergency situations could have a big impact in how undecided voters perceive Harris in these final days. 'President Biden can't help Kamala Harris on the stump,' Borick said. 'But in a campaign where you are turning over every rock in a few states to get that undecided voter, how he manages these crises over the next several weeks could have an impact.' The Harris campaign understands the risks it faces with multiple crises converging all at once, especially given their varied and unpredictable nature. A prolonged strike, a bungled disaster response or a further expansion of Middle East conflict could raise doubts about Biden's leadership, and by extension that of his second-in-command. At the same time, Harris campaign aides believe the perilous moment presents an opportunity to demonstrate to voters the stakes of who’s in the job and the seriousness with which they approach it, according to campaign officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal thinking. The former president, in a speech in Waunakee, Wisconsin, and in social media postings Tuesday, offered a mixture of prayer and concern for those impacted by Helene, jabs at Harris for the dockworkers strike, and an aside about the casting of Stanley Kubrick's film 'Full Metal Jacket.' 'The situation should have never come to this and, had I been president, it would not have,' Trump said in a statement about the strike. Harris aides made a point of having the vice president deliver brief remarks on the Iranian attack Tuesday in between taping interviews for her campaign, aiming to portray her as ready to take command. Late-term tumult has been fixture in American presidential politics, sometimes in the form of scandal and other times with an incumbent hoping to demonstrate that he or his preferred successor would be a steady head at an uncertain time. George W. Bush pushed a rescue package through Congress to stabilize a reeling financial system by creating the Troubled Asset Relief Program amid fears that the economy was on the verge of collapse. The broader economic conditions didn't help Republican John McCain in the race he lost to Barack Obama. Jimmy Carter's reelection campaign in 1980 was paralyzed by the Iran hostage crisis. Fifty-two hostages were released on January 20, 1981, soon after his successor, Ronald Reagan, was inaugurated. Lyndon Johnson announced a halting of bombings in North Vietnam days before the 1968 election, a step he hoped would bring the conflict toward a peace settlement. But the South Vietnamese indicated they would not negotiate and Johnson's vice president, Hubert Humphrey, lost narrowly to Republican Richard Nixon. 'The efforts by incumbents to help themselves or their party's nominee with ‘October surprises’ go back quite a ways,' said Edward Frantz, a University of Indianapolis historian. 'In this current climate, I'm not sure how many voters can be persuaded by a candidate this late in the game trying to show competency.' ___ Beaumont reported from Des Moines, Iowa.

Tokyo shares fall, Hong Kong's advance as tensions escalate in the Middle East	Asian shares were mixed on Wednesday, with Tokyo’s benchmark falling while Hong Kong’s advanced despite the sharp escalation of tensions in the Middle East. Oil prices extended gains after Iran fired dozens of missiles into Israel, potentially raising the risk of disruptions to supplies. That news overshadowed an upbeat report showing U.S. job openings rose unexpectedly in August as the American labor market continued to show resilience. But regional trading was thin, with mainland Chinese markets closed for a weeklong national holiday. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 lost 1.7% to 37,993.18. It has retreated since the ruling Liberal Democratic Party chose Shigeru Ishiba to lead the government, replacing Fumio Kishida, who stepped aside on Tuesday. A weaker Japanese yen and higher energy prices would add to Ishiba's burdens as he works to pep up the economy. The dollar was trading at 143.82 yen, up from 143.57 yen late Tuesday. Hong Kong's Hang Seng jumped 2.3% to 21,615.87, riding a wave of investor enthusiasm over recent moves by Beijing to rev up the Chinese economy with policies aimed at reviving the ailing property sector and supporting financial markets. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 was flat at 8,208.50 and the Kospi in Seoul lost 0.5% to 2,579.63. On Tuesday, U.S. stocks retreated from their records, with the S&amp;P 500 dropping 0.9% to 5,708.75. The Dow dropped 0.4% to 42,156.97, and the Nasdaq composite lost 1.5% to 17,910.36. White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan called Iran’s missile attack a 'significant escalation,' although he said it was ultimately 'defeated and ineffective.' Israel is not a major producer of oil, but Iran is, and the potential for a wider conflict could affect other, neighboring producers of crude. The price for a barrel of benchmark U.S. crude rose as much as 5% before settling 2.4% higher. Brent crude, the international standard, rallied 2.6%. Early Wednesday, U.S. crude was up $1.15 at $70.98 per barrel. Brent crude climbed $1.10 to $74.66 per barrel. On Tuesday, oil-and-gas producers logged some of the market’s biggest gains. ConocoPhillips rose 3.9%, and Exxon Mobil climbed 2.3%. Shares of defense contractors also rallied. Northrop Grumman rose 3%, and RTX added 2.7%. RTX partners with Israeli company Rafael Advanced Defense Systems to make the 'Iron Dome' air defense system that Israel’s government uses. Most U.S. shares fell. The all-time high that the S&amp;P 500 set on Monday was its 43rd of the year so far. Stocks had been jumping on hopes the U.S. economy can continue to grow despite a slowdown in the job market, as the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates to give it more juice. The Fed last month lowered its main interest rate for the first time in more than four years, and it’s indicated it will deliver more cuts through next year. The dominant question hanging over Wall Street is whether the cuts will ultimately prove to be too little, too late after the Fed earlier kept rates at a two-decade high in hopes of braking on the economy enough to stamp out high inflation. A discouraging report arrived Tuesday, showing U.S. manufacturing weakened by more in September than economists expected. Another threat to the economy could lie in a strike by dockworkers at 36 ports across the eastern United States that could snarl supply chains and drive up inflation. The workers are asking for a labor contract that doesn’t allow automation to take their jobs, among other things. Supply chain experts say consumers won’t see an immediate impact because most retailers have stocked up on goods, moving ahead shipments of holiday gift items. An encouraging update from Europe showed inflation among the 20 countries that use the euro came in below 2% in September, the first time that’s happened in more than three years. That could give the European Central Bank leeway to cut interest rates more quickly.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-rates-strike-iran-3c147dc46c6ef60cd1e16dd099c4be3e	2024-10-01T19:19:27-07:00	
After pressing an Israel-Hezbollah cease-fire, the Biden administration shifts its message	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration says there is a significant difference between Israeli actions that have expanded its war against the Iranian-backed militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah and Iran’s retaliatory missile attack against Israel, which it condemned as escalatory. In carefully calibrated remarks, officials across the administration are defending the surge in attacks by Israel against Hezbollah leaders in Lebanon, while still pressing for peace and vowing retribution after Iran fired about 200 ballistic missiles at Israel on Tuesday. President Joe Biden praised the U.S. and Israel militaries for defeating the barrage and warned, 'Make no mistake, the United States is fully, fully supportive of Israel.' Secretary of State Antony Blinken called the Iranian missile attack 'totally unacceptable, and the entire world should condemn it.' There was little criticism that Israel may have provoked Iran's assault. 'Obviously, this is a significant escalation by Iran,' national security adviser Jake Sullivan said. Just a week after calling urgently for an immediate cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah to avoid the possibility of all-out war in the Middle East, the administration has shifted its message as Israel presses ahead with ground incursions in Lebanon following a massive airstrike Friday in Beirut that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and Iranian Revolutionary Guard Gen. Abbas Nilforushan. U.S. officials stress that they have repeatedly come out in support of Israel’s right to defend itself and that any change in their language only reflects evolving conditions on the ground. And, officials say the administration’s goal — a cease-fire — has remained constant. The U.S. has been quick to praise and defend Israel for a series of recent strikes killing Hezbollah leaders. In contrast to its repeated criticism of Israel's war in Gaza that has killed civilians, the U.S. has taken a different tack on strikes that targeted Nasrallah and others but also may have killed innocent people. At the Pentagon, Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder made it clear that while the U.S. is still 'laser focused' on preventing a wider conflict in the Middle East, he carved out broad leeway for Israel to keep going after Hezbollah to protect itself. 'We understand and support Israel’s right to defend itself against Hezbollah,' Ryder said. 'We understand that part of that is dismantling some of the attack infrastructure that Hezbollah has built along the border.' He said the U.S. is going to consult with Israel as it conducts limited operations against Hezbollah positions along the border 'that can be used to threaten Israeli citizens.' The goal, he said, is to allow citizens on both sides of the border to return to their homes. Part of the ongoing discussions that the U.S. will have with Israel, Ryder said, will focus on making sure there’s an understanding about potential 'mission creep' that could lead to tensions to escalate even further. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Tuesday that Israel’s targeting of senior Hamas and Hezbollah leaders as well as its initiation of ground incursions into Lebanon are justified because they were done in self-defense. 'If you look at the actions that they have taken, they were bringing terrorists to justice, terrorists who have launched attacks on Israeli civilians,' Miller said. By contrast, he said that Iran’s response was dangerous and escalatory because it was done in support of Hamas and Hezbollah, both of which are U.S.-designated terrorist organizations that Iran funds and supports. 'What you saw (was) Iran launching a state-on-state attack to protect and defend the terrorist groups that it built, nurtured and controlled,' Miller said. 'So there is a difference between the actions.' The full-throated defense of Israel, however, may come with risks. So far, there is little evidence that the Biden administration's push for a cease-fire and warnings of broadening the conflict have had much impact on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In commentary Monday, Jon Alterman, director of the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said that U.S. influence on Netanyahu seems to be waning and that he 'seems to have blown by U.S. cautions about starting a regional war.' The White House must 'worry that a sustained inability to make diplomatic progress weakens U.S. influence in the Middle East and around the world,' Alterman said, adding that 'Netanyahu’s assurance that the United States will stand by Israel in any circumstance emboldens Israel to take more risks than it otherwise would.' ___ Associated Press writer Tara Copp in Washington contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/middle-east-israel-hezbollah-united-states-8bed0f7a37b5059ba4c94552ff750f34	2024-10-01T19:10:56-07:00	
Republicans are more likely than Democrats to see Israel as a US ally: AP-NORC poll	WASHINGTON (AP) — After a year of war between Israel and Hamas, U.S. public opinion on the conflict remains polarized, a new survey by the Pearson Institute and The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds, with Democrats more likely to be critical of Israel, while Republicans remain more supportive. There are a few points of relative consensus — about half of U.S. adults, for example, say Hamas bears 'a lot' of responsibility for the continuation of the war, while about one quarter says it has 'some' responsibility and about 2 in 10 say it has 'not much' responsibility or 'none at all.' But U.S. adults remain divided on the extent to which the Israeli government is responsible for the conflict continuing. And the findings indicate that the past year of war hasn’t done much to widen or narrow the partisan gulf that existed early in the conflict. Democrats remain more sympathetic toward the Palestinians than Republicans and more critical of Israel, while Republicans are more likely to sympathize with the Israelis and view Israel as a U.S. ally that shares the United States' values and interests. However, it’s unclear from this survey if public opinion will shift as the war in the Middle East expands beyond Gaza. It was conducted from Sept. 12 to 16, before Israel’s military significantly escalated its operations against Hezbollah in Lebanon and before Iran launched missiles at Israel on Tuesday. Hamas, based in Gaza, and Hezbollah, based in Lebanon, are militant groups allied with Iran. Americans largely don't blame the US government President Joe Biden has maintained crucial U.S. military support to Israel throughout the Gaza war, while repeatedly trying — and failing — to broker a cease-fire. Americans are most likely to place 'a lot' of blame on Hamas for the continuation of the war between Israel and the militant group, followed by the Israeli government, and the Iranian government and groups backed by Iran. They place much less responsibility on their own country. Only about 1 in 10 Americans say the U.S. government bears 'a lot' of responsibility for the continuation of the war between Israel and Hamas, while about 4 in 10 say it bears 'some' responsibility, and 45% say the U.S. bears 'not much' or no responsibility at all. Democrats are slightly more likely than Republicans to say the U.S. has 'some' responsibility, but overall the partisan differences on this question are small. Brian Grider, a 48-year-old Republican from Moscow, Ohio, isn't sure how the U.S. could defuse the conflict. 'I don’t know if there’s anything we can do,' he said. 'It would be nice if we could and we might want to try, but is it going to work? Probably not.' Republicans more likely than Democrats to see Israel as an ally The year of fighting appears to have calcified the partisan divide on the war and the U.S. relationship with Israel. About half of Republicans view Israel as an ally of the U.S. that shares its values and interests, while about half of Democrats think Israel is a partner that the U.S. should cooperate with but that doesn't share American values and interests. More than half of Democrats also say the Israeli government bears 'a lot' of responsibility for the continuation of the war, compared to about 4 in 10 Republicans. Brian Becker, a 49-year-old Democrat in Colorado, says his views of the war shifted after hearing more on social media about Palestinians and Palestinian Americans who were harmed by the war. 'I didn’t feel like that was fair for them,' Becker said. 'So that did start to change my mind a little bit, started to give that waver of support to Palestine,' he said. 'Where before I probably would have been just, ‘Yeah, go Israel.'’ On the other hand, about half of Republicans say they sympathize more with the Israelis than the Palestinians, while Democrats are more likely to say they sympathize with both groups equally. Grider, the Ohio Republican, thinks Israel responded appropriately to the Oct. 7 attack, comparing it to the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks in the U.S. 'I definitely don't think Israel is doing too much in response to what happened to them,' he said. Overall views of the war remain stable Views of the Israel-Hamas conflict, and the U.S. role in mediating it, haven't shifted much over the course of the year. Support for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state rose slightly, from around 2 in 10 in August 2023 to about 3 in 10 now. (About half of Americans currently say they neither favor nor oppose an independent Palestinian state, and about 2 in 10 are opposed.) There was also a slight uptick in the share of Americans who think the U.S. is too supportive of Israel. But about 4 in 10 U.S. adults continue to say the U.S. is spending 'too much' on military aid to Israel in the war, while a similar share say the U.S. is spending 'the right amount.' About 1 in 10 say the U.S. is spending 'too little,' which is in line with an AP-NORC poll conducted in early 2024. The mix of U.S. opinions on the Gaza war reflects the complexity of a conflict where Americans may see bad actors and innocent victims on both sides, according to Paul Poast, a political scientist at the University of Chicago and a research affiliate of the Pearson Institute. 'This leads to people having very strong views on both sides, which, of course, we’ve seen,' Poast said. And it doesn’t, he added, make for 'a consistent narrative of, ‘We’ve got to support Israel,' or 'We’ve got to support the Palestinians.’' Hamas killed about 1,200 people in Israel on Oct. 7 and took hostages, some of whom are still being held in Gaza. Israel’s military campaign in Gaza has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians. Gaza health officials do not distinguish between civilians and combatants in their death toll but say many of those killed are women and children. Charles Jolivette, a 42-year-old Democrat in New Orleans who developed concerns about Israel’s offensive through discussions with friends and colleagues who have Palestinian heritage, has observed a kind of echo-chamber effect, where people on the different sides of the issue seem to only hear views that reflect their own beliefs. 'But I would love to have some more,' Jolivette said, referring to exchanges of view with people who see the conflict differently. And for 'not only mainstream media, but the mainstream American populace, to have that ability to have these real conversations.' ___ The poll of 1,111 adults was conducted using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 3.95 percentage points. __ Ellen Knickmeyer contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-hezbollah-iran-20b070612a8a76ee1d4d6c47864a2355	2024-10-01T19:05:17-07:00	
Palestinians in West Bank risk crossing Israel's separation barrier to flee failing economy	YATTA, West Bank (AP) — At dawn in mid-May, Sayyed Ayyed and dozens of other unemployed Palestinian men gathered at the foot of the towering wall of concrete and barbed wire dividing the occupied West Bank from Israel. A smuggler was there with a ladder and ropes. Each man handed over the equivalent of $100. Ayyed waited his turn as others clambered over. The 30-year-old father of two young daughters hadn’t found work for a year. Debts were mounting. Rent had to be paid. On the Israeli side, there was the lure of work on a construction site. He just had to get over the wall. 'When we reach the point where you see that your children do not have food,' he said, 'the barrier of fear is broken.' A year of war in Gaza has reverberated across the West Bank, where the World Bank warns the economy is at risk of collapse because of Israeli restrictions barring Palestinian laborers from entering the country for work, and the biggest wave of violence in decades. Unemployment has skyrocketed, reaching 30% from around 12% before the war. The past year, some 300,000 Palestinians in the West Bank, many of whom worked in Israel, have lost their jobs, the Palestinian Economy Ministry says. Over the first quarter of 2024, the territory’s economy contracted by 25%, according to the World Bank. Desperate for jobs, some Palestinians are resorting to smuggling themselves at great personal risk through the guarded barrier and into Israel. When they find them, Israeli security forces arrest them — or at times open fire. There are no official figures from Palestinian authorities about workers killed or injured by Israeli gunfire trying to cross the barrier. The Associated Press spoke to families of three Palestinians who said their relatives were killed trying to sneak across. 'These people are being shot at trying to go to work,' said Assaf Adiv, director of MAAN, a worker’s association that focuses on Palestinian labor rights. Wedding debt cost one Palestinian his life Before the war, some 150,000 Palestinians from the West Bank were crossing legally every day into Israel to work, mainly in construction, manufacturing and agriculture. After Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, Israeli authorities barred entry to most Palestinians, saying it was necessary for security. Tens of thousands of Palestinians became jobless overnight. Eyad al-Najjar, a 47-year-old laborer from a village near the West Bank town of Yatta, slipped into Israel through a barbed-wire section of the barrier in July, earning the equivalent of $650 for a week’s work, his family said. Then his son got married. The wedding set the family back $8,000. So al-Najjar tried his luck again. He approached a hole in the barrier Aug. 26, three days after the wedding. Israeli troops spotted al-Najjar and opened fire, killing him with a shot to the head, his relatives said. 'His children will have to work to close this debt in the future,' relative Jawadat al-Najjar said. 'No one helps in these difficult days.' The Israeli military told the AP it couldn't comment on the shooting without specific coordinates of where relatives said it happened. 'The IDF forces work to prevent illegal infiltrations and to maintain the security of the barrier and the safety of residents,' it said in a statement. 'The forces conduct proactive ambushes along the barrier, arresting infiltrators and infiltrator smugglers and operate both overtly and covertly to protect the barrier area.' Labor rights experts say infiltrations happen daily, often involving dozens of Palestinians at a time. Under restrictions, livelihoods have dried up Many Palestinians found their livelihoods gutted by the restrictions. Some sold possessions. On West Bank roadsides, children hawk tissues, bottled water and air fresheners. Some men have tried their hand at selling sandwiches at makeshift street stalls. It isn't just the cutoff from jobs in Israel. The military also tightened its grip in the West Bank, implementing a network of new military checkpoints that have hampered the movement of commerce and workers. Vehicles can wait for hours as soldiers inspect everyone, unlike before the war, when many were waved through. Other roads are shut off completely. In one case, the army closed a road linking 12 villages to the southern town of Dura, said local activist Badawi Jawaed. Many workers couldn’t reach their jobs and were laid off, he said. Violence has surged, with increased Israeli raids targeting armed groups. More than 700 West Bank Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire, the Palestinian Health Ministry says. Many were shot dead in armed clashes, others for throwing stones at troops. But some appear to have posed no apparent threat. In Israel, Palestinians can earn double or triple a West Bank salary. Standing in their way is Israel’s barrier, running some 700 kilometers (400 miles) long and peaking at 7-meters (23-feet) tall. Many climb over with ladders and ropes. Others hide in trucks that pass through checkpoints. Some slip through holes in fencing, workers and experts said. Ayyed once worked for an Israeli construction company that paid 7,000 shekels ($1,850) monthly. Cut off from the job since the war began, he searched for work in his home city of Jenin, in the northern West Bank. Ayyed said he tried grocery stores and restaurants, but no one was hiring. To get by, he borrowed money from friends, racking up around $1,600 in debt. He cut back on water and electricity. By spring, he had no one left to borrow from and a $500 monthly rent bill to pay. So he decided to risk it. As he scaled the wall, the ladder slipped. Ayyed fell to the ground on the West Bank side, breaking his leg. He limped home penniless. Smuggling rings run by gangs Palestinian smugglers or middlemen linked to gangs on both sides of the barrier arrange the crossings. They provide ladders and rope, as well as vehicles on the Israeli side to whisk workers away from the patrolled barrier. They charge 300 to 1,000 shekels ($79 to $260), said Arafat Amro, a Palestinian labor rights expert. Once through, work isn't hard to find, due to a labor shortage across Israel, mostly in construction and agriculture, Palestinian workers and Amro said. To evade Israeli authorities, Palestinian workers are 'sleeping in the fields, they sleep in the farms, they sleep under the trees, at the construction sites,' Amro said. Raouf Adra, a laborer from Yatta, said he found two week’s work on a construction site in the southern Israeli town of Dimona that would have paid 350 shekels ($65) daily. After climbing the barrier and reaching the site, he was told he was forbidden to leave after his shifts, to prevent discovery. The next day, Israeli police stormed the site, arresting Adra and several other Palestinians. The Israeli site manager was nowhere to be seen. 'He ran away,' Adra said. Adra was handed a 40-day prison sentence and fined 1,500 shekels ($390). Once released, he was transported back to the West Bank and banned from entering Israel for three years. Desperate for work, this Palestinian would do it again Unable to walk after his fall in May, Ayyed said he had to sell the gold his family gave his wife as a wedding present and then his car. 'I know people who sold their furniture,' he said. Four months later, his broken leg is almost completely healed. Asked if he would try again, he replied: 'If the situation remains the same, I will consider it.'	https://apnews.com/article/jobs-palestinians-israel-barrier-economy-west-bank-2971f01fd6fd878399911cef00bfa087	2024-10-01T19:04:21-07:00

In India, warming climate pressures scientists to keep developing tougher seeds	BENGALURU, India (AP) — Unpredictable rains and increasing heat aren't just making life more difficult for the people of Rayanpet, a village in India's arid south. They're also taking a toll on the thousands of acres of rice grown here. 'We used to know when it would rain and for how long and we sowed our seeds accordingly,' said P. Ravinder Reddy, a former soldier who turned to farming on his family's land 16 years ago. 'Now it’s so unpredictable and many times the seeds don’t sprout either because there’s too much rain or it’s completely dry.' Fortunately for Reddy, agricultural research organizations in India have been working for years to engineer rice seeds that can better withstand the vagaries of climate. He's been experimenting with the new varieties for the past five years, and said they're giving better yields with less water and are more disease-resistant. 'I have planted them across a quarter of my 25-acre field because there’s still demand for older varieties but I think in a few years, we will use only these tougher seeds,' Reddy said. India is one of the world’s largest producers and consumers of wheat and rice. Research organizations here, like their counterparts around the world, have long worked to produce seeds that increase yields, withstand drought or resist plant diseases. It's a growing need as a changing climate leads to more extreme and unpredictable weather. According to a United Nations report released earlier this year, more than 700 million people went hungry last year and over a third of the global population is unable to afford a healthy diet, thus increasing the urgency for resilient seeds that can produce food reliably. Apart from India, other programs including a United States government program and privately funded projects are helping develop climate-resilient crops in Africa, Central America and other Asian countries. As India is among the countries most vulnerable to climate impacts, these new seeds are essential in ensuring it produces enough food for its people as well as for export. Defending against climate shocks As climate change intensifies, India’s nearly 120 million farmers — most with less than 5 acres of land — are seeing their livelihoods threatened by erratic rainfall patterns, rising temperatures and increased pest infestations. Some are taking to what is called natural farming — techniques like using natural fertilizers and planting crops alongside trees and other plants that can protect crops from wind, erosion and some extreme weather — to deal with climate change. But that can mean reduced yields, and India’s federal government is also promoting the use of climate-resilient seeds that don’t compromise yields. Increasing salinity in groundwater, heavy rainfall over short periods, prolonged droughts and even increasing nighttime temperatures can affect rice seeds, experts say. 'We really need these seeds to deal with these multiple issues created by global warming,' said Ashok Kumar Singh, former director of New Delhi-based Indian Agriculture Research Institute and a scientist who specializes in plant genetics and breeding. Singh has overseen the creation of multiple successful rice varieties to withstand pests and various plant diseases. And his organization, with funding from the federal agriculture ministry, has released more than 2,000 climate-resilient seed varieties in the last decade. Earlier this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi released 109 climate-resilient seeds across crops that included cereals, pulses and oilseeds like peanuts. India’s federal government has announced plans to ensure at least 25% of land tilled for paddy in the country will be sowed with climate-resilient seeds in the coming 'kharif' or winter crop season. 'We are breeding for multiple stressors, including heat and disease resistance,' said Janila Pasupuleti of International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics, based in Hyderabad. Pasupuleti said that this approach not only stabilizes yields but also enhances the nutritional quality of crops, benefiting both farmers and consumers. Logistical issues that need ironing out Even as scientists are creating climate-resilient seeds regularly, making sure the seeds reach the maximum number of farmers is critical. Ensuring that farmers know about such seeds, can afford them, and are trained to use them properly is as important as creating the seeds, said Aditi Mukherji, director for climate change adaptation and mitigation at the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research and an author of several United Nations climate reports. Mukherji noted that India’s green revolution in agriculture, which took place in the 1960s when agriculture was modernized to ensure food security and increase yields of food grains such as wheat and rice across the country, succeeded because such services were available and well-coordinated by state and federal governments at that time. Agriculture scientists also say there's a need for more funding for research and development — equivalent to at least 1% of the agricultural gross domestic product, said Singh, the agriculture scientist. In Rayanpet village, Reddy is preparing to sow rice seeds for the winter season in a few weeks, and says he hopes to expand the area that gets the climate-resilient seeds. 'It’s good to keep trying new seeds as after some time all of them will have some issue or the other. If the government can also make sure we get good prices for our crops after harvest, that would help farmers like us a great deal,' he said. ___ Follow Sibi Arasu on X at @sibi123 ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Indian soccer team refuses to travel to Iran for game because of security fears	KOLKATA, India (AP) — India’s Mohun Bagan Super Giants has refused to travel to Iran to play Tractor SC in an Asian Champions League Two match scheduled for Wednesday because of the escalating security problems in the country and region. The Kolkata club asked the Asian Football Confederation to reschedule the match, which was due to take place in the northwestern city of Tabriz. The teams play in the continent’s second-tier competition. The organization released a statement on Tuesday that said: 'The matter will be referred to the relevant AFC Committees with further updates to be communicated in due course.' In the top-tier Asian Champions League Elite, four-time champion Al-Hilal of Saudi Arabia made it two victories from two with a 5-0 win over Al-Shorta of Iraq. Marcos Leonardo, signed from Benfica as cover for the injured Neymar, opened the scoring after 11 minutes. Aleksandar Mitrovic made it 2-0 four minutes later. Salem Al-Dawsari, Nasser Al-Dawsari and Mohamed Kanno each scored in the second half. Elsewhere, Qatar’s Al-Gharafa of Qatar defeated Al-Ain of the United Arab Emirates 4-2. The 24 teams in the revamped tournament are divided into two groups of 12 — one based in the west and one in the east — with the top eight from each progressing to the round of 16. In the eastern zone, Gwangju FC of South Korea won a second game in its first appearance in Asia with a 1-0 win at Kawasaki Frontale of Japan. Jasir Asani’s first-half penalty was enough. Also from South Korea, three-time champion Pohang Steelers recovered from an opening-round loss to beat Shanghai Port 3-0. City rival Shanghai Shenhua lost by the same scoreline to Johor of Malaysia while Thailand’s Buriram United won 2-1 at Australia’s Central Coast Mariners. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer	https://apnews.com/article/asian-champions-league-iran-9e83299d8cfc3aac5b5e711cca11450c	2024-10-01T13:27:39-07:00	
A plane carrying Brazil President Lula lands safely at Mexico City airport after circling for hours	ZUMPANGO, Mexico (AP) — An airplane carrying Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva back to Brasilia landed safely on Tuesday at Mexico City’s Felipe Angeles airport after circling for hours due to a technical problem. Brazil's air force confirmed the safe landing of the aircraft, an Airbus A319, at 7:16 p.m. local time after four hours circling the airport. 'We landed and everyone is well,' Brazil's press secretary José Chrispiniano told The Associated Press in a telephone interview. The aircraft had departed earlier in the afternoon following the inauguration of Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, but experienced a technical problem after leaving Mexico City. The Brazilian air force said in a statement that the aircraft had to consume enough fuel to allow it to land again safely. It landed almost five hours after it took off. Lula planned to board another plane to return to Brasilia later on Tuesday. The Brazilian air force said in its statement that 'security procedures for the problem' were performed successfully, but pilots must 'wait for the necessary fuel consumption so the airplane returns to the same airport it took off from.' A source who was traveling in the plane said Lula was calm but worried throughout the flight, which was carrying 16 people, including first lady Rosângela Lula da Silva, members of the Cabinet, lawmakers and crew. The source spoke under condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. Lula arrived in Mexico on Sunday and had a meeting with former President Andrés Manuel López Obrador. He left for Brazil after attending Sheinbaum's inauguration Tuesday morning. The commercial airport was built on a military base by López Obrador after he canceled the larger partially-built airport closer to the city. Foreign dignitaries, including U.S. first lady Jill Biden, had flown into the airport for the Mexican president's inauguration. Brazilian media reported that members of Lula's staff in the plane believe a bird strike may be behind the technical problem. Aviation experts have said about similar incidents that the protocol for landing after a bird strike requires pilots to fly close to an airport as they get rid of fuel. In January, an airplane carrying Lula's security team was not able to take off as it encountered a technical problem during a trip to the northeastern Brazilian state of Paraiba. Brazil's presidency said after the incident that the staffers were never at risk. ___ Savarese reported from Sao Paulo. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/brazil-lula-airplane-mexico-city-baf4e4a690a62f2b3f3b32534560b771	2024-10-01T13:18:09-07:00	
Daniel Day-Lewis ends acting retirement for a movie directed by his son	NEW YORK (AP) — Daniel Day-Lewis is coming out of retirement, seven years after his last movie, for a film directed by his son Ronan Day-Lewis. The project was announced Tuesday by Focus Features and Plan B, who are partnering on 'Anemone.' The film, Ronan Day-Lewis' directorial debut, will star his father along with Sean Bean and Samantha Morton. The film was co-written by the two Day-Lewises. Earlier Tuesday, Daniel Day-Lewis and Bean were spotted driving a motorbike through Manchester, England, stoking intrigue about his impending return to acting. After making Paul Thomas Anderson's 2017 film 'Phantom Thread,' the 67-year-old had said he was quitting acting. 'All my life, I’ve mouthed off about how I should stop acting, and I don’t know why it was different this time, but the impulse to quit took root in me, and that became a compulsion,' he told W Magazine in 2017. 'It was something I had to do.' Since then, his appearances in public have been infrequent. In January, though, he made a surprise appearance at the National Board of Review Awards to present an award to Martin Scorsese, who directed him in 'Gangs of New York' (2002) and 'The Age of Innocence' (1993). 'Anemone,' currently in production, is described as exploring 'the intricate relationships between fathers, sons and brothers, and the dynamics of familial bonds.' Ronan Day-Lewis, 26, is a painter who has previously exhibited his works in New York. His first international solo exhibition debuts Tuesday in Hong Kong. 'We could not be more excited to partner with a brilliant visual artist in Ronan Day-Lewis on his first feature film alongside Daniel Day-Lewis as his creative collaborator,' said Peter Kujawski, chair of Focus Features. 'They have written a truly exceptional script, and we look forward to bringing their shared vision to audiences alongside the team at Plan B.'	https://apnews.com/article/daniel-daylewis-comeback-anemone-9683ca22582383fed172bad8b68a7c22	2024-10-01T12:51:02-07:00	
What to know about Hezbollah's capabilities after its recent losses	BEIRUT (AP) — Hezbollah has suffered some of the heaviest losses in its history over the past two weeks, chief among them the killing of its longtime leader, Hassan Nasrallah, in an Israeli airstrike. Two weeks ago, thousands of communications devices used by Hezbollah members exploded, killing 39 people and wounding nearly 3,000 in an apparent remotely detonated attack that Hezbollah blamed on Israel. The Lebanese militant group has lost nearly 500 fighters since it started attacking Israeli military posts in support of its ally, Hamas, last October. And hundreds more were likely killed in Israel's bombardment of Lebanon over the past week, which has killed a number of high-ranking commanders and officials. Still, Hezbollah has continued to launch rockets at central Israel. The group's chief spokesman, Mohammed Afif, warned Tuesday that those attacks were only the beginning and that the militant group is waiting for invading forces to enter Lebanon to confront them. Iran, which backs Hezbollah, fired dozens of missiles into Israel on Tuesday and referenced Nasrallah’s death in a statement on state television claiming responsibility for the attack. The bombardment came a day after Israel said it had begun limited ground operations against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. Here's a look at where Hezbollah stands after its recent losses. Where are Hezbollah's forces deployed? Hezbollah’s tens of thousands of fighters have been battle-hardened in regional conflicts, including in Syria, where the militant group helped tip the balance of power in the 13-year conflict in favor of President Bashar Assad. Hezbollah has five main units, each consisting of several thousand fighters. The Nasr and Aziz units are deployed in areas bordering Israel, with Nasr controlling the southeastern region including the edge of the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights. The Aziz unit is deployed in the southwest, including along the Mediterranean coast. Nasr and Aziz commanders were killed in Israeli airstrikes earlier this year but were believed to have been replaced. The Badr unit is deployed in an area that includes Apple province, a mountainous region overlooking large parts of southern Lebanon that has been a Hezbollah stronghold since the late 1980s. The Haidar unit is in the eastern Bekaa Valley while the Dahiyeh unit is in Beirut’s heavily populated southern suburb that housed the group’s headquarters where Nasrallah was killed Friday. The group also has the elite Radwan Force of several thousand fighters, part of which is deployed along the border with Israel. Hezbollah’s Al-Manar TV said in a report Monday that invading Israeli troops will get to know the experienced fighters of Radwan Force if they decide to launch a ground invasion. Which Hezbollah commanders are still in control? In recent weeks, Hezbollah has lost some of its most experienced military commanders, including Ibrahim Akil, who was in charge of the Radwan Force, and Ibrahim Kobbeisi, who was the group’s missiles commander. The commander of Hezbollah’s drones unit, Mohammed Surour, and the commander of Hezbollah forces in south Lebanon, Ali Karaki, were also killed in air strikes. In late July, Israel killed Hezbollah's top military commander, Fouad Shukur. Among the group’s commanders who are still active is Talal Hamieh, who is in charge of Hezbollah’s external operations, and Khodor Nader, who heads the group’s security unit. Hezbollah denied Israeli statements that claimed to have killed senior military commander known as Abu Ali Rida, commander of the Badr unit. The group’s strongman, Hashem Safieddine, Nasrallah’s maternal cousin, is also alive and widely expected to replace Nasrallah as Hezbollah secretary-general. Safieddine is close to Iran and his son, Rida, is married to Zeinab Soleimani, the daughter of an Iranian general who was killed in a U.S. airstrike in Iraq in 2020. What types of weapons does Hezbollah still have? Hezbollah has an arsenal of more than 150,000 rockets and missiles as well as surveillance and explosive drones of different types. Over the past year, Hezbollah has used a small type of guided missile known as Almas, or Diamond, as well as short-range Falaq and Burkan rockets from areas several kilometers (miles) from the border. Over the past week, Hezbollah introduced the middle-range Fadi rockets, attacking the outskirts of Tel Aviv and the northern city of Haifa. Hezbollah has yet to use all the weapons it is believed to possess, including its precision-guided missiles and surface-to-sea missiles such as the Russian-made Yakhont. Israeli officials say its bombardment of large swaths of Lebanon over the past week aimed to take out Hezbollah's supplies of weapons. However, since the escalation began, Hezbollah has continued to launch attacks across the border and even unveiled new types of weapons. On Tuesday, Hezbollah said it fired middle-range Fadi-4 rockets toward the headquarters of Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency. Hours later, the group said it fired similar rockets toward an air base in a Tel Aviv suburb. The group has used surface-to-air missiles and shot down or chased off Israeli drones on several occasions — including in the past week. Most of the incoming fire has either been intercepted or landed in open areas. But Israeli military officials warn that the country's air defenses are not hermetic.	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-hezbollah-nasrallah-ground-operation-c14b6079a847fde6f7f9ce148ea55053	2024-10-01T09:56:10-07:00	
Christmas starts in Venezuela, but the festive mood is nowhere to be found	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — It doesn’t feel like Christmas in Venezuela. At least not yet. Even if the president wants it to be. Residents of Caracas, the capital, woke up Tuesday to a towering Christmas tree standing in a popular public square, weeks after President Nicolás Maduro declared the jolly season would start earlier this year in the South American country. Workers rushed to set up decorations in various neighborhoods, but the mood was far from festive. 'I think it’s terrible because it’s October,' said Desiré Aguiar, 32, before setting up her jewelry and accessories booth in a local market. 'Halloween hasn’t even passed, and it’s already Christmas? Are we celebrating them together?' Venezuelans, particularly those who remember life at the turn of the century, have long associated Christmas with careless shopping and bulging wallets thanks to profit-sharing and holiday bonuses employers paid at the end of the year. Employees often received three times their monthly salary all at once. The smell of fresh paint even signaled the arrival of Christmas because so many put a new coat on their walls. These days, however, meager wages and bonuses resulting from the country’s economic collapse have turned the season into a time of have and have-nots. And this year, the season arrived amid a collective pessimism that followed the July 28 election. 'If they start paying... the Christmas bonus in advance, we won’t have anything left in December,' Aguiar lamented. 'I think it’s a really bad idea.' It remains unclear whether public and private employers will make changes to bonus payments this year. Maduro, whom electoral authorities handed a third six-year term, surprised the country on Sept. 2 when he declared on state television that the Christmas season would start earlier than ever. Mockery followed Maduro’s decree across social media, but on the streets, few dared to say anything about the decision — another sign of the chilling effect resulting from the repression campaign unleashed by the government after the highly anticipated election. Thousands of people, including minors, took to the streets across Venezuela hours after ruling party-loyal electoral authorities declared Maduro the winner without showing any vote tallies. The protests were largely peaceful, but demonstrators also toppled statues of Maduro’s predecessor, the late leader Hugo Chávez, threw rocks at law enforcement officers and buildings, and burned police motorcycles and government propaganda. Maduro and his ruling party allies, who control all aspects of government, responded to the demonstrations with full force. Security forces detained more than 2,000 people, including minors, and more than 20 protesters were killed. Maduro also called on Venezuelans to denounce election doubters via a government-run app originally created to report power outages and complaints about state-provided services. This prompted people to delete photos, videos, memes, messages and apps from their phones to avoid prosecution. On Tuesday, while some rejected Maduro’s decree for economic or political reasons, others rejected it for puritanical reasons. 'Christmas is in December. We must be clear about that, we celebrate the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ,' Wilfredo Gutiérrez, 61, said while observing a group of workers setting up decorative lights along a main avenue in Caracas. 'The one good thing is that they picked up the trash. Normally, this place is dirty.' ___ Garcia Cano reported from Mexico City.	https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-christmas-maduro-election-repression-70c691563a257284d6a5a056bafac452	2024-10-01T09:42:27-07:00	
Watchdog blasts DEA for not reporting waterboarding, torture by Latin American partners	MIAMI (AP) — A federal government watchdog is blasting the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration for failing to timely report human rights violations committed by Latin American law enforcement partners who admitted to waterboarding, suffocating and torturing crime suspects. The management advisory memorandum published Tuesday by the Justice Department’s Office of the Inspector General centers on the DEA’s obligations under what’s known as the Leahy Act, which prohibits the U.S. from providing foreign assistance to security forces that violate human rights. Foreign police officers and units working closely with the DEA in the frontlines of the war on drugs must undergo vetting to comply with the law, one of the U.S.’ most important tools to promote respect for human rights among security forces. The Inspector General, as part of an ongoing audit of the DEA's use of polygraph examinations as part of the vetting process, found five instances in which the DEA failed to notify the State Department of potential violations that it turned up last year. In one instance, three officers from an unidentified Central American nation admitted to waterboarding and placing plastic bags over the heads of suspects to obtain information, the watchdog said. Another, also from Central America, and who was previously approved to receive training from another federal U.S. agency, acknowledged using a Taser until suspects passed out or vomited. Finally, an officer from a DEA-run unit in a South American country admitted to beating a detained suspect while they were handcuffed to a chair. In all five instances, the DEA waited until the Inspector General raised concerns — in one case almost nine months — before reporting their findings to the State Department. The DEA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But as part of the audit, it told the Inspector General that at the time of the incidents it did not have a policy, procedures and training in place to ensure the potential violators are brought to the attention of the State Department. It has since updated its policies to train agents in the Leahy Law's guidelines and ensure violators are identified in a timely fashion. Last week the Inspector General published a 49-page report detailing how the DEA in recent years has hired almost 300 special agents and research analysts who either failed to pass a required polygraph exam during the onboarding process or provided disqualifying information during the examination. While polygraph exams are typically not admissible in court proceedings, they are frequently used by federal law enforcement agencies and for national security clearances. The DEA had long been a holdout among federal law enforcement agencies in not requiring applicants to pass a lie detector test before being hired. But in 2019, after a series of overseas scandals, including revelations that a once-star agent in Colombia who conspired with cartels was hired despite showing signs of deception on a polygraph, it tightened its procedures.	https://apnews.com/article/dea-human-rights-violations-drug-enforcement-a0d2edb7dd2146ae0cfd29f80a0b8a17	2024-10-01T08:57:15-07:00

Swiss glaciers are receding again after 2 punishing years and despite a good start to 2024	GENEVA (AP) — The volume of Switzerland's glaciers shrank again this summer, compounding the negative impact of climate change after a devastating two-year run that depleted the ice by more than 10%, scientific experts reported Tuesday. The cryosphere observation team at the Swiss Academy of Sciences reported that high temperatures in July and August, combined with the heat-absorbing impact of reddish-yellow dust blown northward from the Sahara Desert onto Swiss glaciers, led to a loss of 2.5% of their volume this year. The shrinkage came despite 'extremely favorable' conditions through June, the academy said, thanks to 30% more snowfall in the preceding winter compared to average levels, meaning that the glaciers had an extra layer of protective covering of snow — before temperatures rose. 'August saw the greatest loss of ice recorded since measurements began,' the academy said in a statement summarizing the findings. 'The retreat of the glacier tongues and their disintegration continue unabated as a result of climate change,' it said, adding that the 2.5% loss of volume was higher than the average levels over the last decade. Experts at the Glacier Monitoring in Switzerland network, known as GLAMOS, said that more than half of the glaciers it monitored completely lost their snow coverage throughout the summer. Several topmost measurement points on glaciers, such as Plaine Morte and Gries in the south and Silvretta in the east, recorded melt rates of a meter or more, the network said in a report for the Swiss Academy of Sciences. GLAMOS cited three factors: 'very high' average air temperatures in July and August; good weather in those months in which there was no fresh snow; and southwesterly winds in the winter and spring that dumped the Saharan dust onto the Alps, causing a warming effect on the ice. Switzerland is home to the most glaciers of any country in Europe, and saw 4% of its total glacier volume disappear last year. That was the second-biggest decline in a single year on top of a 6% drop in 2022. ___ Follow AP’s climate and environment coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment	https://apnews.com/article/switzerland-glacier-melt-2024-climate-change-57afa74ffc3a95d02ce1ddb38db4e9af	2024-10-01T08:22:49-07:00	
French and US companies to invest $10 billion to extract oil off Suriname's coast	PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) — France’s TotalEnergies and U.S. hydrocarbon company APA Corp. plan to invest $10 billion to extract oil off the coast of Suriname in a historic investment for the South American country, officials announced Tuesday. The first oil is expected by mid-2028, with an anticipated production of 220,000 barrels per day, according to TotalEnergies CEO Patrick Pouyanné, who flew to Suriname to personally announce the investment, the country’s largest to date. The so-called GranMorgu project focuses on an offshore area believed to contain some 700 million barrels of oil. It is adjacent to a successful ExxonMobil project in waters belonging to neighboring Guyana. 'Today is a historic day for Suriname,' said a jubilant President Chan Santokhi, calling it 'a day that will determine our future.' TotalEnergies will partner with APA Corp, a holding company for Apache Corporation, a Texas-based hydrocarbon exploration business, and Staatsolie, the local national oil producer representing the Surinamese government. Staatsolie plans to issue bonds in 2025 to finance its participation, since it is entitled to a 20% stake under the production sharing contract. The company secured an initial $175 million payment and is now in talks with banks and planning a bond offer to complete a second payment, Jagesar said. Santokhi said the anticipated revenue from the project would be used to raise the standard of living in Suriname, a country of more than 640,000 people with a poverty rate of 18%, according to the Inter-American Development Bank. 'This is a game-changer,' he said. Suriname holds $3.5 billion in debt and is undergoing a three-year, $688 IMF restructuring program that led to austerity measures and sparked violent protests last year. Annand Jagesar, CEO of Staatsolie, said that the oil exploration deal means that 'Suriname will never be the same.' But he warned of potential poor governance, noting how Venezuela had plenty of reserves but still struggled economically since it did not develop other resources and was oil dependent. TotalEnergies has pledged to develop its project responsibly, utilizing advanced technologies to minimize greenhouse gas emissions.	https://apnews.com/article/france-us-suriname-oil-exploration-21019fc6255e6c1630f6c3d7e70f7c4a	2024-10-01T07:09:54-07:00	
US sanctions extremist West Bank settler group for violence against Palestinians	WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. on Tuesday imposed sanctions on Hilltop Youth, a group of extremist settlers in the Israeli -occupied West Bank who attack Palestinians and their property. In addition, the State Department placed diplomatic sanctions on two men—Israeli settler Eitan Yardeni, for his connection to violence targeting West Bank civilians and Avichai Suissa, the leader of Hashomer Yosh, a sanctioned group that brings young volunteers to settler farms across the territory, including small farming outposts that rights groups say are the primary drivers of settler violence across the territory. The sanctions, which expose people to asset freezes and travel and visa bans, come as violence against Palestinians in the West Bank has exploded since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, following the deadly terrorist attacks of October 7th. Palestinians report verbal and physical harassment, restriction of movement, and face intimidation by settlers circling their properties on motorbikes, cars or horses and spying via drones. The Treasury Department said Hilltop Youth has carried out killings and mass arson, while rights groups and Palestinians say the group is behind 'price tag' attacks – attacks on Palestinian villages in retaliation for perceived efforts to hamper settlement construction. The group may prove difficult to effectively sanction, as it is loosely organized and decentralized. In addition, Israel’s finance minister has previously vowed to intervene on sanctioned settlers’ behalf. In the past, sanctioned settlers have told the AP that the measures have had little impact on their finances. Hilltop Youth has already faced sanctions from the EU and UK. The Biden administration has been criticized for imposing relatively few sanctions on Israeli extremists. According to the Office of Foreign Assets Control, 27 extremists and entities have been sanctioned by the U.S. under President Joe Biden ’s February 2024 Executive Order related to maintaining West Bank stability. The Treasury's Acting Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Bradley T. Smith said that the U.S. 'will continue to hold accountable the individuals, groups, and organizations that facilitate these hateful and destabilizing acts.' State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said 'the actions of these individuals have contributed to creating an environment where violence and instability thrive. Their actions, collectively and individually, undermine peace, security, and stability in the West Bank.' ___ Associated Press writers Julia Frankel and Jack Jeffrey contributed to this report from Jerusalem.	https://apnews.com/article/hilltop-youth-sanctions-israel-gaza-settler-treasury-west-bank-extremist-53fb26077c8d88637b4bd366ad3343cb	2024-10-01T06:18:29-07:00	
The Latest: VP candidates Vance and Walz meet in last scheduled debate for 2024 tickets	Barring a late addition to the schedule, Tuesday night's vice presidential debate between J.D. Vance and Tim Walz could be the last debate of the 2024 campaign between the Republican and Democratic tickets. Both Vance, a GOP senator from Ohio, and Walz, the Democratic governor of Minnesota, have embraced the traditional role of attack dog for the person at the top of the ticket. That could be on full display during the vice presidential debate in New York hosted by CBS News. Although conventional wisdom says the matchup between the candidates with second billing on the ticket seldom have much impact, polls are so tight that it could sway voters on the margins. It also could be the last head-to-head matchup between the tickets because Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, and former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, haven't agreed to a second meeting. A new AP-NORC poll found that Walz is better liked than Vance, potentially giving the Republican an added challenge. Although Vance has said he didn’t 'have to prepare that much' for the debate because he had 'well-developed views on public policy,' he had been doing debate prep sessions with his wife, Usha Vance, senior aides, and Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., who has played Walz, according to a person familiar with his preparations who requested anonymity to discuss strategy. Walz’s debate prep included sessions hunkered down in a Minneapolis hotel, with Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg standing in for Vance, according to a person familiar with the process who requested anonymity to discuss the campaign’s internal dynamics. — Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: 2 former GOP governors back Trump during rally at Wisconsin metal manufacturer Two former Wisconsin Republican governors who together won seven elections told Trump supporters at a rally Tuesday that it’s critical for the former president to bolster GOP turnout in one of the most liberal counties in the battleground state. Former Govs. Tommy Thompson and Scott Walker told hundreds of Trump supporters inside a metal manufacturer in Waunakee that winning Wisconsin means campaigning in Democratic areas like Dane County. Trump was to speak there later Tuesday. President Joe Biden won 75% of the vote in 2020 in Dane County, beating Trump by 181,000 votes in the county while carrying the state by fewer than 21,000. Thompson, who was elected governor four times, said he told Trump to win Wisconsin he had to 'go where the opposition is,' including Dane County, which is home to liberal state capital of Madison. 'And, the retort was, ‘Isn’t Madison very liberal?’' Thompson said. 'Yes, but Dane County has the third most Republican votes in the state of Wisconsin and all we have to do is increase them.' Walker, who won two elections and a recall election, encouraged Trump supporters in Dane County to 'go beyond your comfort zone' and talk with people who don’t normally vote Republican. 'Remind them with this simple truth: life was better when Donald J. Trump was president of the United States,' Walker said. Trump campaigns in battleground Wisconsin ahead of VP debate Trump was scheduled to speak about the economy Tuesday in the critical swing state of Wisconsin. The former president was visiting a manufacturing facility in Waunakee, a suburb of Wisconsin’s capital city of Madison in the Democratic stronghold of Dane County. Later he planned to hold an event at a museum in the state's largest city of Milwaukee, with hopes of reaching that city's conservative suburbs, where his support has softened. Dane County, the location of Trump’s first stop, is Wisconsin’s fastest-growing county and an economic engine for the state, fueled by jobs in the health care and tech industries. It is also home to the University of Wisconsin. 'President Trump’s appearance will be a big shot in the arm for demoralized conservatives here,' the Dane County Republican Party Chairman Brandon Maly posted on X, the social media platform, when the visit was announced. He has said Trump must get at least 23% of the vote in Dane County to have a chance of winning statewide. Democratic presidential candidates have long come to Dane County to hold massive rallies to fire up the base. Harris campaigned there on Sept. 20, holding a rally in Madison that attracted more than 10,000 people. Presidential candidates modify campaign plans due to Hurricane Helene In the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, Harris cut short a campaign visit to Las Vegas to return to Washington for briefings while Trump headed to Georgia to see the storm’s impact. Hurricane Helene’s death toll is more than 130 people and rising, with some of the worst damage caused by inland flooding in North Carolina. In addition to being humanitarian crises, natural disasters can create political tests for elected officials, particularly in the closing weeks of a presidential campaign. Presidents typically avoid racing toward disaster zones so they don’t interfere with recovery efforts. The White House said Harris would visit impacted areas 'as soon as it is possible without disrupting emergency response operations.' President Joe Biden planned to survey the devastation on Wednesday. Trump's hurricane relief fundraiser surpasses $1 million A GoFundMe campaign launched by former president Donald Trump to help the victims of Hurricane Helene has raised more than $1 million. The website calls the effort 'an official response for MAGA supporters to offer their financial assistance to their fellow Americans impacted by Hurricane Helene' and promises that all donations will be directed to those who have been impacted by the devastation. Trump earlier Monday paid a visit to Valdosta, Georgia, and said he had brought with him supplies, including fuel, that will be distributed by the Christian relief group Samaritan’s Purse. Trump slams US response to Helene. His own disaster-response record is marked by politics Former President Trump criticized the Biden administration’s response to the widespread devastation caused by Hurricane Helene, even as his supporters have called for cuts to federal agencies that warn of weather disasters and deliver relief to hard-hit communities. As president, Trump delayed disaster aid for hurricane-devastated Puerto Rico and diverted money from the Federal Emergency Management Agency in order to finance an effort to return undocumented migrants to Mexico. And Project 2025, backed by Trump supporters, would restructure FEMA to limit aid to states and says that the National Weather Service, which provides crucial data on hurricanes and other storms, 'should be broken up and downsized.' Read more here. Biden responds to Trump's false statements regarding the federal hurricane response President Biden criticized Trump for 'lying' about federal contacts with Georgia officials during the response to Hurricane Helene. Trump falsely claimed during a Monday tour of the damage that Biden hadn’t been in touch with the state’s Republican governor. 'He’s lying, and the governor told him he was lying.' 'I don’t know why he does this,' Biden continued. 'I don’t care about what he says about me, but I care what he what he communicates to people that are in need. He implies that we’re not doing everything possible. We are. We are.' North Carolina officials work to ensure those affected by Hurricane Helene have voting access State election officials in North Carolina are gathering information about options available to voters in the counties hardest hit by Hurricane Helene and plan a press conference for Tuesday. Karen Brinson Bell, executive director of the North Carolina State Board of Elections, said during an emergency board meeting on Monday that she will be providing more information, including details on how voters could declare 'natural disaster' as their reason for not being able to provide a photo ID. The board met Monday to approve a resolution granting counties flexibility for holding weekly meetings required under state law to review absentee ballots. These meetings are required to begin every Tuesday between now and Election Day, officials said. The resolution passed unanimously.	https://apnews.com/article/election-2024-harris-trump-walz-vance-debate-9d7e3087d38a0e4b308613c0e2a91a94	2024-10-01T06:17:04-07:00	
Britain's Princess Beatrice is pregnant with her second child	LONDON (AP) — Britain’s Princess Beatrice is pregnant with her second child, Buckingham Palace announced Tuesday. The place said 36-year-old Beatrice and her husband Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi 'are very pleased to announce that they are expecting their second child together in early spring.' The baby will be a sibling for 8-year-old Wolfie – Mapello Mozzi’s son from a previous relationship — and the couple's 3-year-old daughter Sienna. Buckingham Palace said King Charles III has been informed 'and both families are delighted with the news.' Beatrice, who is ninth in the line of succession to the British throne, is the elder daughter of Prince Andrew and his ex-wife, Sarah, Duchess of York. She married millionaire property tycoon Mapelli Mozzi in July 2020 in a private wedding ceremony at the Royal Chapel of All Saints at Royal Lodge, Windsor.	https://apnews.com/article/britain-princess-beatrice-pregnant-second-child-074b456289cc7cf66e91247a230077ed	2024-10-01T05:47:51-07:00	
Chanel show wrestles with designer void as actor Lupita Nyong'o talks diversity in fashion	PARIS (AP) — A giant empty cage greeted Chanel’s guests at its return to the Grand Palais on Tuesday. Though perhaps not intentionally symbolic, the décor seemed to capture the current state of the house itself: a majestic structure empty of creative direction. With Virginie Viard’s recent departure, Chanel finds itself at a crossroads, as the fashion world eagerly awaits the appointment of a new creative leader. Meanwhile, in a powerful step toward embracing diversity, Chanel announced Lupita Nyong’o as its newest ambassador. The appointment of the Oscar-winning actor, who is Kenyan Mexican, comes at a pivotal moment for the French fashion house that had faced criticism in the past for its lack of inclusivity. This move follows the widely-lauded appointment of British-Indian Leena Nair as Chanel’s global chief executive in 2022, making her the only woman of color at the helm of a major luxury brand. Here are some highlights of spring-summer ready-to-wear shows: Chanel: seeking a vision beyond the emp ty cage The spring collection delivered many familiar elements from Chanel’s vast repertoire — chiffon capes, slit skirts, embroidered transparent shirt dresses, trench coats adorned with multicolored feather prints, aviator jackets with Peter Pan collars, total pink or blue tweed looks, and the iconic little black dress that Chanel herself introduced to the world. Tweed, jersey, faille, transparent embroidery, sequins, fringe, pastel knits, and sparkling platform shoes all made an appearance, forming a showcase of the house’s signatures. Yet despite the breadth and richness of the offering, something was amiss. There was little cohesion, and at times, the collection lacked the unmistakable soul that once characterized Chanel’s shows. A series of foulard-printed gowns seemed out of place — as if borrowed clumsily from another narrative altogether. With a snip of scissors, Gabrielle 'Coco' Chanel freed women from their corsets. Today, Chanel itself needs liberation. The applause at the end of the show, which featured designs that often felt uninspired, was distinctly muted, with critics visibly shifting in their seats. Star appearances by Elvis Presley’s granddaughter Riley Keough, who capped the show with a funky vocal performance of a Prince hit from inside the gilded cage, as well the starry presence of Nyong’o, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Vanessa Paradis, Margaret Qualley and Naomi Campbell, seemed like an effort to divert attention from the elephant — or the empty cage — in the room. Chanel is unquestionably a fashion juggernaut, and it will weather this moment of transition. However, there is no overstating the importance of the decision the house now faces. Chanel must find a designer who can reshape and redefine its vision for the future. The industry is rife with speculation. Potential successors include Daniel Roseberry, known for his dramatic work at Schiaparelli, Marc Jacobs, a seasoned classicist with Paris experience, and Nadège Vanhée, the skilled designer from Hermès. Viard, ousted this summer, succeeded Karl Lagerfeld upon his death in 2019 and was his closest collaborator for decades. She had overseen record sales for Chanel, reaching a reported $19.7 billion last year. Ready-to-wear sales reportedly increased 23% during her tenure. Viard was only the third creative director in Chanel’s over 100-year history, following Lagerfeld and legendary founder Chanel herself. Lupita Nyong’o named Chanel ambassador Nyong’o shared her excitement and the deep sense of responsibility accompanying the new role. 'It’s a great honor,' she said. 'Chanel is a legacy brand with a long history. And to be the newest face of it feels monumental. I feel very, very proud and excited to take this new journey with a brand that I think is dynamic and always feminine and regal.' Nyong’o’s appointment comes as a breath of fresh air in an industry criticized for lack of diversity and reluctance to change. The number of Black designers leading heritage houses remains alarmingly low — currently only Balmain’s Olivier Rousteing and Louis Vuitton men’s designer Pharrell Williams hold such positions in Parisian legacy brands. For Nyong’o, joining Chanel is about more than wearing beautiful clothes — it’s about contributing to a narrative shift in fashion. 'The message that I bring naturally and deliberately to the role is that things have changed. And we don’t want them to go back to what they once were,' she said. Nyong’o drew inspiration from watching a recent documentary about Bethann Hardison, the iconic model and activist who was at the forefront of pushing for diversity in fashion during the 1960s and 1970s. Hardison, who rose to prominence after her appearance at the historic 1973 Battle of Versailles — a groundbreaking fashion show that brought American designers into the spotlight — became one of the first high-profile Black models and an outspoken advocate for change. 'In that documentary, I was really alarmed to see how much work had been done to diversify the fashion industry, but then how much it reverted to monoculture in the following years,' Nyong’o said. Hardison’s tireless efforts led to significant gains for Black models in the past, but the subsequent regression underscored how fragile those victories could be. Her fight for inclusivity in fashion serves as both a cautionary tale and a source of inspiration for Nyong’o, who now finds herself continuing Hardison’s legacy. 'It took a step back, so for me that was testament to the fact that it takes consciousness. It’s a conscious effort that has to be made on a daily basis and in present time. You don’t fix it once and then hope it stays that way,' Nyong’o added. She sees Chanel’s decision to name her as an ambassador as part of a broader, deliberate declaration: 'I feel like these movements that Chanel is making are part of declaring a desire to represent a more realistic world. And I’m proud to be one of those faces that is sending that message.' The importance of visibility in reshaping perceptions cannot be understated. 'When I was growing up, I didn’t see myself in ads for brands like this. It resulted in me going through quite the identity crisis and feeling undervalued by the world,' Nyong’o said candidly. She recounted those early days — staring at glossy magazine pages, searching for a face that mirrored her own, only to find none. Now, she imagines a little girl somewhere, watching her in a Chanel campaign, seeing someone who looks like her — someone who is elegant, celebrated, and valued. 'I would hope that there is a message for little girls,' she continued. 'My work as an actor and as an author, as a podcast maker, and now as a brand ambassador, is to change that by just occupying the space.' It is a powerful reminder of the transformative impact of representation; when someone finally occupies a space that was once empty, it changes the way people see themselves and the world around them. The luxury sector has frequently been accused of tokenism and superficial diversity efforts — making short-term gestures without genuine long-term change. Nyong’o is determined to make her role count, embodying the idea that representation must come with influence and purpose. Louis Vuitton blends opulence and chaos in a dazzling collection French fashion once again showcased its formidable strength at Nicolas Ghesquière’s spring collection for Louis Vuitton, blending savoir-faire with cultural resonance. 'French fashion is a formidable soft power, radiating a tradition of savoir-faire, an art de vivre – a cultural singularity,' the house said, and the designer delivered a spectacle that seemed like yet another a grand culmination of the house's journey across time, space, and style. A sheeny striped coat with a curved silhouette opened the show, its adornments and accessories teeming with a kind of futuristic couture—a theme Ghesquière has mastered over his tenure. The coat set the stage for a collection that often intentionally deceived and dazzled the eye, echoing Ghesquière’s penchant for 'colliding references' and reimagining the old as new. Giant petal-like fabrics encircled the necks of models, conjuring both South American flair and a nod to punk—the very hybrid aesthetic that makes Ghesquière’s work so unmistakable. The show leaned into religious undertones, featuring a priest-like robe with fluid proportions, accessorized with an almost comically oversized black chain adorned with a sort of crucifix. Yet, despite the individual flair of many pieces, the sheer divergence of styles sometimes felt overwhelming. One particular black-and-white floral split dress seemed to confuse the eye, its busy patterns making it difficult for spectators to discern where the dress ended and the underdress began. This tendency to merge multiple aesthetic elements occasionally crossed into visual overload. Miu Miu examines youth, uses A-listers as models If anyone can redefine fashion by dipping into the nursery wardrobe, it’s Miuccia Prada. This season, Miu Miu, Prada’s irreverent and intellectual baby sister, examined early youth — and with it, the liberating simplicity and honesty it brings to thinking and dressing. The brand is notorious for blurring the lines between sophistication and play, and it’s no surprise that a baby’s cotton chemisette took center stage and transformed, under Prada’s artful manipulation, into something altogether more complex. Opening with a crisp white cotton dress, this deceptively intricate collection borrowed directly from childhood is the fruit of a collaboration with Petit Bateau. Chemisette dresses, sweaters, and twisted shirts became subversive statements — folded, wrapped, and twisted in all the wrong ways to create something utterly fresh. The result? A glamour that Prada herself called 'dishonest' — a term almost mischievously fitting for Miu Miu’s rebellious ethos. It’s the spirit of a girl who refuses to conform, wearing her tights over her dress, her sweaters in unconventional ways, just because she can. The sense of playful contrast—an innocent wardrobe rendered provocative—captured one of Miu Miu’s long-standing narratives: youth is a state of being under construction, where rules are fluid, and experimentation is freedom. It’s a continuation of Prada’s love for subversion and polarity, whether it’s mixing raw imperfection with poise or twisting utilitarian comfort into a silhouette that exudes audacity. Prada called in a remarkable cast, including Alexa Chung, Willem Dafoe, Cara Delevingne, and Hilary Swank — household names from every corner of the artistic universe, as comfortable in front of the camera as they were here, treading the Miu Miu boards. Where Miuccia Prada excels is her ability to inject humor — a knowing wink — into serious fashion. And just as Prada herself once said, sometimes we must choose whether to be a child or a lady near death. This collection chose the former. ___ This article was corrected to show that Erykah Badu did not attend the Chanel fashion show.	https://apnews.com/article/chanel-paris-fashion-week-lupita-295f0d27ab9e2cfca5c3b1cb28eb5739	2024-10-01T04:59:37-07:00	
France's new prime minister vows to curb debt as he faced baptism of fire at heckled parliament	PARIS (AP) — Lawmakers gave new French Prime Minister Michel Barnier a rough ride, heckling him constantly, as he laid out his proposed policies in an inaugural speech to parliament on Tuesday, a baptism of fire that highlighted how difficult governing will be for his minority government. In a wide-ranging speech, Barnier, a veteran conservative, warned soberingly of France’s colossal debt, promised belt-tightening and more taxation to improve the nation’s finances, and said France will continue to support Ukraine in its defense against Russia’s invasion. But he also faced angry shouts from left-wing lawmakers and immediate criticism from the far right, now a powerful force in parliament after surprise elections three months ago, of not being tough enough against immigration. The address to the new legislature’s opening session was a crucial test for his new government, which has no clear majority in the parliament. The National Assembly after legislative elections produced no clear winner. The mood in the chamber was closely watched for signs of how difficult opposition lawmakers intend to make it for the 73-year-old veteran conservative and EU Brexit negotiator to get things done and keep power. Here's a look at Barnier's key proposals and consensual approach. More taxation and less expenses Barnier made a priority of remedying France's indebted public finances. 'The true sword of Damocles is our colossal debt,' he said. 'If we are not careful, it will take our country to the edge of the precipice.' Barnier announced an 'exceptional' tax on France's wealthiest individuals — but did not specify who, exactly, falls into that tax bracket. He also said an extra contributory 'effort' will be asked of large companies making big profits. France is under pressure from the European Union’s executive arm to reduce its debt. Still, tax hikes would go against the fiscal philosophy of French President Emmanuel Macron, who consistently cut taxes when he still had a government with a clear majority in parliament. Barnier also said he aims to curb spending, saying France has 'much to do' but adding: 'We must do with little.' He said his government will seek to reduce France’s deficit from an estimated 6% of Gross Domestic Product now to 5% next year and under 3% by 2029. To do so, he promised to cut state expenses, spend money more 'efficiently' and fight tax evasion and other frauds. Reign in immigration Barnier, who had pledged a hardline stance on migration, said he wanted to 'better control' the numbers of people coming to France. He proposed to 'facilitate' the detention of foreigners who are staying illegally in the country pending the implementation of deportation orders. He said France will continue 'as long as needed' to implement controls at its national borders in the passport-free area in Europe. In addition, Barnier suggested that the number of visas granted would be conditional on other nations’ ability to provide consular documents for their citizens being deported from France after arriving illegally. A similar move by Macron prompted a year-long dispute with Morocco in 2022. Stand by Ukraine France 'will remain at the side of the Ukrainian people,' Barnier said. He stressed Ukrainians are fighting 'to defend their sovereignty and freedom' but also to defend 'shared values' with France and Europe. He vowed to implement France’s multi-billion-euro plan to boost its military spending, spurred by the war in Ukraine, in the coming years. France 'will also remain active' in the Middle East, he added. 'The worsening situation in Lebanon ... requires our full mobilization with our partners in the region, the United States and Europeans, to put an end as quickly as possible to hostilities that are seriously threatening the stability of the entire region,' he said. Seeking compromises Barnier's speech covered his plans to tackle problems as diverse as mental health and aid for farmers to wind power and sexual violence. Yet, he carefully avoided to enter into divisive details, tiptoeing through the political minefield and using soft language. Left-wing lawmakers kept up a steady drumbeat of shouted comments throughout but failed to throw the veteran politician off his stride. He responded to the heckling with flashes of wry humor and said he aims to listen to and respect all lawmakers 'even if this respect is not always reciprocal.' He called on politicians to 'seek compromises,' overcome their 'divisions and quarrels' and 'act in the best interests of the country.' Bruno Lefebvre, a professor in political sciences at the University of Lille, said Barnier’s 'rather calming speech' took no risks. 'He knows he’s in an ejection seat,' Lefebvre said. 'He has very little room for maneuver.' Barnier vowed to fight racism and antisemitism. He also insisted his government won't restrict the right to abortion, just six months after France became the first country to guarantee in its constitution a woman’s right to voluntarily terminate a pregnancy. He said the parliament will start debating again next year a proposed bill to allow adults with terminal cancer or other incurable illness to take lethal medication, as public demands grow for legal options for aid in dying. A weakened government June-July legislative elections left the National Assembly split between three main blocs, none of them with enough legislators to govern alone. Barnier, appointed last month, primarily recruited ministers from Macron’s centrist alliance and the conservative Republicans to form his government. Most sharply opposed to Barnier is a loose grouping of left-wing parties, the New Popular Front. As a coalition, it secured the most seats in the legislative elections but fell short of a majority. To bring down the new government with a no-confidence vote, the New Popular Front would need support from legislators on the far right who, for the moment, are adopting more of a wait-and-see attitude toward Barnier. Far-right leader Marine Le Pen said Tuesday she could hear 'few solutions' in Barnier’s proposals. 'What will you really do to in the face of a booming legal and illegal immigration ... which you almost didn’t talk about?' she asked. Yet she confirmed her party, the National Rally, won’t support a no-confidence vote for now. Barnier described his address as a roadmap 'for the 2 1/2 years ahead of us' to the next presidential election scheduled in 2027. 'Never!' a lawmaker shouted back — reflecting widespread expectations that his government won’t last that long. ___ AP Writer Diane Jeantet contributed to the story.	https://apnews.com/article/france-parliament-prime-minister-michel-barnier-5071c8ab3c6657f3893aea133decd2b7	2024-10-01T04:30:48-07:00	
A Belarusian opposition leader hails Lithuania's decision to seek ICC investigation into president	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — Belarus' exiled opposition leader hailed Lithuania's move to seek prosecution at the International Criminal Court of her country's authoritarian president and other officials, saying Tuesday that it will give fresh hope to her homeland. 'For me personally, this step means that I can now explain to Belarusians that the international justice system works, that there are countries who really want to help us,' Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya told The Associated Press. 'For the Belarusian people, it is important to prove that we are not abandoned, we are not forgotten,' she added at an event in The Hague a day after Lithuania formally accused President Alexander Lukashenko and others of crimes against humanity by forcing Belarusians to flee the country. The ICC's prosecutor said he would open a probe into the claims. Belarus is not a member state of the court, but Lithuania argues that the court has jurisdiction, citing a case brought by Bangladesh against Myanmar over persecution of the Rohingya people. In its referral to the ICC, Lithuania said there are 'reasonable grounds' to believe that Lukashenko’s government, police and armed forces have been involved in 'deportation, persecution and other inhumane acts' against Belarusian civilians for more than four years. Hundreds of thousands of Belarusians, including Tsikhanouskaya, have fled the country during an intense crackdown on opposition after huge protests arose against the 2020 presidential election, whose disputed results gave Lukashenko a sixth term in office. A large share of them went to Lithuania. Tsikhanouskaya was Lukashenko's main opponent in 2020, entering the race after her husband Siarhei Tsikhanouski was arrested after announcing plans to run. Authorities told her the day after the election to leave the country or face imprisonment. More than 65,000 people have been arrested over the last four years in Belarus in connection with the protests and opposition activity, with many of them severely beaten, according to the Belarusian human rights group Viasna. As Lukashenko seeks a seventh term next year to extend his three-decade rule, opposition leaders in exile say he is ramping up the pressure on Belarusians who moved abroad. The aim, they say, is to quash any opposition support from overseas. The Hague-based ICC last year issued an arrest warrant for Lukashenko's long-time ally and supporter Russian President Vladimir Putin alleging his personal involvement in abductions of children from Ukraine. Putin dismissed the warrant and last month visited Mongolia, an ICC member state that refused to arrest him and turn him over to the court. Another Belarusian opposition leader, Pavel Latushka, said last year that he had handed over to the ICC evidence that he said indicates that more than 2,100 Ukrainian children from at least 15 Russia-occupied Ukrainian cities have been forcibly taken to Belarus with Lukashenko’s approval. He expressed hope that the materials would prompt the ICC to issue a warrant for Lukashenko’s arrest.	https://apnews.com/article/belarus-icc-tsikhanouskaya-investigation-president-4a7cc764847a26655b1229513395b4e1	2024-10-01T03:24:37-07:00	
What to know as Israel says it has launched ground incursion into Lebanon	JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel said its ground troops crossed into Lebanon overnight, launching what the military described as 'localized' raids to root out Hezbollah fighters and infrastructure. Hezbollah, meanwhile, said it saw no sign of Israeli forces and its troops were ready to confront them. Israel said the incursion would be focused on the narrow strip of land just across the border. But it also issued evacuation warnings covering a wider swath of Lebanon, raising fears that a large-scale ground invasion was soon to come. In recent days, a wave of Israeli airstrikes has killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and several of his top commanders, while driving hundreds of thousands of Lebanese from their homes. Israel says a ground operation is now necessary to return tens of thousands of displaced Israelis to their homes in the north, pummeled by continuous rocket fire from Hezbollah since Oct. 8. Here's what we know: Did Israeli troops enter Lebanon? The military says that Israeli troops entered Lebanon late Monday. A military official who spoke on the condition of anonymity in line with military regulations declined to say whether troops were rotating in and out of the country or were stationed there for the foreseeable future. The Lebanese army and UNIFIL, a U.N. peacekeeping force stationed in the zone that Israeli forces purportedly entered, have not confirmed that Israeli troops crossed the border, although UNIFIL said it was notified that they were going to. How far into Lebanon are Israeli ground troops? The military official said that at this point Israeli ground troops are 'within walking distance' of the border, targeting the small Lebanese villages hundreds of meters (yards) from Israeli territory. The military says Hezbollah militants remain in the area, despite heavy Israeli bombardment over the past few weeks. It says they are using the areas to launch attacks on Israel and to store weapons. Have there been clashes between Hezbollah and Israeli troops? There were no signs of ground combat late Monday and early Tuesday in southern Lebanon. The military official said there have been no clashes between Hezbollah militants and Israeli troops so far. Meanwhile, cross-border fire continued. Hezbollah announced in statements that it had targeted groups of soldiers in several Israeli border areas with artillery shelling and rockets. Israel said no soldiers were injured and the targeting was unsuccessful. Still, Israeli artillery units pummeled targets in southern Lebanon through the night and the sounds of airstrikes were heard throughout Beirut. Hezbollah fired a rare volley of rockets toward central Israel on Tuesday, injuring one man, Israeli paramedics said. How extensive is the planned operation? Israel has not given a timetable for how long the incursion will last and has declined to specify how far troops will go. The military official said that marching to Beirut, as Israel did in its 1982 invasion of Lebanon, is 'not on the table.' At the time, the Israeli invasion was also pitched as a limited incursion to push the Palestine Liberation Organization back. He added that the operation in its current stages does not mirror Israel’s ground incursions in Gaza, where the military entered cities with heavy manpower, artillery and tanks. That could change, depending on whether Israel’s government decides to launch a more extensive ground operation. Chris Coyle, a resident of Israel’s north, told AP on Monday that Israeli tanks had been positioned along the border. Troops that entered Lebanon are from the 98th division, the military said. The division is responsible for some of the heaviest fighting inside Gaza and includes elite units specializing in attacks behind enemy lines. Meanwhile, Israel is expanding its evacuation warnings in southern Lebanon, sending hundreds of thousands of Lebanese fleeing from the south. On Tuesday, the Israeli military's Arabic-language spokesperson asked residents living in villages north of a U.N.-declared buffer zone to flee. Under a U.N. resolution that ended the 2006 war, the zone was supposed to be controlled by a U.N. peacekeeping force and the Lebanese military.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-what-to-know-hezbollah-incursion-c44358cb4c70db69bdab4b254cb2ed76	2024-10-01T03:10:40-07:00	
Hundreds of firefighters battle a deadly forest fire raging in southern Greece for the third day	ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Hundreds of firefighters and volunteers in southern Greece battled a wildfire for a third day that has killed two people and devastated a large forested area, prompting pledges of assistance from other European Union countries. Three waterbombing aircraft from Italy and Croatia were due to arrive later Tuesday after Greece requested help through the 27-country bloc's emergency civil protection mechanism. The Greek fire service said more than 400 firefighters, assisted by 20 aircraft, were engaged against the blaze in the mountains of Corinthia in the Peloponnese region. The authorities were optimistic that progress had been made as the main front of the blaze was out, leaving a large number of scattered fires. However, it remained unclear whether that success could be expanded on before winds whipped up and spread the blaze again. Government spokesman Pavlos Marinakis said firefighters had been hampered in their initial response by the difficult terrain and poor road network. 'During the first, crucial stage of the fire, firetrucks had great difficulty approaching (the blaze) because of the narrow roads,' he said. 'The many ravines and the gale-force winds blowing that day greatly impeded' the firefighting effort, Marinakis added. Officials ordered that another village be evacuated as a precaution Tuesday, a day after half a dozen similar orders were issued. A major highway that was closed overnight as flames swept close by was reopened on Tuesday. The blaze destroyed a historic church in the mountains and reportedly damaged buildings outside the threatened villages, but the fire service was not immediately able to provide further details. The two victims were identified as local residents who got trapped late Sunday by the fast-advancing blaze. Greece, like other southern European countries, is plagued every summer by destructive wildfires that have been exacerbated by global warming. Over the past few months, the fire service has had to cope with more than 4,500 wildfires. This year's had been flagged as the most dangerous fire season in two decades after the countryside was left parched by a protracted drought and early summer heatwaves. Still, Greece's big investments in extra water-bombing aircraft, warning drones and other equipment have led to most blazes being extinguished shortly after they broke out.	https://apnews.com/article/greece-wildfire-peloponnese-forest-cfeb415e491edbdce660490bae5aeb3f	2024-10-01T01:49:32-07:00	
Myanmar's military government launches a census seen as a way to gather information about opponents	BANGKOK (AP) — A nationwide census was launched Tuesday by Myanmar’s military government, which says it will be used to compile voter lists for a general election promised for next year, even though much of the country is engulfed in civil war. Census takers, most of them schoolteachers and local administrative workers, began going door-to-door in the capital, Naypyitaw, accompanied by soldiers and police. A group that leads the struggle against military rule, the shadow National Unity Government, has advised people to use 'caution' in complying with the survey, and pro-democracy guerrillas have warned that those who help collect information will face reprisals. Several were attacked and killed during a similar smaller-scale survey last year. The military government is widely seen as hoping the polls will legitimize its rule, which began after it seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021. In a televised speech in early September, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, the head of the military government, said the census information being gathered from Oct. 1 to Oct. 15 is crucial for compiling voter lists for a general election, but did not specify a date for the polls. He previously pledged to hold an election in 2025. He also said that people must answer all the questions without anxiety or doubt. The census is widely seen as an effort to gather information to more closely monitor opponents of military rule. The Ministry of Immigration and Population says more than 42,000 census workers will gather information from more than 13 million households across the country. The survey contains 68 questions on matters such as the number of people living in each home, their education, disabilities, types of houses and access to water, electricity and toilets. It also includes questions about the occupants' backgrounds, family members who have been away from home and the cause of death of family members, all highly sensitive matters for those who joined the armed resistance or the civil disobedience movement. A 33-year-old nurse from Yangon, the country’s biggest city, who joined the civil disobedience movement in 2021 said she was worried about her safety because the census contains detailed questions about her job history and the military might use it to punish her. Like others who agreed to be interviewed, she spoke on condition of anonymity because she feared arrest. A 29-year-old man who took up arms to fight against the army in the southeastern state of Kayin said he had suggested to his family back in his hometown in Mon state that they visit relatives in other townships to avoid the survey. A 26-year-old gym trainer from Yangon told the AP that he believed the authorities are gathering information not only for the census but also to obtain details of men who are eligible for military service. The military activated conscription in February after it was forced into the defensive against pro-democracy militants as well as ethnic militias seeking autonomy. Independent analysts believe the military government controls much less than half of Myanmar's territory. It would be difficult to organize an election while the country is at war, and critics see no way for the polls to be free and fair. At a meeting at the end of July, Min Aung Hlaing said the census would be prioritized in areas under the military’s control. 'Whether they are doing it for the fake elections or census, they are doing it to terrorize the people, so don’t collaborate with them in these matters,' said Kyaw Zaw, a spokesperson for the National Unity Government. 'I would like to say that all those who cooperate with the military council will be punished according to the law because their action is similar to encouraging and cooperating with the military’s terrorist activities.' The Chin Brotherhood Alliance, which comprises five ethnic Chin militias from the northwestern Chin state, and the Dawei Defense Team, a group from the southern Tanintharyi region, warned in statements last month that they will take strong action against military government personnel who participate in the survey. Such guerrilla groups, which often target people associated with the military, carried out attacks during a three-week survey to compile voter lists in January 2023, when elections were still expected later that year. About a dozen people including two police officers and local officials were killed and four military personnel were captured during the attacks. The U.N. Population Fund, the major collaborator in the previous census in 2014, announced in late 2023 that it was unable to support the 2024 census due to Myanmar's political strife and conflict. The military government said in August this year that China, a close ally, had pledged to give technical support for the census. The Ministry of Immigration and Population has estimated Myanmar has more than 56 million people,	https://apnews.com/article/myanmar-census-civil-war-military-resistance-eafba6e479c59fb926d31a10d4b663ca	2024-10-01T01:28:35-07:00	
Australia's online dating industry adopts code of conduct to keep users safer	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — A code of conduct will be enforced on the online dating industry to better protect Australian users after research found that three-in-four people suffer some form of sexual violence through the platforms, Australia’s government said on Tuesday. Bumble, Grindr and Match Group Inc., a Texas-based company that owns platforms including Tinder, Hinge, OKCupid and Plenty of Fish, have agreed to the code that took effect on Tuesday, Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said. The platforms, which account for 75% of the industry in Australia, have until April 1 to implement the changes before they are strictly enforced, Rowland said. The code requires the platforms’ systems to detect potential incidents of online-enabled harm and demands that the accounts of some offenders are terminated. Complaint and reporting mechanisms are to be made prominent and transparent. A new rating system will show users how well platforms are meeting their obligations under the code. The government called for a code of conduct last year after the Australian Institute of Criminology research found that three-in-four users of dating apps or websites had experienced some form of sexual violence through these platforms in the five years through 2021. 'There needs to be a complaint-handling process. This is a pretty basic feature that Australians would have expected in the first place,' Rowland told Australian Broadcasting Corp. on Tuesday. 'If there are grounds to ban a particular individual from utilizing one of those platforms, if they’re banned on one platform, they’re blocked on all platforms,' she added. Bumble said it shared the government’s hope of eliminating gender-based violence and was grateful for the opportunity to work with the government and industry on what the platform described as a 'world-first dating code of practice.' 'We know that domestic and sexual violence is an enormous problem in Australia, and that women, members of LGBTQ+ communities, and First Nations are the most at risk,' a Bumble statement said. 'Bumble puts women’s experiences at the center of our mission to create a world where all relationships are healthy and equitable, and safety has been central to our mission from day one,' Bumble added. The other platforms that signed up to the code did not immediately respond to request for comment on Tuesday. All helped design the code. Platforms that have not signed up include Happn, Coffee Meets Bagel and Feeld. The government expects the code will enable Australians to make better informed choices about which dating apps are best equipped to provide a safe dating experience. The government has also warned the online dating industry that it will legislate if the operators fail to keep Australians safe on their platforms.	https://apnews.com/article/australia-online-dating-sexual-violence-apps-safety-a6cba10c81e60f1cb8866a2a1201c163	2024-10-01T01:06:55-07:00	
Israel calls for evacuations in Lebanon as Hezbollah denies ground incursion began	JERUSALEM (AP) — The Israeli military on Tuesday warned people to evacuate nearly two dozen Lebanese border communities hours after announcing what it said were limited ground operations against Hezbollah. The militant group denied Israeli troops had entered Lebanon, but hours later the Israeli army announced it had also carried out dozens of ground raids into southern Lebanon going back nearly a year. Israel released video footage purporting to show its soldiers operating in homes and tunnels where Hezbollah kept weapons. There was no immediate confirmation, but if true it would be another humiliating blow for Iran-backed Hezbollah, the most powerful armed group in the Middle East. Hezbollah has been reeling from weeks of targeted strikes that killed its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and several of his top commanders. Israel advised people to evacuate to the north of the Awali River, some 60 kilometers (36 miles) from the border and much farther than the Litani River, which marks the northern edge of a U.N.-declared zone that was intended to serve as a buffer between Israel and Hezbollah after their 2006 war. 'You must immediately head north of the Awali River to save yourselves, and leave your houses immediately,' said the statement posted by the Israeli military on the platform X. The warning applied to communities south of the Litani. The border region has largely emptied out over the past year as the two sides have traded fire. But the scope of the evacuation warning raised questions as to how deep Israel plans to send its forces into Lebanon as it presses ahead with a rapidly escalating campaign against Hezbollah. Anticipating more rocket attacks from Hezbollah, the Israeli army announced new restrictions on public gatherings and closed beaches in northern and central Israel. Questions raised over whether Israeli forces entered An Associated Press reporter saw Israeli troops operating near the border in armored trucks, with helicopters circling overhead, but could not confirm ground forces had crossed into Lebanon. Ahead of the Israeli announcement of an incursion, U.S. officials on Monday said Israel had described launching small ground raids inside Lebanon as it prepared for a wider operation. Neither the Lebanese army nor a U.N. peacekeeping force known as UNIFIL, which patrol southern Lebanon, have confirmed that Israeli forces entered. UNIFIL said any such cross-border operation would be a 'dangerous development' and a violation of Lebanese sovereignty. In its first statement since Israel announced the start of ground operations, Hezbollah spokesman Mohammed Afif dismissed what he said were 'false claims' of an Israeli incursion. He said Hezbollah is ready for 'direct confrontation with enemy forces that dare to or try to enter Lebanon.' Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the Israeli military’s top spokesperson, claimed troops were conducting 'localized ground raids' on Hezbollah positions in southern Lebanon to ensure that Israeli citizens could return to their homes in the north. 'We’re not going to Beirut,' he said. 'We’re only going to areas next to our border and will do what is necessary to dismantle and demolish Hezbollah infrastructure.' He said Israel had carried out dozens of small raids inside Lebanon going all the way back to Oct. 8, when Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel after the outbreak of the war in Gaza. He said Israeli forces had crossed the border to collect information and destroy Hezbollah infrastructure, including tunnels and weapons. Israel has said Hezbollah was preparing its own Oct. 7-style attack into Israel. It was not immediately possible to confirm those claims. An Israeli military official said troops taking part in the latest incursion were within walking distance of the border, focused on villages hundreds of meters (yards) from Israel. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with military regulations, said there had been no clashes yet with Hezbollah fighters. The Israeli military was accused of lying to media in 2021 when it released a statement implying that ground troops had entered Gaza. The military played down the incident as a misunderstanding, but well-sourced military commentators in Israel said it was part of a ruse to lure Hamas into battle. Israel strikes more targets and Hezbollah fires rockets Israeli artillery units pounded targets in southern Lebanon through the night and the sounds of airstrikes were heard throughout Beirut. The Israeli military official said Hezbollah had launched rockets at central Israel, setting off air raid sirens and wounding a man in his 50s. Hezbollah said it fired salvos of a new kind of medium-range missile, called the Fadi 4, at the headquarters of two Israeli intelligence agencies near Tel Aviv. Afif, the Hezbollah spokesman, said the missile attack 'is only the beginning.' The Israeli military official said Hezbollah had also launched projectiles at Israeli communities near the border, targeting soldiers without wounding anyone. Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel shortly after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack into Israel ignited the war in Gaza. Israel has launched retaliatory airstrikes and the conflict has steadily escalated. In recent weeks Israel has unleashed a punishing wave of airstrikes across large parts of Lebanon. Hagari said the U.N. Security Council resolution that ended the last Israel-Hezbollah war in 2006 had not been enforced and that southern Lebanon was 'swarming with Hezbollah terrorists and weapons.' That resolution had called for Hezbollah to withdraw from the area between the border and the Litani River and for the Lebanese army and U.N. peacekeepers to patrol the region. Israel says those and other provisions were never enforced. Lebanon has long accused Israel of violating other terms of the resolution. Israeli official says no plans to march on Beirut Lebanon’s Prime Minister Najib Mikati said Monday that his country is willing to deploy the army in support of the resolution if there is a cease-fire. Lebanon’s armed forces would not be able to impose an agreement on the far more powerful Hezbollah. The military statements indicated that Israel might focus its ground operation on the narrow strip along the border, rather than launching a larger invasion aimed at destroying Hezbollah, as it has done in Gaza against the Palestinian Hamas. Hezbollah and Hamas are close allies backed by Iran, and each escalation over the past year has raised fears of a wider war in the Middle East that could draw in Iran and the United States, which has rushed military assets to the region in support of Israel. The incursion follows weeks of heavy blows by Israel against Hezbollah — including an airstrike that killed its longtime leader Nasrallah — and seeks to step up the pressure on the group. There was no word on how long the operation would last. Over 1,000 people have been killed in Lebanon in Israeli strikes over the past two weeks, nearly a quarter of them women and children, according to the Health Ministry. Hundreds of thousands of people have fled their homes. Hezbollah is a well-trained militia, believed to have tens of thousands of fighters and an arsenal of 150,000 rockets and missiles. The last round of fighting in 2006 ended in a stalemate, and both sides have spent the past two decades preparing for their next showdown. Recent airstrikes wiping out most of Hezbollah’s top leadership and the explosions of hundreds of pagers and walkie-talkies belonging to Hezbollah indicate that Israel has infiltrated deep inside the group’s upper echelons. Hezbollah vowed Monday to keep fighting even after its recent losses. The group’s acting leader, Naim Kassem, said in a televised statement Monday that Hezbollah commanders killed in recent weeks have already been replaced. European countries have begun pulling their diplomats and citizens out of Lebanon. A British government-chartered flight is due to leave Beirut on Wednesday to evacuate U.K. nationals. The U.K. has also sent 700 troops to a base in the nearby island nation of Cyprus to prepare for a potential evacuation of the estimated 5,000 British citizens in Lebanon. ___ Mroue reported from Beirut.

A likely Russian artillery strike kills at least 6 at a Ukrainian market	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — An apparent Russian artillery strike hit a market in the southern Ukraine city of Kherson on Tuesday, killing at least six people and wounding three others, authorities said, on a morning when Ukrainians across the country were observing a minute’s silence for their military and war dead. The strike happened as shoppers made their way between stalls at the city center market, regional Gov. Oleksandr Prokudin said. He published a video showing the blurred corpses of people in civilian clothes lying near a stall with tomatoes and other vegetables. Ukraine’s General Prosecutor’s Office said the strike was 'most likely' carried out by Russian artillery and hit close to a public transport stop. It initially reported that seven people were killed but later corrected that toll to six, saying a severely wounded person thought to be dead was in intensive care at a local hospital. The city has not recently been a hotspot in the war, now deep into its third year, as the fiercest battles have been taking place in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region where Russia’s army is pushing hard to take ground ahead of the winter. The hilltop Donetsk town of Vuhledar, an important Ukrainian stronghold for the past two years and part of a belt of strategic garrisons, appears to be on the brink of falling into Russian hands. Fighting for control of Vuhledar has advanced nearly into the town center, making it almost impossible to deliver humanitarian aid, Donetsk regional Gov. Vadym Filashkin said on national television Tuesday. There are still 107 people left in the town, although all children have been evacuated, he said. Ukrainian forces have struck back with an incursion into Russia’s Kursk border region, but the government is waiting to hear what further Western military and financial support it can count on. The Kherson region was one of four, also including Donetsk, Luhansk, and Zaporizhzhia, that Moscow illegally annexed in September 2022 and is partly occupying. Russian President Vladimir Putin wants Ukraine to withdraw completely from those regions. Ukraine refuses. Kherson fell into Russian hands after Moscow’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. A Ukrainian counteroffensive recaptured western areas of the Kherson region, including the regional capital of the same name, nine months later. The market attack came on the same morning as Ukraine celebrated Defenders Day, an annual public holiday that honors the country’s armed forces, veterans and war dead. Across Ukraine, traffic stopped and people on sidewalks came to a halt at 9 a.m. to commemorate those defending Ukraine and those who have sacrificed their lives for the country. People gathered at Independence Square in Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, carrying pictures of fallen Ukrainian soldiers. 'For others, life goes on, but unfortunately for us it stopped when my brother’s heart stopped,' said Angelina Stashenko, holding a portrait of her 30-year-old brother, Denys Stashenko, who was killed in action in May in the Donetsk region. 'I hope future generations will never forget the price our loved ones paid for their freedom. … I hope Ukraine’s future will be bright,' his mother, Halyna Stashenko, said. The national holiday was established in 2014 and first celebrated in 2015, following Russia’s annexation of Crimea and occupation of parts of the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine. Though no official or reliable statistics are available, tens of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers and civilians are believed to have died fighting Russia over the past 10 years. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy used the occasion to appeal for further support from his country’s Western partners, following his visit last week to the United States. 'The daily Russian terror, the daily attempts to destroy life — all this can be stopped,' Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram following the strike on Kherson, adding that 'Ukrainian strength and the determination of our partners must be greater than Putin’s desire to spread terror.' In an address to the military, Zelenskyy thanked troops for their sacrifices. 'You dedicate yourselves so that Ukraine is not surrendered. Both those who were born warriors and those who became warriors. You changed your own lives so that our freedom remains unchanged,' Zelenskyy said. 'We see your courage. We see it every day and every night. On weekdays and weekends. In heat and frost. Always. Every minute. A minute whose value you know better than anyone else. A minute that can change absolutely everything,' he said. ___ Vasilisa Stepanenko in Kyiv, Ukraine, contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-kherson-strike-market-8f9c8ba5604d483652fa9586bc8ed519	2024-09-30T23:24:30-07:00	
More than 20 are feared dead after a school bus catches fire in suburban Bangkok	BANGKOK (AP) — A bus carrying young students and their teachers on a school trip caught fire in suburban Bangkok on Tuesday, leaving more than 20 feared dead, officials and rescuers said. The bus with 45 passengers — six teachers and 39 elementary and junior high school students — was traveling from the central Uthai Thani province when it caught fire in Pathum Thani province, a northern suburb of Thailand's capital, acting police commissioner Kitrat Phanphet said. The fire was first reported around noon and was put out less than an hour later, but rescuers said they could not get on board for hours as the heat inside the natural gas-fueled vehicle could have caused more explosions. Police were still working to identify the dead but three teachers and 20 students remain unaccounted for, Kitrat said. The cause of the blaze was not immediately known. Kitrat said the initial investigation indicates a tire had exploded and caused sparks, which ignited a blaze that spread through the bus. He did not elaborate. No other vehicles were involved, he said. There were discrepancies in reports on the number of the people aboard the bus. Rescuers cited teachers who survived as saying there were three buses from the school for this trip and that along the way, some students had moved to different buses than the ones they were initially on. Videos posted on social media showed the entire bus engulfed in a fire with black smoke pouring out of the bus on the side of a road. Piyalak Thinkaew, a rescuer from the Ruam Katanyu Foundation, told reporters that most of the bodies were found in the middle and back seats, leading them to assume the victims had moved back and that the fire had started at the front of the bus. The police were looking for the driver who appeared to have fled the scene, Kitrat said, adding that the bus company and individuals involved may be charged if they are found responsible. 'Such an incident causes a great sorrow and grief,' he told reporters at a news conference. 'There is no way we will distort the fact or help anyone' escape justice, Kitrat said and added that 16 students were treated for minor injuries and been sent home while three others were hospitalized. The nearby patRangsit Hospital said three girls were initially treated there, one with burns to the face, mouth and eyes. Surgeon Anocha Takham said the doctors would do their best to save the girl, who is around 7, from losing her sight. The girls were later moved to other hospitals for further treatment. Kitrat said a teacher who survived told police the fire had spread so quickly she didn't even have the time to grab her mobile phone. Some on board managed to escape through the door while others jumped out through the windows. Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra offered her condolences in a post on the social media platform X, promising the government would cover the medical expenses and help the victims’ families. She later visited the injured in hospital. When reporters asked her about the fire at the Government House, Paetongtarn was overcome by emotion and burst into tears. She became prime minister in August and is the mother of two children.

Asian markets mixed, Japanese stocks rally from Monday's slump	HONG KONG (AP) — Asian shares were mixed on Tuesday, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 index regaining some of its sharp losses from a day earlier. A quarterly 'tankan' survey by the Bank of Japan showed business confidence among large manufacturers remained steady at 13, indicating an improved outlook for business conditions. A positive number indicates that more companies maintain an optimistic outlook on business conditions than those who feel pessimistic. The survey is closely monitored for clues about the impact of the Bank of Japan’s interest rate decisions, especially after the central bank ended negative rates in March and raised its short-term rate to 0.25% in July. Japan also reported that its unemployment rate for August fell to 2.5% from 2.7% in July, in line with market expectations. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 rallied 1.5% in early Tuesday to 38,476.33, as the yen weakened. The dollar is trading at 144.00 yen, up from 143.62 yen. On Monday, the Nikkei tumbled nearly 5% as markets reacted to the selection of Shigeru Ishiba to be Japan's next prime minister. Ishiba was due to take office Tuesday following the resignation of Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. Ishiba, an expert on defense and on domestic economic issues, was seen as a less favorable choice than some of his rivals in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, partly because he has voiced support for raising interest rates. That caused the Japanese yen to briefly jump in value against the dollar, which would hurt profits of large export manufacturers. Australia’s S&amp;P/ASX 200 dipped nearly 0.7% to 8,214.80 after the data showed that retail sales in August rose 3.1% from the same period last year, which is above expectation. Markets in China and South Korea were shut for holidays. Mainland Chinese markets, which had their best day since 2008 on Monday, will remain closed until Oct. 7 for the National Day break. On Monday, the S&amp;P 500 climbed 0.4% to reached an all-time high at 5,762.48 and clinched its fifth straight winning month and fourth straight winning quarter. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added less than 0.1% to 42,330.15. The Nasdaq composite rose 0.4% to 18,189.17. Wall Street has catapulted to records on hopes the slowing U.S. economy can keep growing while the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates to offer it more juice. A big test will arrive Friday, when the U.S. government offers its latest monthly update on the job market. An overriding worry on Wall Street is whether the economy may already be heading for a recession. Even though the Fed cut rates earlier this month and has indicated more relief is on the way, U.S. employers have already begun paring back on their hiring. Before this month, the Fed had kept interest rates at a two-decade high in hopes of slowing the economy enough to stamp out high inflation. In the bond market, U.S. Treasury yields rose after investors took comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell as a hint that coming cuts to interest rates may be more traditional sized. The Fed began its rate cuts with a larger-than-usual reduction of half a percentage point, and many traders expect the next meeting in November could yield a similar sized reduction. Fed policy makers already had indicated they were planning two more cuts this year of the traditional size of a quarter of a percentage point. But Powell said again on Monday that rate cuts are not something the Fed needs to work quickly on. After his comments, traders were betting on just a 35% probability the Fed will cut rates by another half a percentage point in November. That’s down from a 53% chance seen the day before, according to data from CME Group. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 3.78% from 3.75% late Friday. In other dealings Tuesday, benchmark U.S. crude oil added 10 cents to $68.27 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, rose 15 cents at $71.85 per barrel. The euro was trading at $1.1137, up from $1.1134. ___ AP Business Writer Stan Choe contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/stock-markets-rates-japan-fed-6b846be540b1ede94c2a2cb8410e6f15	2024-09-30T20:58:17-07:00	
NATO's long-time chief hands over to a former Dutch premier	BRUSSELS (AP) — One of NATO’s longest serving top officials, Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, steps down on Tuesday and will hand over the reins to former Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, as the military alliance confronts some of the biggest challenges in its history. Stoltenberg, NATO’s 13th secretary-general, took over in 2014, the year that 'little green men' from Russia infiltrated Ukraine. Moscow annexed the Crimean Peninsula, sparking a defense spending buildup at the world’s biggest security alliance that gathered pace over his term. His tenure was surpassed only by Dutch diplomat Joseph Luns, who spent 12 years in charge of NATO. A series of events to mark the handover will be held at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. NATO secretaries-general run the HQ, drive the alliance's working agenda, and speak on behalf of the 32-nation organization with one unifying voice. Continuity is usually the key word when they take up office. Rutte becomes NATO’s top civilian official as Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine approaches the 1,000-day mark. Political uncertainty within the organization is also high, as election fever roils the United States, its unofficial 'chairman of the board' and most powerful member. Russian forces are making advances in eastern Ukraine. Ukraine’s army has a shaky hold on part of the Kursk region in Russia, which has provided a temporary morale boost, but as casualties mount it remains outmanned and outgunned. Rutte will have to find new ways to encourage support for Ukraine among the allies, whose ranks have swelled to 32 countries since the invasion as Finland and Sweden joined to seek protection from Russia under NATO's security umbrella. Across the Atlantic, surveys suggest the U.S. election in November will be a close race. It could see a return to the White House of Donald Trump, whose bluster during his last term of office about low defense spending among European allies and Canada undermined trust of NATO member countries. It became an existential challenge, as smaller members feared that the U.S. under Trump would renege on NATO’s security pledge that all countries must to come to the rescue of any ally in trouble, the foundation stone the alliance is built on. Trump has been critical of U.S. aid to Ukraine, and he suggested last week that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy should have made concessions to Russian leader Vladimir Putin before he launched his invasion in 2022.	https://apnews.com/article/nato-stoltenberg-rutte-ukraine-3cdef166024f303e1ccb964d31c294a7	2024-09-30T20:26:32-07:00	
Rescuers search for people still missing in Nepal after flooding and landslides that killed 217	KATHMANDU, Nepal (AP) — Rescuers on Tuesday searched for people still missing and tried to recover bodies of those killed in weekend flooding and landslides in Nepal that killed more than 200 people. Weather continued to improve, and workers were clearing the highways that were blocked by landslides. Sections of several highways next to raging rivers were washed away, however, and those repairs will likely take longer. The disaster came just ahead of the country’s biggest festival Dasain, which begins on Thursday when people return home to celebrate with their families. The damage to roads is likely to hamper festival travel plans for many. The government has said it was focusing on helping people who were stranded and who have lost their homes in the flooding and landslides. Nepal police said the death toll by Tuesday had reached 217 while 143 people had been injured. There were still 28 people who were reported missing and searches were continuing for them. Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Oli returned home Monday afternoon from attending the U.N. General Assembly meeting and immediately called an emergency meeting of his Cabinet. Police and soldiers were assisting with rescue efforts, while heavy equipment was used to clear the landslides from the roads. Schools and colleges were closed until Tuesday to help clean up the premises and students to be able to recover. The days of heavy rain came toward the end of Nepal's monsoon season, which began in June and usually ends by mid-September.	https://apnews.com/article/nepal-flood-landslide-deaths-3d8622e5e258920b013976ce37e155e1	2024-09-30T20:22:53-07:00	
Drone boat hits ship in Red Sea as missile strikes another in likely assaults by Yemen Houthi rebels	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — An explosive-loaded drone crashed into one ship Tuesday in the Red Sea as a missile exploded against another, the British military and private security officials said, marking the latest suspected attacks by Yemen’s Houthi rebels. The attacks likely are the rebels’ first assaults on commercial shipping in weeks as the Israel-Hamas war threatens to become a regional conflict. They come as Israeli ground forces entered Lebanon after days of Israeli airstrikes that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and other top officials, and earlier explosions of sabotaged electronic devices used by the Shiite militia. The Houthis threatened 'escalating military operations' targeting Israel on Monday after they apparently shot down a U.S. military drone flying over Yemen. The first attack took place some 110 kilometers (70 miles) off the port city of Hodeida. A captain on a ship saw four 'splashes' near his vessel, the British military’s United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center said in a warning. That likely would have been missiles or drones launched at the vessel that missed. The UKMTO later said the first ship it reported on was later damaged by a drone boat that punctured one of its ballast tanks in another attack. Those tanks control a ship’s buoyancy. Houthi strikes in the past have targeted ships at their waterline to disable the vessels. The private security firm Ambrey also identified the drone as a drone boat, which have been increasingly used by the Houthis. The ship had been heading north to the Suez Canal with armed private security guards aboard, the firm said. Another attack with a missile targeted a separate ship also heading north to the Suez Canal with armed security on board, Ambrey said. The Houthis did not immediately claim responsibility for the attacks. However, they sometimes take hours or days to acknowledge their assaults. Instead, Houthi military spokesperson Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree said in a prerecorded video Tuesday that the rebels had launched drones targeting Israel — attacks unreported by Israel as it faces incoming fire from Hezbollah. The Houthis have exaggerated claims in the past. The Red Sea has become a battlefield for shippers since the Houthis began their campaign targeting ships traveling through the waterway, which once saw $1 trillion a year of cargo pass through it. Houthis have targeted more than 80 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started last October. They have seized one vessel and sunk two in the campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have included Western military vessels. The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the United Kingdom to force an end to Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran. The last attack on a merchant ship by the Houthis was on Sept. 2. The Houthis claimed responsibility for an attack targeting American warships last week. The rebels fired more than a half dozen ballistic missiles and anti-ship cruise missiles and two drones at three U.S. ships that were traveling through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, but all were intercepted by the Navy destroyers, a U.S. official said Friday. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details not yet publicly released. The Houthis also continue to launch missiles targeting Israel, drawing retaliatory airstrikes from the Israelis this weekend on Hodeida.	https://apnews.com/article/yemen-houthi-rebels-red-sea-attacks-israel-hamas-war-2faa48176d4f773003b6a4a3ad5ca73d	2024-09-30T20:03:34-07:00	
A former hostage fought for her own life in Gaza. A year on, she fights for her husband's freedom	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — As a hostage in Gaza, Aviva Siegel found herself begging for food and water. Since her release, she has found herself begging for her husband to be set free from his own ongoing captivity. Siegel has come to embody the disaster that befell Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Armed Hamas militants snatched her from her home and thrust her into Gaza’s web of tunnels. Released during a brief cease-fire in November, she returned to find her community destroyed and became one of tens of thousands of Israelis displaced by conflict. She has emerged as a prominent voice in the struggle to free the remaining hostages, fighting tirelessly for her husband’s release. But as her ordeal reaches the one-year mark, Israel’s attention is focused not on the plight of the hostages and their families, but on fighting Hezbollah in Lebanon. It's the latest diversion to chip away at Siegel's hope that she may reunite with her husband of 43 years anytime soon. 'The hostages, they are being left to die. To die slowly. How can I handle that? I just don’t know how to handle it anymore,' she said, sitting beside a poster of her husband, Keith, a 65-year-old American Israeli originally from Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Her torment is all the more acute because she knows firsthand what her husband is enduring. 'Hostages were chained, tortured, starved, beaten up into pieces. I saw that in front of my eyes. That’s what they did to us,' she said from a short-term rental apartment in Tel Aviv, one of the many places she has lived since her return during the November cease-fire, the first and only deal reached between Israel and Hamas during the war. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to continue the war until 'total victory' over Hamas and pledged to bring home the hostages, but has faced widespread criticism that dozens remain captive a year after the attack. Netanyahu has also argued that the pressure on Hezbollah will, in turn, lead to pressure on its ally Hamas and help speed up the release of the hostages. The Siegels were jolted awake on Oct. 7 at their home in Kibbutz Kfar Aza, one of the hardest-hit communities that day, by a burst of air raid sirens. Like so many others, they took cover in their safe room, built to protect against rocket attacks, that turned out to be no match for the rifle- and grenade-toting Hamas militants who stormed their home. In its attack, Hamas kidnapped roughly 250 people, including women, children and older people. It killed some 1,200 people — most of them civilians — according to Israeli authorities. The war the attack sparked has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, over half of them women and children, according to health officials in Gaza. Hamas has said the hostages are treated humanely, but multiple accounts from freed hostages contradict that. The militants led the Siegels out of their house, shoved her husband, breaking his ribs, and shot him in the hand, Siegel said. They were forced into their own car and driven into Gaza, where crowds of onlookers cheered at their capture. Their first stop was a home with a living room that opened up into an underground tunnel. 'And there’s somebody underneath the hole, in the hole underneath the ground, that’s waiting with a smile, happy as can be. I’ll never forget his face,' she said. They climbed down a steep ladder into the tunnel, one of several they were held in throughout Siegel’s 51 days in captivity. All told, Siegel was moved around 13 times, held in both tunnels and militants’ homes, she said. On the first day, they were joined by other hostages and they were brought pita and cheese, which hardly anyone ate because they were all in shock. But throughout her captivity, food was scarce and Siegel said there were entire days when she wasn’t brought anything to eat. 'They used to starve us while they ate in front of us and not bring us water for hours and days. I had an infection in my stomach, I was dehydrated. We had to beg — beg — for water. Beg and beg for food.' The first tunnel had light — others did not — as well as a fan that labored to circulate the scant air. Seven hostages were held in a room Siegel described as being about the size of three yoga mats. She found comfort in having her husband by her side throughout. She brushed her teeth four times over those weeks and washed herself the same amount, in salt water. 'It’s disgusting. We were filthy. Dirty. The smell that came out of us is the worst that you can imagine,' she said. But worse was the treatment from the guards. Siegel, a 63-year-old grandmother of five, said she was pushed and yanked by the hair and shoved into cars. Her captors told her that Hamas had taken over her kibbutz and that Israel didn’t care about freeing her. So she was in disbelief when freedom came on Nov. 26. But it came at a price: Her husband was to remain behind. Her parting words to him were, 'Be strong for me,' and she promised to be strong for him. Since their painful goodbye, she has crisscrossed Israel and the world, sharing her story and pleading for her husband's release. She has met Netanyahu, United States President Joe Biden and United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, among others. She has spoken repeatedly to Israeli lawmakers and become a fixture at weekly protests in support of the hostages. But her energetic advocacy has been beaten down by the horrific twists and turns of the war. Since her release, she has watched multiple rounds of hostage negotiations collapse. Hostages have been killed by Hamas but also mistakenly by Israeli forces, and some have been rescued. The fighting in Israel’s north, and the stunning assassination of Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, feels like another blow to her struggle, which has faded from the public consciousness. Siegel said she can’t bring herself to watch a video of her husband that Hamas released in April. Clearly filmed under duress, he says he is OK, but breaks down in tears and lays his head on his knees, sobbing. She finds the strength to soldier on by thinking about him, a vegetarian who loves reading books to his grandchildren and studied Arabic so he could converse with workers from Gaza who were employed in the kibbutz. But a year on, her hope is wearing thin. 'I don’t know why I get up,' she said. 'But I do know that I have to get up for Keith.' ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/hostages-gaza-tunnels-hamas-israel-war-d8ecb415268e911cea09518acdaf7ba2	2024-09-30T19:36:39-07:00	
WikiLeaks' Julian Assange to make first public statement since his release from prison	LONDON (AP) — Wikileaks founder Julian Assange will make his first public statements since he was released from prison when he addresses the Council of Europe on Tuesday. Assange, 53, is expected to give evidence to the legal affairs and human rights committee of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg, France. The Parliamentary Assembly, which includes parliamentarians from 46 European countries, said the hearing will discuss Assange's detention and conviction 'and their chilling effect on human rights' ahead of a debate on the topic on Wednesday. WikiLeaks said in a statement that Assange will attend the hearing in person 'due to the exceptional nature of the invitation.' Assange was released in June after five years in a British prison after he pleaded guilty to obtaining and publishing U.S. military secrets in a deal with Justice Department prosecutors that concluded a drawn-out legal saga. Prior to his time in prison, he had spent seven years in self-imposed exile in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he claimed asylum on the grounds of political persecution. The Australian internet publisher was accused of receiving and publishing hundreds of thousands of war logs and diplomatic cables that included details of U.S. military wrongdoing in Iraq and Afghanistan. His activities were celebrated by press freedom advocates, who heralded his role in bringing to light military conduct that might otherwise have been concealed. Among the files published by WikiLeaks was a video of a 2007 Apache helicopter attack by American forces in Baghdad that killed 11 people, including two Reuters journalists. But critics say his conduct put American national security and innocent lives — such as people who provided information to U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan — at risk, and strayed far beyond the bounds of traditional journalism duties. The years-long case ended with Assange entering his plea in a U.S. district court on the Northern Mariana Islands, an American commonwealth in the Pacific. Assange pleaded guilty to an Espionage Act charge of conspiring to unlawfully obtain and disseminate classified national defense information. A judge sentenced him to the five years he had already spent behind bars in the U.K. fighting extradition to the United States. Assange returned to Australia a free man in late June. At the time his wife, Stella, said he needed time to recuperate before speaking publicly. His appearance on Tuesday comes after the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly published a report on Assange's detention in a high-security U.K. prison for five years. The assembly's human rights committee said Assange qualified as a political prisoner and issued a draft resolution expressing deep concern at his harsh treatment.	https://apnews.com/article/julian-assange-statement-council-europe-5373cfb854474deba0e5799b23cb8d2e	2024-09-30T19:23:26-07:00	
Claudia Sheinbaum to be sworn in as 1st female president of Mexico, a country with pressing problems	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Claudia Sheinbaum will take the oath of office Tuesday as Mexico’s first female president in more than 200 years of independence, promising to protect an expanded social safety net and fight for the poor like her predecessor, but facing pressing problems. The 62-year-old scientist-turned-politician will receive a country with a number of immediate challenges, foremost among them stubbornly high levels of violence, a sluggish economy and hurricane-battered Acapulco. Sheinbaum romped to victory in June with nearly 60% of the vote, propelled largely by the sustained popularity of her political mentor, former President Andrés Manuel López Obrador. He took office six years ago declaring 'For the good of all, first the poor,' and promising historical change from the neoliberal economic policies of his predecessors. Sheinbaum promised continuity from his popular social policies to controversial constitutional reforms to the judiciary and National Guard rammed through during his final days in office. Despite her pledge of continuity, she is a very different personality. 'López Obrador was a tremendously charismatic president and many times that charisma allowed him to cover up some political errors that Claudia Sheinbaum will not have that possibility of doing,' said Carlos Pérez Ricart, a political analyst at Mexico’s Center for Economic Research and Teaching. 'So, where López Obrador was charismatic, Claudia Sheinbaum will have to be effective.' He is not leaving her an easy situation. Her first trip as president will be to the flood-stricken Pacific coast resort of Acapulco. Hurricane John, which struck as a Category 3 hurricane last week and then reemerged into the ocean and struck again as a tropical storm, caused four days of incredibly heavy rain that killed at least 17 people along the coast around Acapulco. Acapulco was devastated in October 2023 by Hurricane Otis, and had not recovered from that blow when John hit. Sheinbaum must also deal with raging violence in the cartel-dominated northern city of Culiacan, where factional fighting within the Sinaloa cartel broke out after drug lords Ismael 'El Mayo' Zambada and Joaquín Guzmán López were apprehended in the United States after they flew there in a small plane on July 25. López Obrador has long sought to avoid confronting Mexico’s drug cartels and has openly appealed to the gangs to keep the peace among themselves, but the limitations of that strategy have become glaringly apparent in Culiacan, the capital of Sinaloa state, where gun battles have raged on the city’s streets. Local authorities and even the army — which López Obrador has relied on for everything — have essentially admitted that the fighting will only end when the cartel bosses decide to end it. But that’s only the latest hotspot. Drug-related violence is surging from Tijuana in the north to Chiapas in the south, displacing thousands. While Sheinbaum inherits a huge budget deficit, unfinished construction projects and a burgeoning bill for her party’s cash hand-out programs — all of which could send financial markets tumbling — perhaps her biggest looming concern is the possibility of a victory for Donald Trump in the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election. Trump has already vowed to slap 100% tariffs on vehicles made in Mexico. Though that would likely violate the current U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, there are other things Trump could do to make life difficult for Sheinbaum, including his pledge of massive deportations. Things with its northern neighbor were already tense after López Obrador said he was putting relations with the U.S. embassy 'on pause' after public criticism of the proposed judicial overhaul. First lady Jill Biden struck an optimistic tone for relations with the incoming Sheinbaum administration saying at a reception Monday that, 'Under Dr. Sheinbaum’s presidency I know we will continue to build a more prosperous, safe and democratic region — and take the steps in our U.S.-Mexico partnership.' There are areas where Sheinbaum could try to take Mexico in a new direction. For example, she has a Ph.D. in energy engineering and has spoken of the need to address climate change. López Obrador built a massive new oil refinery and poured money into the state-owned oil company. But his budget commitments do not leave her much room to maneuver. Jennifer Piscopo, professor of gender and politics at the Royal Holloway University of London who has studied Latin America for decades, said Mexico electing its first female leader is important because it will show girls they can do it too, but it can also create unrealistic expectations. 'Woman firsts are powerful symbols, but they do not gain magic power,' she said. 'Especially when the governance challenges are so large, expecting magic solutions overnight can also generate outsized disappointment.' ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-president-claudia-sheinbaum-7d3599b39a7298df46e7eda34d80afee	2024-09-30T19:13:54-07:00

South Korea unveils its most powerful missile, which could reach North Korea's underground bunkers	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea unveiled its most powerful ballistic missile and other weapons targeting North Korea during a massive Armed Forces Day ceremony Tuesday, as the South's president warned the North's regime would collapse if it attempts to use nuclear weapons. South Korea’s weapons displays and warning against North Korea came after its northern rival recently rose regional animosities by disclosing its uranium-enrichment facility and tested missiles ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November. 'If North Korea attempts to use nuclear weapons, it will face the resolute and overwhelming response of our military and the (South Korea)-U.S. alliance,' President Yoon Suk Yeol told thousands of troops gathered at a military airport near Seoul. 'That day will be the end of the North Korean regime.' 'The North Korean regime must abandon the delusion that nuclear weapons will protect them,' Yoon said. During the ceremony, the South Korean military displayed about 340 military equipment and weapons systems. Among them was its most powerful Hyunmoo-5 ballistic missile, which observers say is capable of carrying an 8-ton conventional warhead that can penetrate deep into the earth and destroy underground bunkers in North Korea. It was the first time for South Korea to disclose that missile. The U.S. flew a long-range B-1B bomber during the ceremony in an apparent demonstration of its security commitment to its Asian ally. South Korea also flew some of its most advanced fighter jets. Later Tuesday, South Korea will parade its troops and weapons through the streets of Seoul, the capital, as part of efforts to boost military morale and demonstrate its deterrence capabilities against potential North Korean aggressions. Also Tuesday, South Korea launched its strategic command that officials say integrates South Korea’s conventional capabilities with U.S. nuclear weapons. South Korea has no nuclear weapons. Since taking office in 2022, Yoon, a conservative, has put a stronger military alliance with the U.S. and an improved trilateral Seoul-Washington-Tokyo security cooperation at the center of his security polices to cope with North Korea’s advancing nuclear program. In recent years, North Korea has performed a provocative of missile tests and threatened to use nuclear weapons preemptively in potential conflicts with South Korea and the United States. Last month, concerns about North Korea’s bomb program further grew after it published photos of a secretive facility to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons. It was North Korea’s first unveiling of a uranium-enrichment facility since it showed one at the country’s main Yongbyon nuclear complex to visiting American scholars in 2010. South Korean officials say North Korea will likely try to further dial up tensions with provocative weapons tests ahead of the U.S. election to increase its leverage in future diplomacy with a new U.S. government. Experts say North Korea likely thinks an expanded nuclear arsenal would help it win bigger U.S. concessions like extensive sanctions relief. Earlier Tuesday, North Korea’s vice defense minister, Kim Kang Il, slammed the U.S. for its temporary deployments of powerful military assets to South Korea and vowed strong responses. He cited the recent visit of a U.S. nuclear-powered submarine and Tuesday's B-1B flyover. Kim threatened to bolster North Korea's 'powerful war deterrent,' an apparent reference to its nuclear capability, and take unspecified steps to stoke security concerns to the security of the U.S. mainland. Observers say his comments implies North Korea may consider test-firing an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the U.S. mainland. ___ Follow AP's Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-missile-north-nuclear-7f2f8774b8ebbe697e611b14c06c1de5	2024-09-30T19:01:40-07:00	
Knife attack in Shanghai supermarket kills 3, injures 15 others	BEIJING (AP) — A knife attack at a supermarket in Shanghai killed three people and injured 15 others, local police said. A 37-year-old man surnamed Lin was taken into custody by police responding to the report of the attack Monday evening, the local Songjiang police branch said in a statement Tuesday. Eighteen people were sent to hospital for treatment, and three later died. Police said Lin had personal financial disputes and came to Shanghai to 'vent his anger,' and that further investigation is underway. The attack took place in a suburban district southwest of Shanghai and comes on the eve of the weeklong National Day holidays. Several knife attacks have occurred in China this year. Last month, a 10-year-old Japanese student died after being stabbed near his school in southern China. This follows another knife attack at a school bus stop for a Japanese school that killed a Chinese national who tried to stop the attacker, and injured a Japanese mother and child. Earlier this year, a Chinese man stabbed four U.S. university instructors at a public park in Jilin in the northeast and a Chinese person who tried to intervene. The four instructors from Cornell College were teaching at Beihua University. Their injuries were not critical.	https://apnews.com/article/china-knife-stabbing-attack-shanghai-5a70923e123cf88ca8edffe5efdf787f	2024-09-30T18:31:01-07:00	
Indian-controlled Kashmir votes in final phase of polls to elect local government	SRINAGAR, India (AP) — The final phase of voting to choose a local government in Indian-controlled Kashmir wrapped up Tuesday, the first such vote since Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government stripped the disputed region of its special status five years ago. Over 3.9 million residents were eligible to cast ballots to choose 40 lawmakers out of 415 candidates in the region’s seven districts during the third — and last — phase of the election. It’s the first such vote in a decade and the first since Modi’s Hindu nationalist government scrapped the Muslim-majority region’s semi-autonomy in 2019. Thousands of armed government forces patrolled the voting districts and guarded over 5,000 polling stations. Lines of voters stretched across the stations. The region’s chief electoral office said about 69% turnout was recorded on Tuesday. India's unprecedented move in 2019 downgraded and divided the former state into two centrally governed union territories, Ladakh and Jammu-Kashmir. Both are ruled directly by New Delhi through its appointed administrators along with unelected bureaucrats. The move — which largely resonated in India and among Modi supporters — was mostly opposed in Kashmir as an assault on its identity and autonomy. The region has since been on edge with civil liberties curbed and media gagged. India and Pakistan each administer a part of Kashmir, but both claim the territory in its entirety. The nuclear-armed rivals have fought two of their three wars over the territory since they gained independence from British colonial rule in 1947. In Jammu areas, tens of thousands of Pakistani Hindu refugees are voting for the first time in any regional election since their migration in 1947. The refugees, officially called West Pakistan Refugees, have long been recognized as Indian citizens with voting rights in national elections. However, before the 2019 changes, Kashmir’s special status allowed only descendants from residents of the territory in 1934 to vote and own property. At a polling station in Jammu’s R S Pura area, scores of these refugees lined up to cast their votes. 'It’s a Diwali for us,' said the first-time voter Vikram Choudhary, 26, comparing the vote to the Hindu festival of light symbolizing the victory of light over darkness. 'We feel liberated.' 'Our children will have a secure future and a say in local affairs now,' said another voter, 76-year-old Satpal Choudhary. India’s ruling BJP has a strong political base in the region’s Hindu-dominated areas of Jammu that largely favor the 2019 changes and has won multiple seats from there in the past elections. But it is weak in the Kashmir Valley where the BJP has never won a seat. The party has fielded only 19 candidates for the 47 seats in the valley while it is contesting all 43 seats in Jammu. Modi’s party is not officially aligned with any local group, but many politicians believe it is tacitly supporting some parties and independent candidates in the valley who privately agree with it. The region’s main pro-India political parties say the BJP is trying to manipulate the election and fragment the valley’s vote through independents. About 43% of 503 candidates contesting the vote in the Kashmir Valley are independents, compared to 35% of 359 candidates in Jammu. As in the previous phases of the elections, many voters in the valley said people were frustrated over the absence of their own representatives for so many years. The ballot was the only means for them to express anger at India's actions in the region, they said. 'Truth is that it’s the central government has been the real ruler here even before 2019,' said Syed Altaf after casting his vote in the Kashmir Valley’s Pattan area. Voting began Sept. 18 with about 61% turnout. In the second phase of voting on last Wednesday, overall turnout was about 55%. There were no incidents reported in either phase. Authorities said the region's overall turnout was 63% in the three phases. Votes will be counted next Tuesday, with results expected later that day. The multistage election will allow Kashmir to have its own truncated government and a local legislature, called an assembly, rather than being directly under New Delhi’s rule. However, there will be a limited transition of power from New Delhi to the 90-seat assembly as Kashmir will remain a 'union territory' — directly controlled by the federal government — with India’s Parliament as its main legislator. Kashmir’s statehood must be restored for the new government to have powers similar to other states of India. Militants in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir have been fighting New Delhi’s rule since 1989. Many Muslim Kashmiris support the rebels’ goal of uniting the territory, either under Pakistani rule or as an independent country. India insists the Kashmir militancy is Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. Pakistan denies the charge, and many Kashmiris consider it a legitimate freedom struggle. Tens of thousands of civilians, rebels and government forces have been killed in the conflict. ___ Associated Press journalist Channi Anand contributed to this story from Jammu, India. ___ Follow AP’s Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific	https://apnews.com/article/kashmir-election-phase-3-india-pakistan-419006d6b3e53bb931751a20134a82eb	2024-09-30T17:47:57-07:00	
Japan’s parliament elects Shigeru Ishiba, newly elected governing party leader, as prime minister	TOKYO (AP) — Japan’s parliament on Tuesday formally elected Shigeru Ishiba, head of the governing Liberal Democratic Party, as the country’s new prime minister. Ishiba was chosen as the party's leader on Friday to replace Fumio Kishida, who then stepped down earlier on Tuesday to pave the way. Ishiba will announce his new Cabinet later on Tuesday. Kishida took office in 2021 but left so his party could have a fresh leader after his government was dogged by scandals. Ishiba plans to call a parliamentary election for Oct. 27. 'I believe it is important to have the new administration get the public’s judgment as soon as possible,' Ishiba said Monday in announcing his plan to call a snap election. Opposition parties criticized Ishiba for allowing only a short period of time for his policies to be examined and discussed in parliament before the national election. Kishida had announced in August he would resign at the end of his three-year term. Kishida and his ministers stepped down at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday morning, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said. Kishida left his office after a brief send-off ceremony in which he was presented a bouquet of red roses and applauded by his staff and former Cabinet members. 'As we face a critical moment in and outside the country, I earnestly hope key policies that will pioneer Japan's future will be powerfully pursued by the new Cabinet,' Kishida said in a statement, citing the need to bolster security amid a deepening global divide, such as Russia's war in Ukraine, while tackling a declining birthrate and population, as well as economic and political reforms at home. Ishiba earlier announced his party's leaders ahead of naming his Cabinet. Former Environment Minister Shinjiro Koizumi, who came in third in the party leadership race, will head the party’s election task force. He is expected to name defense experts Takeshi Iwaya as foreign minister and Gen Nakatani as defense chief. The majority of his Cabinet ministers, like Ishiba, are expected to be unaffiliated with factions led and controlled by party heavyweights, and none are from former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's powerful group linked to damaging scandals. Ishiba's lack of stable power base could also mean a fragility of his government, and 'could quickly collapse' even though Ishiba hopes to build up party unity as it prepares for the upcoming election, the liberal-leaning Asahi newspaper said. The move is also seen as revenge by Ishiba, who was largely pushed to the side during most of Abe's reign. Ishiba has proposed an Asian version of the NATO military alliance and more discussion among regional partners about the use of the U.S. nuclear deterrence. He also suggested a more equal Japan-U.S. security alliance, including joint management of U.S. bases in Japan and having Japanese Self Defense Force bases in the United States. Ishiba outlined his views in an article to the Hudson Institute last week. 'The absence of a collective self-defense system like NATO in Asia means that wars are likely to break out because there is no obligation for mutual defense. Under these circumstances, the creation of an Asian version of NATO is essential to deter China by its Western allies,' he wrote. Ishiba proposes combining of existing security and diplomatic groupings, such as the Quad and other bilateral and multilateral frameworks involving the United States, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea and the Philippines. He also noted that the Asian version of NATO can also consider sharing of the control of U.S. nuclear weapons in the region as a deterrence against growing threats from China, North Korea and Russia. Ishiba on Friday stressed Japan needs to reinforce its security, noting recent violations of Japanese airspace by Russian and Chinese warplanes and repeated missile launches by North Korea. He pledged to continue Kishida’s economic policy aimed at pulling Japan out of deflation and achieving real salary increases, while tackling challenges such as Japan’s declining birthrate and population and resilience to natural disasters. The LDP has had a nearly unbroken tenure governing Japan since World War II. The party members may have seen Ishiba’s more centrist views as crucial in pushing back challenges by the liberal-leaning opposition and winning voter support as the party reels from corruption scandals that drove down Kishida’s popularity. Ishiba, first elected to parliament in 1986, has served as defense minister, agriculture minister and in other key Cabinet posts, and was LDP secretary general under Abe. ___ Follow AP's Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific	https://apnews.com/article/japan-cabinet-kishida-ishiba-fa7f80b614a8bf298852b6766dbf6403	2024-09-30T15:51:20-07:00	
Humberto Ortega, Nicaragua's ex-military chief who later turned critic of his brother, dies at 77	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Nicaraguan guerrilla fighter Humberto Ortega, a Sandinista defense minister who later in life became a critic of his older brother President Daniel Ortega, died Monday at 77, Nicaragua's army said. The younger Ortega became the head of the Sandinista army and the country’s defense minister after the overthrow of dictator Anastasio Somoza in 1979. Later in life, Humberto Ortega publicly criticized some actions of his brother’s increasingly repressive administrations. He had been ill and effectively under house arrest for some time. He died Monday at a military hospital, the Nicaraguan military posted on social media. A cause of death was not provided, but a government statement said he had had a prolonged illness. It also praised his bravery in 'revolutionary military actions.' Local media reported in May that police had surrounded Humberto Ortega’s home, the same day online news outlet Infobae published a lengthy interview with him, in which he discussed his at times tense relationship with his brother. He also characterized his brother’s current administration as 'authoritarian, dictatorial' in explaining that when the leader of such a government dies, it is very difficult for there to be continuity with the immediate group in power. At the time, police said in a statement that the Health Ministry had visited 77-year-old Humberto Ortega, who suffered from heart problems, in his home and evaluated his health without ever saying why he was under police guard. Venezuela President Nicolás Maduro expressed his condolences in a statement, praising Humberto Ortega as a freedom fighter. Dissident and former presidential hopeful turned political exile Juan Sebastián Chamorro told the Associated Press 'the legacy of Humberto Ortega is intrinsically linked with the war.' While Chamorro blamed the government for contributing to Ortega's death, he said he also had a hand in the state of the country today. 'He has a lot of responsibility, above all what has happened in the past 40-some years, and particularly in was policy that brought a lot death and destruction to the country,' Chamorro said. The younger Ortega joined the fighters of the Sandinista National Liberation Front and was wounded in the arm in 1969 during an operation to free Carlos Fonseca, the Sandinista commander, from a Costa Rican prison. When the revolution succeeded in overthrowing dictator Anastasio Somoza in 1979, Humberto Ortega was made the head of the Sandinista army and defense minister. He made military service obligatory and would later say in interviews that he had mobilized more than 320,000 young recruits as the Sandinistas battled the United States-backed 'Contra' rebels in a war that began in 1981 and ended in 1990, leaving at least 35,000 dead. Even after his brother’s surprising election loss to Violeta Chamorro in 1990, Humberto Ortega stayed on as leader of Nicaragua’s army for another five years, professionalizing its ranks and making it subordinate to civilian leadership. Humberto Ortega’s political thinking evolved as he moved from guerilla fighter to businessman. In 1981, he threatened to 'hang the bourgeoisie from the light posts,' but by 1996 he was defending his fortune saying he wasn’t going to leave government 'on a bicycle.' After his retirement in 1995, he split time between Nicaragua and Costa Rica, focusing on his business interests and penning essays that advocated a more centrist position and a national conciliation government. Humberto Ortega’s more moderate positions eventually became uncomfortable for his brother who returned to the presidency in 2007. When widespread street protests in April 2018 became demonstrations against Daniel Ortega’s government, the president responded with brutal repression from the police and paramilitary forces. Humberto Ortega called for an end to the use of paramilitaries and accused security forces of 'indiscriminate repression' that left at least 355 dead. 'The army must speak with Daniel Ortega' to control the situation, Humberto Ortega said in a local interview at the time. In 2019, Humberto Ortega spoke out again after the arrest of some 168 opposition figures. His brother responded publicly, saying 'some traitors and sellouts who had said that there wouldn’t be enough lightposts to hang all of the rich, now come out saying that these gentlemen are not terrorists.' In February 2022, he also criticized his brother’s administration with the death of former guerrilla and retired general Hugo Torres after eight months in a notorious Managua prison. Torres had split from Ortega’s government years earlier and was an outspoken critic. Humberto Ortega wrote in a local news outlet that Torres had died at age 73 in a 'cruel imprisonment.' President Ortega visited his younger brother in December, according to a government report that described his condition as serious. The younger Ortega, author of several books of history and military strategy, had suffered from heart problems and was hospitalized in October 2021. ___ AP reporter Megan Janetsky and former reporter Gabriela Selser contributed to this report.

China marks 75 years of Communist Party rule as economic challenges and security threats linger	BEIJING (AP) — China is marking the 75th year of Communist Party rule as economic challenges and security threats linger over the massive state. No festivities have been announced for the occasion Tuesday, save for a flag-raising ceremony at Tiananmen Square, with an honor guard marching from the entrance of the sprawling palace that in past centuries was the home of Chinese emperors. The entirely state-controlled media ran constant reports on China's economic progress and social stability, with no mention of challenges ranging from a declining birth rate to the disruption in supply chains that has harmed the largely export-driven economy. Commemorations were also held in the former British colony of Hong Kong and Portugal's former territory of Macao, both of which returned to Chinese sovereignty in the late 1990s in a key indication of Beijing's determination to overcome what it has called a 'Century of Humiliation.' In recent decades, China has mounted military parades and displays of the country's economic might only at the turn of decades, such as for the 60th and 70th anniversaries. The world’s second largest economy has struggled to regain momentum after the COVID-19 pandemic. A prolonged property slump led to a spillover effect on other parts of the economy, from construction to sales of home appliances. Last week, China announced a slew of measures to boost the economy, including lower interest rates and smaller down payment requirements for mortgages. Party leader and head of state Xi Jinping has largely avoided overseas travel since the pandemic, while continuing with his purges at home of top officials considered insufficiently loyal or being suspected of corruption or personal indiscretions. 'The road ahead will not be smooth, there will definitely be difficulties and obstacles, and we may encounter major tests such as high winds and rough seas, or even stormy waves' Xi warned during a banquet on the eve of the anniversary. 'We must be vigilant in times of peace, plan ahead, and rely closely on the entire Party, the entire army, and people of all ethnic groups across the country' he said, 'no difficulties can stop the Chinese people from moving forward.' The anniversary also comes as China is facing growing frictions with neighbors including Japan, South Korea and the Philippines over territorial claims and their close relationships with Beijing’s chief rival, the United States. The Communists under Mao Zedong seized power in 1949 amid a civil war with the Nationalists, also known as the KMT, led by Chiang Kai-shek, who shifted their political, economic and military power to the now self-governing island democracy of Taiwan. Beijing continues to insist Taiwan must be annexed under Communist Party rule, by force if necessary, while the U.S. has provided arms to ensure its defense. China, meanwhile, has involved itself in disputes over its claims to most of the South China Sea and uninhabited islands held by Japan, the Philippines, Vietnam and other neighboring nations. China's military buildup and its recent launch of a nuclear capable ballistic missile into the Pacific Ocean have raised concerns about a possible conflict. At home, Xi has made himself effectively leader for life by ending term limits and extending his power over key government and party bodies. China allows no competitive elections and the party retains near total control over the media that informs its 1.4 billion people.	https://apnews.com/article/china-communist-party-foundation-day-russia-south-china-sea-5f140a2c8db38029ea0c0f2769e9f619	2024-09-30T15:20:23-07:00	
US opts out of running for reelection on UN Human Rights Council	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration has decided not to seek a second consecutive term on the much-maligned U.N. Human Rights Council, the State Department said Monday. The administration had made U.S. membership on the Geneva-based council a priority when it took office in 2021 after former President Donald Trump had withdrawn from the body, citing anti-Israel bias. Since returning to the council, the administration has frequently taken issue with its votes on the Middle East and other issues. 'We decided not to seek another (term) on the Human Rights Council at this time because we are engaged with our allies about the best way to move forward,' State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters. Elections for the 47-member council are held by the U.N. General Assembly with candidate countries coming from various geographic groups. The three other candidates — Iceland, Spain and Switzerland — from the U.S. geographic group known as Western Hemisphere and Others, or WEOG, would be able to represent American interests and values, Miller said. 'All of them are countries with a very strong record of support for human rights,' he said. 'We thought they would carry the flag forward, but we will continue to remain engaged on human rights issues.' The council was created in 2006 to replace a human rights commission discredited because of some members’ poor rights records. But the new council soon came to face similar criticism, including that rights abusers sought seats to protect themselves and their allies. The U.S. has criticized the selection of candidates with poor rights records on uncontested slates. The U.S. has been the most vocal defender of Israel and has repeatedly joined it in denouncing alleged anti-Israel bias in the U.N. rights body. Spain, meanwhile, was one of three European countries to announce they would recognize a Palestinian state — a move Israel criticized. What the U.S. saw as the council's excessive criticism of Israel culminated in the Trump administration’s withdrawal from it in June 2018. In announcing the Biden administration would reverse Trump's decision, Secretary of State Antony Blinken criticized the withdrawal, saying it 'did nothing to encourage meaningful change, but instead created a vacuum of U.S. leadership, which countries with authoritarian agendas have used to their advantage.'	https://apnews.com/article/us-un-human-rights-council-dafc1b0484cab70d0661460c163f7bba	2024-09-30T11:31:24-07:00	
Aid group says Congo had 25,000 victims of sexual violence last year	KINSHASA, Congo (AP) — Doctors Without Borders treated more than 25,000 victims of sexual violence in the Congo last year, by far the highest level it has seen there and most of it in the east where armed groups vie for power, the aid group said Monday. The vast majority of victims — averaging more than two per hour — were treated in displacement camps near Goma. the capital of Congo's eastern province of North Kivu, the group said. 'According to the testimonies of our patients, two-thirds of them were assaulted at gunpoint,' Christopher Mambula, the group’s program manager in Congo, said in the report. Eastern Congo has struggled with armed violence as more than 120 armed groups fight for power, land and valuable mineral resources while others try to defend their communities. Some armed groups have been accused of mass killings, rapes and other human rights violations. The violence has displaced some 6 million people in the east. Congo alleges that neighboring Rwanda has been involved in aggression and war crimes in the region. It also accuses Rwanda of giving military backing to the M23 rebel armed group. Rwanda denies the claim, but in February admitted that it has troops and missile systems in eastern Congo to safeguard its security, pointing to a buildup of Congolese forces near the border. M23, of the March 23 Movement, is a rebel military group mainly made up of ethnic Tutsis that broke away from the Congolese army just over a decade ago. They staged a large offensive in 2012 and took over the provincial capital of Goma near the border with Rwanda, the same city they are threatening again. Earlier this week, Human Rights Watch said both Rwanda and Congo’s army have killed displacement camp residents, committed rapes and obstructed aid. 'While the massive presence of armed men in and around displacement sites explains this explosion of sexual violence, the inadequacy of the humanitarian response and the inhumane living conditions in these sites fuel the phenomenon,' Doctors Without Borders said in its report. High numbers of sexual assaults have also been recorded this year by the charity, which treated more than 17,000 victims between January and May in the North Kivu province alone. ——————- Banchereau reported from Dakar, Senegal	https://apnews.com/article/congo-sexual-violence-doctors-without-borders-74aeb67d4b76088ea43257f9321f96f8	2024-09-30T11:21:51-07:00	
On a day when isolated nations get their say at the UN, North Korea reups condemnation of US	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — North Korea condemned the United States and its allies Monday for 'stirring up military confrontations still further' by engaging in war games in the Asia-Pacific region and 'talking unceasingly' about regime change in the diplomatically isolated nation. U.N. Ambassador Kim Song said North Korea was taking unspecified steps to defend itself better. The words from Kim, while sharp, did not appear to represent any notable departure from Pyongyang's usual rhetoric. He spoke on the final day of the U.N. General Assembly's high-level meeting of world leaders — a day when some of the world's most diplomatically isolated nations took the rostrum alongside a diverse roster of leaders from nations like Canada and the United Arab Emirates. Kim said the United States, trying to dominate world affairs, was not acting fairly to the community of nations and was misusing the ostensibly multilateral United Nations for its own ends. 'They are stirring up military confrontations still further,' Kim said, accusing Washington of hypocrisy — another common charge from North Korea. 'Who has developed and used nuclear weapons for the first time in human history? ... Who is talking unceasingly about the end of a regime of a sovereign state?' He added: 'The United Nations is misused for the political aims of an individual country. Such realities should no longer be tolerated and allowed.' As he spoke, a lone U.S. diplomat intently scrawled notes on paper. There was no immediate response from the U.S. North Korea is responding to U.S.-South Korea drills U.S. and South Korean troops held a large-scale exercise last month aimed at strengthening their combined defense capabilities against nuclear-armed North Korea, which again accused the allies of practicing an invasion. The annual summertime exercise came amid heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula as the pace of both North Korea’s weapons demonstrations and the U.S.-South Korea combined military exercises have intensified. At the time, the North released a statement calling the exercises 'provocative war drills' and said they justified Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions. In a rebuttal later in the assembly hall, a South Korean diplomat called the North's claims groundless and said its pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles was the root of the tensions. 'It is our duty, like any member state, to protect the lives and safety of our people from the DPRK's military threat by maintaining a robust South Korea-U.S. combined defense and deterrence posture,' said deputy U.N. Ambassador Sangijn Kim, using an abbreviation for the North’s formal name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Kim's speech resembled his previous one at the same lectern last year, when he said the United States was trying to provoke a nuclear war. He also said that Pyongyang was bolstering its defenses to match the 'hegemony' it says threatens it. 'We continue to increase our war deterrence capabilities,' Kim said. The 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice instead of a peace treaty, leaving the Korean Peninsula divided and — technically — still in a state of war. Some players weren't there to speak Notably absent from the 190 speakers who addressed the assembly over six days: representatives from Myanmar and Afghanistan, both of which are in U.N. limbo after new regimes took over in recent years. Afghanistan wasn't totally absent from the debate Monday. Irish Foreign Minister Seán Fleming demanded a 'non-negotiable' commitment to gender equality there. And Canada's foreign minister criticized the ruling Taliban for their restrictive policies toward women and the impact such laws have on Afghan society. 'The Taliban,' Melanie Joly said, 'cannot make international law disappear through simple decrees.' On a morning peppered with denunciations of 'hegemony,' Burkina Faso’s top diplomat said the U.N.’s treasured concept of multilateralism – broad-scale decision-making that gives all countries a voice on the issues facing the planet – is 'exhausted,' its reputation 'neutered, time and time again, by predatory actions by certain member states who have decided that they are the masters of the world.' 'The harmony and cohesion of our world is at stake,' Foreign Minister Karamoko Jean Marie Traore said. 'We’d like to appeal to the powers of our world to prioritize an inclusive global governance which is rid of hegemonizing visions. And if we can do that, the U.N.’s glory will again be restored.' Less powerful nations criticize U.N., West Syrian Foreign Minister Bassam Sabbagh, who represents another relatively isolated nation, also said the U.N.'s brand of multilateralism has stopped working — if, he said, it ever had. He cited what he called 'terrorist' crimes of Israel since Hamas attacked Israelis on Oct. 7, 2023, and Israel responded swiftly and fiercely in Gaza. Israel says it is only defending itself. 'Chaos is spreading,' Sabbagh said. 'All that has happened has revealed the true intentions of the collective West. The United States has prevented the (Security) Council from fulfilling its responsibility to confront threats to international peace and security.' Said the United Arab Emirates' foreign minister, Shekh Shakhboot Nahyan al-Nahyan, on the same topic: 'Even wars have rules.' Meanwhile, the foreign minister of Nicaragua, Valdrack Ludwing Jaentschke Whitaker, said small nations like his would never back down — even in the face of major powers. To 'our invaders, those interventionists that are dressed in sheepskin, that have the faces of wolves,' he said, 'we are peoples rich in culture, resources and community models. We are rich in values that have been disowned, distorted, slandered or worn down. We will not allow ourselves to be converted into needy beggars.' ___ See more of AP’s coverage of the U.N.

Epic Games sues Google and Samsung over phone settings, accusing them of violating antitrust laws	LOS ANGELES (AP) — Video game maker Epic Games sued Google and Samsung on Monday, accusing the tech companies of coordinating to block third-party competition in application distribution on Samsung devices. At issue is Samsung's 'Auto Blocker' feature, which only allows for apps from authorized sources, such as the Samsung Galaxy Store or Google Play Store, to be installed. The feature is turned on by default but can be changed in a phone's settings. The tool prevents the installation of applications from unauthorized sources and blocks 'malicious activity,' according to Samsung. In a lawsuit filed in San Francisco federal court — Epic's second against Google — the company said Auto Blocker 'is virtually guaranteed to entrench Google’s dominance over Android app distribution.' Epic, developer of the popular game 'Fortnite,' filed the lawsuit to prevent Google from 'negating the long overdue promise of competition in the Android App Distribution Market,' according to the complaint. 'Allowing this coordinated illegal anti-competitive dealing to proceed hurts developers and consumers and undermines both the jury’s verdict and regulatory and legislative progress around the world,' Epic Games said in a post on its website. Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Samsung said it 'actively fosters market competition, enhances consumer choice, and conducts its operations fairly.' 'The features integrated into our devices are designed in accordance with Samsung’s core principles of security, privacy, and user control, and we remain fully committed to safeguarding users’ personal data. Users have the choice to disable Auto Blocker at any time,' Samsung said, adding that it plans to 'vigorously contest Epic Game’s baseless claims.' Epic launched its Epic Games Store on iPhones in the European Union and on Android devices worldwide in August. The company claims that it now takes 'an exceptionally onerous 21-step process' to download a third-party app outside of the Google Play Store or the Samsung Galaxy Store. A support page on Epic's website shows a four-step process to remove the Auto Blocker setting. Epic said those steps, combined with Google’s and Samsung’s 'install flow,' are part of the 21 steps to download the Epic Games Store. Epic won its first antitrust lawsuit against Google in December after a jury found that Google’s Android app store had been protected by anti-competitive barriers that damaged smartphone consumers and software developers. The game maker says the 'Auto Blocker' feature was intentionally crafted in coordination with Google to preemptively undermine the jury’s verdict in that case. 'Literally no store can compete with the incumbents when disadvantaged in this way,' Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney said on X. 'To have true competition, all reputable stores and apps must be free to compete on a level playing field.'	https://apnews.com/article/epic-games-google-samsung-d5acc9f1412251335a9e9cf08ce3e98c	2024-09-30T09:09:23-07:00	
Hunger in Haiti reaches famine levels as gangs squeeze life out of the capital and beyond	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — Nearly 6,000 people in Haiti are starving, with nearly half the country's population of more than 11 million people experiencing crisis levels of hunger or worse as gang violence smothers life in the capital of Port-au-Prince and beyond, according to a new report released Monday. The number of Haitians facing crisis, emergency and famine levels of hunger increased by 1.2 million in the past year as gang violence disrupts the transportation of goods and prevents people from venturing out of their homes to buy food, according to the report by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification. In addition, 2 million Haitians are facing severe hunger, according to the report. 'This is shocking,' said Martine Villeneuve, Haiti director for the nonprofit Action Against Hunger. 'We were not expecting that level. Two million…is massive.' Villeneuve told The Associated Press that she also was surprised that some of the 2 million people hit by hunger don't even live in places directly affected by gang violence. While much of the hunger is directly tied to gang violence, double-digit inflation also has limited what many Haitians can afford to buy, with food now representing 70% of total household expenditures. The cost of a food basket increased more than 11% in the past year, with inflation hitting 30% in July. In addition, parts of Haiti are still struggling to recover from the August 2021 earthquake, various drought episodes, and Hurricane Matthew, which struck Haiti as a Category 4 storm in 2016. Gang violence, however, accounts for most of the hunger, with gangs controlling 80% of Port-au-Prince and the roads that lead to and from northern and southern Haiti. From April to June, at least 1,379 people were reported killed or injured, and another 428 kidnapped. In addition, gang violence has left more than 700,000 people homeless in recent years. 'Haiti continues to face a worsening humanitarian crisis, with alarming rates of armed gang violence disrupting daily life, forcing more people to flee their homes and levels of acute food insecurity to rise,' the report stated. Those experiencing famine live in makeshift shelters in the metropolitan area of Port-au-Prince, with 70% of people in shelters overall experiencing crisis levels of hunger or worse, the report found. Among them is Joceline St-Louis, a 28-year-old mother of two boys, 5 and 1. 'Food doesn’t come around very often,' she said, adding that she depends on others to feed her children. 'When an organization does provide food, there’s a major fight,' she said. St-Louis said she has to take her 1-year-old to a clinic so he can receive a peanut butter mix 'so that his body doesn’t collapse in my arms.' 'I’m sometimes so depressed that I sometimes want to kill the kids and myself,' she said in a soft voice as she cradled the 1-year-old in her arms while the 5-year-old played with his friends. In another shelter nearby, Judeline Auguste, 39, said she depends solely on remittances to feed herself and her 8-year-old boy, but the money barely lasts a week. 'It’s very rare that I can get a meal a day,' she said. 'My situation is hard not because of me, but because of my son. He looks at other people eating all the time, and he starts crying, ‘Mommy, I’m hungry.’' Meanwhile, those facing urgent levels of hunger live in Haiti’s northern, central and southern regions, as well as in the capital. Jean Yonel, who fled his home with his family after gangs raided their neighborhood, said there are days that he, his wife and their seven children eat only white rice or spaghetti. 'I can’t provide every day for these children,' Yonel said. 'Sometimes we take just a spoonful of food and leave the rest of the food for the kids so they don’t die.' Yonel used to work as a mason, but with construction jobs drying up, he is now forced to search for wood to make charcoal. His wife sells second-hand clothes. On days when they can’t afford a proper meal for their children, she mixes flour with spinach to keep their stomachs from rumbling.	https://apnews.com/article/haiti-hunger-starving-report-af625f8d80698788624dfbcc30c656a4	2024-09-30T08:35:52-07:00

Belarusian authorities pressure pardoned political prisoners, rights groups say	TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — Belarusian human rights activists Monday accused the government of pressuring political prisoners who have been pardoned by authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko and forcing them to cooperate with authorities. During the past three months, Lukashenko has pardoned 115 activists who were convicted for taking part in the protest against his rule. Those pardoned were a small fraction of more than 1,300 political prisoners in Belarus, according to the Viasna human rights center. They include the group’s founder and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Ales Bialiatski and Polish newspaper journalist Andrzej Poczobut, whose release Poland is seeking. At least six political prisoners have died behind bars, Viasna said. Viasna and other rights groups said Monday that those amnestied were barred from leaving the country and forced to take part in propaganda videos. Andrei Stryzhak of the BYSOL rights group said that some of the amnestied had their phones infested with software intended to spy on the opposition. 'We categorically condemn the authorities' pressure on the former political prisoners,' he said. Viasna representative Pavel Sapelka said the Belarusian law enforcement agencies have threatened those amnestied with repeat conviction or reprisals against their relatives to force them to cooperate with the authorities. In 2020, Belarus was rocked by its largest-ever protests following an election that gave Lukashenko a sixth term in office but was condemned by the opposition and the West as fraudulent. According to Viasna, 65,000 people have been arrested since the protests began and hundreds of thousands have fled Belarus.	https://apnews.com/article/belarus-lukashenko-political-prisoners-pardons-crackdown-cfe0623a07b64512c901b03edc72e040	2024-09-30T08:06:41-07:00	
The US is sending a few thousand more troops to the Middle East to boost security	WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. is sending a 'few thousand' troops to the Middle East to bolster security and to defend Israel if necessary, the Pentagon said Monday. The announcement follows word that Israel has already launched limited raids across the border into Lebanon. The additional forces would raise the total number of troops in the region to as many as 43,000. The increased presence will involve multiple fighter jet and attack aircraft squadrons, Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh told reporters. U.S. officials said the total includes small numbers of other troops to augment the presence as well. It follows recent strikes in Lebanon and the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, a significant escalation in the war in the Middle East, this time between Israel and Hezbollah. The additional personnel includes squadrons of F-15E, F-16, and F-22 fighter jets and A-10 attack aircraft, and the personnel needed to support them. The jets were supposed to rotate in and replace the squadrons already there. Instead, both the existing and new squadrons will remain in place to double the airpower on hand. On Sunday, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced that he was temporarily extending the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group and its embarked air wing in the region. A U.S. official said the extension will be for about a month. A second carrier, the USS Harry S. Truman, departed Virginia last week and is enroute to Europe. It will head to the Mediterranean Sea and will again provide a two-carrier presence in the broader region. It's not expected to arrive for at least another week. At the White House, President Joe Biden said Monday that 'I’m more aware than you might know' about reports that Israel is planning a limited ground incursion into Lebanon after nearly a year of fighting with Hezbollah, and said he wants a cease-fire immediately. Asked about the reports, Biden said, 'I’m more aware than you might know, and I’m comfortable with them stopping. We should have a cease-fire now.' ___ Zeke Miller contributed from Washington.	https://apnews.com/article/us-troops-middle-east-israel-hezbollah-e37e2dbef573e33c0f8fb6a8103f27f1	2024-09-30T07:00:41-07:00	
The world’s longest-serving death row inmate acquitted in Japan mulls suing the government	TOKYO (AP) — A lawyer for the world’s longest-serving death row inmate — who was acquitted in a Japan ese retrial last week of a 1966 quadruple murder — said Tuesday that the defense team is considering filing a damage suit against the government over the fabrication of evidence that ruined the man’s life and his mental health by keeping him in prison for 48 years. Iwao Hakamada, an 88-year-old former boxer, was found not guilty last Thursday by the Shizuoka District Court which concluded that police and prosecutors collaborated in fabricating and planting evidence against him. The court said he was forced into confession by violent, hours-long closed interrogations. The acquittal made him the fifth death row inmate to be found not guilty in a retrial in postwar Japan, where prosecutors have a more than 99% conviction rate and retrials are extremely rare. Hakamada was convicted of murder in the 1966 killing of an executive and three of his family members, and setting fire to their home in central Japan. He was sentenced to death in 1968 but was not executed, due to the lengthy appeal and retrial process in Japan’s notoriously slow-paced criminal justice system. He spent more than 45 years on death row — making him the world’s longest-serving death row inmate, according to Amnesty International. Hakamada is entitled to receive compensation of up to about 200 million yen ($1.4 million) when prosecutors accept the ruling, making the acquittal final. His lawyer Hideyo Ogawa told reporters that the defense team is also considering filing a damage suit against the government because investigators and the police collaborated in fabricating evidence, despite knowing fully well that it could send the man to the gallows and that would be 'totally unforgivable.' Ogawa also demanded that a recording of the investigation process should be made mandatory in the future. Hakamada’s 91-year-old sister Hideko Hakamada said she has been trying to explain the victory to her brother but he seems still not convinced that he is now a free man. The sister, who devoted nearly half of her life to winning her brother’s innocence, said when she told him about his acquittal, as soon as she returned home, he was silent. The next morning, she showed him newspaper stories about him. 'I told him, ‘You see, it’s true, what you kept telling us really came true,’ but he seemed still skeptical,' she said, citing his mental issue and deep suspicion due to his years-long solitary confinement for the crime he was wrongfully accused. 'I will keep reminding him of his acquittal every day' until he can finally believe it. On Sunday, Hakamada, accompanied by his sister, joined his cheering supporters in a meeting in Shizuoka near his hometown of Hamamatsu, in his rare public appearance, and even made a short comment. 'Finally, I have won full and complete victory. Thank you,' Hakamada said. His sister said it was a big surprise as she thought if he could say thank you that was good enough. She says she thinks he is still not fully convinced. It took 27 years for the top court to deny his first appeal for retrial. His second appeal for a retrial was filed in 2008 by his sister, and that request was granted in 2014, when a court ruled there was evidence suggesting he was wrongfully accused. The court did not clear his conviction but released him from his solitary death-row cell, allowing him to await retrial at home because his poor health and age made him a low risk for escape. The case has since bounced along several courts until Thursday. Since his release, he seemed to be in his own imaginary world, and 'I never expected him to say such a thing,' Hideko Hakamada said, referring to his remark Sunday. 'I imagine he must have rehearsed the phrase while in prison for 48 years so he can say it when he wins acquittal one day.' The case is not fully closed for them yet because prosecutors can still technically appeal the decision, while his lawyers and human rights activists are condemning such a move and have started a petition drive. It also sparked calls from law associations and rights groups to demand a legal revision to lower hurdles for retrials. Japan and the United States are the only two countries in the Group of Seven advanced nations that retain capital punishment. In Japan, executions are carried out in secrecy and prisoners are not informed of their fate until the morning they are hanged.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-boxer-death-sentence-acquittal-87094a030d36d5800b5bd960cc0d973c	2024-09-30T06:21:59-07:00	
The Latest: Harris, Trump shift plans after Hurricane Helene's destruction	Hurricane Helene is shifting the presidential candidates’ plans this week. Democratic nominee Kamala Harris is cutting short a campaign visit to Las Vegas to return to Washington for briefings. Republican candidate Donald Trump is heading to Georgia to see the storm’s impact. Hurricane Helene’s death toll is more than 100 people and rising, with some of the worst damage caused by inland flooding in North Carolina. In addition to being humanitarian crises, natural disasters can create political tests for elected officials, particularly in the closing weeks of a presidential campaign. Presidents typically avoid racing toward disaster zones so they don’t interfere with recovery efforts. The White House said Harris would visit impacted areas 'as soon as it is possible without disrupting emergency response operations.' President Joe Biden spoke about his administration’s response to Hurricane Helene and plans to visit areas affected by the storm later this week. — Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: Trump slams US response to Helene. His own disaster-response record is marked by politics Former President Trump criticized the Biden administration’s response to the widespread devastation caused by Hurricane Helene, even as his supporters have called for cuts to federal agencies that warn of weather disasters and deliver relief to hard-hit communities. As president, Trump delayed disaster aid for hurricane-devastated Puerto Rico and diverted money from the Federal Emergency Management Agency in order to finance an effort to return undocumented migrants to Mexico. And Project 2025, backed by Trump supporters, would restructure FEMA to limit aid to states and says that the National Weather Service, which provides crucial data on hurricanes and other storms, 'should be broken up and downsized.' Read more here. Biden responds to Trump's false statements regarding the federal hurricane response President Biden criticized Trump for 'lying' about federal contacts with Georgia officials during the response to Hurricane Helene. Trump falsely claimed during a Monday tour of the damage that Biden hadn’t been in touch with the state’s Republican governor. 'He’s lying, and the governor told him he was lying.' 'I don’t know why he does this,' Biden continued. 'I don’t care about what he says about me, but I care what he what he communicates to people that are in need. He implies that we’re not doing everything possible. We are. We are.' North Carolina officials work to ensure those affected by Hurricane Helene have voting access State election officials in North Carolina are gathering information about options available to voters in the counties hardest hit by Hurricane Helene and plan a press conference for Tuesday. Karen Brinson Bell, executive director of the North Carolina State Board of Elections, said during an emergency board meeting on Monday that she will be providing more information, including details on how voters could declare 'natural disaster' as their reason for not being able to provide a photo ID. The board met Monday to approve a resolution granting counties flexibility for holding weekly meetings required under state law to review absentee ballots. These meetings are required to begin every Tuesday between now and Election Day, officials said. The resolution passed unanimously. White House pushes back against assertion by Trump that Biden has been unresponsive in aftermath of Hurricane Helene The White House on Monday pushed back against an assertion by Donald Trump that President Joe Biden has been unresponsive to Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene. Trump earlier on Monday praised Kemp for doing a 'very good job' but said he was 'having a hard time getting the president on the phone.' Trump added both Biden and the federal government are 'not being responsive' White House Karine Jean-Pierre during her daily press briefing noted that Kemp himself told reporters that he spoke to Biden on Sunday and that the president asked him what Georgia needed. The president’s homeland security adviser, Liz Sherwood-Randall, said that Biden made clear that he offered Kemp 'anything' Georgia needed for its response to the storm and remains available to the governor. 'So, if the governor would like to speak to the president again, of course, the president will take his call,' Sherwood-Randall said. Trump makes false claims about federal response while campaigning in area ravaged by Hurricane Helene Donald Trump repeatedly spread falsehoods Monday about the federal response to Hurricane Helene despite claiming not to be politicizing the disaster as he toured hard-hit areas in south Georgia. Trump criticized Vice President Kamala Harris for 'campaigning and looking for money.' He also levied attacks against the federal government for being 'non-responsive' to the disaster, claiming Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp has been struggling to get President Joe Biden on the phone. This is despite the White House announcing that Biden spoke by phone on Sunday night with Kemp. And North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper. Kemp, meanwhile, expressed appreciation on Monday for federal response to the storm. Valdosta representative says hurricane relief is non-political ATLANTA — Dexter Sharper, a Democratic state representative whose district includes most of Valdosta, didn’t journey downtown to see Trump Monday. He said he was sitting in his truck outside his powerless home, charging his cell phone while trying to coordinate ways to get hot meals to people who also lack electricity. 'To me, it’s a non-factor whether Donald Trump is here or if any of those people are here,' Sharper told the Associated Press by phone. He praised both Republican Gov. Brian Kemp and U.S. Rep. Austin Scott and Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff for visiting Valdosta, saying they helped bring needed aid. 'I’m helping ensure that there’s going to be a bipartisan effort to help Georgia get all the funds we need so we can get back to normal,' Sharper said. 'it’s nonpolitical with us.' Georgia officials say they welcome the federal response and will work in a bipartisan way on disaster relief ATLANTA — Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and U.S. Rep. Rick Allen, both Republicans, did not attack the federal response Monday morning at a news conference in hard-hit Augusta. 'Just know that we will work in a bipartisan way on disaster relief in this state with our federal, state and local partners,' said Kemp, who has often been the subject of attacks by Trump before the former president and Kemp recently patched things up. The two-term governor said he spoke directly to Biden on Sunday evening and has 'been playing phone tag' with Harris. 'The president just called me yesterday afternoon and I missed him and called him right back and he just said ‘Hey, what do you need?’ And I told him, you know, we’ve got what we need, we’ll work through the federal process,' Kemp said. 'He offered if there are other things we need just to call him directly, which I appreciate that. But we’ve had FEMA embedded with us since a day or two before the storm hit in our state operations center in Atlanta. We’ve got a great relationship with them.' Kemp said the state has submitted a request for an expedited emergency declaration to get federal aid for governments and individuals. Normally, the federal government doesn’t start issuing aid until state and local governments have completed damage assessments. Kemp said FEMA acknowledged the request. Allen, a five-term congressman who said a tree is 'resting' on the roof of his home after the storm, also said storm relief would be bipartisan 'This is not a Democrat or Republican issue,' said Allen, who represents the Augusta area. 'This is an American issue. This is a Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina issue.' Trump says he is going to Georgia with lots of relief material Trump says is he heading to Valdosta, Georgia, and bringing along 'lots of relief material, including fuel, equipment, water, and other things' to help those struggling in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene. Trump says in a post on his social media site that he will be joined by 'Many politicians and Law Enforcement,' including evangelist Franklin Graham, whose organization, Samaritan’s Purse, has been helping with disaster relief, and Valdosta’s mayor. He adds that he was going to stop into North Carolina, and has 'lot of supplies ready for them,' but that he is postponing that part of his trip because 'access and communication is now restricted' and so that local emergency management 'is able to focus on helping the people most affected, and not being concerned with me.' In typical Trump fashion, though, he also tried to exacerbate political fault lines, claiming, without evidence, that the federal government and the state’s Democratic governor were 'going out of their way to not help people in Republican areas.' There is no evidence that is the case. Asheville, one of the hardest-hit parts of the state, is solidly Democratic, as is the rest of Buncombe County. Trump campaign is lowering expectations ahead of Tuesday's vice presidential debate Ahead of Tuesday night’s vice presidential debate, the Trump campaign is lowering expectations that the former president’s running mate Ohio Sen. JD Vance to have a decisive performance, telling reporters in a teleconference on Monday that Walz is a seasoned politician who is nimble on the debate stage. 'Tim Walz is very good in debates, really good. He’s been a politician for nearly 20 years. He’ll be very well prepared for tomorrow night,' said Jason Miller, a senior adviser to Trump. He predicted the Democratic governor of Minnesota will be much more 'buttoned up' than he is on the campaign trail and ready to defend his record, but said, 'that’s not to say that JD Vance won’t be prepared tomorrow, or that somehow he isn’t up to the challenge.' Miller was joined on the call by Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., who has been helping Vance prepare for the debate by playing Walz in debate prep sessions. Emmer said he has spent the last month reviewing all of Walz’s past debate performances, studying his mannerisms and policies, and declared that 'JD Vance is prepared to wipe the floor with Tim Walz and expose him to the radical liberal he is.' Harris recalls morning after President Biden told her he was leaving the presidential race Harris says that when President Biden called and told her he was leaving the presidential race in July, it left her with some trouble sleeping. 'Everything was in speedy, speedy motion' and 'I was not sleeping so well,' she said on an episode of the 'All the Smoke' podcast. She laughed and added, 'I like to sleep.' She recalled that, the morning after that phone call, Harris said she wasn’t able to sleep. So she got up and started marinating a pot roast for her family. 'Everybody was asleep. I just got up and started cooking,' she recalled. Harris tells podcast she has been clear about her racial identity and background Vice President Kamala Harris says she’s been clear about her racial identity and background and doesn’t listen to questions about it raised by critics, including her presidential race opponent, Republican Donald Trump. Asked about criticism about her identity on an episode of the 'All the Smoke' podcast that was released Monday, Harris responded, 'I don’t listen to it.' 'I’m really clear about who I am,' she said. 'And if anybody else is not they have to go through their own level of therapy.' Harris said she’s happy to discuss her identity more fully, but that really doing so would require an hours-long discussion about the role of race in America. 'My mother was very clear. She was raising two Black girls to be two proud Black women,' Harris said. 'And it was never a question.' Harris tells podcast ‘All the Smoke’ about the blind date where she met her husband Vice President Kamala Harris says of the infamous blind date where she met her husband, Doug Emhoff, 'I just have a really bossy best friend.' Set up by especially persuasive friends, Harris told an episode of the 'All the Smoke' podcast that was released Monday that Emhoff picked her up for the date in a BMW. He immediately divulged, 'I’m a really bad driver,' she recalled. 'I guess he was trying to create a little expectation,' Harris said. She said the pair then went to Emhoff’s favorite restaurant where people who worked there 'were like, ‘Hey Doug.’' She didn’t name the restaurant. Harris and Trump address Hurricane Helene on the campaign trail At the beginning of a rally in Las Vegas on Sunday, Harris said 'we will stand with these communities for as long as it takes to make sure that they are able to recover and rebuild.' Trump, speaking in Erie, Pa., on Sunday, described the storm as 'a big monster hurricane' that had 'hit a lot harder than anyone even thought possible.' He criticized Harris for attending weekend fundraising events in California while the storm hit. 'She ought to be down in the area where she should be,' Trump said. The White House said Harris would visit impacted areas 'as soon as it is possible without disrupting emergency response operations.' She also spoke with Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina, and she received a briefing from Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Deanne Criswell while she was traveling.	https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-donald-trump-hurricane-helene-election-b2d906b9828f720b2a9bf0a1f92068ef	2024-09-30T05:50:28-07:00	
Top Hamas commander killed in Lebanon was UNRWA employee placed on administrative leave	GENEVA (AP) — The UN agency for Palestinian refugees said a top Hamas commander killed in Lebanon Monday was one of its employees but had been suspended since allegations of his ties to the militant group emerged in March. Fatah Sharif's connection to Hamas appeared set to ratchet up pressure on UNRWA, already facing a $80 million funding shortfall this year. Critics have repeatedly blasted the agency, saying it wasn’t doing enough to root out Hamas militants from its ranks. The U.N.’s internal watchdog has been investigating UNRWA since Israel in January accused 12 of its staffers of being involved in the Oct. 7 attack on Israel, in which armed militants killed 1,200 people and abducted some 250 others. The allegations led more than a dozen donor countries to suspend their funding, causing an initial cash crunch of about $450 million dollars. Since then, all donor countries except for the United States have decided to resume funding the agency. Hamas said Sharif was killed with his wife, son and daughter in an airstrike on Al-Buss refugee camp, one of 12 dedicated to Palestinian refugees in the country, in the southern port city of Tyre. The Israeli military confirmed it had targeted him. Sharif was not open about his affiliation with the group and its armed wing. Israel has previously alleged the UNRWA has been infiltrated by the Palestinian militant group. Israel’s diplomatic mission in Geneva posted on X saying that Hamas announced Sharif's death, 'And guess what was the second job of Mr Sharif? He was a principal, head of @UNRWA teachers association in Lebanon.' The mission added: 'This case proves that there is a deep problem in @UNRWA, the way they do due diligence about who they are hiring.' UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini said he learned in March of allegations that Sharif had been a 'member of the political party of Hamas' and decided to suspend him and launch an investigation 'from day one.' Lazzarini said he hadn't heard Sharif might be a Hamas 'commander' until Monday. 'So he was suspended, had no function, was not paid and was under investigation,' Lazzarini told reporters in Geneva. 'We are still an agency with due process — I mean, respecting due process and the principle of rule of law. So the investigation was ongoing.' Lazzarini said he had received a letter from Israeli authorities listing the names of some 100 people allegedly linked to Hamas, and he took it 'very seriously.' But he said Israeli authorities never responded to UNRWA requests for more information so that it might launch investigations into those cases. 'A list is not proof of anything,' he said. A Hamas statement praised Sharif for his 'educational and jihadist work' and called him 'a successful teacher and an outstanding principal' for generations of Palestinian refugees. The UNRWA teachers’ union and other Palestinian groups had periodically staged protests in front of the U.N. agency's office in Beirut since Sharif’s suspension, alleging it targeted him for his political stances. Earlier this month, the union staged a sit-in during a visit to Lebanon by Lazzarini, saying it awaited 'positive and fair outcomes' in the case of his suspension. Israel has been sharply critical of UNRWA and Lazzarini's leadership of it. In July, David Mencer, a spokesman in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government, called the longtime Swiss diplomat 'one of the bad guys, a terrorist sympathizer, a Jew-killing enabler, a liar.' U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric responded by saying the comments were 'reprehensible' and threatening. UNRWA has 32,000 staff in Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and the Palestinian territories, including 13,000 in Gaza who provide education, health care, food and other services to several million Palestinians and their families. Its facilities in Gaza, where thousands of Palestinians have sought shelter, have been repeatedly attacked. Lazzarini said 223 UNRWA staffers have been killed in Gaza during the war, a toll that the United Nations says is the highest ever in a single conflict for employees of the world body. The Israeli offensive in Gaza has killed 41,615, according to the Gaza Health Ministry which doesn’t distinguish between civilians and combatants. ___ Associated Press Writer Abby Sewell in Beirut contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-hamas-commander-killed-unwra-employee-israel-999ec22c1fef953f4f1b8b40a4c95b35	2024-09-30T05:23:28-07:00	
Analysis: Iran reluctant so far to retaliate against Israel after airstrike kills Hezbollah leader	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran lost its most reliable ally in the Middle East when an Israeli airstrike killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. But Iran isn’t leading the charge to retaliate. That's put Tehran in a bind: Not responding could see it alienate the militias it relies on in the region. Meanwhile, any possible retaliation risks a wider war as its theocracy faces intense challenges at home. 'By the grace and power of God, Lebanon will make the transgressing, malicious enemy regret its actions,' Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in the wake of Nasrallah's death Friday. But the 85-year-old paramount ruler in Iran gave no mention of his country taking action over the death of a man he once praised as 'an exceptional face in the world of Islam' after the Israel-Hezbollah war in 2006. That reluctance continued into Monday, as Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani told journalists that 'the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Iranian people are not after war' but rather 'peace and stability in the region.' Though Kananni added that, 'any adventurous move or action against our national security or interests and our hands will never be tied,' at one point wearing a checkered Palestinian keffiyeh scarf during his remarks. These comments highlight a reticence in responding to Nasrallah’s death. Though his leadership of Hezbollah was the crown jewel in Iran’s decades-long strategy of arming regional militias to counter both Israel and the United States, Iran remains cautious about when — or if — it will strike back. That's not to say that it hasn't launched retaliatory strikes during the yearlong Israel-Hamas war that's riven the Middle East and threatens to erupt into a regional conflict. Iran launched an unprecedented direct attack on Israel in April. It even launched a missile strike against sites in Iraq, Syria and Pakistan in January. But those attacks stemmed from direct attacks on Iranian targets, like the suspected Israeli strike on an Iranian diplomatic post in Syria. 'Iran I think in its priorities have been very much misunderstood since Oct. 8,' said Sanam Vakil, the director of the Middle East and North Africa program at the London-based international affairs think tank Chatham House. 'There was a misconception Iran would pile in.' Instead, it hung back after Hamas — another militant group it has armed — launched its Oct. 7 attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and saw another 250 taken hostage. Even as millions of Iranians purportedly volunteered online to fight on behalf of the Palestinians, Iran didn't enter the war as an Israeli offensive devastated the Gaza Strip, killing over 41,000 people. In the time since, an increasingly emboldened Israel has attacked Hezbollah, Yemen's Houthi rebels and other groups. In marking Nasrallah's killing, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cited a line in the Jewish Talmud fitting that strategy — 'If someone rises up to kill you, kill him first.' For Netanyahu, whose political career has revolved around the threat he perceives from Iran, that includes striking back at those Iranian allies Tehran refers to as the 'Axis of Resistance.' Those militias grew in prominence and power in the chaos that followed the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, the 2011 Arab Spring and the rise of Yemen's Houthi rebels. That created what Iran's opponents feared would become a 'Shiite crescent' of influence that Tehran would be able to wield, something Israel may be aiming to roll back. 'An increasingly emboldened Israel appears to be considering a more expansive plan to confront Iran across the Middle East with the ambition of creating a new regional order,' said Julien Barnes-Dacey, the director of the Middle East and North Africa program at the European Council on Foreign Relations. 'This is a dangerous illusion. Despite Iran’s current weakness, this will be seen as an existential threat by Tehran and its regional allies.' Iran could encourage more asymmetric attacks, targeting Jewish tourists, synagogues or Israeli diplomatic missions as it has done in the past. Netanyahu issued a warning Monday to Iran likely over that risk, saying: 'There is nowhere in the Middle East Israel cannot reach.' Tehran also could weaponize its nuclear program. It already enriches uranium to near-weapons-grade levels after the collapse of its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Hard-line voices within Iran's theocracy, like its daily Kahyan newspaper, already are calling for a response 'harsher' than its April attack, which caused very little damage. That, however, runs directly counter to the plans of Iran's new reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian, who campaigned on a promise to get crushing economic sanctions lifted against Iran. That's grown in importance as energy prices continue to fall and Iran likely sells its oil at a discount due to being locked out of many nations. If nuclear deal 'commitments are implemented fully and in good faith, dialogue on other issues can follow,' Pezeshkian told the United Nations General Assembly last week. Ending the sanctions requires a deal with the West on the nuclear program, something that will become nearly impossible if Iran enters an all-out war with Israel. Relieving that economic pressure remains crucial for Iran's domestic stability as well, as authorities remember the months of protests that followed the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini. 'For the time being it appears the president and the supreme leader, the latter who is abundantly cautious, want to keep the line open to dialogue and negotiations,' Vakil said. And to keep that line open, Iran needs someone else to take the lead against Israel. 'Tehran apparently is content to allow Hezbollah to respond to the Nasrallah killing on its own, and perhaps in concert with the Houthi movement in Yemen, which has recently begun firing some of their Iran-supplied missiles against Israel,' the New York-based Soufan Center security think tank said Monday. ___ EDITOR’S NOTE — Jon Gambrell, the news director for the Gulf and Iran for The Associated Press, has reported from each of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, Iran and other locations across the world since joining the AP in 2006.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-israel-mideast-tensions-hezbollah-lebanon-analysis-5020aeed3c88790d5483fdf40c9ba392	2024-09-30T05:13:09-07:00	
81-year-old South Korean falls short in a bid to become oldest Miss Universe contestant	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — An 81-year-old model fell short in her bid to become the oldest Miss Universe contestant after competing in the South Korean pageant against much younger rivals. Dressed in a beaded white gown, the silver-haired Choi Soon-hwa strutted across the stage and performed in a singing contest at the Miss Universe Korea pageant held Monday at a hotel in South Korea’s capital, Seoul. She missed out on the crown but did take home the 'best dresser' award. Han Ariel, a 22-year-old fashion school student, won the contest and will head to Mexico City for the Miss Universe pageant in November. Choi, a former hospital care worker who began her modeling career in her 70s, was announced as a Miss Universe Korea finalist earlier this month along with 31 other contestants. 'Even at this age, I had the courage to grab onto an opportunity and take on a challenge,' Choi told The Associated Press hours before Monday's pageant. 'I want people to look at me and realize that you can live healthier and find joy in life when you find things you want to do and challenge yourself to achieve that dream.' It would have been impossible for Choi to compete in the pageant a year ago as Miss Universe had limited the participation to women between 18 and 28. The age limit, which had long drawn criticism, was lifted this year ato make the competition more modern and diverse. Organizers of the Korean pageant also removed the swimsuit competition and eligibility requirements related to education, height and foreign language abilities to open the contest to more women.	https://apnews.com/article/korea-beauty-contestant-81-years-miss-universe-c7da720e54e8b006e2c48359ad7f3e44	2024-09-30T05:10:49-07:00	
NYC Mayor Eric Adams accepted harmless 'courtesies,' not bribes, his lawyer says	NEW YORK (AP) — New York City Mayor Eric Adams launched a legal attack on the federal corruption case against him Monday, with his attorney asking a judge to toss out bribery charges and then holding a combative news conference accusing prosecutors of ethical lapses. Adams, a Democrat, pleaded not guilty Friday to charges that he accepted lavish travel benefits and illegal campaign contributions from a Turkish official and other foreign nationals, and in return performed favors including pushing through the opening of a Turkish consulate building. The mayor’s attorneys said in a motion filed early Monday that the cheap flights to overseas destinations, seat upgrades, free meals and free hotel rooms he got were not bribes, as that crime has been defined by federal law. 'Congressmen get upgrades, they get corner suites, they get better tables at restaurants, they get free appetizers, they have their iced tea filled up,' his attorney, Alex Spiro, said at a subsequent news conference. 'Courtesies to politicians are not federal crimes.' While not disputing that Adams accepted flight upgrades and deeply-discounted or free travel, Spiro said his client had never promised to take action on behalf of the Turkish government in exchange for the perks, which prosecutors say were worth more than $100,000. 'There was no quid pro quo. There was no this for that,' Spiro said. The mayor has vowed to continue serving while fighting the charges, which he has suggested — without providing evidence — are politically motivated. On top of the case against Adams, federal prosecutors are believed to be leading separate ongoing investigations into several top city officials with deep ties to the mayor. The drumbeat of searches and subpoenas in recent weeks has prompted the resignation of the city’s police commissioner and schools chancellor, along with some calls for the mayor to resign. Gov. Kathy Hochul, a fellow Democrat who has the power to remove Adams from office, told reporters Monday that she had spoken to the mayor about 'what my expectations are' but also indicated she wasn't ready to give up on his administration. 'I am giving the mayor an opportunity now to demonstrate to New Yorkers — and to me — that we are righting the ship, that we have the opportunity to instill the confidence that I think is wavering right now and to power forward with an effective government,' she said. U.S. Attorney Damian Williams, whose office brought the case, has said that politics played no role. At a news conference on an unrelated topic Monday, Williams declined to comment on Spiro's remarks, saying prosecutors would speak through its court filings going forward. Prosecutors say Adams accepted at least seven free and steeply discounted flights, along with luxury hotel stays, high-end meals, entertainment and illegal foreign donations, from a Turkish official and others seeking to buy his influence. In September 2021, the official sought to cash in on the favors by asking Adams to expedite the opening of the 36-story Manhattan consulate building, which fire safety inspectors said was not safe to occupy, ahead of an important state visit by the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, according to the indictment. Adams then sent a series of text messages to the fire commissioner pushing for him to open the building — something that Spiro also did not dispute. At the time, Adams was still serving as Brooklyn borough president, a largely ceremonial position, but had already won the mayoral primary and was widely expected to become mayor. Prosecutors said Adams did not disclose most of the free or heavily discounted trips he took while borough president, as required by city conflict-of-interest laws. At the news conference, Spiro initially said Adams was not legally obligated to disclose any of the trips or upgrades, but later acknowledged — after reporters noted city rules that required some types of gifts and travel perks to be reported — that he was not an expert in the city’s conflict-of-interest law. Defense attorneys claim the additional charges against Adams — that he solicited and accepted foreign donations and manipulated the city’s matching funds program — would soon be revealed as 'equally meritless.' They said a former Adams staffer had lied to prosecutors to make it seem like the mayor had firsthand knowledge of the illegal donations. 'Eventually New Yorkers, being New Yorkers, are going to wise up to all this,' Spiro said. Adams is due back in court Wednesday for a conference.	https://apnews.com/article/nyc-mayor-eric-adams-3613e485989f57a4c1eaf8643fe57cac	2024-09-30T04:21:36-07:00	
Russia targets 11 Ukrainian regions as it steps up its drone attacks	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia fired missiles and drones at 11 regions of Ukraine, the Ukrainian air force said Monday, in a 33rd consecutive night of aerial attacks behind the front line and set a new monthly record of drone barrages. In Kyiv, multiple explosions and machine gun fire could be heard throughout the night as the Ukrainian capital’s air defenses fought off a drone attack for five hours. No casualties were reported in Kyiv or elsewhere, though a 'critical infrastructure object' caught fire in the southern Mykolaiv region, Gov. Vitalii Kim said, without elaborating. Russia has increasingly deployed Shahed drones, rather than more expensive missiles, in its aerial bombardment of Ukrainian cities since its full-scale invasion of its neighbor in February 2022. It launched more than 1,300 Shahed drones at Ukraine in September alone — the highest number of drone attacks in a single month since the war began. Ukraine, too, has developed a new generation of drones for the battlefield and for long-range strikes deep inside Russia. More than 100 Ukrainian drones were shot down over Russia on Sunday, Russian officials said. Also Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin released a video marking the second anniversary of the annexation of four Ukrainian territories and again accused the West of turning Ukraine into 'a military base aimed at Russia.' Putin was speaking to mark the annexation of the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions of Ukraine after a referendum held in 2022 which was denounced by the West as a sham. Russia also illegally annexed Crimea in 2014. Since 2022, Putin said, businesses in the occupied areas are being 'actively restored' and hospitals and schools are being rebuilt. Thousands of Ukrainians fled from the four regions as a result of Russia’s invasion, but Putin said Russia’s military operation in the country was to defend residents’ 'well-being' and the 'future for our children and grandchildren.' ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-drones-missiles-attack-kyiv-b971c84a5a303f7d6849de0b303c8244	2024-09-30T02:04:41-07:00	
Hezbollah's acting leader vows to fight on after Nasrallah's death	BEIRUT (AP) — Hezbollah's acting leader vowed Monday to continue battling Israel and said the militant group was prepared for a long fight even after much of its top command was wiped out, including its leader, Hassan Nasrallah. Israeli strikes have killed Nasrallah and six of his top commanders and officials in the last 10 days, and have hit what the military says are thousands of militant targets across large parts of Lebanon. Over 1,000 people have been killed in Lebanon in the past two weeks, nearly a quarter of them women and children, according to the Health Ministry. Early Monday, an airstrike hit a residential building, wiping out one apartment, damaging others, and killing three Palestinian militants in central Beirut, as Israel appeared to send a clear message that no part of Lebanon is out of bounds. Despite the heavy blow Hezbollah has suffered in recent weeks, acting leader Naim Kassem said in a televised statement that if Israel decides to launch a ground offensive, the group's fighters are ready — noting that the commanders killed have already been replaced. 'Israel was not able to affect our (military) capabilities,' Kassem said in his first speech since Nasrallah was killed. 'There are deputy commanders and there are replacements in case a commander is wounded in any post.' He added that Hezbollah anticipated 'the battle could be long.' A founding member of Hezbollah who had been Nasrallah’s longtime deputy, Kassem will remain in his acting position until the group’s leadership elects a replacement. The man widely expected to take over the top post is Hashem Safieddine, a cousin of Nasrallah who oversees the group’s political affairs. Hezbollah has significantly increased its rocket attacks in the past week to several hundred daily, but most have been intercepted or fallen in open areas. Several people have been wounded in Israel. There have been no fatalities since two soldiers were killed near the border on Sept. 19. But Hezbollah’s capabilities remain unclear. As recently as two weeks ago, a strike like Monday's in central Beirut — outside of the main areas where Hezbollah operates and next to a busy transportation hub normally crowded with buses, taxis and vans — would have been seen as a major escalation and likely followed by a long-range Hezbollah strike into Israel. But the unspoken rules of the long-running conflict are no longer clear. It's possible that Hezbollah is holding back to save resources for a bigger battle, including a threatened Israeli ground invasion. But the militant group might also be in disarray after Israeli intelligence apparently penetrated its highest levels. In the past week, Israel has frequently targeted Beirut’s southern suburbs, where Hezbollah has a strong presence — including the massive strike on Friday that killed Nasrallah — but had not hit locations closer to the city center. The strike early Monday killed three members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a small, leftist faction that has not been meaningfully involved in months of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Israel has not claimed the strike but is widely assumed to have carried it out. Also Monday, Hamas announced that its top commander in Lebanon, Fatah Sharif, was killed with his family in an airstrike on the Al-Buss refugee camp in the southern port city of Tyre. The Israeli military confirmed that it had targeted him. Hezbollah began firing rockets, drones and missiles into northern Israel after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack from Gaza into Israel sparked the war there. Hezbollah and Hamas are allies and both supported by Iran, and Hezbollah said it would continue the attacks in solidarity with the Palestinians until there was a cease-fire in Gaza. Israel has responded to the rockets with airstrikes in Lebanon, where Hezbollah is based, and the fighting has steadily escalated over the past year. The Lebanese government says the fighting may have displaced up to a million people, although the U.N. estimate is around 200,000. Tens of thousands of Israelis have also been displaced. Israel has vowed to keep fighting until the attacks stop and its citizens can return to their homes. The United States and its allies have called for a cease-fire, hoping to avoid further escalation that could draw in Iran and set off a wider war. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has shown little interest, as his country racks up military achievements against a longtime foe. Some Israelis broke into spontaneous celebrations after Nasrallah’s death was announced. Videos circulated of crowds at bars singing a song in Hebrew mocking him. A news anchor on a pro-Netanyahu station sang and danced as the studio audience joined in with him while a commentator on Israel’s largest TV station offered co-panelists celebratory shots. Hezbollah, which boasts tens of thousands of battle-hardened fighters and long-range missiles capable of hitting anywhere inside Israel, has long been seen as the most powerful militant group in the region and a key partner to Iran in both threatening and deterring Israel. Hezbollah fought Israel to a monthlong stalemate in their 2006 war, But Hezbollah has never faced an onslaught quite like this one, which began with a sophisticated attack on its pagers and walkie-talkies in mid-September that killed dozens of people and wounded around 3,000 — including many fighters but also many civilians. White House national security spokesman John Kirby said Israel's airstrikes in Lebanon had 'wiped out' Hezbollah’s command structure but warned that the group will work quickly to rebuild it. 'We’re watching to see what they do to try to fill this leadership vacuum. It’s going to be tough,' he told CNN’s 'State of the Union' on Sunday. ___ Melzer reported from Tel Aviv, Israel.

Britain's last coal-fired electricity plant is closing. It ends 142 years of coal power in the UK	LONDON (AP) — Britain’s last coal-fired power plant is closing on Monday, ending 142 years of coal-generated electricity in the nation that sparked the Industrial Revolution. The Ratcliffe-on-Soar station in central England is finishing its final shift at midnight after more than half a century of turning coal into power. The U.K. government hailed the closure as a milestone in efforts to generate all of Britain’s energy from renewable sources by 2030. Plant manager Peter O’Grady said it was 'an emotional day.' 'When I started my career 36 years ago, none of us imaged a future without coal generation in our lifetimes,' he said. The shutdown makes Britain the first country from the Group of Seven major economies to phase out coal — though some other European nations, including Sweden and Belgium, got there sooner. Owner Uniper says many of the 170 remaining employees will stay on during a two-year decommissioning process. Energy Minister Michael Shanks said the plant’s closure 'marks the end of an era and coal workers can be rightly proud of their work powering our country for over 140 years. We owe generations a debt of gratitude as a country.' 'The era of coal might be ending, but a new age of good energy jobs for our country is just beginning,' he said. The world’s first coal-fired electricity plant, Thomas Edison’s Edison Electric Light Station, opened in London in 1882. Ratcliffe-on-Soar, which opened in 1967, is a landmark whose eight concrete cooling towers and 199-meter (650-foot) chimney are seen by millions of people a year as they drive past on the M1 highway or speed by on trains. In 1990 coal provided about 80% of Britain’s electricity. By 2012 it had fallen to 39%, and by 2023 it stood at just 1%, according to figures from the National Grid. More than half of Britain’s electricity now comes from renewable sources such as wind and solar power, and the rest from natural gas and nuclear energy. 'Ten years ago, coal was the leading source of this country’s power — generating a third of our electricity,' said Dhara Vyas, deputy chief executive of trade body Energy U.K. 'So, to get to this point just a decade later, with coal’s contribution replaced by clean and low carbon sources, is an incredible achievement,' Vyas said. 'As we aim for further ambitious targets in the energy transition, it’s worth remembering that few back then thought such a change at such a pace was possible.' Coal has fueled civil strife as well as powering the country. Tens of thousands of miners walked out in 1984 over plans by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher’s Conservative government to close more than 20 coal pits. The strike lasted a year, divided communities and saw widespread violence as police clashed with pickets. The miners’ eventual defeat helped break the power of Britain’s trade unions and hasten the end of the mining industry and the communities that relied on it. Coal remains a combustible issue. Plans to open Britain’s first new coal mine in 30 years in northwest England divided residents, with some welcoming the promise of well-paid jobs and others opposing the pollution and carbon emissions it would bring. On Sept. 13 the High Court struck down planning permission for the mine that had been granted by the previous Conservative government in 2022. Another chapter in Britain’s carbon-burning industrial heritage ends Monday with the closure of the last blast furnace at one of the world’s biggest steelworks, in Port Talbot, Wales. Almost 2,000 jobs are being lost with the shutdown at the plant, owned by India’s Tata Steel. Tata plans to replace the blast furnace, which runs on the coal derivative coke, with a cleaner electric furnace that will emit less carbon and require fewer workers. At its 1960s peak, more than 18,000 people were employed at the Port Talbot steelworks, before cheaper offerings from China and other countries hit production. Roy Rickhuss, general secretary of the Community union, said the closure 'marks the end of an era, but this is not the end for Port Talbot.' 'We will never stop fighting for our steel industry and our communities in South Wales,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/uk-last-coal-power-station-closing-9e6b792f27513e3b02904da1eaedfbf3	2024-09-29T23:12:03-07:00	
Japan's likely next leader says he will call an election for Oct. 27 once he takes office	TOKYO (AP) — Shigeru Ishiba, the head of Japan's governing party, plans to call a parliamentary election to be held on Oct. 27 after he is elected as prime minister on Tuesday. Ishiba was chosen as the Liberal Democratic Party's leader on Friday and is assured to also succeed Fumio Kishida as prime minister because the party's coalition controls parliament. Ishiba mentioned the election date as he announced his top party leadership lineup Monday ahead of forming his Cabinet. The plan is not official since he is not prime minister yet, but Ishiba said he mentioned the date early for the logistical convenience of those who have to prepare on relatively short notice. 'I believe it is important to have the new administration get the public's judgment as soon as possible,' Ishiba said. He appointed former Environment Minister Shinjiro Koizumi, who came in third in the party leadership race, to head the party's election task force. He is expected to name defense experts and his longtime confidantes Takeshi Iwaya as foreign minister and Gen Nakatani as defense chief once he takes office. Ishiba has proposed an Asian version of the NATO military alliance and more discussion among regional partners about the use of the U.S. nuclear deterrence. He also suggested a more equal Japan-U.S. security alliance, including joint management of U.S. bases in Japan and having Japanese Self Defense Force bases in the United States. The LDP has had a nearly unbroken tenure governing Japan since World War II. The party members may have seen Ishiba’s more centrist views as crucial in pushing back challenges by the liberal-leaning opposition and winning voter support as the party reels from corruption scandals that drove down Kishida's popularity. Ishiba on Friday stressed Japan needs to reinforce its security, noting recent violations of Japanese airspace by Russian and Chinese warplanes and repeated missile launches by North Korea. He pledged to continue Kishida’s economic policy aimed at pulling Japan out of deflation and achieving real salary increases, while tackling challenges such as Japan’s declining birthrate and population and resilience to natural disasters. Ishiba, first elected to parliament in 1986, has served as defense minister, agriculture minister and in other key Cabinet posts, and was LDP secretary general under former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-ishiba-election-37d55017bea0a9c93c7b98cf6ab3f2d6	2024-09-29T22:06:46-07:00	
Kishida's legacy: Scandals and compromise at home, global respect for security and diplomacy	TOKYO (AP) — Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida will step down Tuesday, handing over leadership to his successor Shigeru Ishiba, who is expected to formally take office later in the day. He says he plans to call a snap election for Oct. 27. Kishida’s popularity ratings were precarious during most of his three-year term due to damaging corruption scandals that eventually led him to bow out. At home, Kishida was seen as a leader without a vision who compromised with powerful conservative nationalists within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party to stay in power. But he has won respect outside Japan, especially from the United States, for pushing bold changes in Japanese defense and security policies and for standing tougher against Russia and China. Here is a lookback at Kishida’s leadership and his legacy: Distress at home After taking office in October 2021, Kishida made a number of major decisions, such as reversing Japan’s nuclear energy phase-out and pursuing a rapid military buildup. But he avoided controversial social issues related to gender and sexual diversity. As head of a smaller faction in the ruling party, his top priority appeared to be keeping a stable grip on power by avoiding clashes with members of the Liberal Democrats' powerful conservative group, led by the late Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Abe’s assassination in July 2022 and subsequent major corruption scandals linked to Abe’s faction members left constantly in damage control mode, as his support ratings tumbled. Kishida himself narrowly escaped an explosives attack during a speech at a fishing port in western Japan's Wakayama in April, 2023. Investigations into Abe’s assassination led to revelations of the Liberal Democrats' decades-long links to South Korea's Unification Church. That was followed by a more damaging corruption scandal involving more than 80 LDP lawmakers, again mostly in Abe's faction, involving illegal slush funds. Several lawmakers, their aides and accountants were indicted in that scandal. Kishida led internal probes and moved to reform and tighten political funding laws, but opposition lawmakers and voters viewed the measures as inadequate. Public outrage over the slush funds scandal has caused the LDP to lose a few local elections this year and lawmakers within the party called for a fresh face to shake off the scandals in order to win the next national election. Kishida ends his term as a kingmaker who could remain influential behind the scenes after he helped lift Ishiba to a come-from-behind victory in the party's vote on Friday against staunch conservative Sanae Takaichi. Stronger defense Kishida, who long served as foreign minister under Abe, has won respect for his national security and foreign policies that significantly deepened ties with the United States and other partners such as Australia, the U.K., South Korea and the Philippines, while elevating the country’s international profile. In December 2022, Kishida’s government adopted a security and defense strategy involving a rapid buildup of Japan’s military power to acquire a 'counter-strike' capability with long-range cruise missiles, a major break from Japan’s post-World War II self-defense-only principle. Kishida’s government set a five-year goal to double Japan’s military spending to nearly 2% of GDP, eventually to about 10 trillion yen ($70 billion), making it the world’s third biggest spender after the United States and China. But it's unclear how Japan will fund that spending and balance it against other urgent needs such as coping with the country's shrinking population. In December, Kishida substantially eased Japan’s weapons export rules, allowing licensing of Japanese-made PAC-3 missile interceptors to the United States and future foreign sales of fighter jets that Japan is developing with the U.K. and Italy. Kishida quickly joined other G7 countries in sanctioning Russia and supporting Ukraine. He has repeatedly said 'Ukraine today may be East Asia tomorrow,' comparing the Russian invasion of Ukraine to China’s growing assertiveness in the Asia-Pacific region. He has worked on strengthening economic and security cooperation in the region. 'Although Kishida’s successes on foreign affairs were overshadowed by domestic political scandals involving his Liberal Democratic Party, as well as lackluster economic growth, he oversaw increases in Japan’s reputation and popularity in the region and globally, as well as the institutionalization of related partnership gains,' Mirna Galic, a senior policy analyst at the U.S. Institute of Peace, wrote in a recent article. Better ties with South Korea One of Kishida's diplomatic successes was Japan’s improved ties with South Korea, especially in regional security and in ties with their mutual ally, the United Sates, due to shared concerns about China and North Korea. Kishida, under pressure from Washington and with support from South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, helped mend ties between the two Asian neighbors that have suffered over Japan’s colonial-era legacy of colonialism and atrocities. Stable relations are key to the U.S.-led united front in the Pacific. In April, Kishida made a state visit to Washington and spoke to Congress, stressing Japan's determination to stand by America as a global partner. In 2023, President Joe Biden invited him to a trilateral summit at Camp David with Yoon where they agreed to strengthen their trilateral security framework. When Kishida announced in August his plans to step down, Biden lauded Kishida’s leadership, saying he had helped take the U.S.-Japan alliance 'to new heights.' 'Guided by unflinching courage and moral clarity, Prime Minister Kishida has transformed Japan’s role in the world,' Biden said in a statement. Kishida’s 'courageous leadership will be remembered on both sides of the Pacific for decades to come,' he said. Kishida also recently helped work out a deal with Beijing to lift a Chinese ban on imports of Japanese seafood that Beijing imposed due to Japan's release of treated radioactive wastewater into the Pacific from its wrecked Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Tensions over China's military activity near Japanese water and airspace persist. He also deepened ties with Southeast Asian countries, the Pacific Island nations as well as so-called Global South developing countries. G7 Hiroshima and nuclear disarmament Kishida represents a constituency in Hiroshima and hosting a summit of the Group of Seven wealthy nations in the city in May 2023 was a highlight of his time in office aligned with his career goal of working toward a world free of nuclear weapons. However, the G7 summit statement on nuclear disarmament defended the possession of nuclear weapons as a deterrence, disappointing and angering survivors of the U.S. 1945 atomic bomb attack. Kishida says he adheres to Japan’s principles of not developing, possessing or allowing the deployment of nuclear weapons in its territory. Ishiba, a former defense minister, has advocated deepening a discussion among regional partners about the U.S. nuclear deterrence strategy. 'New Capitalism' never took off Kishida espoused a 'new capitalism' economic strategy calling for more equitable distribution of national wealth, an alternative to Abe's heavy government spending and hyper-easy monetary policy. Neither policy has managed to get flagging growth back on track. Kishida’s defense and childcare policies would require big spending and the wage hikes he supported failed to keep pace with price increases. Government moves to try to reverse Japan’s falling birth rate involved mostly childcare allowances for married couples and didn't address the problems of the growing number of young Japanese reluctant to marry and start families due to bleak job prospects, the high cost of living and a corporate culture that is unfriendly to working mothers.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-us-kishida-security-05926b50f4f5a83a631f779d906cf06d	2024-09-29T21:49:36-07:00	
Israel-Hamas war latest: Israeli strike hits apartment building in central Beirut	An Israeli airstrike hit an apartment in a multistory building in central Beirut, killing three Palestinian militants, as Hezbollah's acting leader promised the group will fight on following the death of its long-time head Hassan Nasrallah. The early Monday airstrike — the first to hit central Beirut in nearly a year of conflict — killed three members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a small, leftist faction. Videos showed ambulances and a crowd gathered near the building in a mainly Sunni district with a busy thoroughfare lined with shops. Separately, an Israeli airstrike early Monday killed six people, including two sisters and a child, in central Gaza, Palestinian officials said. In the past week, Israel has frequently targeted Beirut’s southern suburbs, where Hezbollah has a strong presence — including a major strike on Friday that killed Nasrallah — but had not hit locations near the city center. Hezbollah's acting leader Naim Kassem said in a televised statement that if Israel decides to launch a ground offensive, the group’s fighters are ready — noting that the commanders killed have already been replaced. The Lebanese Health Ministry said at least 105 people were killed around the country in airstrikes on Sunday. Two strikes near the southern city of Sidon, about 45 kilometers (28 miles) south of Beirut, killed at least 32 people, the ministry said. Separately, Israeli strikes in the northern province of Baalbek Hermel killed 21 people and wounded at least 47. Lebanese media reported dozens of strikes in the central, eastern and western Bekaa and in the south, besides strikes on Beirut. Israel says it targets militants, but the strikes have hit buildings where civilians were living and the death toll was expected to rise. ___ Here is the latest: A Lebanese army soldier injured in an airstrike BEIRUT — A Lebanese army soldier suffered moderate injuries Monday when a motorcycle was targeted by an Israeli airstrike as it crossed an army checkpoint in the southern area of Wazzani, a Lebanese security official said. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak to reporters, said that at least 11 Lebanese army soldiers have been killed and 20 injured — most of them off duty and in their homes — since the escalating conflict between Israel and Hezbollah began nearly a year ago. The Lebanese army, which has a limited arsenal and has been struggling to maintain its forces and equipment due to a protracted economic crisis, has so far stood on the sidelines in the fighting. It is not clear how the army would react if Israel launched a threatened ground invasion into Lebanon. — By Abby Sewell Israeli defense minister hints at possible ground offensive in Lebanon TEL AVIV — Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on Monday hinted at Israeli preparations for a ground offensive in Lebanon. Speaking to troops of the 188 Armored brigade and the Golani Infantry brigade on the northern border, Gallant said, 'The elimination of Nasrallah is a very important step, but it is not everything. We will use all the capabilities we have.' He added, 'If someone on the other side did not understand what the capabilities mean, it is all capabilities, and you are part of this effort.' Israeli airstrike kills 6 people, including 2 sisters and a child, in Gaza DEIR -AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Palestinian medical officials say an Israeli airstrike killed six people, including two sisters and a child, in central Gaza. The strike early Monday hit a family home in the urban Nuseirat refugee camp, according to the Awda hospital, where the casualties were taken. The dead include a man, his two daughters and a grandchild, according to the hospital records. Earlier on Monday, an Israeli strike hit a house in the central town of Deir al-Balah, killing two children and their parents. Israel says it only targets militants and blames civilian casualties on Hamas because the militant group operates in residential areas. The military rarely comments on individual strikes, which often kill women and children. Gaza’s Health Ministry says at least 41,615 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the start of the war. It does not distinguish between militants and civilians but says women and children make up a little more than half of the fatalities. The war began on Oct. 7, when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Yemen’s Houthi rebels claim shooting down another US-made MQ-9 Reaper drone DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Yemen’s Houthi rebels claim they shot down another American-made MQ-9 Reaper drone over the country, with videos purportedly showing a surface-to-air missile striking it. The U.S. military did not immediately acknowledge losing any aircraft. The claimed attack comes as the one-year anniversary of the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip approaches. The Houthis have targeted ships traveling through the Red Sea over the war as U.S.-led airstrikes pound their positions in Yemen. That’s imperiled a waterway that typically sees $1 trillion of trade pass through it, as well as crucial shipments of aid to war-torn Sudan and Yemen. The Houthis also continue to launch missiles targeting Israel, drawing retaliatory airstrikes from the Israelis this weekend on the port city of Hodeida. The Houthi-run broadcaster Al-Masirah claimed shooting down the MQ-9, hours after video footage circulated online showing the purported missile striking the aircraft over Yemen’s Saada province. A single image online also appeared to show wreckage of the drone, with pieces resembling that of an MQ-9. Hezbollah’s deputy leader vows to fight on after Nasrallah’s death BEIRUT — Hezbollah’s deputy leader vowed to continue fighting Israel and said the militant group was prepared for a long war after much of its top command was wiped out, including its leader, Hassan Nasrallah. In his first speech since Nasrallah was killed, Naim Kassem said in a televised statement Monday that if Israel decides to launch a ground offensive, Hezbollah fighters are ready to fight and defend Lebanon. As deputy secretary-general, Naim Kassem now is the acting leader of Hezbollah until a replacement for Nasrallah is chosen. Kassem added that despite the killing of Hezbollah’s top military commanders over the past months, Hezbollah is relying on new commanders. 'Israel was not able to affect our (military) capabilities,' Kassem said. 'There are deputy commanders and there are replacements in case a commander is wounded in any post.' France delivers 12 tons of medical aid to Lebanon PARIS — France has delivered 12 tons of medical aid to Lebanon, including two mobile clinics that will be able to treat 1,000 seriously injured people currently in hospitals’ emergency wards across the country, according to a statement from the French Foreign Ministry on Monday. French military aircraft also delivered critical supplies of medicine to Lebanese emergency, pediatric and general hospitals and clinics, which have been overwhelmed with thousands of injured people since Israel’s bombardment of the country began over a week ago. During his visit to Beirut on Monday, France’s Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot said that Paris is also releasing 10 million euros ($11.1 million) in emergency humanitarian aid to support the work of local humanitarian organizations, particularly the Lebanese Red Cross. 'In the face of the escalating conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, France stands by Lebanon and remains committed to protecting civilians,' the statement said. Barrot is scheduled to meet with Lebanese leaders on Monday, including with Prime Minister Najib Mikati, Army chief Joseph Aoun and Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri. Lebanon asks those who lost relatives in recent airstrikes for DNA samples to match with unidentified remains BEIRUT — Lebanese officials have asked people who lost relatives in recent Israeli airstrikes to provide DNA samples to match with unidentified remains. Lebanon’s Internal Security Forces on Monday called on residents across the country to visit police stations with an identity card to give their samples. It said more than one person from each family should provide a sample, if possible. A wave of Israeli airstrikes across large parts of Lebanon have killed more than 1,030 people — including 156 women and 87 children — in less than two weeks, according to Lebanon’s Health Ministry. Satellite images show site of Israeli airstrike that killed Hezbollah leader DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Satellite images analyzed by The Associated Press show the site of the Israeli airstrike that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. The images, taken Sunday by Planet Labs PBC, show the site just some 2 kilometers (1.25 miles) northeast of Beirut’s Rafik Hariri International Airport. The images show multi-story buildings at the site now cratered in the densely populated predominantly Shiite southern Beirut suburb known as Dahiyeh. Israel said the Friday night strike targeted a meeting at an underground Hezbollah compound located beneath the towers and at least one empty lot at the site. Israeli airstrike kills family of 4 in central Gaza DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Palestinian officials say an Israeli airstrike early Monday killed a family of four in central Gaza. The strike hit a house in the central town of Deir al-Balah, according to the al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, which received the bodies. The dead included two children and their parents, according to hospital records. An Associated Press reporter counted the bodies at the hospital morgue. Israel says it only targets militants and accuses Hamas fighters of hiding among civilians, putting them in danger. It rarely comments on individual strikes, which often kill women and children. The war began on Oct. 7, when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Hamas says one of its commanders was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Lebanon BEIRUT — The Palestinian militant group Hamas says one of its commanders has been killed in an Israeli airstrike in Lebanon. Fatah Sharif was killed early Monday in an airstrike on the Al-Buss refugee camp in the southern port city of Tyre, the group said in a statement. His wife, son and daughter were also killed in the strike, it said. Sharif was a commander in Lebanon and a member of Hamas’ command outside the Palestinian territories, Hamas said. Since the Israel-Hamas war began on Oct. 7, Israeli airstrikes have killed several Hamas officials in Lebanon.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-hamas-latest-mideast-30-september-2024-0413c24b727837f295ada1e81642edfc	2024-09-29T21:13:01-07:00	
Wildfire burning through forest in southern Greece kills 2 people	ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Two people died overnight in a large wildfire burning through forestland in Greece near a seaside resort in the country's south, authorities said Monday. The fire service said about 350 firefighters, assisted by 18 water-dropping aircraft, were battling the blaze near Xylokastro in the Peloponnese region. While the initial large front was put out, scattered flare-ups continued to burn, forcing evacuation orders for three villages on Monday. Earlier, half a dozen villages were ordered evacuated overnight as a precaution after the blaze broke out on Sunday. There was no threat to Xylokastro. The flames were fanned by very strong winds blowing through forests left tinder-dry by a warm spring and hot summer, attributed to climate change. Civil protection officials warned that several parts of the country, including Rhodes and other southeastern Aegean Sea islands, would face a high risk of wildfires Tuesday. Authorities said the two dead men were believed to be residents who were declared missing late Sunday. No one else was reported missing. There were no immediate reports of burned homes in the affected area, located some 150 kilometers (93 miles) southwest of Greece's capital, Athens. Firefighters assisted by five water-dropping aircraft were also battling a forest fire that broke out Monday farther south, near Xerokambi in the central Peloponnese. Another wildfire near Andravida, in the western Peloponnese, was also brought under control on Monday, but firefighters remained on alert. Greece, like other southern European countries, is plagued by destructive wildfires every summer that have been exacerbated by global warming. Over the past few months, authorities have had to cope with more than 4,500 wildfires in countryside left parched by a protracted drought and early summer heatwaves, in what was considered the most dangerous fire season in two decades. A big investment in extra water-bombing aircraft, warning drones and other equipment have enabled firefighters to extinguished most blazes shortly after they broke out. However, in August, a ferocious wildfire swept through the mountains north of Athens, destroying scores of homes and killing one person. Still, authorities say this summer's expanses that have been burned are about 25% less in size than the annual average of the past 20 years.	https://apnews.com/article/greece-wildfire-deaths-xylokastro-a41a28d995f3f70a5d4a159d30845315	2024-09-29T20:52:53-07:00	
France's Le Pen denies wrongdoing as she and her party go on trial accused of embezzling EU funds	PARIS (AP) — French far-right leader Marine Le Pen denied violating any rules as she and her National Rally party and two dozen others went on trial on Monday, accused of embezzling European Parliament funds, in a case that has the potential to derail her political ambitions. Arriving at the court in Paris, Le Pen said 'we have not violated any political and regulatory rules of the European Parliament' and vowed to present 'extremely serious and extremely solid arguments″ in the trial.' The nine-week trial will be closely watched by Le Pen’s political rivals as she is a strong contender in the race to succeed Emmanuel Macron when the next presidential election takes place in 2027 It comes as a new government dominated by centrists and conservatives just came into office in the wake of June-July legislative elections. Some observers expect the trial could prevent National Rally lawmakers, including Le Pen herself, from fully playing their opposition role in Parliament as they would be busy focusing on the party's defense. Since stepping down as party leader three years ago, Le Pen has sought to position herself as a mainstream candidate capable of appealing to a broader electorate. Her efforts have paid off, with the party making significant gains in recent elections at both the European and national levels. But a guilty verdict could seriously undermine her bid to take the Elysee. The National Rally and 27 of its top officials are accused of having used money destined for EU parliamentary aides to pay staff who instead did political work for the party between 2004 and 2016, in violation of the 27-nation bloc’s regulations. The National Rally was called National Front at the time. Le Pen, whose party has softened its anti-EU stance in recent years, denies wrongdoing and claims the case is politically driven. 'Parliamentary assistants do not work for the Parliament. They are political assistants to elected officials, political by definition,' she argued in her defense. 'You ask me if I can define the tasks I assigned to my assistants; it depends on each person’s skills. Some wrote speeches for me, and some handled logistics and coordination.' If found guilty, Le Pen and her co-defendants could face up to 10 years in prison and fines of up to 1 million euros ($1.1 million) each. Additional penalties, such as the loss of civil rights or ineligibility to run for office, could also be imposed, a scenario that could hamper, or even destroy, Le Pen’s goal to mount another presidential bid after Macron’s term ends. Le Pen was runner-up to Macron in the 2017 and 2022 presidential elections. She served as party president from 2011 to 2021 and now heads the group of RN lawmakers at the French National Assembly. Despite her denial, her party has already paid back 1 million to the European Parliament, the Parliament’s lawyer Patrick Maisonneuve said. Of that amount, 330,000 euros were directly linked to Marine Le Pen’s alleged misuse of funds. A longstanding controversy The legal proceedings stem from a 2015 alert raised by Martin Schulz, then-president of the European Parliament, to French authorities about possible fraudulent use of European funds by members of the National Front. Schulz also referred the case to the European Anti-Fraud Office, which launched a separate probe into the matter. The European Parliament’s suspicions were further heightened when a 2015 organizational chart showed that 16 European lawmakers and 20 parliamentary assistants held official positions within the party — roles unrelated to their supposed duties as EU parliamentary staff. A subsequent investigation found that some assistants were contractually linked to different MEPs than the ones they were actually working for, suggesting a scheme to divert European funds to pay party employees in France. Alexandre Varault, a spokesperson for the National Rally who was elected to the European Parliament in June, told The Associated Press that Le Pen will attend the first day of the trial, adding that he hopes for the acquittal of all the defendants. Misuse of public funds alleged Investigating judges concluded that Le Pen, as party leader, orchestrated the allocation of parliamentary assistance budgets and instructed MEPs to hire individuals holding party positions. These individuals were presented as EU parliamentary assistants, but in reality, were allegedly working for the National Rally in various capacities. The European Parliament’s legal team is seeking 2.7 million euros in compensation for financial and reputational damages. This figure corresponds to the 3.7 million euros allegedly defrauded through the scheme, minus the 1 million euros already paid back. During the 2014 European elections, the National Front won a record 24 MEP seats, finishing first with 24.8% of the vote, ahead of the center-right and the Socialists. This surge resulted in a substantial financial windfall for the party, which faced severe financial problems at the time. An audit of the party’s accounts between 2013 and 2016 revealed that it was running a deficit of 9.1 million euros by the end of 2016. Yet, the party still had a cash balance of 1.7 million euros and had lent 1 million euros to Le Pen’s 2017 presidential campaign, while also holding 87,000 euros in loans to Cotelec, its funding association. At the time, the party was also indebted to a Russian bank for 9.4 million euros, a loan taken out in 2014 for 6 million euros. Suspected systemic practice The investigation uncovered many irregularities involving prominent party members. Thierry Légier, the long-time bodyguard of Le Pen’s father Jean-Marie, was listed as his parliamentary assistant. But his resume did not reference this role, and he made no mention of it in his 2012 autobiography. Légier admitted during the investigation that he was not interviewed and signed his employment contract without fully understanding his official role. Jean-Marie Le Pen, who led the National Front from 1972 to 2011, will not appear in court alongside his former colleagues due to health concerns. Now 96, he was deemed unfit to testify by a court in June. He has 11 prior convictions, including for violence against a public official and hate speech. He has denied wrongdoing during his time as party leader, stating that the 'pool' of assistants was common knowledge. 'I did not choose which assistants were assigned to me. That was decided by Marine Le Pen and others. I only signed the contracts,' he said. ___ Diane Jeantet in Paris contributed.

Top Kashmir leader says India has silenced dissenting voices as region votes in final phase of polls	SRINAGAR, India (AP) — Ahead of the final phase of a local election in Indian-controlled Kashmir, a key resistance leader says the regional polls to choose a local government will not resolve the decades-old conflict that is at the heart of a dispute between New Delhi and Pakistan. Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, who has spent most of the last five years under house detention, said the polls are being held as political voices contesting India’s sovereignty over the region remain silenced after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist government stripped the region of its long-held semi-autonomy in 2019. The detained leader said in a phone interview with The Associated Press that the election, touted by the Modi government as a ' festival of democracy ' in the region, cannot be an alternative to resolving the dispute. 'These elections cannot be the means to address the larger Kashmir issue,' said Mirwaiz, who is also an influential Muslim cleric and custodian of the six-century-old grand mosque in the region’s main Srinagar city, the urban heartland of anti-India sentiment. The multistage election, the last phase of which is being held Tuesday, will allow Kashmir to have its own truncated government and a regional legislature with limited powers. It is the first such vote in a decade and the first since 2019, when New Delhi downgraded and divided the former state into two centrally governed union territories — Ladakh and Jammu-Kashmir — both ruled directly by New Delhi through unelected bureaucrats. Authorities have said the election will bring democracy to the region after more than three decades of strife, but many locals see the vote as an opportunity not only to elect their own representatives but also to register their protest against the 2019 changes they fear could dilute the region’s demographics. India’s clampdown following the 2019 move 'has silenced people' in the region who 'feel dispossessed and disempowered,' Mirwaiz said. 'You may not see active turmoil like before 2019 but there is a strong, latent public resistance to all this,' he said. 'We have been forcibly silenced, but silence is not agreement.' India’s sudden move, which largely resonated in India and among Modi supporters, was mostly opposed in Kashmir as an assault on its identity and autonomy. Fearing unrest, authorities detained Mirwaiz and thousands of other political activists, including Kashmiri pro-India leaders who objected to India’s move, amid an unprecedented security clampdown and a total communication blackout in the region. The region has since been on edge, with civil liberties curbed and media gagged. Mirwaiz heads the All Parties Hurriyat Conference, an umbrella grouping that espouses the right to self-determination for the entire region, which is divided between India and Pakistan. According to Mirwaiz, the crackdown has restricted his group’s access to people and shrunk its 'space and scope for proactive involvement' like before. 'The massive assault has considerably weakened the organizational strength of the Hurriyat, but not its resolve,' he said. India and Pakistan have fought two of their three wars over Kashmir, and both countries control parts of the Himalayan territory divided by a heavily militarized frontier. After their first war in 1947, a United Nations referendum a year later gave Kashmir the choice of joining either Pakistan or India, but it never happened. The part of Kashmir controlled by India was granted semi-autonomy and special privileges in exchange for accepting Indian rule. However, Kashmiri discontent with India soon began taking root as successive Indian governments started chipping away at that pact. Local governments were toppled and largely peaceful anti-India movements were harshly suppressed. In the mid-1980s, an election that was widely believed to have been rigged led to public backlash and an armed uprising. Since then, rebels have been fighting in the Indian-controlled part for a united Kashmir, either under Pakistani rule or independent of both. Many Muslim Kashmiris support the rebels’ goal. India insists the Kashmir militancy is Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. Pakistan denies the charge, and many Kashmiris consider it a legitimate freedom struggle. Tens of thousands of civilians, rebels and government forces have been killed in the conflict. Mirwaiz's group believes only talks between India, Pakistan and the region’s people can end the conflict. In the past, he has held several rounds of talks with both New Delhi and Islamabad leaders, including their heads of government. However, under Modi, India has shifted its Kashmir policy and stopped engaging with the region’s pro-freedom leaders, including Mirwaiz. Previous elections in the region have been marred by violence, boycotts and vote-rigging, even though India called them a victory over separatism. This time, the pro-freedom groups, largely incapacitated with most of their leaders jailed, have issued no calls for boycotts. They also did not boycott India’s recent general election. Instead, some lower-ranking activists, who in the past dismissed voting as illegitimate under military occupation, are running for office as independent candidates. 'Boycott was the democratic means to express anger, reject this projection and draw attention towards the unsolved issue (of Kashmir),' Mirwaiz said. But India’s crackdown has left people 'powerless and disempowered' and in such a scenario a 'poll boycott cannot work anymore.' Mirwaiz has distanced himself from the election, but said it had been engineered in favor of Modi’s Hindu nationalist politics before it started on Sept. 18. He cited the government’s July amendment to legislation that gives sweeping executive powers to the federally appointed administrator even after a new local government comes to power in the region. He also referred to the redrawing of assembly districts in 2022 as 'electoral gerrymandering,' an act that gave more electoral representation to the Hindu-dominated Jammu areas over the region’s overwhelmingly Muslim-majority Kashmir Valley. Mirwaiz, however, hoped Kashmiri groups, including pro-India parties, would jointly seek a resolution of the conflict. He expressed his willingness to engage in talks with India but warned that the election should not be seen as public acceptance of New Delhi’s changes in the region. Public participation in the election, Mirwaiz said, 'is a release of their pent-up emotions and a means to oppose these disempowering and dispossessing measures, besides hoping to get some relief and redressal for their bread and butter issues.'	https://apnews.com/article/kashmir-election-india-pakistan-ae53746027853ec36bdb0b39ab580264	2024-09-29T19:57:24-07:00	
China factory surveys show economy weakening, as Beijing steps up support	China's economy weakened further in recent weeks, according to surveys released Monday, signaling the need for more support as the government ratchets up stimulus. The Caixin purchasing managers survey showed new manufacturing orders fell at the fastest pace in two years in September. 'Operating conditions in China’s manufacturing sector deteriorated in September after improving during August,' the report said. 'Furthermore, firms lowered their hiring and purchasing activity.' An official survey released by the National Bureau of Statistics showed a less drastic decline but it marked a fifth straight month of contraction. The purchasing managers index was at 49.8 in September, up from a six-month low of 49.1 in August. The index is on a scale where figures above 50 indicate expansion. The survey showed that factory output rose while new orders fell. Chinese stock markets surged Monday, reflecting enthusiasm over a barrage of policy measures announced last week, including lower interest rates and smaller down payment requirements for mortgages and a cut in required bank reserves. 'There is no doubt that the coordinated and emphatic policy stimulus measures announced by Beijing have justifiably invoked optimism,' Tan Boon Heng of Mizuho Bank in Singapore said in a commentary. The main index smaller market in Shenzhen soared 8.2% while the Shanghai Composite index jumped 5.7% 'The stimulus package announced last week should help shore activity over the coming months,' Gabriel Ng of Capital Economics said in a report. But he noted that imbalances between excess supply of many products versus weak demand persist. And trade measures against China, such as higher tariffs on electric vehicles and other goods, also will weigh on the economy. 'In this environment, a meaningful cyclical recovery would require sizeable fiscal stimulus,' he said. 'There has yet to be any official announcement on fiscal support, though some media reports suggest that one could come soon.' Over the weekend, Beijing moved forward with the measures announced last week to support the property industry and revive languishing financial markets. The central bank announced on Sunday that it would direct banks to cut mortgage rates for existing home loans by Oct. 31. Meanwhile, the major southern city of Guangzhou lifted all home purchase restrictions over the weekend, while both Shanghai and Shenzhen revealed plans to ease key buying curbs. Property developers have struggled after the government cracked down on excessive borrowing for projects several years ago. Housing prices have continued to fall and the government has moved to ensure that developers deliver apartments that were paid for but not yet built. The downturn in the property sector has rippled throughout the world's second-largest economy, hitting many other industries that depended on booming housing construction, such as appliance makers and manufacturers of building materials. It has slowed China's recovery from the massive disruptions of the COVID-19 pandemic, adding to pressures on Chinese consumers worried over pay cuts, job losses and weaker asset prices. The economy expanded at a 4.7% pace in the last quarter, slightly below the government's target for about 5%.	https://apnews.com/article/china-economy-stocks-factory-jinping-e6db38661b131c9e32179cbe31a67136	2024-09-29T19:52:51-07:00	
Flooding toll in Nepal reaches 193 as recovery work is stepped up	KATHMANDU, Nepal (AP) — The number of people killed by flooding and landslides triggered by heavy rainfall over the weekend in Nepal has reached 193 while recovery and rescue work has been stepped up, officials said Monday. A police statement said there were 31 people who were still reported missing and 96 people were injured across the Himalayan nation. Many of the deaths were in the capital Kathmandu which got heavy rainfall and much of southern part of the city was flooded. At least three buses headed to Kathmandu and stuck in traffic jam on a highway were buried by a landslide that killed three dozen people. Weather improved on Sunday and Monday, allowing rescue and recovery work.	https://apnews.com/article/nepal-flood-landslide-deaths-94c25dd2a172cdcf51bc558c5df016aa	2024-09-29T19:31:06-07:00	
Montana man gets 6 months in prison for cloning giant sheep and breeding it	GREAT FALLS, Mont. (AP) — An 81-year-old Montana man was sentenced Monday to six months in federal prison for illegally using tissue and testicles from large sheep hunted in Central Asia and the U.S. to create hybrid sheep for captive trophy hunting in Texas and Minnesota. U.S. District Court Judge Brian Morris said he struggled to come up with a sentence for Arthur 'Jack' Schubarth of Vaughn, Montana. He said he weighed Schubarth's age and lack of a criminal record with a sentence that would deter anyone else from trying to 'change the genetic makeup of the creatures' on the earth. Morris also fined Schubarth $20,000 and ordered him to make a $4,000 payment to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Foundation. Schubarth will be allowed to self-report to a Bureau of Prisons medical facility. 'I will have to work the rest of my life to repair everything I've done,' Schubarth told the judge just before sentencing. Schubarth's attorney, Jason Holden, said cloning the giant Marco Polo sheep hunted in Kyrgyzstan in 2013 has ruined his client's 'life, reputation and family.' 'I think this has broken him,' Holden said. Holden, in seeking a probationary sentence, argued that Schubarth was a hard-working man who has always cared for animals and did something that no one else could have done in cloning the giant sheep, which he named Montana Mountain King or MMK. The animal has been confiscated by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services and is being held in an accredited facility until it can be transferred to a zoo, said Richard Bare, a special agent with the wildlife service. Sarah Brown, an attorney with the U.S. Department of Justice, had asked that Schubarth be sentenced to prison, saying his illegal breeding operation was widespread, involved other states and endangered the health of other wildlife. The crime involved forethought, was complex and involved many illegal acts, she said. Schubarth owns Sun River Enterprises LLC, a 215-acre (87-hectare) alternative livestock ranch, which buys, sells and breeds 'alternative livestock' such as mountain sheep, mountain goats and ungulates, primarily for private hunting preserves, where people shoot captive trophy game animals for a fee, prosecutors said. He had been in the game farm business since 1987, Schubarth said. Schubarth pleaded guilty in March to charges that he and five other people conspired to use tissue from a Marco Polo sheep illegally brought into the U.S. to clone that animal and then use the clone and its descendants to create a larger, hybrid species of sheep that would be more valuable for captive hunting operations. Marco Polo sheep are the largest in the world, can weigh 300 pounds (136 kilograms) and have curled horns up to 5 feet (1.5 meters) long, court records said. Schubarth sold semen from MMK along with hybrid sheep to three people in Texas, while a Minnesota resident brought 74 sheep to Schubarth’s ranch for them to be inseminated at various times during the conspiracy, court records said. Schubarth sold one direct offspring from MMK for $10,000 and other sheep with lesser MMK genetics for smaller amounts. The total value of the animals involved was greater than $250,000 but less than $550,000, prosecutors said. Hybrid sheep were also sold to people in Alabama, Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, Oregon, South Dakota and West Virginia, prosecutors said. In October 2019, court records said, Schubarth paid a hunting guide $400 for the testicles of a trophy-sized Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep that had been harvested in Montana and then extracted and sold the semen, court records said. Sheep breeds that are not allowed in Montana were brought into the state as part of the conspiracy, including 43 sheep from Texas, prosecutors said. 'You were so focused on getting around those rules you got off track,' Morris said. Holden sought reduced restitution, saying Schubarth fed and cared for the hybrid sheep on his ranch until they could be slaughtered and the meat donated to a food bank. The remaining hybrid sheep with Marco Polo DNA on his ranch must be sent to slaughter by the end of the year with the meat also being donated, Morris said. Morris gave Schubarth until December 2025 to sell his Rocky Mountain bighorn hybrid sheep. Schubarth will not be allowed to breed game stock during the three years he is on probation, Morris said. The five co-conspirators were not named in court records, but Schubarth's plea agreement requires him to cooperate fully with prosecutors and testify if called to do so. The case is still being investigated, Montana wildlife officials said. Schubarth, in a letter attached to the sentencing memo, said he becomes extremely passionate about any project he takes on, including his 'sheep project,' and is ashamed of his actions. 'I got my normal mindset clouded by my enthusiasm and looked for any grey area in the law to make the best sheep I could for this sheep industry,' he wrote. 'My family has never been broke, but we are now.'	https://apnews.com/article/giant-sheep-clone-breed-trophy-hunt-d3a2b57886980266abeac69c44b70b2a	2024-09-29T19:19:13-07:00	
As big supermarkets pursue profits, new research shows growing exploitation of shrimp farmers	BANGKOK (AP) — Indonesian shrimp farmer Yulius Cahyonugroho operated more than two dozen ponds only a few years ago, employing seven people and making more than enough to support his family. Since then, the 39-year-old says the prices he gets from purchasers have fallen by half and he's had to scale back to four workers and about one-third the ponds, some months not even breaking even. His wife has had to take a job at a watermelon farm to help support their two children. 'It is more stable than the shrimp farms,' said the farmer from Indonesia’s Central Java province. As big Western supermarkets make windfall profits, their aggressive pursuit of ever-lower wholesale prices is causing misery for people at the bottom end of the supply chain — people like Cahyonugroho who produce and process the seafood, according to an investigation by an alliance of NGOs focused on three of the world's largest producers of shrimp provided to The Associated Press ahead of its publication Monday. The analysis of the industry in Vietnam, Indonesia and India, which provide about half the shrimp in the world's top four markets, found a 20%-60% drop in earnings from pre-pandemic levels as producers struggle to meet pricing demands by cutting labor costs. In many places this has meant unpaid and underpaid work through longer hours, wage insecurity as rates fluctuate, and many workers not even making low minimum wages. The report also found hazardous working conditions, particularly in India and parts of Indonesia, and even child labor in some places in India. 'The supermarket procurement practices changed, and the working conditions were affected — directly and rapidly,' said Katrin Nakamura of Sustainability Incubator, who wrote the regional report and whose Hawaii-based nonprofit led the research on the industry in Vietnam. 'Those two things go together because they're tied together through the pricing.' Tubagus Haeru Rahayu, the director general of aquaculture for Indonesia’s Maritime Affairs and Fisheries Ministry, said he was surprised by the report’s findings and had already reached out to people in the industry to investigate the price pressures. 'If there is pressure like that, there will definitely be a reaction — not only in Indonesia but in Vietnam and India too,' he told the AP in an interview at his Jakarta office. Indian and Vietnamese officials refused to comment. Supermarkets linked to facilities where exploited labor was reported by workers include Target, Walmart and Costco in the United States, Britain's Sainsbury's and Tesco, and Aldi and Co-op in Europe. Switzerland's Co-op said it had a 'zero tolerance' policy for violations of labor law, and that its producers 'receive fair and market-driven prices.' Germany’s Aldi did not specifically address the issue of pricing, but said it uses independent certification schemes to ensure responsibly sourcing for farmed shrimp products, and would continue to monitor the allegations. 'We are committed to fulfilling our responsibility to respect human rights,' Aldi said. Sainsbury's referred to a comment from the British Retail Consortium industry group, which said its members were committed to sourcing products at a 'fair, sustainable price' and that the welfare of people and communities in supply chains is fundamental to their purchasing practices. None of the other retailers named in the report responded to multiple requests for comment on the report, titled 'Human Rights for Dinner.' In Vietnam, researchers found that workers who peel, gut and devein shrimp typically work six or seven days a week, often in rooms kept extremely cold to keep the product fresh. Some 80% of those involved in processing the shrimp are women who rise at 4 a.m. and return home at 6 p.m., with the exception of pregnant women and new mothers who can stop one hour earlier. 'The work day for peelers consists of standing in a refrigerated and disinfected room and working extremely rapidly with a knife while taking care not to make a mistake,' researchers said. Wages are generally not disclosed ahead of time and are based upon production. Sometimes workers make minimum wage, but frequently they do not. The Vietnam Association of Seafood Exporters and Producers issued a statement calling the allegations in the report 'unfounded, misleading and detrimental to the reputation of Vietnam’s shrimp exports.' It cited government labor policies in a four-page statement but did not specifically address the findings, and did not respond to queries. After food supply chain disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission reported earlier this year that some grocers have used the situation 'as an opportunity to further raise prices to increase their profits, which remain elevated today.' The demands for lower wholesale shrimp prices — combined with rising production costs and an oversupply — means farmers often must sell their products under cost just to keep operations going, the Sustainability Incubator analysis found. Cahyonugroho said he's stuck selling his shrimp at the price offered by middlemen who then sell it to factories for processing. He can't scrape together the startup costs needed to sell directly to factories or markets to earn more. 'The opportunity is there,' he said, 'but you need a lot of capital if you want to jump into something like that.' The middlemen who buy the shrimp obfuscate the true sources of shrimp that appear in Western supermarkets, so many retailers may not be following ethical commitments they've made about procuring shrimp. Only about 1,000 of the 2 million shrimp farms in the major producing countries of India, Indonesia, Vietnam, Ecuador, Thailand and Bangladesh are certified by either the Aquaculture Stewardship Council or the Best Aquaculture Practices ecolabel. 'With the yield from most certified shrimp farms being very small, it is mathematically impossible for certified farms to produce enough shrimp per month to supply all of the supermarkets that boast commitments to purchasing certified shrimp,' the report said. Ideally, supermarkets should pay higher wholesale prices and ensure that the extra money makes it all the way down the supply chain, Nakamura said. U.S. policymakers could use antitrust and other laws already in place to establish oversight to ensure fair pricing from Western retailers, rather than adding punishing tariffs on suppliers for labor violations, she said. Awareness about the trends hurting suppliers is growing. In July, the European Union adopted a new directive requiring companies to 'identify and address adverse human rights and environmental impacts of their actions inside and outside Europe.' Britain's Groceries Code Adjudicator office published a 'deep dive' into views of suppliers about the conduct of supermarkets, saying they had chosen to conduct 'warfare' with suppliers. Higher wholesale prices don't have to mean higher prices for consumers, Sustainability Incubator said. 'Prices to farmers would be at least 200% higher than today if the shrimp sold in Global North supermarkets was made at minimum wage rates and in compliance with applicable domestic laws for labor, workplace health, and safety,' the report said. 'This would not necessarily mean higher consumer prices, because supermarkets are already profiting at existing consumer prices.' Researchers from the Corporate Accountability Lab found that Indian shrimp industry workers face 'dangerous and abusive conditions' and that highly-salinated water from newly-dug hatcheries and ponds, tainted with chemicals and toxic algae, are contaminating surrounding water and soil. Unpaid labor prevails, including salaries below minimum wage, unpaid overtime, wage deductions for costs of work and 'significant' debt bondage, the report found. Child labor was also identified, with girls aged 14 and 15 being recruited for peeling work. In Indonesia, three non-profit research organizations found that shrimp workers' wages have declined since the pandemic and now average $160 per month, below Indonesia's minimum wage in most of the biggest shrimp-producing provinces. Shrimp peelers were found to be routinely required to work at least 12 hours per day to meet minimum targets. Still, given widespread poverty most workers said they're happy to have their jobs, said lead researcher Kharisma Nugroho of the Migunani Research Institute. 'It’s exploitation of the vulnerability of the workers, because they have a lack of options,' he said. 'They’re paid the minimum wages but they have to work 150% of the normal,' he told the AP. 'Can they live? Yes. Can they move? Yes. Do they make a complaint? No. They’re still there.' The regional report compiled more than 500 interviews conducted in-person with workers in their native languages, in India, Indonesia and Vietnam, supplemented with secondary data and interviews from Thailand, Bangladesh and Ecuador. After the Indonesia country report was issued recently, government officials asked to meet with the authors, and Nugroho said they showed a 'genuine willingness to improve the situation.' Vietnamese officials have also engaged with Sustainability Incubator to talk about the findings. Government and industry intervention has already helped in Thailand, which has been criticized after the AP exposed serious labor abuses in the shrimp industry in the past. That, however, has led to higher prices for Thai shrimp, leading some buyers to shift sourcing to India and Ecuador. Ecuador has an industrial approach to shrimp farming — unlike the smaller, often family-run operations in Southeast Asia — and is now the world's largest exporter of shrimp. It has the lowest prices, followed by India; China, which wasn't included in the report; then Vietnam and Indonesia. But with the demand for lower wholesale prices, while Ecuador’s exports rose 12% in volume in 2023, they fell 5% in value. India’s exports rose 1% but dropped nearly 11% in value. Meantime, with their relatively higher prices, Vietnam's exports were down 25% in 2023 in volume Indonesia's dropped 9.5%. 'Labor exploitation in shrimp aquaculture industries is not company, sector, or country-specific,' the report concluded. 'Instead, it is the result of a hidden business model that exploits people for profit.' ___ AP journalist Edna Tarigan in Jakarta, Indonesia, contributed to this report. ___ This story was supported by funding from the Walton Family Foundation.

A powerful typhoon is lashing northern Philippine islands	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — A powerful typhoon was lashing the northernmost islands of the Philippines Monday, prompting officials to evacuate villagers, shut down schools and inter-island ferries and warn of 'potentially very destructive' damage to coastal villages. Typhoon Krathon was last tracked over the coastal waters of Balintang island off the provinces of Cagayan and Batanes with sustained winds of up to 175 kph (109 mph) and gusts of up to 215 kph (133 mph), according to government forecasters. The slow-moving Krathon was blowing westward and could strengthen into a super typhoon when it veers northeastward Tuesday toward Taiwan, they said. There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage Guilmar Cabejo, a police officer on the island of Sabtang in typhoon-prone Batanes, said the streets were deserted in the town of more than 1,800 people as the ferocious wind rattled roofs, walls and trees. 'There’s nobody outside, zero, because the wind is so strong,' Cabejo told The Associated Press by cellphone. 'Nobody could stand normally outside in this wind, it will force anybody down to the ground.' Residents, locally renowned for their resilience against seasonal storms, strengthened their roofs with ropes, covered windows with wooden boards and secured their fishing boats away from the sea two days before the typhoon hit, he said. The weather agency warned of 'moderate to high risk of life-threatening storm surge' in the next 48 hours in the coastal villages of Batanes, the nearby Babuyan islands and Cagayan province and said fierce winds could rip off roofs, topple trees, damage farmlands and whip up high waves. 'The situation is potentially very destructive to the community,' it said. Hundreds of villagers were evacuated away from the coast and flood-prone communities in Cagayan province, where power outages were reported. Classes in all levels were suspended Monday in several northern provinces as a precaution, officials said. Sea voyages were also halted in northern towns and provinces being battered or threatened by the typhoon, locally called Julian, officials said. About 20 storms and typhoons batter the Philippines each year. The archipelago also lies in the 'Pacific Ring of Fire,' a region along most of the Pacific Ocean rim where many volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occur, making the Southeast Asian nation one of the world’s most disaster-prone. In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest recorded tropical cyclones in the world, left more than 7,300 people dead or missing, flattened entire villages, swept ships inland and displaced more than 5 million in the central Philippines.	https://apnews.com/article/typhoon-krathon-philippines-taiwan-de393349970fa4907ccedb9f22cecd8f	2024-09-29T16:15:28-07:00	
Kris Kristofferson, singer-songwriter and actor, dies at 88	LOS ANGELES (AP) — Kris Kristofferson, a Rhodes scholar with a deft writing style and rough charisma who became a country music superstar and an A-list Hollywood actor, has died. Kristofferson died at his home on Maui, Hawaii, on Saturday, family spokeswoman Ebie McFarland said in an email. He was 88. McFarland said Kristofferson died peacefully, surrounded by his family. No cause was given. Starting in the late 1960s, the Brownsville, Texas native wrote such country and rock ‘n’ roll standards as 'Sunday Mornin' Comin' Down,' 'Help Me Make it Through the Night,' 'For the Good Times' and 'Me and Bobby McGee.' Kristofferson was a singer himself, but many of his songs were best known as performed by others, whether Ray Price crooning 'For the Good Times' or Janis Joplin belting out 'Me and Bobby McGee.' He starred opposite Ellen Burstyn in director Martin Scorsese's 1974 film 'Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore,' starred opposite Barbra Streisand in the 1976 'A Star Is Born,' and acted alongside Wesley Snipes in Marvel’s 'Blade' in 1998. Kristofferson, who could recite William Blake from memory, wove intricate folk music lyrics about loneliness and tender romance into popular country music. With his long hair and bell-bottomed slacks and counterculture songs influenced by Bob Dylan, he represented a new breed of country songwriters along with such peers as Willie Nelson, John Prine and Tom T. Hall. 'There's no better songwriter alive than Kris Kristofferson,' Nelson said at a 2009 BMI award ceremony for Kristofferson. 'Everything he writes is a standard and we're all just going to have to live with that.' Kristofferson retired from performing and recording in 2021, making only occasional guest appearances on stage, including a performance with Cash's daughter Rosanne at Nelson's 90th birthday celebration at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles in 2023. The two sang 'Loving Her Was Easier (Than Anything I’ll Ever Do Again),' a song that was a hit for Kristofferson and a longtime live staple for Nelson, another great interpreter of his work. Nelson and Kristofferson would join forces with Johnny Cash and Waylon Jennings to create the country supergroup 'The Highwaymen' starting in the mid-1980s. Kristofferson was a Golden Gloves boxer, rugby star and football player in college; received a master’s degree in English from Merton College at the University of Oxford in England; and flew helicopters as a captain in the U.S. Army but turned down an appointment to teach at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York, to pursue songwriting in Nashville. Hoping to break into the industry, he worked as a part-time janitor at Columbia Records’ Music Row studio in 1966 when Dylan recorded tracks for the seminal 'Blonde on Blonde' double album. At times, the legend of Kristofferson was larger than real life. Cash liked to tell a mostly exaggerated story of how Kristofferson landed a helicopter on Cash’s lawn to give him a tape of 'Sunday Mornin’ Comin’ Down' with a beer in one hand. Over the years in interviews, Kristofferson said with all respect to Cash, while he did land a helicopter at Cash’s house, the Man in Black wasn’t even home at the time, the demo tape was a song that no one ever actually cut and he certainly couldn’t fly a helicopter holding a beer. In a 2006 interview with The Associated Press, he said he might not have had a career without Cash. 'Shaking his hand when I was still in the Army backstage at the Grand Ole Opry was the moment I’d decided I’d come back,' Kristofferson said. 'It was electric. He kind of took me under his wing before he cut any of my songs. He cut my first record that was record of the year. He put me on stage the first time.' One of his most recorded songs, 'Me and Bobby McGee,' was written based on a recommendation from Monument Records founder Fred Foster. Foster had a song title in his head called 'Me and Bobby McKee,' named after a female secretary in his building. Kristofferson said in an interview in the magazine, 'Performing Songwriter,' that he was inspired to write the lyrics about a man and woman on the road together after watching the Frederico Fellini film, 'La Strada.' Joplin, who had a close relationship with Kristofferson, changed the lyrics to make Bobby McGee a man and cut her version just days before she died in 1970 from a drug overdose. The recording became a posthumous No. 1 hit for Joplin. Hits that Kristofferson recorded include 'Watch Closely Now,' 'Desperados Waiting for a Train,' 'A Song I’d Like to Sing' and 'Jesus Was a Capricorn.' In 1973, he married fellow songwriter Rita Coolidge and together they had a successful duet career that earned them two Grammy awards. They divorced in 1980. The formation of the Highwaymen, with Nelson, Cash and Jennings, was another pivotal point in his career as a performer. 'I think I was different from the other guys in that I came in it as a fan of all of them,' Kristofferson told the AP in 2005. 'I had a respect for them when I was still in the Army. When I went to Nashville they were like major heroes of mine because they were people who took the music seriously. To be not only recorded by them but to be friends with them and to work side by side was just a little unreal. It was like seeing your face on Mount Rushmore.' The group put out just three albums between 1985 and 1995. Jennings died in 2002 and Cash died a year later. Kristofferson said in 2005 that there was some talk about reforming the group with other artists, such as George Jones or Hank Williams Jr., but Kristofferson said it wouldn’t have been the same. 'When I look back now — I know I hear Willie say it was the best time of his life,' Kristofferson said in 2005. 'For me, I wish I was more aware how short of a time it would be. It was several years, but it was still like the blink of an eye. I wish I would have cherished each moment.' Among the four, only Nelson is now alive. Kristofferson's sharp-tongued political lyrics sometimes hurt his popularity, especially in the late 1980s. His 1989 album, 'Third World Warrior' was focused on Central America and what United States policy had wrought there, but critics and fans weren’t excited about the overtly political songs. He said during a 1995 interview with the AP he remembered a woman complaining about one of the songs that began with killing babies in the name of freedom. 'And I said, ‘Well, what made you mad — the fact that I was saying it or the fact that we’re doing it? To me, they were getting mad at me ’cause I was telling them what was going on.' As the son of an Air Force General, he enlisted in the Army in the 1960s because it was expected of him. 'I was in ROTC in college, and it was just taken for granted in my family that I’d do my service,' he said in a 2006 AP interview. 'From my background and the generation I came up in, honor and serving your country were just taken for granted. So, later, when you come to question some of the things being done in your name, it was particularly painful.' Hollywood may have saved his music career. He still got exposure through his film and television appearances even when he couldn’t afford to tour with a full band. Kristofferson’s first role was in Dennis Hopper’s 'The Last Movie,' in 1971. He had a fondness for Westerns, and would use his gravelly voice to play attractive, stoic leading men. He was Burstyn's ruggedly handsome love interest in 'Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore' and a tragic rock star in a rocky relationship with Streisand in 'A Star Is Born,' a role echoed by Bradley Cooper in the 2018 remake. He was the young title outlaw in director Sam Peckinpah’s 1973 'Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid,' a truck driver for the same director in 1978’s 'Convoy,' and a corrupt sheriff in director John Sayles' 1996, 'Lone Star.' He also starred in one of Hollywood biggest financial flops, 'Heaven’s Gate,' a 1980 Western that ran tens of millions of dollars over budget. And in a rare appearance in a superhero movie, he played the mentor of Snipes' vampire hunter in 'Blade.' He described in a 2006 AP interview how he got his first acting gigs when he performed in Los Angeles. 'It just happened that my first professional gig was at the Troubadour in L.A. opening for Linda Rondstadt,' Kristofferson said. 'Robert Hilburn (Los Angeles Times music critic) wrote a fantastic review and the concert was held over for a week,' Kristofferson said. 'There were a bunch of movie people coming in there, and I started getting film offers with no experience. Of course, I had no experience performing either.' ___ Hall reported from Nashville.

Stuck NASA astronauts welcome SpaceX capsule that'll bring them home next year	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — The two astronauts stuck at the International Space Station since June welcomed their new ride home with Sunday’s arrival of a SpaceX capsule. SpaceX launched the rescue mission on Saturday with a downsized crew of two astronauts and two empty seats reserved for Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who will return next year. The Dragon capsule docked in darkness as the two craft soared 265 miles (426 kilometers) above Botswana. NASA switched Wilmore and Williams to SpaceX following concerns over the safety of their Boeing Starliner capsule. It was the first Starliner test flight with a crew, and NASA decided the thruster failures and helium leaks that cropped up after liftoff were too serious and poorly understood to risk the test pilots’ return. So Starliner returned to Earth empty earlier this month. The Dragon carrying NASA’s Nick Hague and the Russian Space Agency’s Alexander Gorbunov will remain at the space station until February, turning what should have been a weeklong trip for Wilmore and Williams into a mission lasting more than eight months. Two NASA astronauts were pulled from the mission to make room for Wilmore and Williams on the return leg. NASA likes to replace its station crews every six months or so. SpaceX has provided the taxi service since the company’s first astronaut flight in 2020. NASA also hired Boeing for ferry flights after the space shuttles were retired, but flawed software and other Starliner issues led to years of delays and more than $1 billion in repairs. Starliner inspections are underway at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center, with post-flight reviews of data set to begin this week. 'We’re a long way from saying, ‘Hey, we’re writing off Boeing,’' NASA’s associate administrator Jim Free said at a pre-launch briefing. The arrival of two fresh astronauts means the four who have been up there since March can now return to Earth in their own SpaceX capsule in just over a week. Their stay was extended a month because of the Starliner turmoil. Although Saturday's liftoff went well, SpaceX said the rocket's spent upper stage ended up outside its targeted impact zone in the Pacific because of a bad engine firing. The company has halted all Falcon launches until it figures out what went wrong. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

Who were the 7 high-ranking Hezbollah officials killed over the past week?	BEIRUT (AP) — In just over a week, intensified Israeli strikes in Lebanon killed seven high-ranking commanders and officials from the powerful Hezbollah militant group, including the group's leader, Hassan Nasrallah. The move left Lebanon and much of the Mideast in shock as Israeli officials celebrated major military and intelligence breakthroughs. Hezbollah had opened a front to support its ally Hamas in the Gaza Strip a day after the Palestinian group's surprise attack into southern Israel. The recent strikes in Lebanon and the assassination of Nasrallah are a significant escalation in the war in the Middle East, this time between Israel and Hezbollah. Lebanon's most powerful military and political force now finds itself trying to recuperate from severe blows, having lost key members who have been part of Hezbollah since its establishment in the early 1980s. Chief among them was Nasrallah, who was killed in a series of airstrikes that leveled several buildings in southern Beirut. Others were lesser-known in the outside world, but still key to Hezbollah’s operations. Hassan Nasrallah Since 1992, Nasrallah had led the group through several wars with Israel, and oversaw the party's transformation into a powerful player in Lebanon. Hezbollah entered Lebanon's political arena while also taking part in regional conflicts that made it the most powerful paramilitary force. After Syria's uprising 2011 spiraled into civil war, Hezbollah played a pivotal role in keeping Syrian President Bashar Assad in power. Under Nasrallah, Hezbollah also helped develop the capabilities of fellow Iran-backed armed groups in Iraq and Yemen. Nasrallah is a divisive figure in Lebanon, with his supporters hailing him for ending Israel's occupation of southern Lebanon in 2000, and his opponents decrying him for the group's weapons stockpile and making unilateral decisions that they say serves an agenda for Tehran and allies. Nabil Kaouk Kaouk, who was killed in an airstrike Saturday, was the deputy head of Hezbollah’s Central Council. He joined the militant group in its early days in the 1980s. Kaouk also served as Hezbollah’s military commander in south Lebanon from 1995 until 2010. He made several media appearances and gave speeches to supporters, including in funerals for killed Hezbollah militants. He had been seen as a potential successor to Nasrallah. Ibrahim Akil Akil was a top commander and led Hezbollah's elite Radwan Forces, which Israel has been trying to push further away from its border with Lebanon. He was also a member of its highest military body, the Jihad Council, and for years had been on the United States' wanted list. The U.S. State Department says Akil was part of the group that carried out the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut and orchestrated the taking of German and American hostages. Ahmad Wehbe Wehbe was a commander of the Radwan Forces and played a crucial role in developing the group since its formation almost two decades ago. He was killed alongside Akil in an airstrike in Beirut's southern suburbs that struck and leveled a building. Ali Karaki Karaki led Hezbollah's southern front, playing a key role in the ongoing conflict. The U.S. described him as a significant figure in the militant group's leadership. Little is known about Karaki, who was killed alongside Nasrallah. Mohammad Surour Surour was the head of Hezbollah's drone unit, which was used for the first time in this current conflict with Israel. Under his leadership, Hezbollah launched exploding and reconnaissance drones deep into Israel, penetrating its defense systems which had mostly focused on the group's rockets and missiles. Ibrahim Kobeissi Kobeissi led Hezbollah's missile unit. The Israeli military says Kobeissi planned the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli soldiers at the northern border in 2000, whose bodies were returned in a prisoner swap with Hezbollah four years later. Other senior commanders killed in action Even in the months before the recent escalation of the war with Hezbollah, Israel's military had targeted top commanders, most notably Fuad Shukur in late July, hours before an explosion in Iran widely blamed on Israel killed the leader of the Palestinian Hamas militant group Ismail Haniyeh. The U.S. accuses Fuad Shukur of orchestrating the 1983 bombing in Beirut that killed 241 American servicemen. Leaders of key units in the south, Jawad Tawil, Taleb Abdullah, and Mohammad Nasser, who over several decades became instrumental members of Hezbollah’s military activity were all assassinated. Who is left? Nasrallah’s second-in-command Naim Kassem is the most senior member of the organization. Kassem has been Hezbollah’s deputy leader since 1991, and is among its founding members. On several occasions, local news networks were quick to assume that an Israeli strike in southern Beirut may have targeted Kassem. Kassem is only top official of the militant group who has conducted interviews with local and international media in the ongoing conflict. The deputy leader appears to be involved in various aspects of the militant group, both in top political and security matters, but also in matters related to Hezbollah’s theocratic and charity initiatives to the Shia Muslim community in Lebanon. Meanwhile, Hashim Safieddine who heads Hezbollah’s central council, is tipped to be Nasrallah’s successor. Safieddine is a cousin of the late Hezbollah leader, and his son is married to the daughter of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, who was slain in a U.S. drone strike in 2020. Like Nasrallah, Safieddine joined Hezbollah early on and similarly wears a black turban. Talal Hamieh and Abu Ali Reda are the two remaining top commanders from Hezbollah who are alive and apparently on the Israeli military’s crosshairs. — Jeffery reported from Jerusalem.	https://apnews.com/article/hezbollah-lebanon-nasrallah-israel-8b2ae56a54d641c6910a79e9e5699824	2024-09-29T11:27:44-07:00	
Biden says he'll speak with Israeli leader, vowing all-out war in the Middle East must be avoided	DOVER AIR FORCE BASE, Del. (AP) — President Joe Biden said Sunday he would speak with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and believes that an all-out war in the Middle East must be avoided. 'It has to be,' Biden told reporters as he boarded Air Force One for Washington. 'We really have to avoid it.' The president’s statements come as Israeli airstrikes across Lebanon killed dozens of people on Sunday. He would not say when he planned to speak with Netanyahu. The Iran-backed Hezbollah sustained a string of deadly blows to its command structure, including the killing of its overall leader, Hassan Nasrallah, as part of a wave of increasingly brazen Israeli strikes meant to undercut the group's capacity to attack its territory. Tens of thousands of Israelis and Lebanese have been forced to evacuate near the Israel-Lebanon border as Hezbollah has launched near-daily rocket volleys at Israel over the past 11 months and Israel has countered with its own strikes. With tens of thousands of civilians displaced on both sides, the Biden administration has tried to bring about a negotiated resolution that would allow them to return home and prevent a wider regional conflict. Earlier Sunday, White House national security spokesman John Kirby said Israel has 'wiped out' Hezbollah’s command structure with a barrage of airstrikes that has taken out Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and several of the group’s leaders.. But Kirby warned Hezbollah will work to rebuild quickly. 'I think people are safer without him walking around,' said Kirby, referring to Friday’s strike killing Nasrallah. 'But they will try to recover. We’re watching to see what they do to try to fill this leadership vacuum. It’s going to be tough.' Kirby sidestepped questions about whether the administration agreed with how the Israelis are going about targeting Hezbollah leaders, who the Israelis say have built command structures and other facilities adjacent to or underneath civilian sites. The strikes, according to Lebanese officials, have also killed many innocent civilians. The White House continues to call on Israel and Hezbollah to agree to a 21-day temporary cease-fire that was floated by the U.S., France and other countries last week as world leaders gathered for the U.N. General Assembly. 'If you want to get those folks back home safely and sustainably, we believe that a diplomatic path is the right course,' Kirby said. He made the comments during an appearance on CNN’s 'State of the Union.'	https://apnews.com/article/biden-israel-hezbollah-war-af76d9ff367a9ebbc8685628276c484b	2024-09-29T10:06:36-07:00	
Israel's prime minister appoints a former rival to strengthen his hold on office	JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appointed Sunday a former rival, Gideon Saar, as a member of his Cabinet, expanding his coalition and strengthening his hold on office. Under their agreement, Netanyahu said Saar would serve as a minister without portfolio and serve in the Security Cabinet, the body that oversees the management of the ongoing war against Israel's enemies across the Middle East. Saar, 57, had hoped to replace Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, another rival of Netanyahu’s. But a deal to become defense minister fell through several weeks ago after fighting intensified with Hezbollah along Israel's northern border, leaving the popular Gallant in office for the time being. Saar is a veteran politician who himself has had a strained relationship with the prime minister. He was once a rising star in Netanyahu’s Likud party, but angrily left it four years ago after accusing the prime minister of turning it into a 'cult of personality' as he battled corruption charges. Since then, however, Saar has struggled as leader of a small conservative party, enjoying little support with the broader public. While he and Netanyahu have little love for one another, they share a hard-line ideology toward Israel’s Arab adversaries. In recent months, Saar has said Israel must fight until Hamas is destroyed. He also has called for tougher action against Hezbollah's sponsor, Iran. And like Netanyahu, he strongly opposes the establishment of a Palestinian state. In a joint statement, they said they had put their differences aside for the good of the nation. Netanyahu’s decision appears to have been driven in part by domestic politics. He faces a number of key political battles in the coming weeks — including the contentious issue of drafting ultra-Orthodox men into the army, passing a budget and taking the stand in his long-running corruption trial. Saar is expected to help Netanyahu on many of these issues. His appointment also will likely scale back the influence of ultranationalist members of his coalition. Bezalel Smotrich, the Israeli finance minister, and Itamar Ben-Gvir, Israel’s minister of national security, are religious ideologues who have threated to bring down the government if Netanyahu makes too many concessions in any cease-fire deal. Ben-Gvir has also drawn international criticism for provocative visits to a contested Jerusalem holy site. Sunday's agreement gives Saar, who hopes to be prime minister one day, an opportunity to revive his political career, while expanding Netanyahu’s majority coalition to 68 seats in the 120-seat parliament.	https://apnews.com/article/netanyahu-saar-israel-politics-cabinet-ee441a9a75780e5c2740ccaeacc461e9	2024-09-29T09:32:50-07:00	
Pope Francis suggests Israel's actions in Gaza and Lebanon are disproportionate and immoral	ABOARD THE PAPAL PLANE (AP) — Pope Francis suggested Sunday that Israel's attacks in Gaza and Lebanon have been 'immoral' and disproportionate, saying its military domination has gone beyond the rules of war. Francis was asked en route home from Belgium about Israel’s targeted killing of one of Hezbollah’s founding members, Hassan Nasrallah. Friday's strike in Beirut targeted an area greater than a city block and reduced several residential buildings to rubble, and at least six other deaths have been confirmed. Francis didn’t mention Israel by name and said he was speaking in general terms. But he said that 'the defense must always be proportionate to the attack.' 'When there is something disproportionate, there is a dominating tendency that goes beyond morality,' he said. 'A country that does these things — and I’m talking about any country — in a superlative way, these are immoral actions.' He said that even if war itself is immoral, there are rules that 'indicate some morality.' 'But when you don’t do this … you see the bad blood of these things,' he said. The death of Nasrallah has sent shockwaves throughout Lebanon and the Middle East, where he has been a dominant political and military figure for more than three decades. U.S. President Joe Biden said the Israeli strike was a 'measure of justice' for victims of Hezbollah’s 'reign of terror.' Francis has tried to strike a balance in his comments on the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel and the conflicts in Gaza and southern Lebanon that have ensued. He has called for an immediate cease-fire, for the release of hostages taken by Hamas and for humanitarian aid to get to Gaza. Francis repeated that he calls the Catholic parish in Gaza every day to see how they are doing. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Norway is mulling building a fence on its border with Russia, following Finland's example	HELSINKI (AP) — Norway may put a fence along part or all of the 198-kilometer (123-mile) border it shares with Russia, a minister said, a move inspired by a similar project in its Nordic neighbor Finland. 'A border fence is very interesting, not only because it can act as a deterrent but also because it contains sensors and technology that allow you to detect if people are moving close to the border,' Justice Minister Emilie Enger Mehl said in an interview with the Norwegian public broadcaster NRK published late Saturday. She said the Norwegian government is currently looking at 'several measures' to beef up security on the border with Russia in the Arctic north, such as fencing, increasing the number of border staff or stepping up monitoring. The Storskog border station, which has witnessed only a handful of illegal border crossing attempts in the past few years, is the only official crossing point into Norway from Russia. Should the security situation in the delicate Arctic area worsen, the Norwegian government is ready to close the border on short notice, said Enger Mehl, who visited neighboring Finland this summer to learn about how the entire 1,340-kilometer (830-mile) Finnish-Russian land border was closed. The Finnish government was prompted to close all crossing points from Russia to Finland in late 2023 after more than 1,300 third-country migrants without proper documentation or visas — an unusually high number — entered the country in three months, just months after the nation became a member of NATO. To prevent Moscow using migrants in what the Finnish government calls Russia’s 'hybrid warfare,' Helsinki is currently building fences with a total length of up to 200 kilometers (124 miles) in separate sections along the border zone that makes up part of NATO’s northern flank and serves as the European Union’s external border. Finnish border officials say fences equipped with top-notch surveillance equipment — to be located mostly around crossing points — are needed to better monitor and control any migrants attempting to cross over from Russia and give officials time to react. Inspired by Finland’s project, Enger Mehl said that such a fence could also be a good idea for Norway. According to NRK, her statement was supported by police chief Ellen Katrine Hætta in Norway’s northern Finnmark county. 'It’s a measure that may become relevant on all or part of the border' between Norway and Russia, Enger Mehl said. The Storskog border station is currently surrounded by a 200-meter (660-foot) -long and 3.5-meter (12-foot) -high fence erected in 2016 after some 5,000 migrants and asylum-seekers had crossed over from Russia to Norway a year earlier. Norway, a nation of 5.6 million, is a NATO member but isn't part of the European Union. However, it belongs to the EU's Schengen area, whose participants have abolished border controls at their mutual borders, guaranteeing free movement of citizens.	https://apnews.com/article/norway-russia-border-fence-finland-migrants-arctic-dad4878a24fa550dd9eac9d1a6532274	2024-09-29T04:56:55-07:00	
Profiles in clean energy: Former Shell VP helps create a new way of making clean electricity	When Cindy Taff was a vice president at the giant oil and gas company Shell in Houston, her middle schooler Brianna would sometimes look over her shoulder as she worked from home. 'Why are you still working in oil and gas?' her daughter asked more than once. 'Is there a future in it? Why aren’t you moving into something clean?' The words weighed on Taff. 'As a parent you want to give direction, and was I giving her the right direction?' she recalled. At Shell, Taff was in charge of drilling wells and bringing them into production. She worked on oil and natural gas that's called unconventional in the industry, because the oil or natural gas is difficult to get out of the ground — it doesn't naturally gush out like in movies. It's a term often used for oily shale rock. Taff was somewhat unconventional for the industry, too. Her coworkers used to tease her for driving an efficient hybrid. 'You’re not helping oil and gas prices by driving a Prius,' they'd say. ______ EDITOR’S NOTE: This is part of an occasional series of personal stories from the energy transition — the change away from a fossil-fuel based world that largely causes climate change. ______ Taff wanted Shell to pursue the energy that comes from the Earth's natural heat — geothermal. Her team looked into it, but Shell never greenlit any of those projects, saying it would take too much time to recoup the investment. When Brianna went to college, she was passionate about energy too, but she wanted to work on renewables. After her sophomore year, in the summer of 2020, she got an internship at a geothermal company — one that in fact had just been launched by Taff's former colleagues at Shell — Sage Geosystems in Houston. Now it was Taff looking over her daughter's shoulder and asking question as she worked from home during the pandemic. And Sage executives were talking to Brianna, too. 'We could use your mom here,' they said. 'Can you get her to come work for us?' Brianna recalled recently. That's how Cindy Taff left her 36-year career at Shell to become chief operating officer at Sage. 'I didn't understand why Shell wasn't pursuing it,' she said about applying the company's drilling expertise to heat energy. 'Then I got this great opportunity to pivot from oil and gas and work with these guys that I have the utmost respect for. And also, I wanted to make my daughter proud, quite frankly.' Brianna Byrd, now 24, is the operations engineer and spokesperson at the company. She's glad her mother, now CEO, left oil and gas. 'Of course I’m biased, she’s my mom, but I don’t think Sage would be where it is without her,' she said. The United States is a world leader in electricity made from geothermal energy, but this kind of electricity still accounts for less than half a percent of the nation’s total large-scale generation, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. In 2023, most geothermal electricity came from California, Nevada, Utah, Hawaii, Oregon, Idaho and New Mexico, where there are reservoirs of steam, or very hot water, close to the surface. The Energy Department estimates this next generation of geothermal projects, like what Sage is doing, could provide some 90 gigawatts by 2050 — enough to power 65 million homes or more. That hinges on private investment, and on companies like Sage introducing this form of energy to regions where, until now, it’s been thought to be impossible. How it works Sage has two main technologies: The first makes electricity out of heat. The company drills wells and fractures hot, dry rock. Then electric pumps push water into those fractures, heating it up, and the hot water gets jettisoned to the surface where it spins a turbine. But a funny thing happened during testing in Starr County, Texas. In late 2021, the team realized much of their technology could also be used to store energy. If that works, it could be a big deal. Currently, to store energy at large scale, the United States is adding batteries, mostly lithium-ion type, to solar and wind projects, so they can charge up and send electricity back to the electric grid when the sun is not shining or the wind is not blowing. These batteries typically supply four hours maximum power. Sage envisions some of its technology placed at solar and wind farms, too. When electricity demand is low, they'll use extra energy from a solar or wind farm to run electric pumps, pumping water into the underground fractures, leaving it there until demand for electricity increases — storing the energy beneath the Earth's surface for hours, days or even weeks. It's a novel way to use the technology, said Silviu Livescu, lead author on a report looking at the future of geothermal in Texas. Livescu knows Taff and has followed the company's progress. 'It’s the right moment for companies like Sage with a purpose, with a mission and with the technology to show that geothermal indeed is the energy source we need to address climate change,' said Livescu, who co-founded a different geothermal startup in Austin, Texas. These days, Taff is often out in front, talking with politicians and policymakers about the potential of geothermal. She attended the United Nations COP28 climate talks last year to share her vision for this kind of energy. Sage has raised $30 million so far and is growing. It's building a small (3-megawatt), geothermal energy storage system at San Miguel Electric Cooperative, Inc., south of San Antonio this year. It's working with U.S. military facilities in Texas that see geothermal as a way to power their bases securely. Sage recently announced partnerships for heating communities in Bucharest, Romania; clean electricity from geothermal for Meta's data centers, and energy storage and geothermal projects in California. The company is final-testing a proprietary turbine to more efficiently convert heat to electricity. Because of her oil and gas background, Taff said she knows geothermal will only be adopted widely if the cost comes down. The mantra at Sage is: It's going to be clean and it's going to be cheap. She's excited to be working in a field she feels is on the cusp of playing a big role in cleaning and stabilizing the electrical grid. 'I’ve never looked back,' she said. 'I love what I’m doing and I think it’s going to be transformative.' ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Humanitarians enlist entertainers and creators to reach impassioned youth during United Nations week	NEW YORK (AP) — A lively discussion broke out backstage during Climate Week NYC between a TikTok comedian, a buzzed-about actress, a Latin cuisine entrepreneur and a cooking content creator. Convened by World Food Program USA to educate the panel's audiences — over 1.8 million Instagram followers combined — about hunger, the four weighed best practices for authentically breaking down weighty topics on social media. 'I want to force myself to be more active on TikTok,' said ' Avatar: The Way of Water ' star Bailey Bass. Users 'have a thought, and they are talking on their phone, and they post it. It feels very palpable.' 'But how do you know this is true?' asked Manolo Gonzalez Vergara, who co-founded the culinary brand Toma with his mother and actress Sofia Vergara. 'This is just a person talking.' 'But it’s someone you can relate with, so there’s a level of trust,' added Drea Okeke, a Nigerian-American engineer turned social media star with over 6 million TikTok followers. The exchange underscored the questions faced by the humanitarian establishment as they try to reach younger, more environmentally conscious generations who — they routinely acknowledged throughout the many events unfolding this week alongside the United Nations General Assembly in New York — are tasked with digging the world out of the hole left by years of climate inaction. Billionaire Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates acknowledged as much at a Thursday Q&amp;A promoting his new Netflix show. 'We have left some real challenges for this next generation,' acknowledged Gates, who runs one of the world’s largest philanthropic foundations. Young people with large online followings can be good 'placeholders' for older institutions seeking relevance with new generations, said Wawa Gatheru. The Kenyan-American activist regularly uses Instagram to promote Black Girl Environmentalist, the national community she founded to diversify the climate movement’s leadership pipeline. But Gatheru cautioned against looping 'any young person who is visible online as an influencer' or, alternatively, cheapening youth leaders’ expertise simply because they are active online. 'In order to do it well and effectively and not be tokenistic, it’s so important to see young people as collaborators, young people as capable,' she told The Associated Press. 'Content creator' lanyards hung from some Clinton Global Initiative attendees’ necks in a new feature of the yearly gathering hosted by the former First Family's philanthropic foundation. The two-day event marked the first time that organizers intentionally dedicated space for influencers to collaborate. It came from the recognition that creators help shape how 'millions of people relate to others and understand their world,' according to Clinton Foundation Chief Brand and Digital Officer Francesca Ernst-Khan. There, during a conversation about diverse storytelling’s impact on social movements, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton asked Shonda Rhimes how to propel people toward action when their attention is splintered across so many different platforms. Rhimes, the award-winning showrunner behind television hits 'Scandal' and 'Grey’s Anatomy,' said that 'if you can entertain people, you can teach them anything.' Supplementary videos on apps like TikTok, she said, can reach people that the original content was 'never going to reach.' 'If you can place an emotional narrative on any issue — if you can put a face to it, if you can create a character for it, if you can show a struggle that inspires — you can really grab someone’s attention,' Rhimes said. It's an approach long championed by Global Citizen, the international antipoverty nonprofit that returned to New York's Central Park on Saturday for its annual music festival headlined this year by Post Malone. Emceed by longtime ambassador Hugh Jackman, the festival featured appearances from celebrities and new commitments from world leaders. Bill Nye 'The Science Guy,' renowned conservationist Jane Goodall and DJ Khaled all graced the stage at different points. English pop star Ed Sheeran surprised the crowd by performing several hits with Coldplay’s Chris Martin in an unbilled late-night set. The event generated $1 billion, according to Global Citizen. Denmark Minister of Finance Nicolai Wammen announced his nation would send over $491 million to the World Bank’s International Development Association. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen pledged a combined $530 million for global vaccine alliance Gavi and food-focused humanitarian aid. Organizers focused on mobilizing young people and offered free entry on the mobile app in exchange for acts such as volunteering or signing petitions. 'I know so many of you joined me in taking action to earn your tickets to be here tonight,' Grammy-winning rapper-singer Doja Cat said in the middle of her set. 'But we can't stop now. Please keep using your voice to help those fleeing violence to get the food, shelter and education they need and very, very much deserve.' Calls to action are needed more often in online spaces, according to Navin Durbhakula. The Harvard senior's nonprofit seeks to build more sustainable food systems. Durbhakula finds that much of the climate-related information shared on social media is 'geared towards cynicism,' which he said is an important 'wake-up call.' 'We know that there are not many things that we can do as people who are young and probably don't have access to the same spaces' as professionals,' he said. 'But how do we use our voice to raise awareness, to spread more of the important information?' The four members of the World Food Program USA's Zero Hunger Activist Council shared clips over the weekend from their Climate Week panel. Bass said WFP — which describes itself as the largest humanitarian organization implementing school-meal programs — has very little name recognition despite its vast work. Bass said it's especially 'vital' to spread its message because WFP does not have the funds to meet its current goals. Rebecca Middleton, World Food Program USA's chief advocacy and engagement officer, said the goal is to leverage young peoples' influence across age ranges. 'They get a sense of frustration with some of the older generations. I’m Gen X and we didn’t fix it,' she told AP. 'It’s not that Gen Z is going to fix it. But I think that Gen Z is going to be the catalyst for the solutions we’re looking for as a country and as a world.' ___ Associated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

AP images offer a close-up look at the smoldering site of Nasrallah's assassination	BEIRUT (AP) — More than two days after a massive Israeli airstrike that killed the leader of the Hezbollah militant group, smoke is still rising from the smoldering wreckage. Israel said the Friday night strike targeted a meeting at an underground Hezbollah compound. The blasts leveled multiple high-rise apartment towers in the densely populated predominantly Shiite southern Beirut suburb known as Dahiyeh. Hezbollah confirmed in a statement Saturday that its longtime leader, Hassan Nasrallah, was killed in the strike — a huge blow for the group he had led for 32 years. On Sunday, Associated Press journalists saw smoke still rising over the rubble as people flocked to the site, some to check on what’s left of their homes, others to pay respects and pray. Some were there to simply inspect the destruction. Residents of Beirut heard up to 10 explosions following the Friday strike that targeted an area greater than a city block, reducing several residential buildings to a jumble of pancaked concrete and twisted steel. The buildings sank into the ground, leaving a cleared-out area bigger than a soccer field. Israel on Saturday released videos it said were of the warplanes that took part in the strike, showing at least eight F-15Is, but it didn't provide any comment on the type or number of bombs used. Experts said the blasts and destruction left behind were consistent with the 2,000-pound (900-kilogram) -class bombs, likely designed to explode after penetrating structures. Onlookers at the site Sunday clambered over large slabs of concrete, surrounded by high piles of twisted metal and wreckage. Several craters, likely used by rescuers to penetrate under the site of the explosion were visible, some of them apparently up to 30 meters (100 feet) deep. A few Hezbollah workers were using a bulldozer to excavate around one of the craters, some of them apparently dug by rescuers to reach the dead. State security and investigators were nowhere to be seen. The AP footage provided one of the closest looks at the site of the assassination and the extent of the destruction it caused. So far, six deaths have been confirmed at the site, along with dozens of injuries, but it is not clear if the diggers are still looking for bodies. Some people on the scene Sunday said their relatives were still missing. A woman wearing the black head-to-toe robe known as the chador stood on one side, reading from the Islamic holy book, the Quran, as a group of bystanders sobbed. One man collapsed in tears after seeing the immense destruction. 'Ya Sayyed, Ya Sayyed!' he cried, his head resting against a wall, as he referred to Nasrallah by his honorific title. 'Our morale is high and the struggle shall continue,' said Ali Rahhal, 30. 'From here, from the heart of Dahiyeh, we say ‘labbayka ya, Nasrallah’,' he said. The Arabic phrase, which means 'at your service, Nasrallah,' was often chanted by supporters at Hezbollah rallies. ___ Associated Press writer Fadi Tawil contributed reporting.	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-hezbollah-beirut-nasrallah-israel-airstrike-dahiyeh-7ebf675d75e4d49c7b307864cdbc7dc1	2024-09-29T03:14:14-07:00	
U.S. airstrikes on Syria kill 37 militants affiliated with extremist groups	BEIRUT (AP) — In Syria, 37 militants affiliated to the extremist Islamic State group and an al-Qaeda-linked group were killed in two strikes, the United States military said Sunday. Two of the dead were senior militants, it said. U.S. Central Command said it struck northwestern Syria on Tuesday, targeting a senior militant from the al-Qaeda-linked Hurras al-Deen group and eight others. They say he was responsible for overseeing military operations. They also announced a strike from earlier this month on Sept. 16, where they conducted a 'large-scale airstrike' on an IS training camp in a remote undisclosed location in central Syria. That attack killed 28 militants, including 'at least four Syrian leaders.' 'The airstrike will disrupt ISIS’ capability to conduct operations against U.S. interests, as well as our allies and partners,' the statement read. There are some 900 U.S. forces in Syria, along with an undisclosed number of contractors, mostly trying to prevent any comeback by the extremist IS group, which swept through Iraq and Syria in 2014, taking control of large swaths of territory. U.S. forces advise and assist their key allies in northeastern Syria, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, located not far from strategic areas where Iran-backed militant groups are present, including a key border crossing with Iraq.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-militants-killed-airstrike-us-central-command-8921f045b25d621143778730d78bd4e4	2024-09-29T02:20:30-07:00	
Could a doping probe strip Salt Lake City of the 2034 Olympics? The IOC president says it's unlikely	PARK CITY, Utah (AP) — In his first visit back to Utah since awarding Salt Lake City the 2034 Winter Games, the International Olympic Committee president sought to ease worries that the city could lose its second Olympics if organizers don't fulfill an agreement to play peacemaker between anti-doping authorities. Thomas Bach on Saturday downplayed the gravity of a termination clause the IOC inserted into Salt Lake City’s host contract in July that threatens to pull the 2034 Games if the U.S. government does not respect 'the supreme authority' of the World Anti-Doping Agency. Olympic officials also extracted assurances from Utah politicians and U.S. Olympic leaders that they would urge the federal government to back down from an investigation into a suspected doping coverup. Utah bid leaders, already in Paris for the signing ceremony, hastily agreed to the IOC's conditions to avoid delaying the much anticipated announcement. Bach characterized the contract language Saturday as a demonstration of the IOC's confidence that the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency will fall in line with WADA. He implied that WADA, not the Olympic committee, would be responsible in the unlikely occasion that Salt Lake City loses the Winter Games. 'This clause is the advice to our friends in Salt Lake that a third party could make a decision which could have an impact on our partnership,' Bach said. Tensions have grown between WADA and its American counterpart as the U.S. government has given itself greater authority to crack down on doping schemes at international events that involve American athletes. U.S. officials have used that power to investigate WADA itself after the global regulator declined to penalize nearly two dozen Chinese swimmers who tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021. With its contract curveball, the IOC attempted to use its little leverage to ensure that WADA would be the lead authority on doping cases in Olympic sports when the U.S. hosts in 2028 and 2034. Salt Lake City's eagerness to become a repeat host — and part of a possible permanent rotation of Winter Olympic cities — is a lifeline for the IOC as climate change and high operational costs have reduced the number of cities willing and able to welcome the Winter Games. The Utah capital was the only candidate for 2034 after Olympic officials gave it exclusive negotiating rights last year. Utah bid leaders should have the upper hand, so why did they agree to the IOC's demands? Gene Sykes, chairman of the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee, said he doesn't view the late change to the host contract as a strong-arm tactic, but rather a 'reasonable accommodation' that secured the bid for Utah and brought him to the table as a mediator between agencies. He expects the end result will be a stronger anti-doping system for all. 'It would have been incredibly disturbing if the Games had not been awarded at that time,' Sykes told The Associated Press. 'There were 150 people in the Utah delegation who’d traveled to Paris for the single purpose of being there when the Games were awarded. So this allowed that to happen in a way that we still feel very confident does not put Utah at any real risk of losing the Games.' 'The IOC absolutely does not want to lose Utah in 2034,' he added. Sykes is involved in an effort to help reduce tensions between WADA and the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, while making sure the U.S. stands firm in its commitment to the world anti-doping system that WADA administers. The White House's own director of national drug control policy, Rahul Gupta, sits on WADA's executive committee, but the global agency this month has tried to bar Gupta from meetings about the Chinese swimmers case. For Fraser Bullock, the president and CEO of Salt Lake City's bid committee, any friction between regulators and government officials has not been felt on a local level. His decades-long friendship with Bach and other visiting Olympic leaders was on full display Saturday as he toured them around the Utah Olympic Park in Park City. 'There's no tension — just excitement about the future of the Games and the wonderful venues and people of Utah,' Bullock told the AP. 'We are 100%.'	https://apnews.com/article/utah-winter-olympics-doping-investigation-5a8ec7f335acfa2d8d86b2dbb147624b	2024-09-29T01:11:34-07:00	
Russia downs over 100 Ukrainian drones in one of the largest barrages of the war	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — More than 100 Ukrainian drones were shot down over Russia Sunday, officials said, sparking a wildfire and setting an apartment block alight in one of the largest barrages seen over Russian skies since Moscow invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Russia’s Ministry of Defense reported that it had shot down 125 drones overnight across seven regions. The southwestern region of Volgograd came under particularly heavy fire, with 67 Ukrainian drones reportedly downed by Russian air defenses. Seventeen drones were also seen over Russia’s Voronezh region, where falling debris damaged an apartment block and a private home, said Gov. Aleksandr Gusev. Images on social media showed flames rising from the windows of the top floor of a high-rise building. No casualties were reported. A further 18 drones were reported over Russia’s Rostov region, where falling debris sparked a wildfire, said Gov. Vasily Golubev. He said that the fire did not pose a threat to populated areas, but that emergency services were fighting to extinguish the blaze, which had engulfed 20 hectares (49.4 acres) of forest. Russian ground assault warnings Elsewhere, 16 civilians were injured in an overnight barrage on the southern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia after Ukrainian military leaders warned that Moscow could be preparing for a new military offensive in the country’s south. The city was targeted by Russian guide bombs in 10 separate attacks that damaged a high-rise building and several residential homes, regional Gov. Ivan Fedorov wrote on his official Telegram channel. More people could still be trapped beneath the rubble, he said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also said that the Zaporizhzhia attack had damaged the city's transport links. 'Today, Russia struck Zaporizhzhia with aerial bombs. Ordinary residential buildings were damaged and the entrance of one building was destroyed. The city’s infrastructure and railway were also damaged,' Zelenskyy said in a post on X. The Ukrainian leader appeared Sunday at a memorial service to make the 83rd anniversary of the Babyn Yar massacre, one of the most infamous mass slaughters of World War II. Babyn Yar, a ravine in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, is where nearly 34,000 Jews were killed within 48 hours in 1941 when the city was under Nazi occupation. 'Babyn Yar is vivid proof of the atrocities that regimes are capable of when led by leaders who rely on intimidation and violence. At any time, they are no different,' Zelenskyy said in a statement. 'But the world’s response should be different. This is the lesson the world should have learned. We must guard humanity, life, and justice.' The Ukrainian military warned Saturday that Russian forces may be preparing for offensive operations in the wider Zaporizhzhia region. Vladyslav Voloshyn, spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern military command, said that Russia was amassing personnel in this direction. Ukraine’s air force also reported that 22 Russian drones were launched over the country overnight. It said that 15 were shot down in Ukraine’s Sumy, Vinnytsia, Mykolaiv, and Odesa regions, and that five more were destroyed using electronic defenses. The fate of the remaining two drones was not specified. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-drone-attacks-voronezh-rostov-zaporizhzhia-f998200f2d4aee0ea7cbbe5725ed907a	2024-09-29T00:47:29-07:00	
Hezbollah confirms a 7th top commander was killed in Israeli strikes in recent days	JERUSALEM (AP) — The Israeli military said Sunday it has killed another high-ranking Hezbollah official in an airstrike as the Lebanese militant group was reeling from a string of devastating blows and the killing of its overall leader, Hassan Nasrallah. The military said Nabil Kaouk, the deputy head of Hezbollah's Central Council, was killed on Saturday. Hezbollah confirmed his death, making him the seventh senior Hezbollah leader slain in Israeli strikes in a little over a week. They include founding members who had evaded death or detention for decades. The Israeli military said it carried out another targeted strike on Beirut later on Sunday, with details to follow. Hezbollah had earlier confirmed that Ali Karaki, another senior commander, died in Friday's strike that killed Nasrallah. The Israeli military had earlier said that Karaki was killed in the airstrike, which targeted an underground compound in Beirut where Nasrallah and other senior Hezbollah figures were meeting. The military said at least 20 other Hezbollah militants were killed in the strike, including two close associates of Nasrallah, one of whom was in charge of his security detail. Hezbollah has also been targeted by a sophisticated attack on its pagers and walkie-talkies that was widely blamed on Israel. A wave of Israeli airstrikes across large parts of Lebanon has killed at least 1,030 people — including 156 women and 87 children — in less than two weeks, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry. Hundreds of thousands of people have been driven from their homes in Lebanon by the lastest strikes. The government estimates that around 250,000 are in shelters, with three to four times as many staying with friends or relatives, or camping out on the streets, Environment Minister Nasser Yassin told The Associated Press. Hezbollah has continued to fire rockets and missiles into northern Israel, but most have been intercepted or fallen in open areas. No Israelis have been killed since the latest wave of strikes on top Hezbollah leaders began on Sept. 20. Kaouk was a veteran member of Hezbollah going back to the 1980s and served as Hezbollah's military commander in southern Lebanon during the 2006 war with Israel. He often appeared in local media, where he would comment on politics and security developments, and he gave eulogies at the funerals of senior militants. The United States had announced sanctions against him in 2020. Hezbollah began firing rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack out of Gaza triggered the war there. Hezbollah and Hamas are allies that consider themselves part of an Iran-backed 'Axis of Resistance' against Israel. Israel has responded with waves of airstrikes, and the conflict has steadily ratcheted up to the brink of all-out war, raising fears of a region-wide conflagration. Israel says it is determined to return some 60,000 of its citizens to communities in the north that were evacuated nearly a year ago. Hezbollah has said it will only halt its rocket fire if there is a cease-fire in Gaza, which has proven elusive despite months of indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas led by the United States, Qatar and Egypt. ___ Chehayeb reported from Beirut. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-gaza-09-29-2024-4696e581e28d8c747f017221f2cf420f	2024-09-29T00:09:33-07:00	
Pope wraps troubled visit to Belgium by praising victims and demanding abusers be judged	BRUSSELS (AP) — Pope Francis demanded Sunday that sexually abusive clergy be judged and their bishops stop covering up their crimes as he ended a troubled visit to Belgium by responding to the outrage over the scandal here that has devastated the church’s credibility. 'Evil must not be hidden. Evil must be brought out into the open,' Francis told some 30,000 people at Belgium’s sports stadium, drawing applause repeatedly as the crowd took in what he was saying. Francis deviated from his prepared homily to respond to the meeting he held with 17 abuse survivors on Friday night, where he heard first-hand of the trauma and suffering they endured and the tone-deaf response of the church when they reported the crimes. Belgium has had a wretched legacy of abuse and cover-up, none more symbolic of the church's hypocrisy than the case of Bruges Bishop Roger Vangheluwe. He was allowed to quietly retire in 2010 after he admitted that he had sexually abused his nephew for 13 years. Francis only defrocked him this year — 14 years later — in a move clearly seen as finally dealing with a problem before his arrival in Belgium. Once here, he couldn't escape the criticism. Belgium’s king demanded the church work 'incessantly' to clean up the scandal, and the prime minister insisted that victims’ needs be placed first, in a remarkable dressing-down from the leadership of the once-staunchly Catholic country. 'In the church there is room for everyone, everyone, but everyone will be judged and there is no place for abuse. There is no place for the covering up of abuse,' Francis said in his homily. 'I ask the bishops not to cover up abuse. Condemn the abusers and help them to recover from this disease of abuse.' Expressions of outrage from Belgium's leaders Francis’ visit to Belgium was always going to be difficult, given the country’s history of clerical sexual abuse and overall secularizing trends which have emptied its majestic cathedrals and churches. But it’s unclear if he or his entourage expected such sharp public expressions of outrage or the pointed calls for reform from Belgium's intellectual elite. The main reason for the trip was to celebrate the 600th anniversary of the Leuven/Louvain Catholic University, the oldest Catholic university in the world and long the Vatican’s academic fiefdom in Belgium. But the rector of the Dutch campus told Francis that the abuse scandal had so harmed the church’s moral authority that it would do best to reform if it wants to regain credibility and relevance. Rector Luc Sels suggested that opening up greater roles for women – including the priesthood – and being more welcoming to LGBTQ+ Catholics would be a good place to start. Francis heard a similar call from the Francophone campus, where students staged a reading of an articulated critique of his landmark environmental encyclical 'Praised Be' in which they called for a 'paradigm shift' in the way the church views women. They noted that the encyclical virtually ignores women, cites no female theologians and contributes to women's 'invisibility' in the church and society. Women have long complained they have a second-class status in the church, barred from the priesthood and positions of power despite doing the lion’s share of the work educating the young, caring for the sick and passing on the faith. Catholic university rebukes the pope for his views on women Francis, an 87-year-old Argentine Jesuit, said he liked what they said. But he repeated his frequent refrain about women being the 'fertile' nurturers who complement men, and that regardless 'the church is woman.' His words drew a remarkable rebuke from the Catholic university that invited him. As soon as he finished speaking, Louvain issued a statement expressing its 'incomprehension and disapproval' of his views on women, which it said were 'deterministic and reductive.' 'We cannot agree on his position for sure,' said rector Françoise Smets. 'We are fighting against discrimination for women, and we would like women to have another role in the society and in the church also.' Valentine Hendrix, a 22-year-old international relations masters student at Louvain, told reporters that students had hoped that Francis might respond positively to their appeal. While others applauded at the end of Francis' remarks, she refused and said his comments on abortion and women’s role meant that he had 'given up on a committed dialogue.' 'We had expectations, even if we saw that he disappointed us in just a few hours,' she said. Francis has made several reforms during his 11-year pontificate, allowing women to serve as acolytes, giving them the vote in his periodic synods, or meetings, and appointing several women to high-ranking positions in the Vatican. He has said women must have greater decision-making roles in the church. But he has ruled out ordaining women as priests and has refused so far to budge on demands to allow women to serve as deacons, who perform many of the same tasks as priests. He has taken the women’s issue off the table for debate at the Vatican’s upcoming three-week synod because it’s too thorny to be dealt with in such a short time. He has punted it to theologians and canonists to chew over into next year. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Climate change and harsh weather in France bring challenges to Chablis wine country	LIGNORELLES, France (AP) — On a brisk late September morning in the heart of Chablis wine country, grape pickers haul large and heavy buckets over their shoulders, drenched in sweat as they climb the very steep slope of the Vau de Vey vineyard. It's the final day of the harvest at the Domaine Roland Lavantureux winery, and workers are handpicking the last of the prized Chardonnay grapes that will eventually be transformed into the bright and high-end Premier Cru that is bottled by the estate. But wine lovers around the world may struggle to get their hands on the 2024 'millesime' — wine that comes from a single year's harvest. It will be available in smaller quantities than usual. Much of France’s wine country faced one of the wettest years on record in 2024 so far amid a changing climate, after years of challenges to vineyards and wine quality caused by drought and heat. At the Lavantureux estate, the picking lasted just nine days — about half the usual time — after a year of unpredictably harsh weather marked by frost, hail, record rainfall and the spread of a dangerous fungus that has left Chablis growers on edge. 'I have been working here since 2010. This is my most difficult year,' says winemaker David Lavantureux, who follows in the footsteps of his father Roland, a winemaker himself. 'And all the old-timers will tell you the same thing. It’s been a very difficult year because the weather has been so unpredictable. We have not been spared a single thing.' The ordeal began in April with the frost. Then in May, a double hailstorm pummeled the region. Then came relentless rain, right up to the harvest. According to the Burgundy wine federation, some 1,000 hectares (nearly 2,500 acres) of vines in the Chablis country were affected by the May storm. And the excess moisture allowed a destructive mildew fungus to thrive. Disease devastates the vineyard Once entrenched, the disease causes huge crop losses and can also affect wine quality. Together with his brother Arnaud, David fought hard to try and control mildew with various treatments, which were washed away by the rain and didn't prove effective. 'On our estate, we’re looking at losses of 60 to 65%,' David Lavantureux said. 'It’s going to be a low-yield year.' The weather impact wasn't confined to the Lavantureux estate. Wet conditions across France have wreaked havoc on many wine-growing regions this year. Mildew, combined with episodes of frost and hail, have reduced overall production. The French ministry of agriculture estimates that it will amount to 39.3 million hectoliters, below both 2023 levels (-18%) and the average for the past five years (-11%). 'It’s been a very tough year, both physically and mentally,' Arnaud says. 'We’re relieved the harvest is over. I'm exhausted.' The challenges of this year will inevitably influence the wines produced at the family winery, resulting in a 2024 vintage with distinct characteristics. 'Balances are not at all the same,' adds Arnaud. 'There’s more acidity. Maturity is less optimal. But the goal is to craft the wine so that, in the end, the balance is as perfect as possible.' Adapting to a changing climate Located in the northern part of the Bourgogne region, the vineyards of Chablis have traditionally benefited from a favorable climate — cold winters, hot summers and annual rainfall between 650-700 millimeters (25-27 inches). But climate change is altering those conditions, bringing unseasonably mild weather, more abundant rainfall, and recurrent spring frosts that were less common in the past. The frost damage is particularly frustrating. A similar phenomenon hit French vineyards in recent years, leading to big financial losses. And scientists believe the damaging 2021 frost was made more likely by climate change. 'There was a period when we thought that with global warming setting in, Chablis would be safe from frost,' David Lavantureux says. 'And finally, over the last 15 years, it’s come back even stronger.' To adapt, winemakers have been adopting creative solutions. Cutting the wines later helps delay bud burst and reduce the vulnerability to late frost, while keeping a larger foliage above the fruit shields the grapes from the scorching sun in hot summers. During frost threats, many growers use expensive methods such as lighting candles in the vineyards. They also install electric lines to warm the vines, or spray water on the buds to create a thin ice layer that ensures the blossom’s temperature remains around freezing point but doesn't dip much lower. Throughout the Burgundy region, anti-hail devices have also been deployed in a bid to lessen the intensity of hailstorms. 'It helps reduce risk, but it’s never 100% protection,' David Lavantureux says. 'We saw that again this year with several hailstorms, two of which were particularly severe.' Looking ahead Fortunately for the Lavantureux family, two very good years in 2022 and 2023 should help mitigate the financial losses induced by the reduced 2024 harvest as international demand for Chablis remains solid, especially in the United States. In June, the Burgundy wine association said that Chablis wine exports to the U.S. reached 3 million bottles, generating 368 million euros ($410 million), a 19% increase compared to the previous year. 'We’ve put this harvest behind us,' says Arnaud Lavantureux 'Now it's time to think on the next one.' ___ Marine Lesprit contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/climate-change-chablis-wine-france-84ffd41b546154acb8d2761a0b347ff8	2024-09-28T22:08:10-07:00	
At least 148 are dead in floods and landslides in Nepal	KATHMANDU, Nepal (AP) — Rescuers in Nepal recovered dozens of bodies from buses and other vehicles that were buried in landslides near the capital Kathmandu, as the death toll from flooding rose to at least 148 with dozens missing, officials said Sunday. The weather improved on Sunday following three days of monsoon rains, and rescue and clean-up efforts were underway. Kathmandu remained cut off Sunday as three highways out of the city were blocked by landslides. Rescuers retrieved 14 bodies overnight from two buses that were headed to Kathmandu when a landslide buried them. Another 23 bodies were dug out from vehicles Sunday on the same spot, about 16 kilometers (10 miles) from Kathmandu, and workers searched for others who may have been buried. A statement by the Nepal police said another 101 people were injured in the flooding and landslides while 50 are missing. The death toll was expected to rise as reports come in from villages across the mountainous country. Residents in the southern part of Kathmandu, which was inundated on Saturday, were cleaning up houses as water levels began to recede. At least 34 people were killed in Kathmandu, which was the hardest hit by flooding. Police and soldiers were assisting with rescue efforts, while heavy equipment was used to clear the landslides from the roads. The government announced it was closing schools and colleges across Nepal for the next three days. The monsoon season began in June and usually ends by mid-September.	https://apnews.com/article/nepal-kathmandu-floods-landslides-deaths-9e810fd32a53ca5bb0172438adcb21af	2024-09-28T19:56:14-07:00	
Hospital clowns bring joy to young Ukrainian cancer patients who survived Russian missile attack	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Their costumes are put on with surgical precision: Floppy hats, foam noses, bright clothes, and a ukulele with multicolored nylon strings. Moments later, in a beige hospital ward normally filled with the beeping sounds of medical machinery, there are bursts of giggles and silly singing. As Ukraine’s medical facilities come under pressure from intensifying attacks in the war against Russia's full-scale invasion, volunteer hospital clowns are duck-footing their way in to provide some badly needed moments of joy for hospitalized children. The 'Bureau of Smiles and Support' (BUP) is a hospital clowning initiative established in 2023 by Olha Bulkina, 35, and Maryna Berdar, 39, who already had more than five years of hospital clowning experience between them. 'Our mission is to let childhood continue regardless of the circumstances,' Bulkina, told The Associated Press. BUP took on new significance following a Russian missile strike on Okhmatdyt Children’s Hospital in Kyiv in July. The attack on Ukraine’s largest pediatric facility forced the evacuation of dozens of young patients, including those with cancer, to other hospitals in the capital – and the clowns did not stand aside. Together with first responders, Berdar and Bulkina helped with clearing the rubble after the attack and attended to the children who were relocated to other medical facilities. But even for them, the real heroes there were young patients. 'When the children were evacuated from Okhmatdyt after the missile attack, many of them were in extremely difficult medical conditions, but even in this situation they tried to support the adults,' said Berdar, recalling the events after the strike. The hospital clowns, who use traditional clown noses and bright costumes, are now visiting multiple hospitals in the Ukrainian capital region, including the National Cancer Institute, where patient numbers have surged after the Okhmatdyt attack. Tetiana Nosova, 22, and Vladyslava Kulinich, 22, are volunteer hospital clowns who go by Zhuzha and Lala and joined BUP more than a year ago. For them, hospital clowning is as challenging as it is rewarding. 'I volunteer so that children don’t think about their illness, even for a short moment, so that laughter replaces tears, and joy replaces fear, especially during medical procedures,' Kulinich said. In her practice, she stays together with children, sharing all their feelings, whether they are fear, pain, or joy. For Nosova, the process itself is what made her start clowning. 'I am motivated by joy. I simply enjoy it. All my life I studied to be an actress, all my life I enjoyed making people laugh. That’s enough motivation for me,' she said. In a city grappling with nightly air raid alerts and power outages, overworked doctors say the presence of the volunteers brings a much-needed distraction, often helping children who had been undergoing painful medical treatment to feel happy again. 'Clowns play a very important role in the treatment of children. They help distract the children, they help them forget about the pain, they help them not pay attention to the nurses or doctors who come to treat them,' Valentyna Mariash, a senior nurse on the Okhmatdyt cancer ward, told AP. The July attack complicated treatment plans for many families. Daria Vertetska, 34, was in Okhmatdyt with her 7-year-old daughter, Kira, when the missile exploded just outside their ward. Kira, who was diagnosed with rhabdomyosarcoma of the nasopharynx, was asleep, medicated with morphine. 'It saved her that she was covered with a blanket during the strike, but still, her head, legs, and arms were cut with small glass shards,' said Vertetska. She and Kira returned to Okhmatdyt in less than a week after the attack. Not all the children returned to the hospital. Some stayed in the medical facilities where they had been evacuated, while others were moved to apartments paid for by charity organizations and located in the hospital’s vicinity. Despite hospital clown initiatives like BUP across Ukraine, the need for their work grows exponentially. 'When I see how our work is needed in the large children’s hospitals located in Kyiv, I can only imagine what a great need there is in regional and district hospitals, where such (clown) activity, as for example in Okhmatdyt, to be honest, simply does not exist,' Berdar said. The World Health Organization, earlier this month, warned that the country faces a deepening public health crisis, largely due to devastating missile and drone strikes on the country’s electricity system as well as hospital infrastructure. Since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, WHO has recorded nearly 2,000 attacks on Ukraine’s health care facilities and says they are having a severe impact. Children are among the most vulnerable, but a mental health crisis affects the whole country. It means the clowns’ work has won broad support from medical professionals. Parents are simply happy to see a smile return to their children’s faces. 'With clowns, children learn to joke, they play with soap bubbles, their mood lifts. Today, Kira saw clowns playing the ukulele, now she wants one, too,' said her mother, Daria. ___ Associated Press writer Derek Gatopoulos contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP's coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-russia-war-hospital-clowns-children-okhmatdyt-7a5e88712053f7bb33e0983a7ecc21ab	2024-09-28T19:08:48-07:00	
Austrian far-right party hopes for its first national election win in a close race	VIENNA (AP) — Austria’s far-right Freedom Party could win a national election for the first time on Sunday, tapping into voters’ anxieties about immigration, inflation, Ukraine and other concerns following recent gains for the hard right elsewhere in Europe. Herbert Kickl, a former interior minister and longtime campaign strategist who has led the Freedom Party since 2021, wants to become Austria’s new chancellor. He has used the term 'Volkskanzler,' or chancellor of the people, which was used by the Nazis to describe Adolf Hitler in the 1930s. Kickl has rejected the comparison. But to become Austria's new leader, he would need a coalition partner to command a majority in the lower house of parliament. And a win isn’t certain, with recent polls pointing to a close race. They have put support for the Freedom Party at 27%, with the conservative Austrian People’s Party of Chancellor Karl Nehammer on 25% and the center-left Social Democrats on 21%. More than 6.3 million people age 16 and over are eligible to vote for the new parliament in Austria, a European Union member that has a policy of military neutrality. Kickl has achieved a turnaround since Austria’s last parliamentary election in 2019. In June, the Freedom Party narrowly won a nationwide vote for the first time in the European Parliament election, which also brought gains for other European far-right parties. In 2019, its support slumped to 16.2% after a scandal brought down a government in which it was the junior coalition partner. Then-vice chancellor and Freedom Party leader Heinz-Christian Strache resigned following the publication of a secretly recorded video in which he appeared to offer favors to a purported Russian investor. The far right has tapped into voter frustration over high inflation, the war in Ukraine and the Covid pandemic. It also been able to build on worries about migration. In its election program, the Freedom Party calls for 'remigration of uninvited foreigners,' and for achieving a more 'homogeneous' nation by tightly controlling borders and suspending the right to asylum via an 'emergency law.' Gernot Bauer, a journalist with Austrian magazine Profil who recently co-published an investigative biography of the far-right leader, said that under Kickl’s leadership, the Freedom Party has moved 'even further to the right,' as Kickl refuses to explicitly distance the party from the Identitarian Movement, a pan-European nationalist and far-right group. Bauer describes Kickl’s rhetoric as 'aggressive' and says some of his language is deliberately provocative. The Freedom Party also calls for an end to sanctions against Russia, is highly critical of western military aid to Ukraine and wants to bow out of the European Sky Shield Initiative, a missile defense project launched by Germany. The leader of the Social Democrats, a party that led many of Austria’s post-World War II governments, has positioned himself as the polar opposite to Kickl. Andreas Babler has ruled out governing with the far right and labeled Kickl 'a threat to democracy.' While the Freedom Party has recovered, the popularity of Nehammer’s People’s Party, which currently leads a coalition government with the environmentalist Greens as junior partners, has declined since 2019. During the election campaign, Nehammer portrayed his party, which has taken a tough line on immigration in recent years, as 'the strong center' that will guarantee stability amid multiple crises. But it is precisely these crises, ranging from the COVID-19 pandemic to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and resulting rising energy prices, that have cost the conservatives support, said Peter Filzmaier, one of Austria’s leading political scientists. Under their leadership, Austria has experienced high inflation averaging 4.2% over the past 12 months, surpassing the EU average. The government also angered many Austrians in 2022 by becoming the first European country to introduce a coronavirus vaccine mandate, which was scrapped a few months later without ever being put into effect. And Nehammer is the third chancellor since the last election, taking office in 2021 after predecessor Sebastian Kurz — the winner in 2019 — quit politics amid a corruption investigation. But the recent flooding caused by Storm Boris that hit Austria and other countries in Central Europe brought back the topic of the environment into the election debate and helped Nehammer slightly narrow the gap with the Freedom Party by presenting himself as a 'crisis manager,' Filzmaier said. Nehammer said in a video Thursday that 'this is about whether we continue together on this proven path of stability or leave the country to the radicals, who make a lot of promises and don't keep them.' The People’s Party is the far right’s only way into government. Nehammer has repeatedly excluded joining a government led by Kickl, describing him as a 'security risk' for the country, but hasn’t ruled out a coalition with the Freedom Party in and of itself, which would imply Kickl renouncing a position in government. The likelihood of Kickl agreeing to such a deal if he wins the election is very low, Filzmaier said. But should the People’s Party finish first, then a coalition between the People’s Party and the Freedom Party could happen, Filzmaier said. The most probable alternative would be a three-way alliance between the People’s Party, the Social Democrats and most likely the liberal Neos. ___ Associated Press videojournalist Philipp Jenne contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/austria-national-election-far-right-freedom-party-1a22057b230a2576e0ca0ee69607cf6e	2024-09-28T19:05:58-07:00	
Model makers in Madagascar are bringing history's long-lost ships back to life	ANTANANARIVO, Madagascar (AP) — A French trading ship that sank in the 17th century with treasure onboard is being brought back to life in a workshop in Madagascar with every stroke of Rafah Ralahy's small wood sander. Ralahy, eyes sparkling behind his glasses, has learned in 30 years as a craftsman at the Le Village model ship making company that recreating history in miniature form can't be rushed. It'll take time to get the shape of the hull just right on this model, to get it just as it was on the 1,000-ton original. The ship in question was called the Soleil d’Orient — the Eastern Sun — and it was one of the best in the French East India company. It sank in 1681 while carrying ambassadors and treasure sent by the King of Siam (now Thailand) to King Louis XIV of France. Anyone wanting an exact wooden replica from Le Village, albeit a few feet long, can get it for just over $2,500. That excludes the shipping costs. 'My job is to be as faithful as possible to the plan,' said 50-year-old Ralahy, referring to copies of the ships’ original building plans that Le Village acquires from maritime museums or other sources. 'At each stage we check so that the model we create is identical to the ship designed centuries ago.' Le Village has been making models of history's most famous vessels since 1993 and sending them to collectors across the world, some of them eminent. Prince Albert of Monaco has several models displayed in his palace, said Le Village co-owner Grégory Postel. The Spanish royal family also own Le Village creations. Pope Francis was gifted a model by Madagascar President Andry Rajoelina. Those royal customers are looking for a model ship 'that resembles what their ancestors knew,' said Postel, championing the company's attention to historic detail. Some of the high-end models sell for a princely sum of $10,000. Collectors with as much passion but less means can find something for around $150. Le Village has dozens of ships available for order, from celebrated to infamous to ill-fated. Some recently were shown at an exhibition in Venice, Italy, including one of the company’s showpieces, the British ship HMS Bounty that is renowned for a mutiny by its disgruntled crew. A model of perhaps the most famous ship ever, the Titanic, is of course available. Le Village's staff of more than two dozen model makers work in nine dusty workshops on the outskirts of the Madagascar capital of Antananarivo. Like Ralahy, many of them have been here for more than 20 years, crafting a reputation for an unusual company. Madagascar has hardly any shipbuilding tradition despite being the world's fourth largest island. So, Le Village's own story is one of endeavor. It was started by Frenchman Hervé Scrive, who arrived in Madagascar off the east coast of Africa with a passion. He sold it after 20 years to a family, but it hit choppy waters during the COVID-19 pandemic as Madagascar — already struggling with high levels of poverty — sank into a deep economic recession. Postel, his wife and another French couple bought it last year with the aim of bringing it out of financial trouble and, hopefully, expanding. Postel said they want to start a woodworking school to spread the craft on the island and create opportunities for others. They'd also like to build a maritime museum of their own. Ralahy, a house painter as a young man before finding another use for his nimble hands, sands the rough wood that will become the outer hull of the Soleil d’Orient model he’s started. Weeks of intricate work lie ahead for the team of crafters and some models take more than 1,000 hours of work. But the miniature sails will be hoisted on a new Soleil d’Orient nearly 350 years after tragedy befell the original and she sank with no survivors, sending her treasure to the ocean bottom. Each model passes through the different workshops and through the hands of different specialists. Husbands and wives work together at Le Village, as do other members of the same families. It's a tight-knit team. In another room, four women who craft and attach the tiny ropes, sails and other finishing touches, are working with a sense of urgency on one model. This one is nearing completion and has already been paid for. 'It’s a race,' said Alexandria Mandimbiherimamisoa as she gets mini flags ready to add to the ship. 'We have to send the boat to its buyer in a week.' Her husband, Tovo-Hery Andrianarivo, also works at Le Village, his fingernails blackened from a misplaced hammer blow or two over the years, an occupational hazard. He spoke of their collective pride when they see how far some of their models have traveled. Andrianarivo once watched a documentary on the recreation of a life-size version of the Hermione, an 18th-century frigate that carried French General Lafayette to the American War of Independence. It was rebuilt and launched again in 2014 to much fanfare. 'Behind the museum curator who was speaking, there was our model,' Andrianarivo said. 'The feeling I felt that day was incredible.' ___ For more news on Africa and development: https://apnews.com/hub/africa-pulse ___ The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

What to know from the UN: China, Russia have their say, and a frog metaphor makes a cameo	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — China and Russia got their turns at the U.N. General Assembly podium on Saturday, but — per usual — their top leaders didn't speak. Instead, they turned to their foreign ministers, WANG YI and SERGEY LAVROV. Wang's speech, per usual for China at the U.N., didn't break much new ground. He weighed in on the importance of national sovereignty — a frequent talking point for Beijing — and insisted, as he usually does, that Taiwan incontrovertibly belongs to China. Wang warned fellow leaders against an 'expansion of the battlefield' in Russia’s war with Ukraine and said the Beijing government remains committed to shuttle diplomacy and efforts to push the conflict toward its end. He warned against other nations 'throwing oil on the fire or exploiting the situation for selfish gains,' a likely reference to the United States. Lavrov, meanwhile, waded into the topic of nukes three days after Russian President VLADIMIR PUTIN aired a shift in his country’s nuclear doctrine, 'I’m not going to talk here about the senselessness and the danger of the very idea of trying to fight to victory with a nuclear power, which is what Russia is,' he said. Later, holding court at a news conference, he accused the United States of seeking 'to preserve their hegemony and to govern everything.' He pointed to NATO’s deepening relations with four partners – New Zealand, Australia, South Korea and Japan — as well as the so-called Quad which groups the U.S., India, Australia and Japan. From the podium ELOQUENCE BLUE RIBBON: The leader of Grenada, DICKON MITCHELL, went personal in his speech about resilience, spinning it into a mini-memoir that started with his birth in a small hillside village without running water or electricity.

Hurricane Isaac and Tropical Storm Joyce move through the open Atlantic far from land	MIAMI (AP) — Hurricane Isaac was a Category 2 storm far from land in the North Atlantic on Saturday, while Tropical Storm Joyce continued its path over open water well to the east of the Caribbean. Isaac had maximum sustained winds of 100 mph (155 kph) and was about 645 miles (1,040 kilometers) west-northwest of the Azores archipelago, which lies west of mainland Portugal. It was moving toward the northeast at 18 mph (30 kph), according to the National Hurricane Center. Far to the south, Joyce had maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (75 kph), and its center was about 1,080 miles (1,735 kilometers) east of the Northern Leeward Islands, which are on the eastern ring of the Caribbean. It was heading to the west-northwest at 9 mph (15 kph), the hurricane center reported. Neither storm posed any threat to land, forecasters said, and both were expected to weaken in the coming days. Hurricane Helene, which made landfall as a Category 4 storm early Friday, left an enormous path of destruction across the southeastern United States and has left at least 56 dead.	https://apnews.com/article/tropical-weather-atlantic-hurricane-isaac-joyce-e877d4191f0b41c8eccbca631cc2bf32	2024-09-28T16:29:05-07:00	
Hermès brings unexpected autumnal hues to spring Paris spring collection with a geometric edge	PARIS (AP) — Nadege Vanhee-Cybulski set Hermès’ spring collection ablaze with golden beiges and autumnal hues, defying seasonal conventions. Sensual mesh, leather thin as air, and a touch of utilitarian chic came together in an elegantly modern vision. Hermès proved once again that luxury can be both adventurous and effortlessly refined. Here are some highlights of Saturday's ready-to-wear collections: Hermes' gentle geometry Nadège Vanhee-Cybulski’s Hermès collection reimagined spring with a palette of warm golden beiges and earthy autumnal hues, a bold choice that immediately set the collection apart. Gentle geometry shaped the garments — myriad squares and architectural forms that fused seamlessly with Hermès’ signature minimalism. This interplay was reinforced by the striking wooden backdrop, enhancing the atmosphere of sophisticated restraint. Vanhee-Cybulski leaned into a refined sensuality with sheer mesh trousers that transformed at a flick of a zip and featherweight leather jackets that seemed almost ethereal. These pieces paired athletic ease with luxury, demonstrating her skill in blending delicacy with bold, structured shapes. Utilitarian details, like buckled belts and boxy, pocket-laden shirts, underscored the collection’s grounding in practicality, even amid its more daring expressions of sensuality. Throughout, Vanhee-Cybulski captured the lightness that spring calls for—luxurious reinterpretations of Hermès’ iconic silk scarves, transformed into breezy shirtdresses and rompers, embodied a carefree spirit ready for sunlit escapes. Warm neutrals dominated, echoing a feeling of being sun-soaked, while her activewear-inspired pieces conveyed a relaxed, summer-ready attitude without compromising on elegance. The footwear, always a standout for Hermès, carried this ethos further. Sleek riding boots offered a solid foundation to the collection’s grounded luxury, while clog sandals brought a playful, modern twist. Westwood's controled chaos Vivienne Westwood’s spirit lived on in Paris this season, as Andreas Kronthaler brought a masterful interplay of rebellion, history, and glam rock energy to the runway. The spring collection opened with sparkling pants paired with a silky blue bodice, a nod to the late designer’s love of bold, unexpected contrasts—a brilliant start that practically screamed rock ‘n’ roll chic. Kronthaler clearly hasn’t lost his taste for the dramatic, diving headfirst into the kind of fierce, confrontational style that made Westwood an icon. A giant silver chain, dangling almost absurdly to the model’s knees, set the tone: a clear statement of raw, unapologetic power, in course with the punk ethos of the 80s that still courses through this house’s veins. And there, of course, were the signature Westwood suits and Grecian-style draped dresses—classic shapes that carried a dynamic energy and timeless rebellion, reminiscent of the archival references that have defined Kronthaler’s tenure. These silhouettes bore the same sense of timeless radicalism seen in Kronthaler’s reinterpretations of Westwood’s personal wardrobe last fall, where each garment seemed to transcend fleeting trends. Clashing checks—a staple of the Westwood lexicon—made their mark, giving the collection an urban, gritty edge that felt distinctly true to the house’s rebellious spirit. Whimsy had its moment in the shape of a giant tulle headpiece, soaring high and embodying an ’80s bridal punk vision—a dizzying height of contradiction that no one but Westwood’s house could make look so irreverently sophisticated. This playful chaos echoed past seasons, where Kronthaler has embraced an eclectic mishmash of themes—from historical doublets to modern macramé cloaks. This time, however, there was a sense of restraint. It was a more controlled affair, one that saw Kronthaler tightening his narrative, perhaps reflecting a shift toward emotional homage rather than spectacle alone. Elie Saab takes us on a sultry journey Elie Saab unveiled his spring collection on Saturday at the Palais de Tokyo, and let me tell you, any expectations of colonial nostalgia were swiftly blown away, just like the harmattan gusts he drew inspiration from. Instead, what we got was a mesmerizing journey through the African savannah that felt fresh, vibrant, and completely devoid of tired clichés. This was no ordinary safari chic—Saab took the concept and injected it with his signature luxury, letting it roar in all the right ways while keeping the camp firmly in check. Right from the start, Saab showed he wasn’t afraid to play with the safari staples—but with a twist. Safari suits, reimagined as roomy linen separates and sleek crepe jumpsuits, traded their usual khaki for the blazing red of fireball lilies, moody elephant gray, and the ochre dust of West Africa. It was a palette that brought the raw, natural beauty of the continent to life without falling into the predictable tropes. These looks weren’t the romanticized garb of the intrepid explorer; they were effortlessly chic, perfectly fitted for today’s cosmopolitan adventurer. Then came the raffia—oh, the raffia! Saab worked magic with this plant fiber, weaving it into low-slung skirts and minidresses with faint bubble hems that felt light and breezy, yet utterly luxurious. It also made an appearance as fern embroideries on floor-grazing tulle gowns, adding texture and depth that felt delightfully organic. It was these delicate, thoughtful touches that took this collection beyond just a thematic exercise and elevated it to something exquisite.	https://apnews.com/article/france-paris-fashion-week-408dc76f3d542340dc77daed228113db	2024-09-28T13:51:41-07:00	
Children learn to cooperate early, but world leaders at the UN struggle to get that done	NEW YORK (AP) — Our children are told when they're little: Play nicely. Work together. Don't hit. Use your words. Multiply that by nearly 200 countries, leaders of varied backgrounds and a preposterously complex set of 21st-century priorities and goals, and you come up with what exists in the world today: the United Nations. There, the word for 'play nicely' and 'work together' is a complex one — 'multilateralism' — and its goals often get lost in its syllables. But the principle remains the same: Unite to get more done, unite to offset bullies, unite to find outcomes that all can endorse and that benefit as many of the planet's human beings as possible — and can be the foundation for eventual lasting world peace. At the U.N. General Assembly this week, it's a principle that leaders — and, not surprisingly, leaders of smaller nations most of all — mention constantly. That's not just because the U.N. has stood for multilateralism since it rose from the dictator-inflicted rubble of World War II. It is because today, in an interconnected era where human fates lie more than ever in what other humans do in other places, cooperation isn't just an ideal but a necessary reality, whether anyone wants it or not. But the problem, many leaders say, is that despite the hope that the U.N. still offers, the aging model of multilateralism — 'a mirror that obstinately reflects the values of 1945,' according to Mexican Foreign Minister Alicia Bárcena — hasn't been retooled to be effective in an era it quite possibly never envisioned. 'We cannot ignore that our common multilateral progress is failing us in the hour of greatest need,' said Hilda Heine, president of the Marshall Islands. 'This old political shell of the post-1945 political order can barely contain the contradictions,' said Ralph Gonsalves, the prime minister of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. 'We cannot continue to rule in the old way, but the new is yet to be born.' The old model isn't working anymore Both of those nations are small ones, and that's no coincidence. Though many larger nations embraced multilateralism and still do — to a point, depending on their own strategic priorities — it is smaller states that embrace it most fervently. After all, they stand to benefit most from a united front in everything from military operations to development. 'For small states, multilateralism in international law is not an option. It is in fact an existential necessity,' Singapore’s foreign minister, Vivian Balakrishnan, said Saturday. Four generations after World War II ended, the challenges of the 21st century and — of late — the rising tide of populism have led many to conclude that old models of multilateralism aren’t working. But even leaders who still believe that working together and equally is ultimately the most effective and most secure way to do things lamented, one after another, that they are still waiting for the emergence of a fresh approach. António Guterres, head of the United Nations for the past seven years, has spent most of that time preaching passionately about the virtues of multilateralism — first patiently, then less so, then more urgently, now increasingly desperately. He knows things aren't working. He believes they still can — not in spite of an increasingly complex world but precisely because of its realities. 'I have no illusions about the obstacles to reform of the multilateral system,' Guterres told leaders this week. 'Those with political and economic power – and those who believe they have power – are always reluctant to change. But the status quo is already draining their power. Without reform, fragmentation is inevitable, and global institutions will become less legitimate, less credible and less effective.' Fragmentation. That's a key word here. The rise of the internet and the global economy and the subsequent repercussions stitched things together in some ways but tore them into a million pieces in others. Long-prevailing narratives are crumbling — for good and for ill. Putting the pieces back into a recognizable and productive mosaic — the core job of the United Nations — is a Sisyphean task. This is where most conversations about multilateralism tend to end up. The very things that make it strong — many voices, many backgrounds, diverse priorities — also make it, and the United Nations itself, almost impossible to wrangle. That has a particularly strong impact on those smaller states, which need that collaboration desperately in the face of larger, more muscular ones. Increasingly beleaguered Tuvalu can't solve the encroaching waters of climate change on its own. Saint Kitts and Nevis isn't going to figure out all the impact of AI alone. Without a thriving international economy, there are a lot more problems that descend upon everywhere from Kazakhstan to Suriname to Eswatini. African nations in particular have been seeking a permanent seat on the powerful U.N. Security Council so they can have a strong bloc of cooperation — and power — within the larger one. 'Multilateral institutions, including the Security Council, do not represent African needs and aspirations,' said Nangolo Mbumba, Namibia's president. New approaches — and fast — are seen as pivotal Because of the wide perception that multilateralism is at a breaking point, Guterres this year convened a summit that produced a 'Pact for the Future,' a wide-ranging plan that the secretary-general said was 'designed to bring multilateralism back from the brink.' He insisted that, unlike many other U.N. initiatives, this one must be more than talk and documents but must produce tangible, collaborative results in coming years. Essentially, it resembles a soft reboot of the United Nations itself to make it more relevant in an age of globalization, interconnectivity, fragmentation and artificial intelligence. Many speakers this week have seized upon precisely that kind of modernization across the board — what Mohamed Irfaan Ali, the president of Guyana, called 'enlightened multilateralism.' To nations like his, that notion would represent a more substantive inclusion, a world in which they are not simply partners but equal partners — not just being a member of the club of nations, but helping to run the clubhouse. Could the 'great powers' ever accept this? Could a reset, even a limited one, of the only truly global body of nations push the U.N. back on the path it has long envisioned? Everyone, including Guterres, insists that it's possible — but that time for a new and reinvigorated multilateralism is running out. 'The world stands fractious, polarized and frustrated. Conversations have become difficult; agreements even more so,' said Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar. 'This is surely not what the founders of the U.N. would have wanted of us.' The founders recognized that humans wouldn't always play nicely — but that they had to work together. And, ideally, not hit each other. And using their words? Even in a forum committed to dialogue and understanding (not to mention long equipped with real-time translation), that is becoming a taller order with each passing year. 'If we carry on like this,' Jaishankar said Saturday, 'the state of the world is only going to get worse.' ___ Ted Anthony, director of new storytelling and newsroom innovation for The Associated Press, has been writing about international affairs since 1995.

Hundreds rally in the streets of Paris to support world abortion rights	PARIS (AP) — Hundreds of people came out in Paris on Saturday, marching in support of the right to abortion for women across the world, just six months after France became the first country to guarantee in its constitution a woman's right to voluntarily terminate a pregnancy. The protest, organized by civil society groups to mark International Safe Abortion Day, also called for greater and easier access to abortion in France, denouncing budget cuts, staff reductions and the closure of abortion centers and maternity wards, which organizers say all contribute to penalizing women. Sarah Durocher, president of France’s not-for-profit family planning services, said French women sometimes have to travel to another region to access the medical services needed to abort, denouncing the 'obstacle course' they sometimes face. Thibault Thomas, 28, said the ongoing trial of a man who has confessed to drugging his wife so that dozens of men could rape her while she was unconscious, was one of the reasons that motivated him to attend the protest on Saturday. 'There’s a mood in France, a particular context with the Mazan trial,' he said, referring to the name of the small Provence town where the couple had bought their retirement home, and where the repeated rapes occurred. 'This sweeps away all the excuses, or all the mitigating circumstances that we thought could have existed before,' Thomas said. 'In fact it is something broader, generalized.' Earlier this year, France became the only country to explicitly guarantee a woman’s right to voluntarily terminate a pregnancy, when lawmakers overwhelmingly approved a bill to enshrine abortion rights in the constitution. Abortion in France has been legal since 1975 and enjoys wide support across most of the political spectrum. Enshrining the right in the Constitution sought to prevent the kind of rollback seen in the United States in recent years. Still, many in the protest Saturday said the right to abort could never be taken for granted, especially at a time when far-right nationalist parties are gaining influence, in France and other European countries. 'Every time the far right comes to power, sexual and reproductive rights are threatened. I don’t see why there would be a French exception,' said Durocher, stressing that every nine minutes, a woman dies somewhere in the world for not having been able to access safe abortion.. 'So obviously these rights are threatened.' Also in the march on Saturday was a small organization representing Colombian women in Paris, carrying a large purple banner with a feminist sign. 'In France, fortunately, it is enshrined in the constitution. But we know that when we exert pressure in France or in Latin America, we also help all women to say, ‘We are not alone,'' said 49 year-old Talula Rodríguez. 'We’re all going to fight for rights, rights over our bodies. It’s our choices.'	https://apnews.com/article/abortion-rights-france-paris-protest-women-553a060cb9e157b4d15dc830f81607b7	2024-09-28T07:50:39-07:00	
Biden and Harris call the Israeli strike killing Hezbollah’s Nasrallah a 'measure of justice'	REHOBOTH BEACH, Del. (AP) — The Israeli strike that killed Hezbollah’s Hassan Nasrallah was a 'measure of justice' for victims of a four-decade 'reign of terror,' President Joe Biden said Saturday. The comments came after Lebanon’s Hezbollah group confirmed earlier Saturday that Nasrallah, one of the group’s founders, was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut the previous day. Biden noted that the operation to take out Nasrallah took place in the broader context of the conflict that began with Hamas’ massacre of Israelis on Oct. 7, 2023. 'Nasrallah, the next day, made the fateful decision to join hands with Hamas and open what he called a ‘northern front’ against Israel,' Biden said in a statement. He also noted that Hezbollah under Nasrallah’s watch has been responsible for the deaths of thousands of Americans, Israelis and Lebanese. Hezbollah attacks against U.S. interests include the truck bombing of the U.S. Embassy and multinational force barracks in Beirut in 1983 and the kidnapping of the Central Intelligence Agency chief of station in Beirut, who died while held captive. The U.S. said Hezbollah leaders armed and trained militias that carried out attacks on American forces during the war in Iraq. The White House sees the death of Nasrallah as a huge blow to the group. At the same time, the administration has sought to tread carefully as it has tried to contain Israel 's war with Hamas, which, like Hezbollah, is backed by Iran, from exploding into an all-out regional conflict. The White House and Pentagon were quick on Friday, shortly after the strike, to say publicly that Israel offered it no forewarning of the operation. 'President Biden and I do not want to see conflict in the Middle East escalate into a broader regional war,' Vice President Kamala Harris said in a statement Saturday that echoed Biden's description of a 'measure of justice.' She added, 'Diplomacy remains the best path forward to protect civilians and achieve lasting stability in the region.' The confirmation of Nasrallah's death comes during a week that began with Biden’s top national security aides working on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly to build support for a 21-day Israel-Hezbollah cease-fire that they hoped might also breathe new life into stalled efforts to secure a truce in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered a defiant speech Friday to the United Nations, vowing to keep up operations against Hezbollah until tens of thousands of Israeli citizens displaced by rocket attacks can return home. Shortly after, Israel carried out the strike killing Nasrallah. Biden reiterated on Saturday that he wants to see cease-fires both in Gaza and between Israel and Hezbollah. 'It is time for these deals to close, for the threats to Israel to be removed, and for the broader Middle East region to gain greater stability,' Biden said. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian accused the United States of supporting the killing that took out Nasrallah and dozens of others. 'The world community will not forget that the order of the terrorist strike was issued from New York and the Americans cannot absolve themselves from complicity with the Zionists,' Pezeshkian was quoted as saying in a statement read on Iranian state television. The State Department on Saturday ordered the departure of the families of U.S. diplomats who are not employed by the embassy in Beirut and authorized the departure of those who are, as well as nonessential employees because of 'the volatile and unpredictable security situation' in Lebanon’s capital. The U.S. embassy in Beirut also posted a link to an online form that Americans in Lebanon can complete if they are interested in possible assistance leaving the country. The embassy stressed that it was not organizing evacuations and that there are still commercial means to leave, but the request for information appeared to suggest that such plans may be in the works. The State Department has previously advised American citizens to consider leaving Lebanon and reiterated its warning against all travel to the country. 'Due to the increased volatility following airstrikes within Beirut and the volatile and unpredictable security situation throughout Lebanon, the U.S. Embassy urges U.S. citizens to depart Lebanon while commercial options still remain available,' the department said in a statement Saturday. The State Department routinely orders or authorizes the departure of nonessential embassy staffers and the families of diplomats when security conditions deteriorate in the country where they are posted. An ordered departure is not technically an evacuation but does require those affected to leave. An authorized departure allows those affected to leave the country voluntarily at government expense. Biden, who was spending the weekend at his vacation home in Delaware, and Harris, who was campaigning in California, held a call with national security aides on Saturday to discuss the situation in the Middle East. In a brief exchange with reporters as he left church on Saturday, Biden did not directly respond to questions about the conflict potentially escalating further. 'It’s time for a cease-fire,' he said. The president on Friday directed the Pentagon to assess and adjust as necessary the U.S. force posture in the region to enhance deterrence, ensure force protection and support the full range of U.S. objectives. He called for the assessment after the Pentagon earlier in the week announced it was sending an unspecified number of additional U.S. troops to the region because of rising tensions.	https://apnews.com/article/biden-hezbollah-nasrallah-israel-lebanon-024756fb7c2b7bdda93454db97659a19	2024-09-28T07:45:48-07:00	
Hundreds of fleeing families sleep on beaches and streets after Israel's strikes shake Beirut	BEIRUT (AP) — Smoke was still rising from Beirut’s southern suburbs Saturday morning, visible to many of the families who had fled their homes there the night before to escape Israel’s massive bombardment. It had been a harrowing night — getting out amid earthshaking explosions, looking in vain for space in one of the overflowing schools-turned-shelters. By the morning, hundreds of families were sleeping in public squares, on beaches or in cars around Beirut. Lines of people trudged up to the mountains above the Lebanese capital, holding infants and a few belongings. Overnight, Israel unleashed a series of strikes on various parts of Dahiyeh, the predominantly Shiite collection of suburbs on Beirut’s southern edge where tens of thousands of residents live. The biggest blasts to hit Beirut in nearly a year of conflict killed the leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, Friday. The assault was part of a rapid escalation of Israeli strikes the past week that has killed more than 700 people in Lebanon. Israel has vowed to cripple Hezbollah and put an end to 11 months of its fire onto Israeli territory in what Nasrallah described as a 'support front' for his ally Hamas in Gaza. The newly displaced swell the numbers Beirut is absorbing The people escaping Friday night’s mayhem joined tens of thousands who have fled to Beirut and other areas of southern Lebanon the past week to escape Israel’s bombardment. For many residents of Dahiyeh, the forced evacuation was disconcertingly familiar. Some were Lebanese who had lived through the bruising monthlong war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006, when Israel leveled large parts of the Beirut suburbs. Others were Syrians who had taken refuge from the long civil war in their own country. Fatima Chahine, a Syrian refugee, slept on the Ramlet al-Bayda public beach in Beirut with her family and hundreds of strangers. The night before she, her husband and their two children had piled onto a motorcycle and raced out of Dahiyeh, with 'bombing below us and strikes above us.' 'Thank God, no one was wounded,' she said. The government has opened up schools in Beirut to take in the displaced. But Syrians have reported that some sites turn them away to reserve the few spaces for Lebanese. Chahine said her family came directly to the beach. 'We only want a place where our children won’t be afraid,' she said. 'We fled from the war in Syria in 2011 because of the children and we came here, and now the same thing is happening again.' Since Monday, some 22,331 Syrians in Lebanon have crossed back into Syria, along with 22,117 Lebanese, according to Lebanese authorities. Chahine said returning is not an option for her family; she is from an opposition area and so could face reprisals from the Syrian government. At the beach, the displaced were spread out over the sidewalk or in cars parked by the curb. Others were camped out in beach pagodas or on blankets in the sand. 'We spent more than three hours going in circles between schools and shelters and we didn’t find one with room,' said Talal Ahmad Jassaf, a Lebanese man who slept on the beach with his family. He said he is considering going to the relative safety of Syria. But he worries about airstrikes on the road between Beirut and Damascus. Some people are left without aid The U.N. Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, said this week's escalation had more than doubled the number of people displaced by the conflict in Lebanon. There are now over 211,000 people displaced, including some of the humanitarian workers who should be responding to the crisis, it said. Around 85,000 of them are sleeping in shelters, it said. 'Humanitarian capacities to respond have been severely overstretched,' it added. Displaced people sleeping outside in Beirut largely told The Associated Press that they had not received assistance from any humanitarian organization. A stadium in the seaside neighborhood of Manara owned by the Nejmeh soccer club opened its doors to the displaced, who spent the night sleeping on bleachers. Among them was Mariam Darwish, her husband and five children. She fled her home in Dahiyeh earlier in the week when the first Israeli strikes hit there. Darwish said they had received water from the soccer club but that no organization had brought food, blankets or other supplies. 'People are helping each other out, family and friends are getting things for each other,' she said. She and her husband had fled during the 2006 war, when their oldest son was a baby, and returned to their home when the war ended. They hope their house will still be standing to return to this time, she said. 'We’re worried about our children and the schools, that they’ll lose out on their future,' she said. 'What can we do? We can only say thank God.' She added, 'May the resistance be victorious.' At the time of the interview, Hezbollah had not yet confirmed Nasrallah’s death. Despite their battered-down circumstances, others also struck a defiant tone. Jamal Hussein fled Dahiyeh at 3 a.m. with his extended family amid ongoing bombing and spent the night sleeping on the seaside promenade in Beirut’s upscale Ain Mreisseh district. 'Of course we aren’t afraid for ourselves, but we have children,' he said. 'We are steadfast and ready to sacrifice more than this.'	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-hezbollah-displaced-beirut-dahiyeh-children-583bbed45402d6802fa3643247924599	2024-09-28T07:07:54-07:00	
China, at UN, warns against 'expansion of the battlefield' in the Ukraine war	NEW YORK (AP) — Three days before his communist government turns 75, China's foreign minister warned fellow leaders Saturday against an 'expansion of the battlefield' in Russia's war with Ukraine and said the Beijing government remains committed to shuttle diplomacy and efforts to push the conflict toward its end. 'The top priority is to commit to no expansion of the battlefield. ... China is committed to playing a constructive role,' Wang Yi said. He warned against other nations 'throwing oil on the fire or exploiting the situation for selfish gains,' a likely reference to the United States. Wang's speech appeared to break no new ground, as is generally China's recent practice at the U.N. General Assembly's annual meeting of leaders. In fact, his boss, Chinese President Xi Jinping, has not participated in the leaders' meeting since 2021 — and then only virtually, during the pandemic. Xi has not attended in person for several years. On Friday, on the assembly sidelines, China and Brazil sought to build enthusiasm for their peace plan for Ukraine. They said about a dozen countries signed a communique that says they 'note' the six-point plan. The plan calls for a peace conference with both Ukraine and Russia and no expansion of the battlefield, among other provisions. Ukrainian officials have given the proposal a cold shoulder, but the countries that signed the communique are forming a group of 'friends for peace' for their U.N. ambassadors to keep the conversation going among themselves. Ranging from Algeria to Zambia, the members are largely African or Latin American countries. Wang made sure to note Friday that the group doesn’t decree individual countries’ policies. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said at a news conference Saturday that Russia was ready to provide assistance and advice to the group, adding that 'it’s important for their proposals to be underpinned by the realities and not just be taken from some abstract conversations.' Sovereignty has long been a talking point for China China has been an ally of Russia, a nation that has been accused of violating the U.N. Charter by Secretary-General António Guterres, the U.S. and many world nations. Moscow insists its so-called 'special military operation' is in self-defense, which is allowed in the U.N. Charter. China's continuing and vehement insistence on respect for other nations' sovereignty is not only a cornerstone of its foreign policy but a foundational ethos for the government of a nation that has traditionally struggled to maintain control at its edges — from Xinjiang and Tibet in the far west to Hong Kong and Taiwan off its east coast. China's current government was established on Oct. 1, 1949, when it was proclaimed by communist revolutionary-turned-leader Mao Zedong in Beijing's Tiananmen Square after a civil war with Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist government. The Nationalists began ruling Taiwan as a self-governed island, and that practice continues today — and is something that China rejects and insists is only a temporary situation for territory it considers sovereign. 'There is no such thing as two Chinas or one China-one Taiwan. On this matter there is no gray zone,' Wang said. 'Taiwan will eventually return to the embrace of the motherland. This is the overwhelming trend of history that no one can stop.' The Republic of China — the government in Taiwan established by Chiang Kai-shek — was a member of the United Nations until 1971, when the U.N. recognized the Beijing government. Since then, Beijing has worked to isolate Taiwan by rewarding nations that recognize it diplomatically and, sometimes, punishing those who do not. At every General Assembly high-level meeting, the leaders of scattered Taiwan-supporting nations — usually small ones — lament at the rostrum about the island's government being shunned by the international community. Wang's subjects in the speech varied Wang also weighed in with China's positions on increasing Mideast tensions and the situation on the Korean Peninsula. The latter has always been a key strategic priority for Beijing. THE MIDEAST: Saying that 'the question of Palestine is the biggest wound in human conscience,' Wang reiterated that China supports Palestinian statehood and full U.N. membership and insisted that a two-state solution is 'the fundamental way out.' He did not mention Israel by name or directly reference the war that began when Hamas fighters streamed across the Gaza border into Israel, killing hundreds and taking dozens hostage. THE KOREAN PENINSULA: As is China's policy, Wang expressed support for a transition 'from the armistice to a peace mechanism.' The two Koreas technically remain in a state of war since a 1950-53 conflict separated the peninsula into north and south. China has been a longtime backer of North Korea while the United States is a close ally of the South. He offered a veiled warning about others trying to pull strings in East Asia: 'We are firmly against the meddling of countries outside the region.' The Korean Peninsula broke into the U.S.-supported, capitalistic South Korea and the Soviet-backed, socialist North Korea after its liberation from Japan’s 35-year colonial rule at the end of the World War II in 1945. The two Koreas have the world’s most heavily fortified border. HUMAN RIGHTS: Wang repeated China's usual talking points, saying that 'no country should infringe on another’s internal affairs in the name of human rights' and insisting that China had chosen its own way, which is just as legitimate as others'. 'We have found a path of human rights development that suits China’s national condition,' Wang said. Other nations and international rights groups have long condemned Beijing's treatment of Tibetans, ethnic Uyghurs in the far-west region of Xinjiang and — more recently — activists in the 'special administrative region' of Hong Kong. ___ Associated Press writers Jennifer Peltz and Edith M.

Iran Revolutionary Guard general died in Israeli strike that killed Hezbollah leader, reports say	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — A prominent general in Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard died in an Israeli airstrike that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, Iranian media reported Saturday. The killing of Gen. Abbas Nilforushan marks the latest casualty suffered by Iran as the nearly yearlong Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip teeters on the edge of becoming a regional conflict. His death further ratchets up pressure on Iran to respond, even as Tehran has signaled in recent months that it wants to negotiate with the West over sanctions crushing its economy. Nilforushan, 58, was killed Friday in the strike in Lebanon that killed Nasrallah, the state-owned Tehran Times reported. Ahmad Reza Pour Khaghan, the deputy head of Iran’s judiciary, also confirmed Nilforushan's death, describing him as a 'guest to the people of Lebanon,' the state-run IRNA news agency said. Khaghan also reportedly said that Iran had the right to retaliate under international law. The U.S. Treasury had identified Nilforushan as the deputy commander for operations in the Guard. It sanctioned him in 2022 and said he had led an organization 'directly in charge of protest suppression.' Those sanctions came amid the monthslong protests in Iran over the death of Mahsa Amini following her arrest for allegedly not wearing her headscarf, or hijab, to the liking of police. Nilforushan also served in Syria, backing President Bashar Assad in his country’s decades-long war that grew out of the 2011 Arab Spring. Like many of his colleagues, he began his military career in the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s. In 2020, Iranian state television called him a 'comrade' of Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the head of its expeditionary Quds Force who was killed in a U.S. drone attack in Baghdad that year. ___ Associated Press writer Nasser Karimi in Tehran, Iran, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-revolutionary-guard-general-dead-hezbollah-israel-airstrike-46d2133e594b9c4ce448a6b683802995	2024-09-28T04:33:47-07:00	
Tropical Weather Latest: Millions still without power from Helene as flooding continues	The remnants of Hurricane Helene dissipated Saturday but millions remain without power across the Southeast and officials warned that record-breaking river flooding is ongoing in parts of southern Appalachia. The storm has been blamed for at least 44 deaths across five states, including 19 people in South Carolina. But officials fear the death toll could rise as authorities continue to take stock of Helene's devastation. The hurricane roared ashore Thursday night as a Category 4 storm on Florida's Gulf Coast and then quickly moved Friday through Georgia, the Carolinas and Tennessee, uprooting trees, splintering homes and sending creeks and rivers over their banks and straining dams. Tropical Storm John made its second landfall along Mexico’s Pacific coast Friday, while in its wake authorities in the resort city of Acapulco called for help from anyone with a boat to deal with the flooding. It has since dissipated over Mexico. Follow AP’s coverage of tropical weather at https://apnews.com/hub/hurricanes. Here's the latest: Locals grateful no one was killed in Tampa neighborhood that saw unprecedented storm surge TAMPA, Fla. — Davis Islands, the Tampa neighborhood that star athletes like baseball’s Derek Jeter and football’s Tom Brady have called home, was cleaning up Saturday after Helene’s chest-high storm surge tore through its streets the day before. The two islands sit just off the city’s downtown and are home to about 5,000 people. The neighborhood had never seen storm surge like it had Friday. No one died, but homes, businesses and apartments were flooded. Authorities warned residents to evacuate, and many did, but some stayed behind. 'I don’t think anybody was expecting it,' Faith Pilafas told the Tampa Bay Times. 'We’ve kind of gotten accustomed to lots of talk about big storms, and never actually like feeling the effects of it. So for all the people who didn’t leave the island, I feel like they were all just expecting it to be a normal storm, anticlimactic. And wow, were we surprised.' A 24-year-old restaurant worker, she and her boyfriend watched from their second-floor apartment as the water rose to over 4 feet (1.2 meters). Her boyfriend used his kayak to help people get off the island. 'I mean, just every single business is, like, totally destroyed,' she told the newspaper. 'But we don’t know anybody who is seriously injured, and so we’re just really grateful that didn’t happen.' Debra Ogston returned to her Italian restaurant to find that its heavy coolers had been overturned. She said the job now will be to clean up and reopen. 'We’re resilient,' she told the newspaper. 'We’re going to go for progress, not perfection. ... The damage here is annoying, and a little heartbreaking. But it’s stuff. Stuff can be replaced.' Vice President Harris urges residents affected by Helene to heed local officials DOUGLAS, Ariz. — Vice President Kamala Harris on Friday urged residents impacted by Hurricane Helene to pay heed to local authorities as the storm continues to wreak havoc on a significant swath of the southeast. 'The storm continues to be dangerous and deadly, and lives have been lost and the risk of flooding still remains high,' Harris said at the start of a campaign speech in Douglas, Arizona. 'So, I continue to urge everyone to please continue to follow guidance from your local officials until we get past this moment.' Dam near North Carolina-Tennessee border not experiencing ‘catastrophic failure,’ officials say NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Tennessee Emergency Management Agency said Friday that a 'catastrophic failure' was not taking place at Walters Dam, also known as the Waterville Dam, which sits in North Carolina close to the Tennessee border. A local mayor had urged residents to evacuate due to the dam potentially breaking, but TEMA said in a statement that the 'dam has not failed' after talking to Duke Energy, which owns the nearly 100-year-old dam. Dozens rescued by helicopter from a flooded Tennessee hospital NASHVILLE — There have been hundreds of water rescues due to Helene, but perhaps none more dramatic than in rural Unicoi County in East Tennessee, where dozens of patients and staff were plucked by helicopter from the roof of a hospital that was surrounded by water from a flooded river. Some 54 people were moved to the roof of the Unicoi County Hospital while water rapidly flooded the facility, according to Ballad Health. Ballad Health said on social media that county officials had ordered an evacuation of the hospital Friday morning due to rising water in the Nolichucky River, including 11 patients. After other helicopters failed to reach the hospital because of the storm’s winds, a Virginia State Police helicopter was able to land on the roof. Three National Guard helicopters with hoist capabilities were sent and Ballad Health assisted with its own helicopter, officials said. After about four hours, all of the staff and patients had been rescued. ▶ Read more about Friday's dramatic rescue	https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-helene-latest-death-toll-aftermath-52162181c47f400351397fe1c71e32a6	2024-09-28T04:20:46-07:00	
Hassan Nasrallah, longtime leader of Lebanon’s Hezbollah, is killed by his archenemy Israel	BEIRUT (AP) — Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who transformed the Lebanese militant group into a potent paramilitary and political force in the Middle East was killed in an Israeli airstrike, the group said. He was 64. Nasrallah, who spearheaded Hezbollah's war against Israel in 2006 and got the group heavily involved in neighboring Syria’s brutal conflict, was killed in a massive Israeli airstrike on the Beirut southern suburb of Haret Hreik Friday evening that knocked down several multi-story apartment buildings. 'His eminence Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's secretary-general had joined his fellow great martyrs whom he had led for 30 years from one victory to another,' Hezbollah said in a statement. It added that Nasrallah 'fell as a martyr on the road to Jerusalem.' Fears of a regional war Nasrallah's death comes amid a dizzying escalation in the nearly yearlong conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, since the war in Gaza started, and more than three decades after he took leadership of the Iranian-backed militant group following the killing of his predecessor by an Israeli missile in 1992. Five years later, the United States designated Hezbollah a terrorist organization. Hezbollah has been firing rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza and Hamas, an allied Iran-backed militant group. Israel has responded with increasingly heavy airstrikes and the targeted killing of Hezbollah commanders while threatening a wider operation. This week has been the deadliest in Lebanon since the bruising 2006 monthlong war between Israel and Hezbollah. Thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies used mainly by Hezbollah members exploded in different parts of Lebanon, killing 39 people and wounding nearly 3,000, many of them civilians. Lebanon blamed Israel, but Israel did not confirm or deny responsibility. Nasrallah had promised to retaliate. Then, Israeli strikes on Lebanon killed more than 700 people in five days, including at least 150 women and children, according to Lebanese authorities. Nasrallah had said the barrages would continue — and Israelis wouldn't be able to return to their homes in the north — until Israel’s campaign in Gaza ended. Seen by his supporters as a charismatic and shrewd strategist, Nasrallah had reshaped Hezbollah into an archenemy of Israel, cementing alliances with the ayatollahs in Tehran and Palestinian militant groups such as Hamas. Idolized by his Lebanese Shiite followers and respected by millions of others across the Arab and Islamic world, Nasrallah held the title of sayyid, an honorific meant to signify the Shiite cleric's lineage dating back to the Prophet Muhammad, the founder of Islam. Nasrallah’s image appears on billboards in the group’s strongholds across Lebanon — especially in southern Beirut, Hezbollah's headquarters — and on trinkets in souvenir shops not only in Lebanon but also in countries such as Syria and Iraq. Despite the power he wielded, Nasrallah lived largely in hiding in the last years of his life for fear of an Israeli assassination, giving speeches to followers via a satellite link. A fiery orator viewed as an extremist in the U.S. and much of the West, as well as in some oil-rich Gulf Arab countries, he was also considered a pragmatist, compared to the firebrand militants who dominated Hezbollah after its founding in 1982, during Lebanon's civil war. War after war in the Middle East Under Nasrallah, Hezbollah fought Israel to a stalemate during the 34-day war in 2006 and was credited with leading the war of attrition that led to the withdrawal of Israeli troops from south Lebanon in 2000, after an 18-year occupation. Nasrallah's eldest son, Hadi, was killed in 1997, while fighting against Israeli forces. When Syria’s civil war erupted in 2011, Hezbollah fighters rushed in, siding with Syrian President Bashar Assad's forces — even though Hezbollah's popularity took a dive as the Arab world ostracized Assad. Along with Damascus' key allies Russia and Iran, Hezbollah played a major role in helping Assad stay in power and eventually retake territory lost in the early years of the conflict. Hezbollah saw its popularity among Arabs surge again when it came to the defense of Hamas, opening a front with Israeli forces along the Israel-Lebanese border barely a day after the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. The Hamas-led attack killed around 1,200 people in Israel and took about 250 hostage, triggering one of the most destructive military campaigns in modern history. Israel's subsequent aerial bombardment and ground invasion of the Gaza Strip killed tens of thousands of Palestinians. In June 2024, Nasrallah warned Israel that Hezbollah had new weapons and capabilities. Nasrallah also claimed that Hezbollah now has a far higher number of fighters than the 100,000 figure he gave three year earlier. The early years Nasrallah, the eldest of nine siblings, was born into a poor family in Beirut’s impoverished northern suburb of Sharshabouk. In 1975, the Lebanese civil war forced the family to flee south, to their ancestral home in Bazzouriyeh, a village near the ancient Phoenician port city of Tyre. There, Nasrallah joined the Amal movement, a political and paramilitary organization representing the once-marginalized Shiites in Lebanon, and soon began his rise as a revolutionary. At the age of 16, he went to Iraq's holy Shiite city of Najaf where the leader of Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution, the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, lived in exile at the time and taught theology. Later, Nasrallah studied in the city of Qom, the seat of Iran’s religious hierarchy. Nasrallah was among Hezbollah’s founders when the party was formed by Iranian Revolutionary Guard members who came to Lebanon in the summer of 1982 to fight invading Israeli forces. He built a power base as Hezbollah over time became part of a cluster of Iranian-backed factions and governments known as the Axis of Resistance. It was also the first group that Iran backed and used as a way to export its brand of political Islam. Two days after its leader, 39-year-old Sayyed Abbas Musawi, was killed in an Israeli helicopter gunship raid in south Lebanon, Hezbollah chose Nasrallah as its secretary-general in February 1992. Like Musawi, Nasrallah was committed to the struggle against Israel and Khomeini’s anti-Western teachings, and famously declared: 'America will remain the dreadful enemy and Israel a cancerous growth that should be uprooted.' A black-turbaned cleric or a militant leader? Wearing spectacles and sporting a bushy grey beard like many religious Shiite men, Nasrallah's image was far from that of a militant who commanded thousands of heavily armed, well-trained and battle-hardened followers. He often paused in his speeches to make jokes or break into local dialect and once, responding to a reporter asking about his monthly salary during a television interview, Nasrallah said it was about $1,300. Following the end of Lebanon’s 1975-90 civil war, Nasrallah gradually turned the organization into a 'state within a state,' with an elaborate social welfare network that provided schools, clinics, and housing in the impoverished and predominantly Shiite parts of Lebanon. After Israel's withdrawal from southern Lebanon in 2000, Nasrallah rose to iconic status both within Lebanon and throughout the Arab world. His messages were beamed on Hezbollah's own radio and satellite TV station. In a famous speech marking the Israeli withdrawal, he said: 'It (Israel) has a nuclear weapon and the strongest air force in the region, but in truth, it is weaker than a spider’s web.' As Israel, and later Syria, pulled their armies out of Lebanon, Nasrallah began to steer Hezbollah increasingly into the realm of politics. In the 2005 parliamentary elections, the first after Syria ended its 29-year military presence in Lebanon, Hezbollah made substantial gains and joined the Cabinet for the first time, holding two seats. Politics and war In July 2006, after Hezbollah captured two Israeli soldiers in a cross-border attack, Israel launched a monthlong massive air, sea and ground campaign against Lebanon. Nasrallah’s home and offices and much of the group’s infrastructure were destroyed, as well as much of south Lebanon and Beirut's southern suburbs. Hezbollah fired around 4,000 rockets into Israel and after 34 days of fighting, a truce took effect and Nasrallah declared a 'divine victory' over Israel. While he was cheered for standing up to the Israeli army, Nasrallah was criticized by many for providing the spark for that war during which more than 1,200 people died in Lebanon — most of them civilians — and 159 in Israel. Nasrallah later expressed regret — an unprecedented move for him — and said during a televised interview that Hezbollah had not expected 'even one percent' that the capture of the Israeli soldiers 'would lead to a war of this magnitude.' 'You ask me, if I had known ... that the operation would lead to such a war, would I do it? I say no, absolutely not,' he said. In May 2008, Hezbollah’s reputation suffered a setback when its fighters briefly seized much of west Beirut, turning their guns on local Lebanese foes after the government took measures against the group's private telecommunications network. In the years that followed, a U.N.-backed tribunal in the Netherlands sentenced three Hezbollah members in absentia to five concurrent life sentences over the 2005 assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. Hezbollah ignored the tribunal and repeatedly denied its members were involved in the massive suicide bombing along the Beirut corniche that killed Hariri and 21 others, an attack that deeply divided Lebanon. During the Arab Spring uprisings against autocratic governments, Hezbollah's close alliance with Syria and Iran opened the group to accusations that it was merely a well-armed tool of Damascus and Tehran. Hezbollah was also pulled into the regional rivalry between Iran and Saudi Arabia and in 2016, the Saudi-led, six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council branded Hezbollah a terrorist organization. But Hezbollah's anti-Israel campaign remained at its forefront as the group continued to build up its arsenal of tens of thousands of missiles, including precision-guided missiles, as well as drones. After 2006, the Lebanon-Israel border remained mostly calm until Hamas' October 2023 deadly incursion into Israel. The next day, Hezbollah began attacking Israeli military posts and drawing Israeli fire in what became near-daily exchanges. Nasrallah said the aim was to ease the tension from the Gaza Strip. Nasrallah is survived by his wife, Fatima Yassin. He also has three sons Jawad, Mohammed-Mahdi and Mohammed Ali, and a daughter Zeinab, as well as several grandchildren.	https://apnews.com/article/obituary-nasrallah-lebanon-israel-2da3789a02fd4e2e88511a7f59174d19	2024-09-28T03:58:59-07:00	
9 dead as boat carrying migrants capsizes off Spain’s Canary Islands	MADRID (AP) — Nine people have died and another 48 are missing after a boat carrying migrants capsized during a rescue operation near the Canary Islands, Spanish authorities said Saturday. Spain’s maritime rescue service said that the tragedy occurred after it was alerted to the presence of a small boat loaded with people some 6 1/2 kilometers (4 miles) from the island of El Hierro. The boat turned over when too many people moved to one side during the rescue attempt, according to a statement by the rescue service. Rescuers have saved 27 people and confirmed nine dead. The service said that the scue operation was made more difficult because it was carried out during the night and under gusts of winds that reached 20 knots. Rescue craft and helicopters of the maritime rescue service, the Civil Guard, the Red Cross and the local government all participated in the operation. The Atlantic route for migrants from West Africa to the Canary Islands is one of the deadliest in the world. While there is no accurate death toll because of the lack of information on departures from West Africa, Spanish migrant rights group Walking Borders estimates the victims are in the thousands. Over 26,000 people have arrived via sea to the Canary Islands so far this year, compared to some 14,000 in the same period last year. Located nearer to Africa than mainland Spain, the archipelago seen by most as a step toward continental Europe. Many come from Mali as well as youth from Senegal, Mauritania and other West African countries seeking better job opportunities abroad or fleeing violence and political instability. ___ Follow AP coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/migration	https://apnews.com/article/migrants-canary-islands-boat-spain-c0e23bb2e09e75e6538bebca71305b85	2024-09-28T03:57:57-07:00	
Poland's death toll from floods rises to 9 after 2 more bodies found	WARSAW, Poland (AP) — The death toll in Poland from recent floods has risen to nine, after two more bodies were found, the national police chief said Saturday. One person is still missing, police chief Marek Boron told a government meeting on the the effects of the floods that hit southwestern Poland earlier this month. The floods following torrential rains inundated houses and damaged bridges and roads in the towns of Stronie Slaskie, Nysa and many villages in the area. More than 20 people had died in Poland and elsewhere in Central Europe from the floods. Among the dead in Poland was a German citizen, Prime Minister Donald Tusk said earlier this week.	https://apnews.com/article/poland-flood-deaths-police-a87141fef1a47ae2e3dbbff076624afb	2024-09-28T03:52:48-07:00	
The new top youth official at the UN talks about what's in it for young people	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Dr. Felipe Paullier is quick to say he doesn't speak for the world's roughly 2 billion tweens, teens and young adults. But as the United Nations' first assistant secretary-general for youth affairs, he's tasked with advocating for young people and their concerns to be incorporated into the organization's work — a goal shared by young activists who don't always feel heard by the international community. Paullier, a pediatrician and former director general of Uruguay's National Youth Institute, started in in the job in December. He sat down with The Associated Press on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly this week to talk about his role, the U.N.'s new ' Pact for the Future,' what it means for young people — and whether their elders really mean it about including them. Here are excerpts from the interview, edited for length and clarity. ___ AP: Given the subject, let's start with this: How old are you? PAULLIER: I'm 33. When I started, I was 32. I'm getting old. AP: Your role is very new. PAULLIER: You know, the U.N. has been an organization championing the youth agenda for many, many decades. But in terms of really putting this at the global level and as a priority, I think this is a bit more recent. ...My role is not about representing the youth voices — because young people are too diverse to be represented by one person. But at the same time, I think the office is a testament to the recognition of youth at the global level. I think that’s our role. AP: What did the recent U.N. Summit of the Future and 'Pact for the Future' add to the picture? PAULLIER: I think there are two concrete commitment outcomes of this summit. Now, it’s always about these commitments being put into actions. But one is about governments committing to implement, at the national level, youth engagement mechanisms. And I think that’s a very important and very crucial point. And the second one is, at the global level, this idea of having a process to have common principles about meaningful youth participation. Because this is a relatively new concept. Ten or 15 years ago, you know, young people were just seen as beneficiaries of policies. And now I think the summit, the establishment of the office, there are many things changing that are showing institutions, decision-makers, are saying, 'OK, we need to engage with them as partners.' AP: At a leadup event for the summit, one young activist was quite frank about saying that it’s not just a matter of being invited to attend or speak at events — it's a matter of actually being heard and seeing something come out of it. How do you encourage young people to take the U.N. at its word that it wants to include them in a way that’s meaningful? PAULLIER: You know, I think this is a challenge of every traditional institution. And I'm saying 'traditionally' because our institutions were established in a different world. It’s true that in the last 10 or 15 years, the world has changed dramatically. Technology has brought to people a lot of power, and this is transforming the accountability systems, the way that people can organize themselves, express themselves, mobilize. That's something very positive. But at the same time, institutions need to align to these transformations.... So I think that the summit is essentially the recognition that this needs to be transformed. As an office, our role is that we push for changes for happen. And let's not see this only in the negative way of thinking. I tend to believe that these commitments from governments are a testament that they have willingness to really advance in this direction. AP: Do you feel like the goals of young people who want this change are realistic? PAULLIER: Completely. ___ See more of AP’s coverage of the U.N.

17 people have been killed in 2 mass shootings in the same town in South Africa	JOHANNESBURG (AP) — Seventeen people including 15 women were killed in two mass shootings that took place in close proximity to each other in a rural town in South Africa, police said Saturday. A search was underway for the suspects, national police spokesperson Brig. Athlenda Mathe said in a statement. The victims were 15 women and two men, she said. One other person was in critical condition in the hospital. The shootings took place Friday night in the town of Lusikisiki in Eastern Cape province in southeastern South Africa. Video released by police showed that the shootings occurred at two houses in the same neighborhood, which is a collection of rural homesteads on the outskirts of the town. Twelve women and a man were killed in one house and three women and a man were killed in the other house, police said. 'A manhunt has been launched to apprehend those behind these heinous killings,' Mathe said. Police did not give any details on a possible motive. South Africa has one of the highest homicide rates in the world and mass shootings have become increasingly common in recent years, sometimes targeting people in their homes. Ten members of the same family, seven of them women and one a 13-year-old boy, were killed in a mass shooting at their home in the neighboring KwaZulu-Natal province last April. South Africa's homicide rate is around 45 per 100,000 people, compared to around 6.3 per 100,000 in the United States. Most European countries' homicide rates are around 1 per 100,000 people. South Africa recorded more than 27,000 homicides in the 12 months from March 1, 2023, to Feb. 28, 2024, which is more than 70 a day in the country of 62 million people. Firearm laws are reasonably strict in South Africa, but authorities have often pointed to the large number of illegal, unregistered guns in circulation as a major problem. ___ AP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa	https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-mass-shootings-86e1fe1e481781793c76cc82f65049c7	2024-09-28T02:51:31-07:00	
Flooding in Nepal's capital kills at least 32 people	KATHMANDU, Nepal (AP) — Flooding caused by continuous rainfall has killed at least 32 people in Nepal's capital, and another 12 are missing, police said Saturday. Rains have been pounding since Friday night and are expected to continue over the weekend. Seventeen people were also injured while 1,053 were rescued across Kathmandu, according to Nepal Police spokesman Bishwo Adhikari. He said all police personnel across the nation have been ordered to help in the rescue efforts. The government had issued flood warnings across the Himalayan nation warning of massive rainfall. Buses were banned from traveling at night on highways and cars were discouraged from the roads. Security forces were ordered to high alert. Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak told reporters that there are reports of damage in other parts of the country, too, and officials are still collecting information. 'The government's priority right now is to rescue the people and help those who have been affected,' Lekhak said. Parts of Kathmandu were inundated by the swollen rivers with many houses flooded and residents forced to move to top floors. A huge area on the southern side of the city has been mostly flooded. An army helicopter was used to pick up four people who were unable to leave their houses. Most of Kathmandu was without power and internet for a period of time. There were reports of landslides and flooding in other parts of the country. The monsoon season that bring heavy rainfall began in June and usually ends by mid-September.	https://apnews.com/article/nepal-kathmandu-floods-e19bcf99e5930cc0813809e8a5946769	2024-09-28T00:16:20-07:00	
Russian strikes on a medical center kill 9 people in the Ukrainian city of Sumy	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Two consecutive Russian attacks on a medical center in the northeastern Ukrainian city of Sumy killed at least nine people on Saturday morning, officials said. The first strike killed one person. Russia attacked again while patients and staff were evacuating, said Ukraine’s Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko. Local officials in Sumy said Shahed drones were used in the attack. Twelve other people were wounded, Sumy's City Military administration said. Sumy lies some 20 miles (32 kilometers) from Russia’s Kursk region, where Ukrainian troops have been deployed since Aug. 6 in a bid to divert the Kremlin’s military focus away from the front line in Ukraine. Ukraine’s air force said it shot down 69 of 73 Russian drones launched overnight as well as two of the four missiles. City authorities in Kyiv said around 15 drones had been shot down over the Ukrainian capital and its outskirts. In Kryvyi Rih, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s home city, local officials said Saturday that a man’s body was found under the rubble of an administrative building hit by a Russian missile on Friday, bringing the death toll from that attack to four. In Russia, the Defense Ministry said Saturday that air defenses overnight had shot down four Ukrainian drones over the Belgorod region and one over the Kursk region, both areas bordering Ukraine. One person was killed in Ukrainian shelling of the Russian border city of Shebekino on Saturday, Belgorod regional Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said. Two other people were wounded. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-sumy-drones-a218e9c5650e633490c55c1907889a6a	2024-09-27T23:25:32-07:00	
Hezbollah confirms its leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike	BEIRUT (AP) — Lebanon’s Hezbollah group confirmed on Saturday that its leader and one of its founders, Hassan Nasrallah, was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut the previous day. A statement said Nasrallah 'has joined his fellow martyrs.' Hezbollah vowed to 'continue the holy war against the enemy and in support of Palestine.' Nasrallah, who led Hezbollah for more than three decades, is by far the most powerful target to be killed by Israel in weeks of intensified fighting with Hezbollah. The Israeli military said it carried out a precise airstrike on Friday while Hezbollah leadership were meeting at their headquarters in Dahiyeh, south of Beirut. The Lebanese Health Ministry said six people were killed and 91 injured in the strikes, which leveled six apartment buildings. Ali Karki, the commander of Hezbollah’s Southern Front and other commanders were also killed, the Israeli military said. Iran announced Saturday that a prominent general in its paramilitary Revolutionary Guard sanctioned by the U.S. died in the same airstrike. Abbas Nilforushan, 58, who the U.S. identified as the deputy commander for operations in the Guard, was killed Friday, Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency reported. Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, an army spokesperson, said the airstrike was based on years of tracking Nasrallah along with 'real time information' that made it viable. He declined to say what munitions were used in the strike or provide an estimate on civilian deaths, only saying that Israel takes measures to avoid civilians whenever possible and clears strikes ahead of time with intelligence and legal experts. The Palestinian militant group Hamas in a statement issued condolences to its ally, Hezbollah. Nasrallah frequently described launching rockets against northern Israel as a 'support front' for Hamas and Palestinians in Gaza. 'History has proven that the resistance ... whenever its leaders die as martyrs, will be succeeded on the same path by a generation of leaders who are more valiant, stronger and more determined to continue the confrontation,' the Hamas statement said. It added that 'assassinations will only increase the resistance in Lebanon and Palestine in determination and resolve.' Immediately after the official confirmation from Hezbollah, people starting firing in the air in Beirut and other areas of the country, to mourn Nasrallah's death. Some were protesting that he was killed because of his support for the war in Gaza. 'Wish it was our kids, not you, Sayyid!' said one woman, using an honorific title for Nasrallah, as she clutched her baby in the western city of Baabda. Israel vows to keep up attacks on Hezbollah Israel’s Chief of Staff, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, said Saturday that the elimination of Nasrallah was 'not the end of our toolbox,' indicating that more strikes were planned. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant called it 'the most important targeted strike since the founding of the State of Israel.' Israel has vowed to step up pressure on Hezbollah until it halts its attacks that have displaced tens of thousands of Israelis from communities near the Lebanese border. The recent fighting has also displaced more than 200,000 Lebanese in the past week, according to the United Nations. The military said Saturday it was mobilizing additional reserve soldiers as tensions escalate with Lebanon, activating three battalions of reserve soldiers to serve across the country. It sent two brigades to northern Israel earlier in the week to train for a possible ground invasion. Shoshani, the army spokesperson, said that Israel has inflicted heavy damage on Hezbollah’s capabilities over the past week by targeting a combination of immediate threats and strategic weapons, such as larger, guided missiles. But he said much of Hezbollah’s arsenal still remains intact and that Israel would continue to target the group. The Israeli military updated guidelines for Israeli citizens, canceling gatherings of more than 1,000 people due to the ongoing threat. Approximately 60,000 Israelis have been evacuated from their homes along the Lebanese border for almost a year. Earlier this month, Israel's government said halting Hezbollah’s attacks in the country’s north to allow residents to return to their homes is an official war goal. Iran, Iraq call for support for Hezbollah Iranian state television read the announcement from Hezbollah confirming Nasrallah's death live, but there was no other immediate comment. Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in a Saturday message said 'the resistance movement, heading by Hezbollah, will decide the fate of the region,' in a statement read on state TV. Iran is the main supporter of Lebanese Hezbollah and other militant groups in the region. Also on Saturday, Iran’s influential parliamentary committee of national security demanded 'strong' response to Israel following a meeting of the committee. State TV also said people staged anti-Israeli rallies in support of Hezbollah in major cities and town across the country. Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani of declared a three-day period of mourning in his country. Sudani came to power with the backing of a coalition of Iran-backed political factions, many of which have armed wings that are allied with Hezbollah. A year of hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah Hezbollah started firing rockets on Israel in support of Gaza on Oct. 8, a day after Hamas militants launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing some 1,200 people and abducting another 250. Since then, the two sides have been engaged in cross-border strikes that have gradually escalated and displaced tens of thousands of civilians on both sides of the border. Hostilities escalated dramatically last week when thousands of explosives hidden in pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah detonated, killing dozens of people and leaving thousands, including many civilians, with severe injuries to the eyes, face and limbs. Israel is widely believed to be behind the attack. Israel has also killed several top Hezbollah commanders in Beirut, especially in the past two weeks, in addition to the attack that killed Nasrallah. A window of opportunity for Israel, Lebanon Orna Mizrahi, a senior researcher at the Tel Aviv-based think tank Institute for National Security Studies and former intelligence analyst for the Israeli military and prime minister’s office, noted that Nasrallah was sometimes a 'voice of reason,' interested in engaging Israel in a war of attrition and holding the militant group back from using the full force of their formidable arsenal against Israel. Nasrallah's death could prompt some less senior members of Hezbollah to unleash much stronger weapons than have been used in the nearly yearlong exchange of hostilities between Hezbollah and Lebanon, she said. The biggest question mark right now, though, is how Iran will respond, said Mizrahi. She added that Nasrallah's death could provide a window of opportunity, while the organization is significantly weakened, for Lebanon to dilute Hezbollah’s far-reaching influence, especially in the south, that threatens to drag Lebanon into a full-scale war with Israel. Continuing strikes on both sides of the border On Saturday morning, the Israeli military carried out more than 140 airstrikes in southern Beirut and eastern Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley, including targeting a storage facility for anti-ship missiles in Beirut suburb of Dahiyeh. Israel said the missiles were stored underground beneath civilian apartment buildings. Hezbollah launched dozens of projectiles across northern and central Israel and deep into the Israel-occupied West Bank, damaging some buildings in the northern town of Safed. In Beirut’s southern suburbs, smoke rose and the streets were empty after the area was pummeled overnight by heavy Israeli airstrikes. Shelters set up in the city center for displaced people were overflowing. Many families slept in public squares and beaches or in their cars. On the roads leading to the mountains above the capital, hundreds of people could be seen making an exodus on foot, holding infants and whatever belongings they could carry. A total of 1,030 people — including 156 women and 87 children — have been killed in Israeli strikes in Lebanon in less than two weeks, the country’s health minister said Saturday. ___ Mroue reported from Beirut.

Israel-Hamas war latest: Smoke rises from Beirut’s southern suburbs after a night of Israeli attacks	Smoke rose from Beirut’s southern suburbs Saturday morning and the streets were empty after the area was pummeled overnight by heavy Israeli airstrikes. Attacks on Hezbollah targets by fighter jets Friday continued into the early hours Saturday after the army said it told residents to evacuate three buildings it was targeting. Hours before the strikes, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the United Nations, vowing that Israel’s campaign against Hezbollah would continue — further dimming hopes for an internationally backed cease-fire. Netanyahu abruptly cut his United States visit short and returned to Israel. More than 720 people have been killed in Lebanon since the conflict escalated Monday, according to Lebanon’s health ministry. The United Nations says the number of those displaced by the conflict from southern Lebanon has more than doubled, with more than 211,000 people now displaced. At least 20 primary health care centers have shut down in hard-hit areas of Lebanon, the U.N. Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said. Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel in support of Hamas after it stormed into Israel, sparking the Israel-Hamas war. Top Israeli officials have threatened to repeat the destruction of Gaza in Lebanon if the Hezbollah fire continues, raising fears that Israel’s actions in Gaza since Oct. 7 would be repeated in Lebanon. ___ Here’s the latest: Lebanon asks medical centers to make room for people from hard-hit Beirut suburbs BEIRUT — Patients in hospitals in Beirut’s southern suburbs will be evacuated to medical centers in the capital and the nearby Mount Lebanon region, Lebanon’s Health Ministry says. In a statement carried by state news agency early Saturday, the ministry called on hospitals in Beirut and Mount Lebanon to stop receiving cases that can be delayed in order to receive patients evacuating from the hard-hit southern suburb Dahiyeh. The ministry’s decision came after a night of Israeli airstrikes on Dahiyeh, a predominantly Shiite district. The ministry also called on hospitals and medical centers to care for ill people who fled Dahiyeh overnight as a result of the airstrikes. Israel targets areas around Beirut early Saturday BEIRUT — Smoke rose from Beirut’s southern suburbs Saturday morning and the streets were empty after the area was pummeled overnight by heavy Israeli airstrikes. Explosions rocked Beirut’s southern suburbs, with flames lighting up the pre-dawn darkness. Fire raged from at least one location, and smoke and flames were seen from above Beirut early Saturday. Residents reported jets flying overhead. In a short statement, the Israeli military described the sites it hit as belonging to Hezbollah. Authorities there did not immediately acknowledge if there were any casualties. Shelters set up in the city center for people displaced by the onslaught were overflowing. Many families slept in public squares and beaches, or in their cars. On the roads leading to the mountains above the capital, hundreds of people could be seen making an exodus on foot, holding infants and whatever belongings they could carry. Israel says it killed a Hezbollah missile unit commander and his deputy JERUSALEM — Israel’s military said it killed a Hezbollah missile unit commander and his deputy during a strike in southern Lebanon earlier in the week. Israel Defense Forces said in a statement that its air forces killed Muhammad Ali Ismail, who it said was responsible for directing 'numerous terror attacks' against Israel, including the firing of rockets towards Israeli territory. The Tuesday strike also killed the commander’s deputy, Hussein Ahmad Ismail, it said. There was no immediate confirmation from Hezbollah. 20 health care centers shut down amid escalating violence in Lebanon, UN says BEIRUT — The United Nations said the escalating violence between Israel and Hezbollah has forced at least 20 primary health care centers to shut down in hard-hit areas of Lebanon. The U.N. Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, said in the latest escalation that began earlier in the week, Israeli airstrikes impacted 25 water facilities, affecting access to clean water for nearly 300,000 in high-risk areas. The escalation since Sept. 23 has also more than doubled the number of those displaced by the conflict from southern Lebanon. There are now over 211,000 people displaced, some 85,000 of them now living in public schools and other shelters spread around the country’s north and east. A new phase of escalation began Friday, when Israel targeted Hezbollah’s leader in the southern suburb of Beirut, in one of the largest blasts to hit the Lebanese capital in years. The fate of the group’s leader is still unknown. After the initial strike early Friday evening, Israeli warplanes continued to pound buildings and targets in the southern suburb for over six hours. Smoke and balls of fire covered the Beirut skyline for hours.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-hamas-latest-mideast-28-september-2024-bad4f10c71b1d060a8f98fe13037da20	2024-09-27T21:34:29-07:00	
Europeans, Arab and Muslim nations launch a new initiative for an independent Palestinian state	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — European, Arab and Islamic nations have launched an initiative to strengthen support for a Palestinian state and its institutions, and prepare for a future after the war in Gaza and escalating conflict in Lebanon, Norway’s foreign minister said Friday. Espen Barth Eide told The Associated Press that 'there is a growing consensus in the international community from Western countries, from Arab countries, from the Global South, that we need to establish a Palestinian Authority, a Palestinian government, a Palestinian state — and the Palestinian state has to be recognized.' Eide said many issues need to be addressed, including the security interests of Israel and the Palestinians, recognition and normalization of relations after decades of conflict and the demobilization of Hamas as a military group. 'These are pieces of a bigger puzzle,' Norway’s chief diplomat said. 'And you can’t just come in there with one of these pieces, because it only works if all the pieces are laid in place.' But even if the puzzle is completed, it's unlikely to gain traction with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Still, Eide believes that after decades of failed or stalled negotiations, 'we need to take a new approach' to achieving an independent Palestinian state. To accelerate work on these issues, Eide said almost 90 countries attended a meeting Thursday on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly’s current gathering of world leaders. He and Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister co-chaired the session to launch 'The Global Alliance for the Implementation of a Palestinian State and a Two-State Solution.' 'We have to see how we can come out of this deadlock and try to use this deep crisis also as an opportunity to move forward,' Eide told a U.N. Security Council meeting on Gaza later Friday. Norway is the guarantor of the 1993 Oslo Accords, hailed as a breakthrough in the decades-long conflict between Arabs and Jews, which created the Palestinian Authority and set up self-rule areas in the Palestinian Authority. Eide said more than 30 years later, Israel’s 'occupation' is continuing, and there there are no negotiations leading to a final settlement and an independent Palestinian state — which led to Norway’s decision in May to recognize a Palestinian state. Now, 149 of the U.N.’s 193 member nations have recognized a Palestinian state. Eide urged all countries 'to contribute to universal recognition' and strengthen Palestinian institutions so they live up to the expectations of people in the West Bank and are prepared to return to Gaza: 'We want one Palestine, not different Palestines,' he said. Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al-Saud told the U.N. Security Council on Friday that his country, the joint Islamic-Arab ministerial committee, Norway and the European Union launched the alliance 'because we feel responsible to act to change the reality of the conflict without delay.' EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell urged all countries to take practical measures 'to bring about the free Palestine next to a secure Israel.' Borrell said on X that the first meetings of the alliance would be in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and Brussels. Borrell asked rhetorically of anyone who opposes a two-state solution: What is the solution, and can it be implemented? He stressed that work on this initiative will move ahead quickly. Eide said this new effort is built on the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative, 'but updated to today’s reality.' The 2002 initiative, endorsed by the Arab League and the 57-member Organization of Islamic Cooperation, offered Israel normalized relations in exchange for a full withdrawal from territories captured in 1967. He said efforts started long ago to build the institutions of a Palestinian state. 'It’s difficult,' Eide said. 'Their hands are tied in many ways. We’re seeing an increasing amount of illegal settlements and settle violence.' 'But still, there is an embryonic institution there that we have to strengthen,' he said. Eide said he chaired a meeting Thursday of the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee for the Building of Palestinian Institutions, with the United States, Canada, the EU and many Mideast and European countries contributing. 'None of these tools will solve the problem on their own, and we never pretended that, but we’re trying to build a body of instruments that will take us forward to a peaceful settlement,' Eide said. 'And I am convinced it will happen here.' ___ See more of AP’s coverage of the U.N.

In global game of influence, China turns to a cheap and effective tool: fake news	WASHINGTON (AP) — When veteran U.S. diplomat Kurt Campbell traveled to the Solomon Islands to counter Beijing's influence in the South Pacific country, he quickly saw just how far China would go to spread its message. The Biden administration’s Asia czar woke up one morning in 2022 to a long article in the local press about the U.S. running chemical and biological labs in Ukraine, a claim that Washington calls an outright lie. Started by Russia, the false and incendiary claim was vigorously amplified by China's vast overseas propaganda apparatus. It was another example of 'clearly effective Russian and Chinese disinformation,' Campbell told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in July. Two years later, the claim still reverberates online, demonstrating China's sprawling effort to reshape global perceptions. The campaign, costing many billions per year, is becoming ever more sophisticated thanks to artificial intelligence. China's operations have caught the attention of intelligence analysts and policymakers in Washington, who vow to combat any actions that could influence the November election or undermine American interests. The key tactic: networks of websites purporting to be legitimate news outlets, delivering pro-China coverage that often parallels official statements and positions from Beijing. Shannon Van Sant, an adviser to the Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong Foundation, tracked a network of dozens of sites that posed as news organizations. One site mimicked The New York Times, using a similar font and design in what she called an attempt at legitimacy. The site carried strongly pro-Chinese messages. When Van Sant researched the site's reporters she found no information. Their names didn't belong to any known journalists working in China, and their photos bore telltale signs of being created with AI. 'Manipulation of the media is ultimately a manipulation of readers and the audience, and this is damaging to democracy and society,' Van Sant said. Liu Pengyu, spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in the U.S., said allegations that China uses news websites and social media to spread pro-Beijing information and influence public opinion in the U.S. 'are full of malicious speculations against China, which China firmly opposes.' In addition to its state media, Beijing has turned to foreign players — real or not — to relay messages and lend credibility to narratives favoring the Communist Party, said Xiao Qiang, a research scientist at the School of Information at the University of California, Berkeley. Xiao also is editor-in-chief of China Digital Times, a bilingual news website that aggregates information from and about China. Beijing's methods are wide-ranging and links to the government are often difficult to prove, Xiao said. But whether it's journalists with American-sounding names or an Indian influencer, the consistently pro-Beijing messages give them away. 'The implicit message is the same — that the Chinese Communist Party works for its people,' Xiao said. Analysts at the cybersecurity firm Logically identified 1,200 websites that had carried Russian or Chinese state media stories. The sites often target specific audiences and have names that sound like traditional news organizations or defunct newspapers. Unlike Russia or Iran, which have displayed clear preferences in the U.S. presidential campaign, Beijing is more cautious and focused on spreading positive content about China. While the sites aren't owned by China, they run Chinese content. When Logically looked at content specifically about the U.S. election, 20% could be traced back to Chinese or Russian state media. 'There's a decent likelihood that these articles could influence U.S. audiences without them even knowing where it comes from,' said Alex Nelson, Logically's senior manager for strategy and analysis. According to the Gallup World Poll, more countries surveyed view the U.S. positively, but the share of countries where views of both the U.S. and China are negative overall is higher than 15 years ago, signaling the U.S. doesn’t appear to be making gains over China. Some U.S. officials want to increase spending to even the playing field. The House of Representatives this month approved a bill that would authorize $325 million annually through 2027 to counter China’s global influence, including its disinformation campaigns. The measure still needs Senate approval. 'We are in a global competition for influence with China, and if you want to win it, then you cannot do it on a middle-power budget,' said Rep. Gregory Meeks, a Democrat from New York. Chinese President Xi Jinping has demanded a systematic buildup of Chinese narratives that would give his country a global voice 'commensurate with' its international stature. Beijing has invested in state media such as the Xinhua news agency and China Central Television to convey its messages to global audiences in various languages and platforms. Media groups at the local level are creating 'international communication centers' to build an overseas presence with websites, news channels and social media accounts. Beijing also has struck media partnerships worldwide, and the article Campbell read in the Solomon Islands is likely a result of those. China’s outreach is tied to the global race for economic dominance in electric vehicles, computer chips, AI and quantum computing, said Jaret Riddick, a senior fellow at Georgetown University's Center for Security and Emerging Technology. 'The countries that lead on emerging technologies will be the countries that have a great advantage going forward,' Riddick said. To tell its story, Beijing has not shied away from using fake personas. A 2023 State Department report detailed the case of a published writer named Yi Fan, originally described as a Chinese foreign ministry analyst. Yi morphed into a journalist, then became an independent analyst. Yi's details changed, but the message did not. Through published commentaries and writings, Yi trumpeted close ties between China and Africa, praised Beijing’s approach to environmental sustainability and argued that China must counter distorted Western narratives. Then there was Wilson Edwards, a supposed Swiss virologist quoted in Chinese media as a COVID-19 expert who criticized the U.S. response. But Swiss officials found no evidence he existed. 'If you exist, we would like to meet you!' the Swiss Embassy in Beijing wrote on social media. ___ AP writer Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux contributed from Washington.	https://apnews.com/article/china-disinformation-fake-news-russia-3085f10d6edca36f6415d6410e5ef874	2024-09-27T19:13:24-07:00	
Money Gambians send home from Europe is a lifeline for their families but the sacrifices take a toll	KWINELLA, Gambia (AP) — Binta Bah met her husband last year on a dating app and instantly fell in love. They spent hours every day glued to their mobile phones and soon got married on a video call. But they've met in person only once, when Suleyman Bah came home to Gambia for a visit, months after the wedding. He is one of tens of thousands of West Africans who have undertaken the perilous journey to Europe, and is now working in a factory in Germany. Every month he sends money home. He is not alone — Gambians abroad send hundreds of millions of dollars a year in remittances, according to the World Bank. The remittances account for a fourth of the tiny country's economy — the highest such proportion on the African continent. Even as European countries increase their efforts to keep migrants out, Gambians and other West Africans keep risking the dangerous route, known locally as 'the backway,' in unsafe boats across the Atlantic Ocean — or trek hundreds of miles across the Sahara Desert and then cross the Mediterranean Sea. Almost 10% of Gambia’s population of 2.7 million has left the country, most of them young men from rural areas. The money they send is an economic lifeline for their families but their absence weighs heavily on their communities. 'It’s difficult to be apart,' the 24-year-old Binta Bah said of her long-distance marriage. 'But it’s good when the other person takes care of you.' 'Whenever I need something, like to see a doctor, he sends the money straight away,' added Bah, who lives with her mother-in-law. Life is increasingly difficult in their village of Kwinella, where villagers for centuries grew rice, maize, millet and peanuts to make a living. But ravages of climate change and outdated farming practices have made their traditional lifestyle unsustainable. Moustapha Sabally, deputy chief of Kiang Central province, which includes Kwinella, said the rains have become unpredictable for farming, which is still done by hand and without tractors. Few young men are around to do that work, he said, and estimated that about 70% of them left the province for the capital, Banjul, or for Europe. That leaves women and older people who struggle with the long and laborious work on the land, forcing the community to depend on remittances, Sabally said. Without the remittances, 'life would be very difficult,' he said. Gambia, the smallest country on the African mainland, is surrounded by Senegal except for a sliver of the coast where the Gambia River flows into the Atlantic Ocean. According to the World Bank, 75% of its population lives in poverty and there is virtually no industry. The economy relies on imports, and living costs have skyrocketed since the coronavirus pandemic. Nearly 60% of Gambians are under 25, and nearly half of them are unemployed. Despite European Union's efforts in West Africa to reduce the number of migrants, the lack of jobs reinforces the conviction of many that leaving is their only option. Last year alone, over 8,000 Gambians arrived in Europe, according to the International Organization for Migration. Many others die trying. Earlier this year, a boat carrying 300 migrants, mostly from Gambia and Senegal, capsized off Mauritania; more than a dozen were killed and at least 150 others went missing. Last year, a young man from Kwinella drowned on his way to Europe. Because the journey is so risky, most young men slip away for Europe without letting their loved ones know they're leaving. Musukebbe Manjang's 39-year-old husband left Kwinella for Italy 10 years ago, after he could no longer make enough money from construction work. She never encouraged him to leave, 'the risk was just too high,' she said. One evening, when Manjang was pregnant with their third child, her husband's younger brother called him from Italy, and he simply disappeared without a word. He later called to say he had left for Europe. Then she heard nothing for nine months, and her anger turning to fear. When he finally arrived in Italy, he called and explained that he had been kidnapped in Libya, long a key starting point for many Mediterranean crossings to Europe. These days, Manjang's husband sends around 14,000 dalasi, or $200, a month, enough to cover the children's school fees, food and clothes, she said. But on a personal level, it's been difficult. 'He misses all the important moments,' she said. 'He hasn't even met our youngest daughter.' Gambia's central bank says remittances amounted to over $730 million last year but experts warn that the rising costs of living will push more men to migrate abroad. Eliman Jallow, 42, the Gambia-born founder of a U.K.-based company that facilitates sending money home to Africa, says his clients are a mix, from highly skilled workers to manual laborers. The son of Ansumana Sanneh from Kaiaf, a village not far from Kwinella, was a teacher. He left for Europe because he could barely make a living on a teacher's monthly salary of 5,000 dalassi, about $70. His journey was cut short when he was kidnapped by a Libyan militia and Sanneh paid the equivalent of $700 in ransom before his son was freed and returned home. Sanneh believes the dreams of the young village men are fueled by the misguided idea of Europe as a promised land. But with rising costs of living in European countries, migrants today are able to send less money home than in the past, he said. The gamble is simply not worth the risks, Sanneh said. But stories of success journeys and evidence of what remittances can do often outweigh such words of caution — large concrete village homes built with money sent back are solid; images posted on social media by migrants who work in Europe appeal to the young men still in the village. Despite his ordeal, Sanneh's son hopes to find a way to leave Gambia again. Not far from their home, a group of teenagers practiced a dance routine in front of a stylish brick house, its driveway lined with spotless pink tiles. The teens were recording a video for TikTok, they said, and chose the prettiest — and largest — village house for the background. The house, they said, belongs to a family whose young man migrated to the United States, for many, the most coveted migrant destination. ___ For more news on Africa and development: https://apnews.com/hub/africa-pulse ___ The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

What to know from the UN: Netanyahu says no cease-fire, but other countries keep asking	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — After a day filled with hopes of a cease-fire between Lebanon and Israel, the U.N. General Assembly meeting Friday was a harsh reality check. Israeli Prime Minister BENJAMIN NETANYAHU shut down the idea in a morning speech that he said he didn't initially intend to make. He said he had not planned to come to the meeting this year, because his country is at war, but 'after I heard the lies and slanders leveled at my country by many of the speakers at this podium, I decided to come here and set the record straight.' The week has been full of speakers calling for a cease-fire in both Lebanon and Gaza, continuing into Friday. But Netanyahu wasn't swayed. He said his nation will 'continue degrading Hezbollah' until achieving its goals along the Lebanon border, and would no longer tolerate daily rocket fire from the area. Shortly after Netanyahu wrapped up his speech, the Israeli military said it carried out a strike on Hezbollah’s headquarters in Beirut, which caused huge blasts in the city. Here’s your daily guide to what’s going on at the United Nations this week: From the podium MORE ANTI-WAR: Calls for Israel to stop its war in Gaza and back off from a growing conflict in Lebanon continued. The two speakers who preceded Netanyahu each made a point of calling out Israel for its actions. 'Mr. Netanyahu, stop this war now,' Slovenian Prime Minister ROBERT GOLOB said as he closed his remarks, pounding the podium. And Pakistani Prime Minister SHEHBAZ SHARIF, speaking just before the Israeli leader, declared of Gaza: 'This is not just a conflict. This is systematic slaughter of innocent people of Palestine.' He thumped the rostrum to audible applause. PROMISE FOR DEMOCRACY: Tanzania Prime Minister KASSIM MAJALIWA pledged that his country will uphold democracy and human rights ahead of next year’s presidential election. An opposition party official was killed in early September and two main opposition leaders were arrested among a dozen other opposition politicians while planning a youth rally and during protests against recent killing and arrest of opposition officials and members. President SAMIA SULUHU has condemned the killing of the opposition official Ali Kibao and promised justice. She’s serving out the term of the late President JOHN MAGUFULI, whose autocratic rule saw the ban on political rallies and detention of opposition leaders. POETRY IN POLICY: As Pakistan tries to climb out of an economic crisis, Sharif turned Friday to poetry to convey his country’s resolve. Addressing world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly, he read aloud part of 'Keep Going,' a 1921 piece by American poet Edgar A. Guest. It begins 'When things go wrong, as they sometimes will' — when, for example, 'the funds are low and the debts are high.' (Sharif substituted 'credits' for 'funds.') Pakistan’s debts are indeed substantial. The International Monetary Fund this week approved a $7 billion loan for the nation, which plunged into one of the worst economic crises in its history after flooding in 2022. Sharif's government raised electricity prices, saying the hike was necessary to meet conditions of the new loan. The increase spurred protests and a merchants’ strike. Sharif told the assembly that his government has 'taken some very difficult but necessary decisions that have rescued our economy from collapse.' Then he brought up the poem, saying it had bucked him up. He went through a stanza that ends: 'When care is pressing you down a bit, / Rest if you must, but don’t you quit.' 'This,' Sharif told the assembly, 'is how we have learned to face our challenges and negotiate the most daunting challenges that we have faced.' CUBA COMMENTS: For decades Cuba’s primary foreign-policy priority has been ending the U.S. trade embargo on the island. The country dedicates much of its General Assembly diplomacy to getting leaders to decry the embargo. According to Cuba’s U.N. mission, by 3:41 p.m. on Friday 25 countries had addressed the embargo at this year’s UNGA and 11 leaders had critiqued the U.S. inclusion of Cuba on the list of countries that sponsor terrorism, another sanction limiting international trade. Many of the countries that spoke have benefitted from another of Cuba’s trademark programs, sending its well-trained and highly educated doctors to developing countries across the world. Right after mentioning Ukraine and Gaza, Prime Minister ALLAH MAYE HALINA of Chad told the world that 'we can’t ignore the embargo on Cuba, which hurts its people and hinders its development.' On the sidelines Norwegian Foreign Minister ESPEN BARTH EIDE, who was in the General Assembly hall listening to Netanyahu, called his address 'a rather dark speech' that was 'very defiant.' Norway recognized the State of Palestine in May. Eide said there are many countries that would like to support Israel and normalize relations, including Saudi Arabia and others in region, 'but they are not able to do that as long as the Palestinian question remains unanswered.' FUNDRAISERS, ADVOCATES: As the meeting of world leaders unfolds at the United Nations, a crush of events unfold on the sidelines of the official high-level meetings, where nonprofits, advocates and fundraisers mingle and lobby world leaders, billionaires and funders — and plan their next steps with each other. A few examples: On Sunday, throngs of people streamed through a 'climate science fair ' showcasing work on nature, food and the energy transition, held across Manhattan on an elevated park that runs along old rail lines. On Monday, the BILL &amp; MELINDA GATES Foundation held a ceremony featuring Grammy-winning musician JON BATISTE performing in a gold sequin suit, and honoring Brazilian PRESIDENT LUIZ INÁCIO LULA DA SILVA for his work lifting millions out of poverty and significantly reducing malnutrition among children. Climate moment Papua New Guinea's prime minister, JAMES MARAPE, told the General Assembly that accessing money to fight climate change has been a challenge.

Charismatic and shrewd: A look at longtime Hezbollah leader Hassan Narallah	BEIRUT (AP) — Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has led the Lebanese militant group for the past three decades and transformed it into one of the most powerful paramilitary groups in the Middle East. Israeli airstrikes on Friday afternoon knocked out six buildings in Beirut’s southern suburb of Harek Hreik, the largest strike in the Lebanese capital in nearly a year of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. The Israeli military said the strike, which killed and wounded dozens of people, hit the headquarters of Hezbollah in Beirut. Three major Israeli TV channels said Nasrallah was the target of the strikes in Beirut’s southern suburbs, which has not been officially confirmed by Israel. Hezbollah officials did not comment. Here's a look at the fiery, charismatic leader: Who is Hassan Nasrallah? Under the leadership of the 64-year-old Nasrallah, Hezbollah has fought wars against Israel and taken part in the conflict in neighboring Syria, helping tip the balance of power in favor of President Bashar Assad. A charismatic and shrewd strategist, Nasrallah reshaped Hezbollah into an archenemy of Israel, cementing alliances with Shiite religious leaders in Iran and Palestinian militant groups such as Hamas. Idolized by his Lebanese Shiite followers and respected by millions of others across the Arab and Islamic world, Nasrallah holds the title of sayyid, an honorific meant to signify the Shiite cleric’s lineage dating back to the Prophet Muhammad, the founder of Islam. A fiery orator viewed as an extremist in the U.S. and much of the West, he is also considered a pragmatist compared to the firebrand militants who dominated Hezbollah after its founding in 1982, during Lebanon’s civil war. Despite the power he wields, Nasrallah has lived largely in hiding in the past years for fear of an Israeli assassination. How he rose to power Born in 1960 into a poor Shiite family in Beirut’s impoverished northern suburb of Sharshabouk, Nasrallah was later displaced to south Lebanon. He studied theology and joined the Amal movement, a Shiite political and paramilitary organization, before becoming one of Hezbollah’s founders. Hezbollah was formed by Iranian Revolutionary Guard members who came to Lebanon in the summer of 1982 to fight invading Israeli forces. It was the first group that Iran backed and used as a way to export its brand of political Islam. Nasrallah built a power base as Hezbollah over time became part of a cluster of Iranian-backed factions and governments known as the Axis of Resistance. Two days after its leader, 39-year-old Sayyed Abbas Musawi, was killed in an Israeli helicopter gunship raid in south Lebanon, Hezbollah chose Nasrallah as its secretary-general in February 1992. Five years later, the United States designated Hezbollah a terrorist organization. Under Nasrallah, Hezbollah was credited with leading the war of attrition that led to the withdrawal of Israeli troops from south Lebanon in 2000, after an 18-year occupation. Nasrallah’s eldest son, Hadi, was killed in 1997, fighting against Israeli forces. After Israel’s withdrawal from southern Lebanon in 2000, Nasrallah rose to iconic status both within Lebanon and throughout the Arab world. His messages were beamed on Hezbollah’s own radio and satellite TV station. That status was further cemented when, in 2006, Hezbollah fought Israel to a stalemate during the 34-day war. When Syria’s civil war erupted in 2011, Hezbollah fighters rushed in, siding with Assad’s forces — even though Hezbollah’s popularity took a dive as the Arab world ostracized Assad. His role in the current conflict A day after the Israel-Hamas war started on Oct. 7, Hezbollah began attacking Israeli military posts along the border calling it a 'backup front' for Gaza. In speeches throughout the conflict, he has argued that Hezbollah’s cross-border strikes had pulled away Israeli forces that would otherwise be focused on Hamas in Gaza and insisted that Hezbollah would not halt its attacks on Israel until a cease-fire is reached in Gaza. Over the past weeks, he continued to strike a defiant tone as tension rose dramatically, with Israel announcing a new phase in the conflict intended to push Hezbollah back from the border to allow thousands displaced from northern Israel to return. It launched strikes killing top military commanders with the group and was blamed for the explosion of thousands of communications devices, mainly used by Hezbollah members, that killed 37 people and wounded thousands.	https://apnews.com/article/hezbollah-nasrallah-lebanon-israel-airstrikes-haret-hreik-7d89051bb420991cee29398243c250fe	2024-09-27T13:10:40-07:00	
Wrapping up mission, US troops will leave some longstanding bases in Iraq under new deal	WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. announced an agreement with the Iraqi government Friday to wrap up the military mission in Iraq of an American-led coalition fighting the Islamic State group by next year, with U.S. troops departing some bases that they have long occupied during a two-decade-long military presence in the country. But the Biden administration refused to provide details on how many of the approximately 2,500 U.S. troops still serving in Iraq will remain there or acknowledge it will mark a full withdrawal from the country. 'I think it’s fair to say that, you know, our footprint is going to be changing within the country,' Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters Friday without providing specifics. The announcement comes at a particularly contentious time for the Middle East, with escalating conflict between Israel and two Iranian-backed militant groups — Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza — threatening a broader regional war. Bases housing U.S. forces and contractors have been regularly targeted by Iran-backed militias over the last several years, and those attacks intensified late last year and early this spring after the Israel-Hamas war broke out nearly a year ago. For years, Iraqi officials have periodically called for a withdrawal of coalition forces, and formal talks to wind down the U.S. presence in the country have been going on for months. U.S. officials who briefed reporters Friday said the agreement will bring about a two-phase transition in the troops assigned to Iraq that began this month. In the first phase, which runs through September 2025, the coalition mission against ISIS will end and forces will leave some longstanding bases. Following the November election, American forces will start departing from Ain al-Asad airbase in western Iraq and from Baghdad International Airport, according to Iraqi government officials who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity. Those forces will be moved to Hareer base in Erbil, in northern Iraq's Kurdistan region. In the second phase, the U.S. will continue to operate in some fashion from Iraq through 2026 to support counter-ISIS operations in Syria, a senior Biden administration official and a senior defense official said on the condition of anonymity on a call with reporters to provide details ahead of the announcement. Ultimately, the U.S. military mission would transition to a bilateral security relationship, the U.S. officials said, but they did not indicate what that might mean for the number of American troops who remain in Iraq in the future. The Iraqi officials said some American troops may stay at Hareer base after 2026 because the Kurdistan regional government would like them to stay. 'We have taken an important step in resolving the issue of the international coalition to fight ISIS,' Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed al-Sudani said in a speech this month. He noted 'the government’s belief in the capabilities of our security forces that defeated the remnants of ISIS.' The continued presence of U.S. troops has been a political vulnerability for Sudani, whose government is under increased influence from Iran. Iraq has long struggled to balance its ties with the U.S. and Iran, both allies of the Iraqi government but regional archenemies. 'We thank the government for its position to expel the international coalition forces,' Qais Khazali, founder of Asaib Ahl al-Haq — an Iran-backed Iraqi Shia militia that has conducted attacks against U.S. forces in Iraq — said last week. But critics caution that this year’s surge of ISIS attacks in Syria across the desert border from Iraq suggest the drawdown in Iraq is a 'really significant cause for concern,' said Charles Lister, a senior fellow with the Middle East Institute research center in Washington. The U.S. withdrawal from Iraq isn’t because ISIS has disappeared, Lister said. 'The withdrawal is because there’s a significant proportion of the policy-making community in Baghdad that doesn’t want American troops on Iraqi soil.' The agreement marks the third time in the last two decades that the U.S. has announced a formal transition of the military's role there. The U.S. invaded Iraq in March 2003 in what it called a massive 'shock and awe' bombing campaign that lit up the skies, laid waste to large sections of the country and paved the way for American ground troops to converge on Baghdad. The invasion was based on what turned out to be faulty claims that Saddam Hussein had secretly stashed weapons of mass destruction. Such weapons never materialized. The U.S. presence grew to more than 170,000 troops at the peak of counterinsurgency operations in 2007. The Obama administration negotiated the drawdown of forces, and in December 2011, the final combat troops departed, leaving only a small number of military personnel behind to staff an office of security assistance and a detachment of Marines to guard the embassy compound. In 2014, the rise of the Islamic State group and its rapid capture of a wide swath across Iraq and Syria brought U.S. and partner nation forces back at the invitation of the Iraqi government to help rebuild and retrain police and military units that had fallen apart and fled. After ISIS lost its hold on the territory it once claimed, coalition military operations ended in 2021. An enduring U.S. presence of about 2,500 troops stayed in Iraq to maintain training and conduct partnered counter-ISIS operations with Iraq's military. In the years since, the U.S. has maintained that presence to pressure Iranian-backed militias active in Iraq and Syria. The presence of American forces in Iraq also makes it more difficult for Iran to move weapons across Iraq and Syria into Lebanon, for use by its proxies, including the Lebanese Hezbollah, against Israel. —- AP writer Ellen Knickmeyer contributed from Washington.	https://apnews.com/article/iraq-us-troops-military-withdrawal-iran-a79aa83dca8f776f87a138bfe5697fa3	2024-09-27T10:16:34-07:00	
At the UN, young people push to make sure the generational shift is faster — and more substantial	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — They were sharing the world stage to discuss a plan to give young people more input in decisions that shape lives. And 26-year-old Daphne Frias, talking to the head of the United Nations, had thoughts. 'Truly, it’s time for the people who do so much of the talking to do less of the talking,' the disability and climate activist told Secretary-General António Guterres. 'And to have the voices of my generation ... lead.' Their exchange this month, at a leadup event to the U.N. General Assembly's meeting of nations' leaders, was a measure of diplomacy's generation gap. A big young cohort is coming of age in a troubled world, and it's coming with ideas about inclusion, participation and authority. Those ideas are nudging the hierarchical, bureaucratic ways of an international order set up when their grandparents were kids or not even born. 'My generation messed up when it comes to the world today,' the 75-year-old U.N. chief told Frias and an audience of activists and others in the vast, coolly elegant assembly hall. The world needs a new generation that understands 'we are living to disaster' and can turn it around, Guterres said, adding emphatically: 'We cannot do that if your generation is not part of the decision-making process that is still controlled by my generation that messed up.' Passing the torch can be difficult But how to make that change in a global system and governments largely run by older people, and a United Nations that has tried to engage the young but still has some procedures, protocol — and even architecture — reflecting what was 'modern' more than seven decades ago? Does the U.N. matter, anyway, to a social-network-native generation with its own means of connecting and organizing across borders, and with a sense of urgency that chafes at the pace of intergovernmental accords? Marinel Sumook Ubaldo, a 27-year-old Filipina climate activist, has been involved in U.N. conferences and believes the world body can be a valuable platform for advocacy. But so can grassroots organizing and building public pressure outside big organizations, Ubaldo says. 'If the U.N. can shift from symbolic inclusion to truly empowering youth with decision-making authority and accountability mechanisms, I would say it would remain relevant,' she said. 'But if not, young people will continue to forge new paths.' Over 1.9 billion people — nearly a quarter of the world population — are between ages 10 and 24. But young people are sparse in the corridors of power. Under 3% of members of national legislatures are under 30, according to the Inter-Parliamentary Union, a global group of such bodies. Of course, today's young activists aren't the first to worry about the world they're inheriting, to yearn to be heard or to feel they can't wait patiently for the creaky wheels of change to turn. But this generation has been steeped in a particular brew of risks and crises: post-9/11 wars and security culture, a financial meltdown, a pandemic, billions of people living in conflict zones, a planet that's warming at the fastest rate ever measured. And, with the rise of social media, the generation's ideas about solutions to such challenges move around faster than ever before. As Frias puts it, 'we don’t have time for dues to be paid' to try to influence things. 'We constantly get told that we are inspirational, that we’re doing a great job, that we are the future,' Frias, an American-born daughter of Dominican immigrants, said in an interview. 'But inspiration doesn’t change the world. Action does.' There's growing momentum — to a point Over the years, the U.N. has made various overtures to young people. An assistant secretary-general for youth affairs, Felipe Paullier, was tapped last year. There had previously been a lower-level youth envoy. A roster of youth delegates, advisory groups and more have taken part in U.N. activities over the decades. Some have attracted considerable attention, including speeches by Afghan girls' education advocate and Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai, climate activist Greta Thunberg and K-pop stars BTS. A 2018 initiative called 'Youth 2030' is meant to make young people 'full-fledged partners' in the U.N.’s work. A recent update said progress has been 'steady but slower than desired.' Now comes the ' Pact for the Future,' a wide-ranging document approved Sunday at a summit that kicked off this year’s big General Assembly gathering. The pact includes pledges to spend more on youth services, to create jobs and to promote 'meaningful youth participation' in national policymaking and U.N. processes. That might sound bland to the casual observer. But through a U.N. lens, devoting a chapter to youth and future generations in a laboriously negotiated global blueprint — and getting 193 nations to sign off — elevates and enshrines youths as a priority. 'Ten or 15 years ago, you know, young people were just seen as beneficiaries of policies,' Paullier, 33, said in an interview. 'There are many things changing that are showing institutions, decision-makers, are saying, 'OK, we need to engage with them as partners.'' There's still far to go, he notes. Participation must actually be meaningful Nudhara Yusuf, who co-chaired a civil society conference that helped prepare for the recent summit, says the U.N. has made 'a real turn' toward engaging young people. Now it's a question of making promises of 'meaningful' participation ... meaningful. 'How do you go beyond just putting someone on a panel? How do you ensure that they’re part of the dialogue offstage, as well?' asks Yusuf, 25. Born in Britain and raised in India, she's a researcher at the Stimson Center think tank in Washington. Young activists also may lack the resources to move in international circles when it entails far-flung travel. While many have started organizations and done fundraising, some say it's hard getting past a 'youth organization' rubric to tap bigger pools of grants, despite working on broader issues. Amani Joel Mafigi, who co-founded an entrepreneurship organization in Uganda, thinks the U.N. should establish a youth empowerment fund to back climate, social justice and innovation initiatives. The 27-year-old offered that suggestion to the secretary-general at the same event with Frias. In an interview, Mafigi added that he'd want young 'changemakers' to be central to structuring such a fund and steering its work. 'I have seen how much young people with little resources can do and can achieve within a minimum period of time, with less bureaucratic processes,' said Mafigi, who fled Congo as a refugee in 2008. Guterres told him, Frias and others in the assembly hall that the U.N. aims to add more young staffers and to give youths a voice 'when things are being decided, not when things have been decided.' 'But, I mean, let’s be clear: Power is never given. Power is taken,' Guterres said. 'So I encourage young people not to be afraid to fight for their rights.' ___ See more of AP’s coverage of the U.N.

Iranian operatives charged in the US with hacking Donald Trump's presidential campaign	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department unsealed criminal charges Friday against three Iranian operatives suspected of hacking Donald Trump's presidential campaign and disseminating stolen information to media organizations. The three accused hackers were employed by Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard and their operation also targeted a broad swath of targets, including government officials, members of the media and non-governmental organizations, the Justice Department said. The Trump campaign disclosed on Aug. 10 that it had been hacked and said Iranian actors had stolen and distributed sensitive internal documents. Multiple major news organizations that said they were leaked confidential information from inside the Trump campaign, including Politico, The New York Times and The Washington Post, declined to publish it. U.S. intelligence officials subsequently linked Iran to a hack of the Trump campaign and to an attempted breach of the Joe Biden-Kamala Harris campaign. They said the hack-and-dump operation was meant to sow discord, exploit divisions within American society and potentially influence the outcome of elections that Iran perceives to be 'particularly consequential in terms of the impact they could have on its national security interests.' Last week, officials also revealed that the Iranians in late June and early July sent unsolicited emails containing excerpts of the hacked information to people associated with the Biden campaign. None of the recipients replied. The Harris campaign said the emails resembled spam or a phishing attempt and condemned the outreach to the Iranians as 'unwelcome and unacceptable malicious activity.' The indictment comes at a time of heightened tensions between Washington and Tehran as Iran-backed Hezbollah and Israel escalate attacks against each other, raising concerns about the prospect of an all-out war, and as U.S. officials say they continue to track physical threats by Iran against a number of officials including Trump.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-hacking-iran-justice-department-1d7d83ccdc6c879be2802142f1c47191	2024-09-27T07:24:43-07:00	
Israel says it struck Hezbollah's headquarters in huge explosion that shakes Lebanese capital	BEIRUT (AP) — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office says the Israeli leader is cutting short a visit to the U.S. and returning home. The office made the announcement shortly after a massive Israeli airstrike on Hezbollah’s headquarters in Beirut. Netanyahu, in New York to address the United Nations, had been scheduled to stay in the U.S. until Saturday night, after the end of the Jewish sabbath. Israeli politicians do not normally travel on the sabbath except for matters of great import. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below. BEIRUT (AP) — The Israeli military said Friday it struck the central headquarters of Hezbollah in Beirut, where a series of massive explosions leveled multiple buildings, sending clouds of orange and black smoke billowing in the skies. The strikes in the suburbs south of Lebanon's capital came shortly after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the U.N., vowing that Israel's campaign against Hezbollah would continue. His comments further dimmed hopes for an internationally backed cease-fire aimed at preventing a spiral into all-out war. Three major Israeli TV channels said Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was the target of the strikes. But the unsourced reports could not immediately be confirmed by The Associated Press, and the army declined comment. But given the size and timing of the blasts, there were strong indications that a high-value target may have been inside the buildings struck. To a degree unseen in past conflicts, Israel this past week has aimed to eliminate Hezbollah’s senior leadership. In another sign of the strike's importance, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant’s office said he was huddled with the head of Israel’s air force and other top commanders at military headquarters, following updates. Friday's bombings were the most powerful yet seen in the Lebanese capital the past year. Israeli army spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said the strikes targeted the main Hezbollah headquarters, located beneath residential buildings. Four buildings in the Haret Hreik neighborhood of Dahiyeh were reduced to rubble, Hezbollah’s Al-Manar TV reported. The blast rattled windows and shook houses some 30 kilometers (18 miles) north of Beirut. Ambulances were seen headed to the scene, sirens wailing. Officials at a nearby hospital said they received at least 10 wounded, three critically including a Syrian child. Israel dramatically intensified its airstrikes in Lebanon this week, saying it is determined to put an end to more than 11 months of Hezbollah fire into its territory. The scope of Israel’s operation remains unclear, but officials have said a ground invasion to push the militant group away from the border is a possibility. Israel has moved thousands of troops toward the border in preparation. At least 25 people were killed in Israeli strikes early Friday, Health Minister Firass Abiad said, bringing the death toll in Lebanon this week to more than 720. He said the dead included dozens of women and children. A predawn strike Friday in the mainly Sunni border town of Chebaa hit a home, killing nine members of the same family, the state news agency said. A resident identified the dead as Hussein Zahra, his wife Ratiba, their five children and two of their grandchildren. At the U.N., Netanyahu vowed to 'continue degrading Hezbollah' until Israel achieves its goals. Netanyahu’s comments have damped hopes for a U.S.-backed call for a 21-day truce between Israel and Hezbollah to allow time for a diplomatic solution. Hezbollah has not responded to the proposal. Iranian-backed Hezbollah, the strongest armed force in Lebanon, began firing rockets into Israel almost immediately after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack, saying it was a show of support for the Palestinians. Since then, it and the Israeli military have traded fire almost daily, forcing tens of thousands of people to flee their homes on both sides of the border. An Israeli security official said he expects a possible war against Hezbollah would not last for as long as the current war in Gaza, because the Israeli military’s goals are much narrower. In Gaza, Israel has vowed to dismantle Hamas’ military and political regime, but the goal in Lebanon is just to push Hezbollah away from the border with Israel -- 'not a high bar like Gaza' in terms of operational objectives, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to military briefing guidelines. The Israeli military said it carried out dozens of strikes over the course of two hours around the south on Friday, including in the cities of Sidon and Nabatiyeh. It said it was targeting Hezbollah rocket launchers and infrastructure. It said Hezbollah fired a volley of rockets toward the northern Israeli city of Tiberias. In the southern Lebanese city of Tyre, civil defense workers pulled the bodies of two women – 35-year-old Hiba Ataya and her mother Sabah Olyan – from the rubble of a building brought down by a strike. 'That’s Sabah, these are her clothes, my love,' one man cried out as her body emerged. Israel says its accelerated strikes this week have already inflicted heavy damage on Hezbollah’s weapons capabilities – and a string of its top commanders have been assassinated in strikes. Officials have suggested its limited fire of missile and rockets the past week show it has been set back. But the group boasted a large arsenal of rockets and missiles and its remaining capacities remain unknown. Hezbollah officials and their supporters remain defiant. Not long before the explosions Friday evening, thousands were massed in another part of Beirut’s suburbs for the funeral of three Hezbollah members killed in earlier strikes, including the head of the group’s drone unit, Mohammed Surour. Men and women in the giant crowd waved their fists in the air and chanted, 'We will never accept humiliation' as they marched marched behind the three coffins, wrapped in the group's yellow flag. Hussein Fadlallah, head of Hezbollah in Beirut, said in a speech that no matter how many commanders Israel kills, the group has endless numbers of experience fighters who are deployed all over the front lines. Fadlallah vowed that Hezbollah will keep fighting until Israel stops its offensive in Gaza. 'We will not abandon the support of Palestine, Jerusalem and oppressed Gaza,' Fadlallah said. 'There is no place for neutrality in this battle.'	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-hezbollah-airstrikes-suburb-617575d9c5d7c711bc02e7b81d2ba4ad	2024-09-27T06:34:31-07:00

Netanyahu, at UN, vows that Israel will keep 'degrading Hezbollah' until its objectives are met	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — His leadership strained by conflicts on two fronts, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told world leaders at the United Nations on Friday that his nation will 'continue degrading Hezbollah' until achieving its goals along the Lebanon border, further dimming hopes for an internationally backed cease-fire to halt the spiral into an all-out regional war. He said his government would no longer tolerate daily rocket fire from the area. Shortly after Netanyahu wrapped up his speech, the Israeli military said it carried out a strike on Hezbollah's headquarters in Beirut, which caused huge blasts in the city. 'Israel has every right to remove this threat and return our citizens to their home safely. And that’s exactly what we’re doing ... we’ll continue degrading Hezbollah until all our objectives are met,' Netanyahu said to a gallery that — at least from the crowd noise — appeared replete with his supporters. 'Just imagine if terrorists turned El Paso and San Diego into ghost towns ... How long would the American government tolerate that?' he said, shaking his fist in emphasis. 'Yet Israel has been tolerating this intolerable situation for almost a year. Well, I’ve come here today to say: Enough is enough.' Netanyahu, armed with visual aids as he has been in the past, defended his nation's response to the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks by Hamas on Israel that triggered an Israeli military operation that has devastated the Gaza Strip. He said he traveled to the United Nations to refute the untruths he had heard from other leaders on the same rostrum earlier in the week. 'I didn’t intend to come here this year. My country is at war fighting for its life,' Netanyahu said. 'But after I heard the lies and slanders leveled at my country by many of the speakers at this podium, I decided to come here and set the record straight.' He insisted that Israel wanted peace but said of Iran: 'If you strike us, we will strike you.' He once again blamed Iran for being behind many of the problems in the region. 'For too long, the world has appeased Iran,' Netanyahu said. 'That appeasement must end.' As he spoke, the seats in the Iran delegation sat empty. Outside, protesters against Netanyahu and Israel's policies demonstrated behind police barricades. Israel is fighting on two fronts Israel’s campaign in Gaza has killed more than 41,500 Palestinians and wounded more than 96,000 others, according to the latest figures released Thursday by the Health Ministry. The ministry, part of Gaza’s Hamas government, doesn’t differentiate between civilians and combatants, but more than half the dead have been women and children, including about 1,300 children under the age of 2. Israel has maintained its military operations are justified and are necessary to defend itself. 'This war can come to an end now. All that has to happen is for Hamas to surrender, lay down its arms and release all the hostages,' Netanyahu said. 'But if they don’t – if they don’t – we will fight until we achieve total victory. Total victory. There is no substitute for it. ' He said Israeli forces have destroyed '90%' of Hamas’ rockets and killed or captured half of its forces. But he insisted nonetheless that he was pursuing peace. 'Israel has made peace and will make peace again,' he said. In recent days, Israel has turned its attention to the border with Lebanon, where it is has stepped up strikes targeting Hezbollah but has inflicted civilian casualties as well. Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel almost immediately after the Hamas attack, saying it was a show of support for the Palestinians. That triggered Israeli counterfire and the two sides have traded fire almost daily for the 11 months since, driving tens of thousands of people from their homes on both sides of the border. Israel vows to drive Hezbollah away from the border to allow its citizens to return safely to their homes. Hezbollah says it won’t stop firing rockets until the Gaza war ends. Late Wednesday, the United States, France and other allies jointly called for an 'immediate' 21-day cease-fire to allow for negotiations as fears grow that this week’s escalation could spiral into an all-out war. Hezbollah hasn’t officially responded to the ceasefire proposal. The United Nations says over 90,000 people have been displaced by five days of Israeli strikes on Lebanon, bringing the total to 200,000 people who have been displaced in Lebanon since the cross-border exchanges began. His speech impacted the rest of the General Assembly Netanyahu also made a lengthy appeal for Israeli relations with Saudi Arabia — but did it without mentioning what’s blocking any action: Saudi Arabia’s demand for an independent Palestinian state. As Netanyahu took the stage Friday morning, there was enough ruckus in the audience that the presiding diplomat had to shout, 'Order, please.' The two speakers who preceded Netanyahu on Friday each made a point of calling out Israel for its actions. 'Mr. Netanyahu, stop this war now,' Slovenian Prime Minister Robert Golob said as he closed his remarks, pounding the podium. And Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, speaking just before the Israeli leader, declared of Gaza: 'This is not just a conflict. This is systematic slaughter of innocent people of Palestine.' He thumped the rostrum to audible applause. And after the Israeli leader left the stage, the next speaker, Prime Minister Mia Mottley of Barbados, started speaking but then paused for noises in the gallery, saying, 'We can wait.' She did so for about 20 seconds before she continued. It wasn't just Friday, either. On Thursday, the leader of the Palestinian Authority and a top Lebanese official both made their cases to fellow leaders — cases that included harsh words for Israel as well. Mahmoud Abbas' first words to the General Assembly were a sentence repeated three times in reference to Gaza: 'We will not leave. We will not leave. We will not leave.' He accused Israel of destroying Gaza and making it unlivable. And Abdallah Bouhabib, Lebanon's foreign minister, decried Israel's 'systematic destruction of Lebanese border villages.' 'The crisis in Lebanon threatens the entire Middle East,' Bouhabib said. 'We wish today to reiterate our call for a cease-fire on all fronts.' ___ See more of AP’s coverage of the U.N.

Somali-Canadian rapper K’naan charged with 2010 sexual assault in Quebec City	QUEBEC CITY (AP) — Canadian rapper K’naan, known for the global hit 'Wavin’ Flag,' has been charged over an alleged sexual assault in Quebec City dating back more than 14 years. A charge sheet filed at the courthouse in Quebec City on Thursday says the rapper, whose given name is Keinan Abdi Warsame, is charged with one count of sexual assault from July 2010. The arrest warrant alleges the assault took place between July 16 and July 17, 2010, dates that coincide with the musician’s appearance at Quebec City’s popular Festival d’été de Québec. The case was before the court, but the accused wasn't present. His lawyers weren’t immediately available for comment. The victim, whose identity is protected, was 29 at the time of the alleged assault. The Somalia-born musician grew up in Toronto, but resides in Brooklyn, New York, according to the charge sheet. K’naan was given the cultural impact award at Canada’s SOCAN Awards on Tuesday for the global resonance of the 2009 hit 'Wavin’ Flag.' ___ This story first moved on Sept. 26, 2024, and was retransmitted on Sept. 27, 2024, to remove an image that misidentified another person as K’naan.	https://apnews.com/article/knaan-sexual-assault-charge-quebec-city-canada-95e616d41fd196fd07dcb370ab423013	2024-09-27T04:26:45-07:00	
Czechs vote in the runoff election for a third of the seats in Parliament's upper house	PRAGUE (AP) — Czechs cast ballots on Friday in the second round of voting for a third of the seats in Parliament’s upper house, the Senate. The current ruling coalition led by Prime Minister Petr Fiala has a clear majority in the Senate though the main opposition group, led by former populist Prime Minister Andrej Babis, has the most candidates advancing from last week’s first round to the runoff for 27 seats in the 81-seat Senate. The top two finishers in each district faced each other in a head-to-head vote. Babis’ ANO, or YES in English, had 19 candidates advancing to the runoffs, the best first round result for the centrist movement. Five candidates reached the 50% threshold in the first round to win seats outright, leaving 22 seats to be decided in runoffs. Parliament’s lower house dominates the legislative process, but the Senate plays an important role in passing constitutional amendments and approving Constitutional Court judges. The results of the two-day vote will be known later on Saturday. In a separate vote last week, ANO also dominated Czech regional elections, winning 10 of the 13 regions contested. In another setback for the ruling coalition, a junior party, the Pirates, said earlier this week that it would leave the Cabinet over Fiala’s decision to fire the party leader. Fiala said he had lost trust in Ivan Bartos’s ability to deal with the problems linked to a new digital system for issuing building permits. Fiala’s government will retain a majority in Parliament’s lower house, even without the Pirates.	https://apnews.com/article/czech-senate-election-babis-d8ad948c4589e128575fedee51720504	2024-09-27T04:17:05-07:00	
Civil society groups nudge and cajole world leaders from the sidelines of United Nations week	NEW YORK (AP) — As the meeting of world leaders kicked off at the United Nations on Sunday, across Manhattan on an elevated park that runs along old rail lines, throngs of people streamed through a 'climate science fair' showcasing work on nature, food and the energy transition. Emerson Collective funds the nonprofits, advocacy organizations and companies at the fair and brought them all to town as counterprogramming to the U.N. General Assembly. The annual convening this year amounted to a shaky demonstration by nation states that they can still work together to solve the world's compounding crises. 'The U.N. and so many of those meetings, they are critical, but they are happening behind closed doors. And they’re very future looking, future facing and commitment based,' said Gabe Kleinman, a partner at Emerson Collective, which is billionaire Laurene Powell Jobs' philanthropy and investing organization. Kleinman said that in contrast to the U.N. events, the science fair was open to all and highlighted solutions for climate change that the organization thinks could be impactful right now. The fair is part of a crush of events every September that unfold on the sidelines of the official high-level meetings, where nonprofits, advocates and fundraisers mingle and lobby world leaders, billionaires and funders — and plan their next steps with each other. They gather in mostly elite spaces — in marble tiled rooms, under glass chandeliers, with snacks of fresh raspberries and glass bottles of sparkling water — to get their messages to the people with their hands on the levers of power. It’s a push and pull of influence games and negotiations with very high stakes. 'I’ve been doing this work for 40 years. I have never seen a world where we are faced with so many crises and not just so many crises, but also crises that are increasingly protracted,' said UNICEF deputy executive director of partnerships Kitty van der Heijden. The number of people who need humanitarian assistance has ballooned from 63 million in 2012 to 367 million, including 183 million children, as of March 2024, UNICEF said. Van der Heijden said she hopes the private sector and philanthropy will become even more involved in the multilateral system to meet the needs of children. Philanthropic money in particular can be more flexible, longer term and take on more risk than public funding, she said. But philanthropic dollars won't ever match the resources that governments can leverage. To that end, billionaire Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates called on nations to fully fund the vaccines alliance GAVI and invest in reducing malnutrition, especially among children at the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation's annual Goalkeepers event that tracks progress toward global development goals. In a ceremony on Monday that featured Grammy-winning musician Jon Batiste performing in a gold sequin suit, the foundation honored Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, for his work during his first term lifting millions out of poverty and significantly reducing malnutrition among children. 'I think it’s commendable that executives like you create a foundation.' said da Silva, addressing Gates while on stage. 'But what will effectively solve the problem of extreme poverty is not through a foundation’s donation, which is important, but through public policies.' To follow the political commitments made by nation states, organizations like the antipoverty nonprofit Oxfam brought in technical experts to New York. They tracked changes word by word over multiple drafts of a pact that countries agreed on coming into a special two day gathering, the 'Summit of the Future,' where they recommitted to the Sustainable Development Goals, including gender equality, that were set back in 2015. Rebecca Shadwick, a policy and advocacy lead for Oxfam International, said one change that civil society groups advocated to get into the final draft was a commitment to 'achieve' gender equality rather than to 'accelerate the achievement of gender equality.' While civil society groups have no formal role in the negotiations, they see themselves as partners in the development of the goals. Practically, nonprofits play a major role in actually realizing these promises, which are significantly off track. Funders who prioritize efforts to combat gender-based violence gathered at the Free Future 2024 conference last week, hosted by the Ford Foundation, whose headquarters around the corner from the U.N. are built around a large indoor garden. They described constant and urgent demands for support from feminist organizations around the world. Abigail Erikson, chief of the UN Trust Fund, said her organization received $1.5 billion in requests for funding this year, while having only $13.5 million to grant out. Her fund is dedicated to addressing violence against women and girls. 'It’s overwhelming,' Erikson said, though she thinks of the potential if that demand was funded. 'Imagine if we had the money flows for that, the same way that the money is flowing to the anti-rights movement.' Elsewhere around town, money did flow. Under a soaring arched ceiling held up by stone pillars, the UN’s sexual and reproductive health agency convened ministers to announce $350 million in new funding for family planning and health services. As a part of that pledge, the British hedge fund billionaire Sir Chris Hohn announced a $100 million commitment through the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation, of which he is founder and chair. The funds will help expand access to contraception and health services in the Sahel and Democratic Republic of Congo. Describing contraception and support for women to make their own choices about when and if to have children as a 'best buy' in development, Hohn said it was 'stupidity' and a lack of empathy keeping governments from fully funding the work of the UN's sexual and reproductive health agency. Those sentiments — among the panel discussions, keynotes and one-on-one meetings, which start early and extend late — are what civil society groups want world leaders to hear, not just for the future of their groups, but also the people they serve all over the world. ___ Associated Press writer Eléonore Hughes contributed from Rio de Janeiro. ___ Associated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Isaac strengthens into a hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean and could cause dangerous waves	MIAMI (AP) — Isaac strengthened Friday into a hurricane in the open waters of the Atlantic Ocean and could cause dangerous waves in parts of Bermuda, forecasters said. The storm was about about 980 miles (1,577 kilometers) east-northeast of Bermuda and about 1,175 miles (1,890 km) west of the Azores, with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (121 kph). It was heading east at 12 mph (19 kph). There were no coastal watches or warnings in effect, but the waves could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions in Bermuda, the Miami-based U.S. National Hurricane Center said. Potentially dangerous waves also could spread to the Azores, the center said. Isaac is expected to strengthen before gradually weakening by the end of the weekend. The storm has been churning in the ocean as Hurricane Helene made landfall in northwestern Florida as a Category 4 storm before weaking early Friday, leaving behind flooding, damage and power outages.	https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-isaac-bermuda-azores-waves-9a27e897969ae1e79fba52a740ba4538	2024-09-27T03:17:24-07:00	
Prince Harry’s Sentebale organization leading initiative to support young people in Southern Africa	NEW YORK (AP) — Prince Harry’s latest philanthropic move will gather world business leaders and philanthropists to work towards fostering prosperity in Southern African communities, specifically focused on young people. In early October, Harry’s charity organization Sentebale, which he co-founded with Prince Seeiso of Lesotho in 2006, will bring together leaders from Google’s charitable arm and several other companies and organizations for a series of meetings and discussions in Lesotho and Johannesburg. The gathering will be Harry’s first time visiting Southern Africa since 2019. He’s long been devoted to philanthropy work in the region in honor of his late mother, Princess Diana. The Duke of Sussex and the leaders will partner with local organizations and companies that are already actively brainstorming solutions to the roadblocks in place for young people in the region to succeed. Harry said in a news release that the organization has developed a 'profound understanding of local youth – their passions, their concerns, and their extraordinary creativity' through their extensive work in the area and their longstanding relationships with local communities. 'These young adults are eager and capable of driving meaningful change, yet significant barriers still stand in their way,' his statement continued, noting Sentebale is nearing its 20th anniversary. While the organization was initially established to help children and young people in Lesotho and Botswana affected by HIV/AIDS, it now works to establish solutions to broader problems impacting youth in the region, like health issues, wealth inequity, and climate. The organization’s name means ‘forget-me-not’ in the Sesotho language, and the princes established the charity in memory of their late mothers. The session, which will reunite the group after they previously convened in Miami for a session in April, will also feature a panel discussion in addition to the private work sessions, and they will complete a site visit to the 'mountain kingdom' of Lesotho. 'Over 50% of these young people are at risk of remaining economically vulnerable without urgent investment in digital skills, education, and job creation,' said Sentebale Board Chair, Sophie Chandauka in a release. 'The Duke’s return to Southern Africa, alongside our new American friends, marks a milestone as we collaborate with world-class organizations and local leadership to engage this critical youth cohort.' The announcement of the new initiative comes after the Duke of Sussex appeared at several humanitarian and philanthropic events that ran alongside the United Nations General Assembly Week.	https://apnews.com/article/prince-harry-philanthropy-charity-organization-9d6a513ed58befb1693f4df09d93c9d7	2024-09-27T03:00:57-07:00	
Myanmar's opposition rejects a military appeal for talks on a political solution to armed conflict	BANGKOK (AP) — The main group coordinating opposition to military rule in Myanmar rejected on Friday a surprise offer from the ruling generals to hold talks on a political solution to the country’s nationwide armed conflict. Nay Phone Latt, a spokesperson for the opposition’s shadow National Unity Government, told The Associated Press that a joint statement issued earlier this year by opposition groups has already paved the way for a negotiated political solution if the army agrees to its conditions. Padoh Saw Kalae Say, a spokesperson of the Karen National Union, which represents the Karen ethnic minority, said it also will not accept the military’s offer. The KNU has been fighting on and off for greater autonomy since Myanmar, then called Burma, won independence from Britain in 1948. 'What we see is that their inviting offers are the ideas from more than 70 years ago. We won’t accept and discuss it, and looking back at the statements we have repeatedly expressed, I would like to say that there is no need to think about this,' Padoh Saw Kalae Say told the AP. The military’s brief 'Offer to resolve political issues in political means,' dated Thursday and published Friday in the Global New Light of Myanmar and other state-run newspapers, was its most direct offer of peace talks since it seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021. It said its opponents are invited 'to contact the State to resolve the political issues through party politics or electoral processes in order to be able to join hands with the people to emphasize durable peace and development by discarding the armed terrorist way.' The offer came five days before the military government launches a national census to compile voter lists for a general election expected next year. An election is seen as a way for the military to legitimize its rule, though it would be difficult to organize while the country is at war, and critics see no way for the polls to be free and fair. The ruling military originally announced that elections would be held in August 2023, but has repeatedly pushed back the date. The military's offer, which defended its 2021 takeover and blamed the country’s subsequent turmoil on its opponents, came after the army over the past year has suffered unprecedented battlefield defeats from powerful ethnic militias, especially in the northeast along the border with China and in the western state of Rakhine. The army is currently on the defensive against ethnic militias in much of the country that are seeking autonomy, as well as hundreds of armed guerrilla groups collectively called People’s Defense Forces, formed to fight to restore democracy after the army takeover. The opposition’s political road map earlier this year offering talks was signed by the National Unity Government and three major ethnic armed organizations — the Chin National Front, the Karenni National Progressive Party and the Karen National Union, all of which are engaged in active combat against the military government. That statement’s objectives include terminating the military’s involvement in politics, placing all armed forces under the command of an elected civilian government, promulgating a new constitution embodying federalism and democratic values, establishing a new federal democratic union and instituting a system of transitional justice. It calls for a dialogue with the military’s leadership, but only after it shows its unconditional acceptance of the plan for the termination of military rule and a peaceful transition of power. It is not clear whether the military's new offer was meant to include all opposition groups, several of which it has officially classified as terrorists and therefore illegal. While addressing thousands of military personnel at a military parade on Armed Forces Day in March 2022, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, the head of the ruling military council, said he would not negotiate with 'terrorist groups and their supporters for killing innocent people' and threatening peace and security. He said the military — known as the Tatmadaw — 'will annihilate them to (the) end.'	https://apnews.com/article/myanmar-military-political-talks-proposal-opposition-e42372700fbc4bc7b7cdf2917a10e81b	2024-09-27T02:55:15-07:00	
49 saplings from famous UK tree that was illegally chopped down will be shared to mark anniversary	LONDON (AP) — It's been a year since a sycamore tree that stood high and proud near the Roman landmark of Hadrian’s Wall in the north of England was inexplicably chopped down, triggering a wave of shock and disbelief across the U.K., even among those who had never seen it up close. Known and loved by millions, the 150-year-old tree was made famous around the world when it featured in Kevin Costner’s 1991 film 'Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves.' The Sycamore Gap tree, as it was known because of its regal canopy framed between two hills, was a popular subject for landscape photographers and a great resting spot for walkers. Now it is going to get a new lease of life — dozens of them. The National Trust, a conservation charity that seeks to protect and open up historic places and green spaces to the general public, launched an initiative on Friday in which 49 saplings from the tree will be given to communities around the U.K. Other saplings will be sent to the U.K.'s 15 national parks and the local primary school. The initiative, which also involves the local Northumberland National Park Authority and Historic England, the public organization that looks after England’s historic environment, is called 'Trees of Hope' and aims to 'create a new chapter in the life of this legendary tree.' Each of the 49 saplings — one to represent each foot of the tree's height when it was felled — is expected to be 6 feet (1.8 meters) tall on delivery. People from around the U.K. are invited to apply for a tree to plant in publicly accessible spaces which have emotional connections with people and communities. Entries must be made by Oct. 25, with winners announced on Nov. 18. 'The last 12 months have been a real rollercoaster of emotions, from the hopelessness and grief we felt when we discovered that the tree had been illegally felled, to experiencing the stories shared with us about just what the tree meant to so many,' said Andrew Poad, general manager for the National Trust’s Hadrian’s Wall properties. Also on Friday, the Northumberland National Park Authority is marking the anniversary of the felling with the opening of the first phase of an exhibition, 'Sycamore Gap: One Year On,' including the largest remaining section of the tree. Two men — Daniel Graham and Adam Carruthers — have been charged with two counts over the felling of the tree. One count is for allegedly cutting down the tree and the second is for damage to the adjacent wall built by Emperor Hadrian in A.D. 122 to protect the northwest frontier of the Roman Empire. Prosecutors have calculated that the cost of the felling was around 620,000 pounds ($825,000). Both have been released on bail ahead of their trial scheduled for early December.	https://apnews.com/article/sycamore-gap-tree-hadrians-wall-britain-vandalism-f01a506ce053bb746156e2492911d446	2024-09-27T02:20:34-07:00	
Japan's soon-to-be prime minister faces big challenge as he tries to move past ruling party scandals	TOKYO (AP) — The person chosen Friday to lead Japan's governing party, and become prime minister next week, is a veteran politician with deep policy experience, a taste for curry and anime — and big challenges ahead of him as he tries to unite a fractious party and hold off an opposition eager to capitalize on recent corruption scandals. Shigeru Ishiba has long been popular with voters but has often struggled to win over his conservative fellow Liberal Democratic Party lawmakers. A vocal critic of the hawkish politics of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, he was long seen as a troublesome outsider by some party members. That makes Friday's victory a huge comeback for Ishiba. It could also signal a break from years of Abe's influence over the party, even after the former prime minister's assassination. Some analysts believe that Ishiba was chosen as much for his image as a centrist who can counter challenges by the more liberal main opposition party as for his policy views. The 67-year-old former banker was running in the party leadership race for a fifth time and had said this was going to be his 'final battle.' Ishiba was first elected to parliament in 1986, after being influenced by the late Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka, who was popular with the public. He has served as defense minister, agriculture minister and in other key Cabinet posts, and as the LDP secretary general under Abe. His party will now look for him to use his experience, stability and expertise to beat back the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, which recently chose as its new leader former Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda, a veteran known for his inspiring speeches. University of Tokyo politics professor Yu Uchiyama said political parties tend to make centrist shifts to win elections, and Ishiba could do well in an upcoming parliamentary face-off with the opposition leader. Considered a defense policy expert, Ishiba has proposed an Asian version of the NATO military alliance and a more equal and mutual Japan-U.S. security alliance, including having Japanese Self Defense Force bases in the United States. Ishiba is a supporter of Taiwan’ s democracy. He calls for the establishment of a disaster management agency in one of the world’s most disaster-prone countries. Ishiba has vowed to push for more diversity and gender equality. He supports a revision to a 19th century civil code that requires married couples to choose one of their surnames. That has caused most women to adopt their husband’s surname. Moves to change the code have stalled for decades because of LDP opposition. At a recent speech in Tokyo, Ishiba said Japanese women are among the shortest sleepers in the world because of their heavy responsibilities both at work and home. He said most husbands, including himself, hardly help with childrearing and homemaking. Ishiba also supports legalizing same-sex marriage. Ishiba is known as a policy 'otaku,' or nerd, especially in security and defense issues. He likes anime, building model warships and listening to 1970s and '80s Japanese pop songs. He says his favorite food is curried rice.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-ishiba-governing-party-leader-prime-minister-f99834b652921f707471e0be845a6d94	2024-09-27T00:36:32-07:00	
Bangladesh's Shakib is retiring from test cricket but he's not sure in which match	KANPUR, India (AP) — Bangladesh cricket great Shakib Al Hasan wants his last test match to be in his Dhaka hometown next month. He's not sure it will be, though, because he's worried about his safety. Shakib, who has played for Bangladesh for 19 years, told the selectors and the national cricket board (BCB) this week of his pending test retirement, and his immediate retirement from Twenty20s. He wants to continue in one-day internationals until the Champions Trophy in February in Pakistan. The hitch is him getting a security clearance from his government if he returns home. He's in India, playing the ongoing second test against the host in Kanpur. Shakib was a Member of Parliament under the Awami League-led government until the party was ousted from power in August in the face of nationwide protests. Following the government's fall, many Awami League politicians went into hiding, were arrested, and banned from leaving the country. Shakib, who reportedly hasn't been in Bangladesh since before the protests, was accused in a murder case related to the protests by the Adabor police station. The BCB has allowed him to continue playing for the national team until proven guilty. South Africa plans to play two tests in Bangladesh next month, subject to a security clearance, and Shakib wants the first match in Dhaka to be his 72nd and last test. But his desire for a security guarantee from the BCB can't be fulfilled, board president Faruque Ahmed said this week. 'Shakib's security is not in the board's hand,' Faruque told ESPN. 'The board can't provide an individual with personal security. He has to take a decision on that. His security has to come from the highest level of the government.' Shakib said if he can't get security guarantees for his safety, and receive permission to leave the country, then this week's test against India in Kanpur would be his last. 'I am a citizen of Bangladesh, so I shouldn't have any problem going back to Bangladesh. My concern is my safety and security in Bangladesh,' he said. 'My close friends and family members are concerned. I hope things are getting better. There should be a solution to it. 'I am available for the South Africa series but since there's a lot happening back home, everything doesn't depend on me. I have discussed my plans (with the BCB). If there’s a chance, and if I could play, my last test will be in Mirpur (Dhaka). The board is trying to ensure that I can play and feel safe, but at the same time, I should be able to leave the country without a hitch. 'It has been tough for me, while I am focused on the game. There is a case against me. I will be glad to see evidence of it, if it was done properly. Everyone has rights — people know where I was and what I was doing at the time. False allegations are not really giving our country a great outlook. It is not very appropriate.' The 37-year-old Shakib has been a tremendous all-rounder for Bangladesh across 71 tests, 247 ODIs and 129 T20s. He was ranked the world’s best allrounder for long periods. 'It is the right time to move on and create a place for new players,' he said. 'I have played my last T20 in the World Cup (this year). I won’t be playing in the upcoming series against India and the West Indies. 'If I do well in the franchise leagues in the next months, BCB can call me up if they feel I can contribute to the T20 side (for the 2026 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka). Basically, I can see the end of my career in these two formats. I am happy and don’t have any regrets in life. I have enjoyed my cricket career and it is the right time for me as well as Bangladesh cricket.' ___ AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket	https://apnews.com/article/shakib-bangladesh-cricket-retire-8b730b6bc7bc098f7105a214b4c953c8	2024-09-27T00:23:07-07:00	
Belgian PM blasts Pope Francis for Catholic Church's sex abuse cover-up legacy in blistering welcome	BRUSSELS (AP) — Belgium’s prime minister blasted Pope Francis for the Catholic Church’s horrific legacy of clerical sex abuse and cover-ups, demanding 'concrete steps' to come clean with the past and put victims’ interests ahead those of the institution in a blistering welcome at the start of Francis’ visit on Friday. The speech by Prime Minister Alexander De Croo was one of the most pointed ever directed at the pope during a foreign trip, where the genteel dictates of diplomatic protocol usually keeps outrage out of the public speeches. But even King Philippe had strong words for Francis, demanding the church work 'incessantly' to atone for the crimes and help victims heal. Their tone underscored just how raw the abuse scandal still is in Belgium, where two decades of revelations of abuse and systematic cover-ups have devastated the hierarchy’s credibility and contributed to an overall decline in Catholicism and the influence of the once-powerful Catholic Church. Francis applauded at the end of De Croo’s speech, and was expected to meet with victims in private later Friday. 'Today, words alone do not suffice. We also need concrete steps,' De Croo said. 'Victims need to be heard. They need to be at the center. They have a right to truth. Misdeeds need to be recognized,' he said in front of an audience of royals, church officials, diplomats and politicians at Laeken Castle, the residence of Belgium’s royal family. 'When something goes wrong we cannot accept cover-ups,' he said. 'To be able to look into the future, the church needs to come clean on its past.' Revelations of Belgium’s horrific abuse scandal have dribbled out in bits over a quarter century, punctuated by a bombshell in 2010, when the country’s longest-serving bishop, Bruges Bishop Roger Vangheluwe, was allowed to resign without punishment after admitting he had sexually abused his nephew for 13 years. Francis only defrocked Vangheluwe earlier this year, in a move clearly designed to remove a lingering source of outrage among Belgians before his visit. Outrage about church sex abuse was reignited last year, when a four-episode Flemish documentary showed Belgian victims telling their stories on camera. 'Godvergeten' (Godforsaken) aired on public broadcaster VRT in the weeks surrounding a royal visit to the Vatican during which Francis was invited to Belgium. For the first time, Flemish viewers at home saw victims explain the scope of the scandal in their community, the depravity of the crimes, and the systematic cover-up by the Catholic hierarchy. Amid the public outrage that ensued, both a Flanders parliamentary committee and Belgium’s federal parliament opened official inquests and heard months of testimony from victims, experts and the Catholic hierarchy. Their testimonies cast new attention on a scandal that had already been blamed for a steep decline in the Catholic Church over a generation in Belgium, where church authorities have stopped publishing weekly Mass attendance figures as the monthly rate sits in the single digits. The pope also referred to abuse in his remarks, insisting that the church was 'addressing firmly and decisively' the problem by implementing prevention programs, listening to victims and accompanying them to heal. But after the astonishing dressing down by the prime minister and king, Francis went off-script to express the shame of the church for the scandal and voice his commitment to ending it. 'The church must be ashamed and ask forgiveness and try to resovlve this problem, and put all the possibilities in place so that this doesn’t happen again,' Francis said. 'For even one (victim), we must ask forgiveness.' Victims, however, have demanded the church do far more, including implementing robust reparations programs to compensate them for their trauma and pay for the lifelong therapy many need. Some penned a letter demanding such a reparations program, which they planned to deliver to Francis in their private meeting. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Israel-Hamas war latest: With nearly 700 killed in a week, Lebanon fears Gaza-level violence	Nearly 700 people have been killed in Lebanon this week, according to Lebanon’s health ministry. Israel has dramatically escalated strikes, saying it is targeting Hezbollah’s military capacities and senior Hezbollah commanders. Top Israeli officials have threatened to repeat the destruction of Gaza in Lebanon if the Hezbollah fire continues, raising fears that Israel’s actions in Gaza since Oct. 7 would be repeated in Lebanon. The International Organization for Migration estimated Thursday that more than 200,000 people have been displaced in Lebanon since Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel in support of Hamas after it stormed into Israel, sparking the Israel-Hamas war. Lebanon says a total of 1,540 people have been killed within its borders in that time. The United States, France and other allies jointly called for a 21-day cease-fire. Lebanon's foreign minister said the country welcomed the cease-fire efforts, and decried Israel’s 'systematic destruction of Lebanese border villages.' Israeli military vehicles were seen transporting tanks and armored vehicles toward the country’s northern border with Lebanon, and commanders have issued a call-up of reservists. Netanyahu says Israel is striking Hezbollah 'with full force' and won’t stop until its goals are achieved. ___ Here’s the latest: Houthi rebels claim missile attack targeting Israel DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Yemen’s Houthi rebels have claimed a missile attack that targeted Israel early Friday morning. Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree, a Houthi military spokesman, claimed the attack in a pre-recorded statement released by the Houthis. He claimed the rebels launched both a missile and drone. The missile targeted Tel Aviv while the drone targeted another city, though Israel did not acknowledge the drone. No injuries were reported. Israel’s military said earlier Friday it used an Arrow interceptor missile to down the Houthi missile, which saw some shrapnel fall. It’s the second attack by the Houthis to target Tel Aviv in recent weeks. Friday’s launch comes amid Israel’s intensified airstrike campaign targeting Lebanon’s Hezbollah militia. Both Hezbollah and the Houthis are backed by Iran. UN: More than 30,000 people crossed from Lebanon into Syria in 3 days GENEVA — The U.N. refugee agency says 'well over 30,000' people have crossed from Lebanon into neighboring Syria over the last 72 hours in the wake of fighting between the militant group Hezbollah and Israeli forces in Lebanon. Gonzalo Vargas Llosa, the representative for refugee agency UNHCR in Syria, said roughly half of the people who have fled were children and adolescents. He said about 80% were Syrians returning to their home country and the rest were Lebanese. 'Now these, of course, are people who are fleeing bombs and who are crossing into a country that has been suffering from its own crisis and violence for 13 years now,' he told reporters in Geneva by video from the Lebanon-Syria border. Syria is facing 'economic collapse,' he said. 'I think that this just illustrates the kind of extremely difficult choices both Syrians and Lebanese are having to make,' he said. Israeli strike kills a family of 9 in a Lebanese border town, authorities say BEIRUT — An Israeli airstrike on a border village has killed nine members of the same family, Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency said Friday. NNA said nine people were killed in the early Friday airstrike on the village of Chebaa that destroyed their three-story building. Chebaa is in an area where the borders of Syria, Israel and Lebanon meet, and was struck several times in recent months. On Friday, Israeli warplanes struck towns and villages in southern Lebanon and the eastern Bekaa Valley, according to NNA. Israeli military reports more strikes from Lebanon JERUSALEM — Incoming fire from Lebanon into Israel continued Friday, with one man suffering wounds from shrapnel. The Israeli military said four drones came across the border Friday, all of which were intercepted. Earlier Friday, the Israeli military said another 10 projectiles came into Israel from Lebanon, with some intercepted and others falling into open fields. It said it later targeted launchers in Lebanon behind the missile attacks. Hezbollah claimed it had targeted the Israeli city of Tiberias with missiles. The Israeli military said its warplanes had struck launchers in Haddatha, Lebanon, that it said fired the rockets at Tiberius in northern Israel. Israeli strike in Syria kills 5 soldiers DAMASCUS — An overnight Israeli airstrike on a military site in the area of Kfar Yabous in Syria near the border with Lebanon killed five Syrian army soldiers and injured another, Syrian state news agency SANA reported Friday, citing an unidentified military official. Israel's military did not immediately acknowledge the strike. Israel regularly targets military sites in Syria and facilities linked to Iran and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah but rarely acknowledges them. Those strikes have become more frequent as Hezbollah has exchanged fire with Israeli forces for the past 11 months against the backdrop of Israel’s war against Hamas — a Hezbollah ally — in Gaza. Tens of thousands of Lebanese and Syrians have fled across the border from Lebanon into Syria since the beginning of the week under intense Israeli bombardment that Israel says is targeting Hezbollah militants and weapons. The week's strikes have killed an estimated 700 people, including at least 150 women and children. Trade unions file claim at United Nations for Palestinian workers GENEVA — A group of international trade unions on Friday filed a complaint against Israel at the United Nations labor organization in a bid to win compensation for 200,000 Palestinians who have gone unpaid or seen their benefits withheld after the Oct. 7 attacks. The nine unions say the workers from both Gaza and the West Bank had been employed in Israel before the deadly attacks by armed militants, but were barred from entering to go to their jobs afterward. As a result, the workers and their families have faced millions of dollars’ worth of lost income, financial insecurity and no access to remedies through the courts, they said. 'These workers have experienced widespread wage theft due to the suspension of work permits and the unilateral termination of their contracts,' said a joint statement from the unions, whose members are active in industries as diverse as construction, education, journalism, agriculture, hospitality and transportation. The filing at the International Labor Organization in Geneva, of which Israel is a member country, is based on language in its constitution that seeks to ensure that countries uphold international commitments they have already made. Such economic woes that many Palestinians have faced come on top of the bloodshed, displacement and other troubles faced by Gaza and the West Bank as Israel continues its campaign against armed Palestinian militants. The Philippines is preparing to evacuate thousands of its citizens from Lebanon MANILA, Philippines — The Philippine government is bracing to evacuate thousands of Filipino workers in Lebanon in case the deadly conflict between Israel and the Hezbollah militant group further escalates, Philippine officials said Friday. More than 11,000 Filipinos live and work in Lebanon, often as house cleaners. Philippine officials have not yet ordered a mandatory evacuation of its citizens because it was not yet clear whether a full-scale war would erupt, including an Israeli ground attack. Many Filipinos were adamant not to leave their jobs in Lebanon and return to uncertainties at home, but they have been told to be ready to evacuate any time, Foreign Undersecretary Eduardo De Vega told a news briefing in Manila. They say 'it’s better for them to die in war than to die of hunger,' De Vega said. But he added without elaborating that the Philippine government prepared a contingency plan for a massive evacuation if widespread ground fighting erupts across Lebanon. Philippine Ambassador to Lebanon Raymond Balatbat told reporters in Manila via video on Friday that many Filipinos there 'will only decide to leave when the situation is so bad, when the war is at their doorsteps.'	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-hamas-latest-mideast-27-september-2024-4dc3676b10be0fe7b41ab6d9cd897014	2024-09-26T22:28:12-07:00

As the Ukraine war enters a critical period, the EU moves ahead without the US	BRUSSELS (AP) — As the war in Ukraine enters a critical period, the European Union has decided that it must take responsibility for what it sees as an existential threat to security in its own neighborhood and is preparing to tackle some of the financial burden, perhaps even without the United States. EU envoys have been working in Brussels this week on a proposal to provide Ukraine with a hefty loan package worth up to 35 billion euros ($39 billion). It was announced by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen during a trip to Kyiv last Friday. 'Crucially, this loan will flow straight into your national budget,' she told President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. 'It will provide you with significant and much-needed fiscal space. You will decide how best to use the funds, giving you maximum flexibility to meet your needs.' Zelenskyy wants to buy weapons and bomb shelters and rebuild Ukraine's shattered energy network as winter draws near. In international matters, particularly involving major conflicts, the EU rarely moves ahead without the U.S., but it hopes this decision will encourage others to come forward. Russian troops and an election close in Almost 1,000 days since their full-scale invasion, Russian forces are making advances in the east. Ukraine’s army has a shaky hold on part of the Kursk region in Russia, which has provided a temporary morale boost, but as casualties mount it remains outmanned and outgunned. On the political front, Zelenskyy hopes to secure support for a 'victory plan' that might force Russian President Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table. He’s trying to persuade U.S. President Joe Biden and other allies to help strengthen Ukraine’s hand in any future talks. But a U.S. election looms, and polls suggest that Donald Trump might return to the White House in January. Trump has been critical of U.S. aid to Ukraine. On Wednesday, he said Zelenskyy should have made concessions to Putin before the invasion began in February 2022. Most of the 27-nation EU fears that a Putin victory would lead to deep uncertainty. Russia’s armed forces are depleted and currently incapable of another war, but the prospect of a future land grab in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania or Poland remains. Reworking a G7 loan plan The EU loans are part of a plan by the Group of Seven major industrialized nations to take advantage of interest earned on about $250 billion worth of frozen Russian assets, most of them held in Europe. These windfall profits are estimated at around 4.5 billion to 5.5 billion euros ($5 billion to $6 billion) a year. The profits underpin the G7 plan. The EU would stump up $20 billion, the U.S. $20 billion, and Canada, Japan and the U.K. $10 billion together, for a combined total of $50 billion. The scheme expires at the end of the year, before the next U.S. president takes office. Now, amid differences over how long the Russian asset freeze should be guaranteed, the EU has decided to go it alone. Its offer of up to $39 billion in loans accounts for almost the entirety of the U.S. share as well. The U.S. wants to ensure that the assets are locked away for at least three years to guarantee the income. But EU member Hungary insists this should only happen in 6-month increments. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán styles himself as a peacemaker and is too close to Putin for many of his partners' comfort. The other 26 EU countries feel they must move now because time is running out. An evolving alliance with the United States The U.S. election is just weeks away. The Europeans are wary of Trump’s unpredictability and are testing scenarios to help protect themselves from the kind of battering, like tariff hikes, their economies received during his past presidency. But they also see the Democrats as more inward looking these days. Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act left European leaders fuming over rules that favored American products. China and war in the Middle East are the foreign policy priorities of Democrat or Republican candidates alike, and for now the U.S. is in the grip of election campaign fever. The EU hopes that Vice President Kamala Harris, if she is elected president, would enter the loan program as previously planned and reduce the EU's financial burden. But that remains an open question for now, and EU members say Ukraine’s position is too precarious to hesitate. Political delays in the U.S. Congress last year over a $60 billion support package starved Ukrainian troops of weapons and ammunition for months, resulting in 'real consequences on the battlefield,' in the words of NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. Pressing ahead on pressing needs Helping Ukraine in military terms is a challenge for the Europeans. They could not do it alone, and cannot match the U.S. transport, logistics and equipment superiority, despite progress in ramping up their defense industries to supply arms and ammunition. But the world’s biggest trading bloc does wield economic might. It has already given Ukraine about $132 billion since the full-scale invasion started. Within weeks it appears ready to provide tens of billions more, even though going it alone is not in the EU's DNA. 'I do not know what the Americans, the United States with the new presidency, will do or not,' EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on Tuesday. But, he said, 'as long as the Ukrainians want to resist, we have to support them. Otherwise, we will make a historical mistake.' The Biden administration did announce Wednesday that the U.S. will send Ukraine a major military aid package, including cluster bombs and an array of rockets, artillery and armored vehicles. A U.S. official also said billions of dollars more in assistance would arrive over the coming months. Meanwhile, deliberations on the EU's share of the G7 loan package will be high on the agenda of a summit of the bloc's leaders in Brussels on Oct. 17-18. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/eu-ukraine-us-russia-loans-aid-d9ed4389497b4f88647d488fdd7531e2	2024-09-26T21:20:48-07:00	
Helene makes landfall in northwestern Florida as a Category 4 hurricane	CRAWFORDVILLE, Fla. (AP) — Hurricane Helene made landfall in northwestern Florida as a Category 4 storm as forecasters warned that the enormous system could create a 'nightmare' storm surge and bring dangerous winds and rain across much of the southeastern U.S. There were at least three storm-related deaths. The National Hurricane Center in Miami said Helene roared ashore around 11:10 p.m. Thursday near the mouth of the Aucilla River in the Big Bend area of Florida’s Gulf Coast. It had maximum sustained winds estimated at 140 mph (225 kph). That location was only about 20 miles (32 kilometers) northwest of where Hurricane Idalia came ashore last year at nearly the same ferocity and caused widespread damage. Helene prompted hurricane and flash flood warnings extending far beyond the coast up into northern Georgia and western North Carolina. More than 1.2 million homes and businesses were without power in Florida, more than 190,000 in Georgia and more than 30,000 in the Carolinas, according to the tracking site poweroutage.us. The governors of those states and Alabama and Virginia all declared emergencies. One person was killed in Florida when a sign fell on their car and two people were reported killed in a possible tornado in south Georgia as the storm approached. 'When Floridians wake up tomorrow morning, we’re going to be waking up to a state where very likely there’s been additional loss of life and certainly there’s going to be loss of property,' Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said at a news conference Thursday night. Helene was moving rapidly inland after making landfall, with the center of the storm set to race from southern to northern Georgia through early Friday morning. The risk of tornadoes also would continue overnight and into the morning across north and central Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and southern North Carolina, forecasters said. Later Friday, there would be the risk of tornadoes in Virginia. 'Helene continues to produce catastrophic winds that are now pushing into southern Georgia,' the hurricane center said in an update at 1 a.m. Friday. 'Persons should not leave their shelters and remain in place through the passage of these life-threatening conditions.' Even before landfall, the storm's wrath was felt widely, with sustained tropical storm-force winds and hurricane-force gusts along Florida's west coast. Water lapped over a road in Siesta Key near Sarasota and covered some intersections in St. Pete Beach. Lumber and other debris from a fire in Cedar Key a week ago crashed ashore in the rising water. Beyond Florida, up to 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain had fallen in the North Carolina mountains, with up to 14 inches (36 centimeters) more possible before the deluge ends, setting the stage for flooding that forecasters warned could be worse than anything seen in the past century. Heavy rains began falling and winds were picking up earlier Thursday in Valdosta, Georgia, near the Florida state line. The weather service said more than a dozen Georgia counties could see hurricane-force winds exceeding 110 mph (177 kph). In south Georgia, two people were killed when a possible tornado struck a mobile home on Thursday night, Wheeler County Sheriff Randy Rigdon told WMAZ-TV. Wheeler County is about 70 miles (113 kilometers) southeast of Macon. The storm made landfall in the sparsely-populated Big Bend area, home to fishing villages and vacation hideaways where Florida’s Panhandle and peninsula meet. 'Please write your name, birthday, and important information on your arm or leg in a PERMANENT MARKER so that you can be identified and family notified,' the sheriff's office in mostly rural Taylor County warned those who chose not to evacuate in a Facebook post, the dire advice similar to what other officials have dolled out during past hurricanes. Still, Philip Tooke, a commercial fisherman who took over the business his father founded near the region’s Apalachee Bay, planned to ride out this storm like he did during Hurricane Michael and the others — on his boat. 'If I lose that, I don’t have anything,' Tooke said. Michael, a Category 5 storm, all but destroyed one town, fractured thousands of homes and businesses and caused some $25 billion in damage when it struck the Florida Panhandle in 2018. Many, though, were heeding the mandatory evacuation orders that stretched from the Panhandle south along the Gulf Coast in low-lying areas around Tallahassee, Gainesville, Cedar Key, Lake City, Tampa and Sarasota. Among them were Cindy Waymon and her husband, who went to a shelter in Tallahassee after securing their home and packing medications, snacks and drinks. They wanted to stay safe given the magnitude of the storm, she said. 'This is the first time we’ve actually come to a shelter, because of the complexities of the storm and the uncertainties,' she said. Federal authorities staged search-and-rescue teams as the weather service forecast storm surges of up to 20 feet (6 meters) and warned they could be particularly 'catastrophic and unsurvivable' in Apalachee Bay. 'Please, please, please take any evacuation orders seriously!' the office said, describing the surge scenario as 'a nightmare.' This stretch of Florida known as the Forgotten Coast has been largely spared by the widespread condo development and commercialization that dominates so many of Florida’s beach communities. The region is loved for its natural wonders — the vast stretches of salt marshes, tidal pools and barrier islands. 'You live down here, you run the risk of losing everything to a bad storm,' said Anthony Godwin, who lives about a half-mile (800 meters) from the water in the coastal town of Panacea, as he stopped for gas before heading west toward his sister’s house in Pensacola. School districts and multiple universities canceled classes. Airports in Tampa, Tallahassee and Clearwater were closed Thursday, while cancellations were widespread elsewhere in Florida and beyond. While Helene will likely weaken as it moves inland, damaging winds and heavy rain were expected to extend to the southern Appalachian Mountains, where landslides were possible, forecasters said. Tennessee was among the states expected to get drenched. Helene had swamped parts of Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula on Wednesday, flooding streets and toppling trees as it passed offshore and brushed the resort city of Cancun. In western Cuba, Helene knocked out power to more than 200,000 homes and businesses as it brushed past the island. Areas 100 miles (160 kilometers) north of the Georgia-Florida line expected hurricane conditions. The state opened its parks to evacuees and their pets, including horses. Overnight curfews were imposed in many cities and counties in south Georgia. 'This is one of the biggest storms we’ve ever had,' said Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp. For Atlanta, Helene could be the worst strike on a major Southern inland city in 35 years, said University of Georgia meteorology professor Marshall Shepherd. Helene is the eighth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which began June 1. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has predicted an above-average Atlantic hurricane season this year because of record-warm ocean temperatures. ___ Hollingsworth reported from Kansas City, Missouri.

Asian markets follow Wall Street higher on upbeat news from China, US	HONG KONG (AP) — Stocks in Asia advanced on Friday, led by gains in Hong Kong and other Chinese markets fueled by China's moves to rev up its economy. Japan’s Nikkei 225 index was up more than 1% as the ruling Liberal Democratic Party conducted a leadership election that will determine who is Japan’s next prime minister. The change in leadership is not expected to lead to any major policy shifts, given the similarities between the leading contenders. China’s central bank cut its reserve requirement for banks as of Friday as part of measures announced this week to help the property industry and support financial markets. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong advanced 3.7% to 20,659.03 and the Shanghai Composite index jumped 2.1% to 3,065.29. Meanwhile, the Shanghai Stock Exchange encountered glitches that hindered order processing and caused delays after the market opened on Friday. This led to a 6.4% increase in the Shenzhen index, as local media reported that investors flocked to that smaller market during the delay. Trading returned to normal by noon, and the Shanghai Stock Exchange later said in a statement that it was still investigating the causes. In the latest sign of the malaise hindering growth in the world's second-largest economy, the government reported that industrial profits fell nearly 18% year-on-year in August. Shares of Hong Kong’s property giant New World Development surged 21.5% on Friday trading after Adrian Cheng, the third-generation scion at the helm of the conglomerate, had been replaced. The firm reported an annual loss of over $2.4 billion in a profit warning last month, its first loss in nearly 20 years. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 index edged 1.4% higher to 39,451.25 after Tokyo’s consumer inflation, considered a leading indicator of nationwide trends, cooled to 2.2% year-on-year in September, in line with the market consensus. Elsewhere in Asia, Australia’s S&amp;P/ASX 200 added nearly 0.1% to 8,208.70. South Korea’s Kospi shed 0.2% to 2,666.01. On Thursday, the S&amp;P 500 added 0.4% to 5,745.37, setting an all-time high for the third time this week and the 42nd time this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6% to 42,175.11, while the Nasdaq composite rose 0.6% to 18,190.29. Micron Technology led the way with a jump of 14.7% after the maker of computer memory and storage products delivered stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It benefited from sales related to artificial-intelligence technology, where a boom has helped drive some stocks to astounding heights. Jabil climbed 11.7% after the electronics manufacturer likewise reported stronger profit and revenue than expected. It also announced a plan to plow cash to its shareholders by buying back up to $1 billion of its stock. The biggest drop in the S&amp;P 500 hit Super Micro Computer, which gave back some of its huge gains after more than tripling last year amid the AI frenzy. Its stock tumbled 12.2% following a report from The Wall Street Journal saying the U.S. Department of Justice is probing the seller of servers and storage systems. The company declined to comment. A round of reports on Thursday suggested the world’s largest economy may be doing better than expected. Fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week in the latest signal that layoffs remain relatively low across the economy. A separate report said the overall U.S. economy grew at a 3% annual rate during the spring, as previously estimated. That’s a solid rate. The hope on Wall Street is for a form of financial nirvana where the U.S. economy’s growth holds steady, keeping corporate profits humming while the Federal Reserve continues to lower interest rates. The Fed last week made a drastic turn in how it sets interest rates. It’s now cutting them to make things easier for the U.S. economy after keeping rates high for years in hopes of extinguishing high inflation. Lower rates not only make it less expensive to borrow money to buy a house, a car or things on credit cards, they can also boost prices for all kinds of investments. In other dealings early Friday, benchmark U.S. crude oil lost 15 cents to $67.52 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, gave up 19 cents at $70.90 per barrel. The U.S. dollar rose to 145.24 Japanese yen from 144.80 yen. The euro was trading at $1.1170, down from $1.1176. ___ AP Business Writer Stan Choe contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/stock-markets-rates-china-japan-4df6b51767d77295182961585e8ca163	2024-09-26T20:14:01-07:00	
Dozens of children drown while bathing during 3-day Hindu festival in eastern India	PATNA, India (AP) — Dozens of children drowned while bathing in rivers and ponds in rituals that were part of a three-day Hindu festival in eastern India's Bihar state, officials said. Heavy monsoon rains recently had raised the levels of waterways across the state. At least 46 people, including 37 children, drowned in separate incidents across the state’s 15 districts, a statement from Bihar’s disaster management department said. Authorities have recovered 43 bodies so far, and the three missing people are presumed to be dead. During the annual festival, mothers fast for 24 hours for the well-being of their children. The women are sometimes accompanied by their children when they visit rivers and ponds for cleansing rituals. The festival concluded Thursday. The state government has announced a compensation of 400,000 rupees ($4,784) for the families of each of the dead. Deadly accidents like drownings and stampedes during religious festivals are common in India. In July, at least 121 people were killed after severe overcrowding and a lack of exits contributed to a stampede at a religious festival in northern India.	https://apnews.com/article/india-drowning-hindu-festival-688500d6d4f73276bb62a4beba8e10bd	2024-09-26T19:36:55-07:00	
Lebanon fears Gaza-like carnage as Israel ramps up airstrikes across the country	When she first heard about the evacuation warnings Israel was sending to residents of Lebanon, Aline Naser’s thoughts immediately turned to Gaza. For the past year, the 26-year-old Beirut resident has been following with horror the reports about besieged Palestinians in the Gaza Strip ordered to move from one place to the other, fleeing to 'humanitarian zones' only to be bombed and ordered to leave again. The Israeli calls for Lebanese citizens to evacuate ahead of a widening air campaign, delivered via mobile phone alerts, calls and leaflets this week, seemed chillingly familiar. 'It’s definitely something on the back of my mind, and we don’t really know where exactly is safe,' she said. Almost a year after the start of its war in Gaza, Israel has turned its focus on Lebanon, significantly ratcheting up its campaign against its archenemy Hezbollah. Among many in Lebanon, there is fear that Israel’s military operations in Lebanon would follow the same Gaza playbook: Evacuation orders, mass displacement and overwhelming airstrikes. Israel says its strikes target Hezbollah weapons sites and militants. There are key differences between Gaza and Lebanon and how Israel has so far conducted its operations, which it says aim to push back Hezbollah from the border so that tens of thousands of Israelis displaced by Hezbollah's rocket attacks can return to their homes. Although it has said it is preparing for a possible ground operation, Israel has so far not sent troops into Lebanon. Still, there are fears that Israel’s actions in Gaza, including the use of overwhelming and what rights groups and the United Nations have described as disproportionate force, would be repeated in Lebanon. Top Israeli officials have threatened to repeat the destruction of Gaza in Lebanon if the Hezbollah fire continues. On Monday, Israel struck 1,600 targets across Lebanon, killing 492 people and wounding 1,645, and causing a massive wave of displacement as thousands fled from south Lebanon north. It was a staggering one-day toll that shocked a nation used to war. It was by far the deadliest barrage since the monthlong 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war, when an estimated 1,000 people in Lebanon were killed. Throughout the day, the Israeli military sent warnings to residents to immediately evacuate in anticipation of the strikes and to stay away from places where Hezbollah stores weapons — something most would have no way of knowing. 'Please get out of harm’s way now,' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a recorded message. 'Once our operation is finished, you can come back safely to your homes.' Israel’s evacuation orders have been a central part of its military campaign in Gaza for the past year. In the first week after launching war, Israel ordered 1.1 million civilians in the Gaza Strip to relocate from the north to the south, sowing confusion and fear in the overcrowded enclave. Since then, the Israeli military has issued dozens of evacuation orders calling on Palestinians to evacuate to Israeli-designated 'humanitarian zones.' Israeli officials say they are targeting Hamas militants who have embedded themselves among the population. Israel’s campaign in Gaza has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, according to health officials in Gaza. The Health Ministry, part of the territory’s Hamas government, does not differentiate between civilians and combatants, but says that just over half the dead have been women and children.' With Gaza's borders sealed, residents of the crammed territory are trapped with nowhere to go, whereas in Lebanon, those fleeing Israeli strikes have been able to move to safer areas. Thousands have fled to neighboring Syria, while others have left through the country’s airport. A second front for Israel Hezbollah started firing rockets on Israel in support of Gaza on Oct. 8, a day after Hamas militants launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing some 1,200 people and abducting another 250. Since then, the two sides have been engaged in cross border strikes that have gradually escalated and displaced tens of thousands of civilians on both sides of the border. Many Lebanese have been following the growing hostilities with a mixture of nonchalance and dread, hoping they would remain contained. Lebanon has been in the throes of an economic meltdown since 2019 and can ill afford another devastating war with Israel. Hostilities escalated dramatically last week when thousands of explosives hidden in pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah detonated, killing dozens of people and leaving thousands, including many civilians, with severe injuries to the eyes, face and limbs. Israel is widely believed to be behind the attack. Israel has also killed several top Hezbollah commanders in Beirut. Meanwhile, intensifying Hezbollah barrages have wounded several people in Israel. As the region appeared to be teetering toward another all-out war, Jana Bsat, 25, who works for a media analysis company in Beirut, said she now has a bag packed, ready for immediate evacuation. She feels it’s only a matter of time. 'It feels surreal, to be honest. We heard about what was happening in Gaza and now we’re experiencing it for ourselves,' she said. 'I am in disgust of all this fear-mongering and psychological torture,' she said, adding: 'But then you remember, it’s all part of a warfare strategy and it’s not going to stop anytime soon.' Lebanon is not Gaza While Israel’s actions in Lebanon may have echoes of Gaza, the conflicts are different. In Gaza, Israel’s goal is the complete destruction of Hamas, whereas Israel’s stated goal in Lebanon is to push Hezbollah away from its border. Whereas Hamas rules Gaza, Hezbollah is a powerful militia with enormous influence inside Lebanon, and has representatives in the country's parliament and government. In 2006, Israel flattened entire Beirut neighborhoods and bombed Lebanon's only international airport as well as key infrastructure, including bridges and power stations. By contrast, its current campaign seems to be, for the large part, targeting Hezbollah, although many civilians have also been killed. Unlike Gaza, Lebanon is also a mixed tapestry of political and religious groups, including Christian and Sunni-majority areas where there is significant opposition to the Iran-backed Shiite Hezbollah. Ali Safa, a 30-year-old interior designer who fled to Beirut from south Lebanon with his family this week, said he isn’t worried about the Gaza scenario being repeated in Lebanon. 'Gaza is an open prison, it is besieged. Lebanon is much larger, it is not encircled. And it has Hezbollah, which is a much bigger force, much better-equipped than Hamas,' he said. U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres, speaking at the United Nations Wednesday, said the world 'cannot afford Lebanon to become another Gaza.' Frayed nerves Whether the current hostilities will expand into an all-out war or whether Israel will launch a ground invasion remains to be seen. Israel’s army chief said Wednesday that preparations were underway for a possible ground operation. Many in Lebanon say they are haunted by the nonstop churn of horrifying images from Gaza over the past year, fearing the same scenario in Lebanon. For several months, low-flying Israeli fighter jets have launched sonic booms over Lebanon, rattling windows and terrifying residents. More recently, the buzzing sound of Israeli military drones in Lebanese skies have added to the anxiety. Some have gotten used to it. At a funeral for a Hezbollah commander recently where a few hundred people gathered, hardly anyone flinched when low-flying Israeli planes caused a thundering boom that shook the ground. Bsat said at some point she, too, got used to hearing sonic booms that made the windows in her house shake. 'The drones I also got used to and now, unfortunately, the bombing,' she said via Whatsapp. 'I’ve come to terms with reality, but my hands still can’t stop shaking as I’m writing this,' she said. 'I’m still dreading what is going to happen here.'	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-gaza-hezbollah-hamas-war-fears-ca37a9b6314d327f8719a4f513e81233	2024-09-26T19:29:38-07:00	
Mexico's populist president held court each morning for 6 years. Now he's retiring from public life	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Every day at 7 a.m., President Andrés Manuel López Obrador strolls onto a stage in Mexico's National Palace, clad in a smart suit and tie, and peers out at a room of bleary-eyed reporters and social media personalities. 'Buenos días, look alive!' the 70-year-old leader calls out in a gravelly voice. And the show begins. Throughout his nearly six-year term in office, López Obrador’s morning media briefings, known as 'las mañaneras,' have provided him with a powerful tool: a direct line to his political base, broadcast live on government and local news channels, and streaming online. Without pausing to take bathroom breaks or even a sip of water, the president stands at the podium talking for sometimes more than three hours, often in long, roundabout musings or rambling diatribes, all in simple language that anyone tuning in can understand. Before he leaves office Monday, the daily briefings, beloved by many supporters and criticized by opponents as full of falsehoods and personal attacks, are emblematic of the particular brand of folksy populism that López Obrador wielded to become one of the most powerful political forces Mexico has seen in decades. It's a model that his successor and protege, President-elect Claudia Sheinbaum, will be hard-pressed to emulate. 'The national conversation revolves around him,' said Daniela Lemus, a National Autonomous University of Mexico professor who researches political communication and has written about the briefings. 'He is the protagonist of the mañaneras … and what he says becomes the main topic of conversation by the media, day and night.' When López Obrador won the presidency in a landslide in 2018, he pitched himself as a fighter for poor, working-class and rural Mexicans long neglected by the political elite. He started holding the briefings right after taking office that December, and has continued to do so every workday almost without fail for the duration of his time in office. They're popular with his base: One older adult couple in Mexico City, for example, tune in religiously on a small TV wedged between bags of seeds and nuts at their stall in a food market. Elsewhere, a magazine vendor records the broadcast to watch at night after work. Still another fan of AMLO, as the president is popularly known, streams it on social media while he looks for work. 'The mañaneras have opened our eyes. They show us all what Mr. López Obrador has achieved,' said Jesús Hernández Alarcón, a 79-year-old roasted corn vendor. 'We have understood a lot because the media is full of lies, many have tricked us. Now that we have the mañaneras, everything has changed for me.' López Obrador often uses the space to provide updates on key projects and take questions from a cluster of journalists and government-friendly social media influencers, some of whom have gained a platform from their participation in the briefings — such as Carlos Pozos Soto, an eccentric, bow-tied, effusively pro-AMLO figure better known as Lord Molecule. As time has gone on, the briefings have morphed into something resembling a morning show, with López Obrador inviting mariachi bands to serenade viewers on Mother’s Day, lecturing at length on Mexican history and hosting recurring segments such as 'Who's who in the lies of the week,' in which government officials attack critical media. 'This is a way to educate, to raise awareness so that (traditional news organizations) cannot manipulate' information, López Obrador said one morning in August. 'People are more informed, and that comes with a lot of advantages. … There is no topic that is off limits, there is no censorship.' López Obrador’s willingness to publicly joust with journalists has had all the more impact because his predecessor, Enrique Peña Nieto, almost never took a question during his own six-year term. But while the president calls the briefings a bastion of transparency in a nation long plagued by corruption, critics say he has used them to badmouth opponents and journalists, spread false information and firmly control the political narrative. Often, rather than answering a question directly, he instead uses it as a launching pad to talk about one of his preferred topics. He consistently sidesteps questions about Mexico's continuing cartel-fueled violence, for example, or pivots to rail against his predecessors for starting the drug war. López Obrador has attacked judges, criticized opponents during election campaigns and regularly targeted both domestic and foreign journalists. In February, after a New York Times reporter sought comment for an article investigating ties between his administration and drug cartels, the president disclosed her cellphone number during a morning briefing. And last month, when an independent Mexican journalist said she had been harassed by a mob of his supporters and forced to flee an event she was covering, López Obrador responded with a mix of scorn and disinterest. 'I am at risk because of this, now anyone can attack me in the street,' Reyna Ramírez told the president. 'You have polarized society. Don’t you have anything to say about that?' 'Have you gone on long enough?' the president said. Advocates for press freedom have expressed concern over his hostility toward critical media in a place that is more dangerous for journalists than any other country not currently at war. At least 138 journalists have been killed in Mexico in the past 20 years, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, and many more have gone missing or been threatened, attacked, tortured or forced to flee their homes. The president's discourse created 'a narrative of us versus them, of journalists being the enemies of this political project, the opponents of the people … diminishing the urgency of protecting press freedom,' said Jan-Albert Hootsen, the CPJ's Mexico representative. Meanwhile a 2021 report by the political consulting agency SPIN found that López Obrador made more than 56,000 false or misleading statements in his mañaneras in a period covering 2 1/2 years. Among them is his assertion that cartels ' respect citizens ' and only fight among themselves. 'Just because the president is walking up to a stage and is talking about something, doesn’t mean he's being open,' Hootsen said. 'If he’s lying all the time, and there are no consequences, then we’re not talking about transparency.' In the age of social media, videos and soundbites from the mañaneras often go viral online, further boosting the president’s audience. 'It’s not what happens in the morning press conference itself, but what happens after,' said Kevin Zapata, a social and public policy professor at the University de Nottingham who has studied the briefings. 'A 30-second clip can be more powerful than the two hours on the TV.' For people who may not have much time to investigate López Obrador's claims and deeply distrust Mexican media, it's often the government's narrative that ends up dominating. When asked about false information and attacks on journalists, his supporters often repeat the president's lines of attack, for example saying such criticism comes from a corrupt opposition and the president is defending Mexican sovereignty. López Obrador's popularity spurred his Morena party to major electoral gains in the June elections. Morena will have an even greater majority in Congress as Sheinbaum takes up the presidency, and lawmakers recently passed a constitutional amendment that observers and critics say is likely to result in courts being stacked with judges friendly to the party. Sheinbaum has said she will continue the morning broadcasts. But most Mexicans agree that she lacks the natural charisma that has allowed López Obrador to wield the mañaneras so effectively. 'It’s something that worked for AMLO because he’s a very unique figure and very charismatic. ... But now democracy is becoming a popularity show in Mexico,' Zapata said. 'Many people will try to emulate it, that’s for sure. But not everyone will be able to.' ___ Follow AP's Latin America coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-lopez-obrador-mananeras-daily-briefings-81245ec04ad9843f3bfa64cfad2ce66b	2024-09-26T19:26:10-07:00	
Trump and Zelenskyy meet in New York amid rising questions about US support for Ukraine	NEW YORK (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met face-to-face with Donald Trump on Friday with public tensions rising between the two over Ukraine's defense against Russia's invasion and in the midst of the U.S. presidential election. 'We both want to see this end, and we both want to see a fair deal made,' Trump told Fox News while standing alongside Zelenskyy after meeting for 40 minutes. 'The president wants it to end, and he wants it to end as quickly as possible. He wants a fair transaction to take place.' Zelenskyy said the war shouldn't have started and added that there needs to be pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin and peace for the families of those killed. 'We need to do everything to pressure him to stop this war. He is in our territory. That's most important to understand. He is in our territory.' The meeting came at a critical time in the Russia-Ukraine war as Election Day nears in the U.S. Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, his Democratic opponent, have taken sharply different approaches to Ukraine. Zelenskyy has been eager to keep good relations with the United States, his country's largest provider of arms and money for the war. But the future of that support would be in doubt if Trump were to win the election. Trump, who has touted his good relationship with Putin and called the Russian leader 'pretty smart' for invading Ukraine, has for months criticized U.S. support for Ukraine and derided Zelenskyy as a 'salesman' for persuading Washington to provide weapons and funding to his military as it tries to fend off Moscow. On Friday, Trump brought up his first impeachment, which Democrats in Congress pursued after he asked Zelenskyy for a 'favor' — that he investigate Joe Biden, now the president, and Biden’s son Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. At the time Trump asked for the 'favor,' he was withholding $400 million in military aid to Ukraine as it fought Russian-backed separatists on its eastern boundary. He was later acquitted of the impeachment charges by a Republican-led Senate. 'He could have grandstanded and played cute,' Trump said. 'And he didn't do that. He said, ‘President Trump did absolutely nothing wrong.’ He said it loud and clear.' Zelenskyy told reporters in October 2019, as Congress was launching its impeachment inquiry, that there was 'no blackmail' from Trump. He also told reporters, 'I don’t want to interfere in any way in the elections,' trying to publicly and privately distance himself then from U.S. domestic politics. But The Associated Press reported afterward that, despite Zelenskyy’s denials, U.S. officials were aware he was feeling pressure from the Trump administration to investigate Biden even before his phone call with Trump regarding the 'favor.' Friday's meeting almost wasn't scheduled despite Zelenskyy’s office saying something had been planned during the Ukrainian leader’s visit to the U.N. General Assembly, during which he is making his endgame pitch to allies. In an interview with The New Yorker that was published earlier this week, Zelenskyy implied Trump does not understand and oversimplifies the conflict. The Ukrainian leader said Trump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, was 'too radical' and has essentially advocated for Ukraine to 'make a sacrifice' by 'giving up its territories.' Trump ripped Zelenskyy and Ukraine on two separate occasions this week. Speaking Wednesday in North Carolina, he referred to Ukraine as 'demolished' and its people as 'dead.' 'Any deal — the worst deal — would’ve been better than what we have now,' Trump said. 'If they made a bad deal, it would’ve been much better. They would’ve given up a little bit and everybody would be living and every building would be built and every tower would be aging for another 2,000 years.' Meanwhile, Harris on Thursday stood alongside Zelenskyy and said Trump's push for Ukraine to quickly cut a deal to end the war was 'not proposals for peace,' but 'proposals for surrender.' Trump on Thursday said he was not advocating for a surrender. As he was preparing to sit down for the Friday meeting, Trump was asked by a reporter if Ukraine could win the war and he replied, 'Sure. They could.' He said of Zelenskyy: 'We have a very good relationship. And I also have a very good relationship, as you know, with President Putin. And if we win, I think we’re going to get it resolved very quickly.' Zelenskyy cut into Trump's remarks with, 'I hope we have more good relations between us.' Before moving on to another question, Trump interjected to say 'but, you know, it takes two to tango.' ___ Gomez Licon reported from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and Mascaro from Washington.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-zelenskyy-trump-tower-meeting-7c163eb5068c5003b219b6d524436517	2024-09-26T19:05:15-07:00	
Titan implosion hearing paints a picture of reckless greed and explorer passion	Witnesses testified that the company that operated an experimental deep-water submersible that imploded, killing five people, put profits over safety and ignored warning signs before the disaster. Several company officials, meanwhile, spoke of the explorer spirit and taking calculated risks to push humankind’s boundaries. Those different viewpoints emerged as the Coast Guard panel on Friday wraps up two weeks of testimony on the Titan disaster last year. The panel is tasked with determining why the carbon-fiber submersible was lost 12,500 feet (3,810 meters) deep on the ocean floor near the wreck of the Titanic. Testimony painted contrasting images of greed and hubris as OceanGate sought out well-heeled clients for its submersible made from carbon fiber — a material that was untested at such depths — versus modern-day explorers who carefully considered risks as they sought to open the deepest depths of the world’s oceans to more people. Guillermo Sohnlein, who helped found OceanGate with Stockton Rush, described the lofty goal 'to give humanity greater access to the ocean, specifically the deep ocean.' Using carbon fiber for the pressure hull was hardly a novel idea, he said, and noted Rush himself was the first human to test the design. But former operations director David Lochridge said the company was committed only to profit making. 'The whole idea behind the company was to make money,' he testified. 'There was very little in the way of science.' Witnesses could not even agree on what to call the wealthy clients who paid $250,000 for the experience. Some said they were simply passengers, even though OceanGate called them 'mission specialists' who were given tasks. Killed in the implosion were Rush and four others including Paul-Henri Nargeolet, who was director of underwater research for RMS Titanic, which holds the legal rights to salvage the wreck of the ship. Nargeolet’s family is suing for more than $50 million, accusing the sub’s operator of gross negligence. The carbon-fiber pressure hull of Titan was the subject of much of the discussion. An expert witness, Roy Thomas, senior principal engineer at the American Bureau of Shipping, testified that carbon-fiber may be strong and light, but that it’s tricky to manufacture. Carbon fiber also is 'susceptible to fatigue failure' under repeated pressurization and salt water can weaken the material in multiple ways, he said. Coast Guard officials noted at the start of the hearing, held in South Carolina, that the submersible had not been independently reviewed, as is standard practice. Witnesses testified they had heard loud cracking sounds in past descents. And scientific director Steven Ross said that, on a dive just a few days before the Titan imploded, the vessel became unstable because of a ballast problem, causing passengers to tumble and crash into a bulkhead. During its final dive on June 18, 2023, the crew lost contact after an exchange of texts as it descended. One of the last messages from Titan’s crew to the Polar Prince support ship before the submersible imploded stated, 'all good here.' The crew of Polar Prince, meanwhile, grew increasingly concerned. Ships, planes and other equipment assembled for a rescue operation about 435 miles (700 kilometers) south of St. John’s, Newfoundland. Wreckage of the Titan was subsequently found on the ocean floor about 330 yards (300 meters) off the bow of the Titanic, Coast Guard officials said.	https://apnews.com/article/titan-submersible-disaster-coast-guard-hearing-f991bd49eb1f49b303477bfcab8923f1	2024-09-26T19:02:20-07:00

A crucial party election Friday will determine Japan's new prime minister	TOKYO (AP) — A crucial party election in Japan on Friday will determine the nation's new prime minister. The vote by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party will technically choose a new party leader, but since the party has a decades-long stranglehold on power, the winner will become prime minister when the current leadership resigns on Tuesday. The current p rime minister, Fumio Kishida, has been dogged by corruption scandals, and his party is looking for a fresh leader to try to regain public trust. A record nine lawmakers, including two women, are vying for the job. The vote is limited to LDP members of parliament and about 1 million dues-paying party members. That's only 1% of eligible voters. Past votes were often determined by the party’s powerful faction leaders, but that may change this time because all but one of the six factions has announced their dissolution following the corruption scandals. There's widespread worry among experts that the removal of faction support from whoever wins could mean Japan will return to an era similar to the early 2000s, which saw 'revolving door' leadership changes and political instability. A succession of short-lived governments hurts Japanese prime ministers' ability to set up long-term policy goals or develop trusted relations with other leaders. Backroom dealing among party heavyweights makes this election hard to predict, but Shigeru Ishiba, a former defense minister, has steadily ranked No. 1 in media surveys. Environment Minister Shinjiro Koizumi, the son of a former popular prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, is behind Ishiba. Economic Security Minister Sanae Takaichi, an Abe protege and staunch conservative who ran against Kishida in 2021, is third by a narrow margin. Experts say two of the three are expected to advance to a runoff. If one of the women wins the vote — Takaichi or Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa — she would become Japan’s first female leader. Women make up only 10.3% of Japan’s lower house of parliament. That makes the country 163rd for female representation among 190 countries examined in an April report by the Geneva-based Inter-Parliamentary Union. On Tuesday, Kishida and his Cabinet ministers will resign. The new leader, after a parliamentary endorsement, will then form a new Cabinet later in the day. The main opposition — the liberal-leaning Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan — has struggled to build momentum, despite the LDP scandals. ___ Follow AP's Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific	https://apnews.com/article/japan-election-new-prime-minister-ca3ba06b79c79d5dc534a0d259a7272c	2024-09-26T16:17:37-07:00	
Venezuelans crossing the Darien Gap say they lost hope after July's election	LAJAS BLANCAS, Panama (AP) — Venezuelans trekking across the Darien Gap – a rugged jungle passage between Colombia and Panama – say they're making the perilous journey because they lost hope for change after a contentious presidential election handed victory to President Nicolás Maduro despite vote tallies released by the opposition showing that his competitor won by a landslide. 'We stayed waiting for the election (results) because if Maduro left (power) then we would stay. But nothing happened,' said Enrique Dordis, 46, a former cab driver from the central state of Carabobo, who left Venezuela last week with his wife, an 8-year-old son, Emanuel, and four other family members. Tucked in a tent in the Lajas Blancas camp, he reflected Thursday on the raging rivers and heavy downpours the family had to face in their four-day trek across the dense jungle, once believed to be nearly impossible to cross. 'Money is not enough. You get desperate and you have to look for a better future for your children,' he said. Last year, more than half a million migrants – a record number – crossed through the Darien on their way to the United States. More than 60% of them were Venezuelans fleeing economic and political turmoil by the millions. Those who didn’t migrate held onto hope that their country, once one of Latin America’s wealthiest, would someday bounce back. While migration from Venezuela has since slowed along the border from record levels, the disputed results of the July election and the state repression that followed was the final straw, and many fear it could potentially trigger a new wave of migration. 'We feel very disappointed after the election, which was a total fraud,' said Rosimar Angulo, a Venezuelan staying with other migrants in a small Red Cross reception center on Thursday morning at the mouth of the jungle passage. Angulo arrived in the camp after traveling by boat from Bajo Chiquito, where migrants make their first registration with Panamanian authorities, after trudging days through the jungle on foot. 'It’s getting harder and harder, our relatives are getting sick,' Angulo said, as a fellow traveler was carried on a stretcher by members of the Red Cross. Like Angulo, many of the Venezuelans arriving to Lajas Blancas said that they made the decision to leave shortly after Venezuela’s electoral authority handed victory to Maduro, despite vote tallies released by the opposition showing that his competitor won by a landslide. More than half a dozen Venezuelan migrants interviewed said they held out until several weeks after the election, hoping for a favorable outcome for opposition candidate Edmundo González — who has since left the country — and encouraged by street demonstrations led by leader María Corina Machado. 'For us, the same government winning again means there will be no improvement in the country,' said Laura Naveda, a migrant traveling with 13 family members, including several children. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-darien-gap-maduro-election-migration-us-138b9d6127dde6c97f1fca75aaf79cd5	2024-09-26T15:02:21-07:00	
The families of 43 missing students in Mexico are still demanding justice 10 years later	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Families of the 43 students from a rural teacher’s college abducted 10 years ago in southern Mexico marked the painful anniversary Thursday disillusioned after what they say was a decade of unfulfilled government promises. Thousands marched with the families in the rain through Mexico's capital demanding the truth about what happened and justice for the missing. 'The first time we came through here, who could have imagined that all of this time would pass and (we're) here again without answers,' said Margarito Guerrero, the father of missing student Jhosivani Guerrero de la Cruz. Guerrero appreciated those who accompanied them, like Lourdes Silva, a homemaker, participating in her first march with her daughter, a student who has been following the families' movement for a decade. 'We need to keep pressuring,' Silva said. 'We want this agony to end for the parents.' The anniversary falls just four days before the departure of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, whose election in 2018 generated hope among the families. His administration made some early advances, established a Truth Commission and declared the disappearances a 'state crime.' But when the investigation stalled without the cooperation of the military, the president closed ranks with the generals. 'He gave us a lot of hope,' said Joaquina García, mother of missing student Martín Getsemany Sánchez. 'But it looks like he really protects the military and that’s not fair.' On Sept. 26, 2014, students from the Rural Normal School at Ayotzinapa went to Iguala to steal buses – a common way they obtained transportation. They were attacked by a local drug gang in cahoots with local, state and federal authorities. Two administrations later, many details of what happened to the students and most importantly where they are remain unknown. They are among the more than 115,000 recorded missing in Mexico. 'Ten years of suffering, 10 years of pain, of not having your son isn’t easy,' García said at an event Thursday at Mexico’s National Autonomous University. 'Here we’re shouting to see if the people who took our children will find it in their heart.' Some 120 people are in custody. Mexico’s former attorney general has been charged in inventing a false narrative about what happened. López Obrador had promised to solve mystery. But on Wednesday, he downplayed, minimized and even pushed back against the findings of his own administration, asserting that those trying to link the military are driven by 'political interests.' The United Nations Human Rights Office lamented in a statement Thursday the 'unsatisfactory results' of authorities. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, which sent experts to Mexico to aid in the investigation for eight years said in a statement it was worried the investigation had stalled and denounced a 'pact of silence that has impeded the identification of the perpetrators and those who cover for them.' The families are prepared to pressure incoming President Claudia Sheinbaum as well. 'We're going to press her if she doesn't respond,' Guerrero said. García agreed. 'This fight is not over.'	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-missing-students-ayotzinapa-b46b193319fdcd6cdf92c0ce0d0699da	2024-09-26T11:26:04-07:00	
What is the 2006 UN resolution that some hope could help to end the Israel-Hezbollah conflict?	BEIRUT (AP) — In 2006, after a bruising monthlong war between Israel and Lebanon's powerful Hezbollah militant group, the United Nations Security Council unanimously voted for a resolution to end the conflict and pave the way for lasting security along the border. But while there was relative calm for nearly two decades, Resolution 1701's terms were never fully enforced. And now, after nearly a year of low-level clashes, Israel and Hezbollah appear on the verge of another all-out war. As Israeli jets pound deep inside Lebanon and Hezbollah fires rockets deeper into northern Israel, U.N. and diplomatic officials have again turned to the 2006 resolution in a bid to end the conflict. Years of deeply divided politics and regionwide geopolitical hostilities have halted substantial progress on its implementation, yet Resolution 1701 is still considered the brightest prospect for long-term stability between Israel and Lebanon. What is UNSC Resolution 1701? In 2000, Israel withdrew its forces from most of southern Lebanon along a U.N.-demarcated 'Blue Line' that separated the two countries and the annexed Golan Heights. U.N. peacekeeping forces in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, increased their presence along the line of withdrawal. Resolution 1701 was supposed to finish the incomplete work from 2000 and end the 2006 war; Israeli forces would fully withdraw while the Lebanese army and UNIFIL — Hezbollah excluded — would be the exclusive armed presence south of Lebanon's Litani River. The Lebanese state was to have full sovereignty over its south. Meanwhile, up to 15,000 U.N. peacekeepers would help to maintain calm, return displaced Lebanese and secure the area alongside the Lebanese military. The goal was long-term security, with land borders eventually demarcated to resolve territorial disputes. 'It was made for a certain situation and context,' Elias Hanna, a retired Lebanese army general, told The Associated Press. 'But as time goes on, the essence of the resolution begins to hollow.' Has it been implemented? For years, Lebanon and Israel blamed each other for countless violations along the tense frontier. Israel says Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force and growing arsenal remain, and accuses the group of using a local environmental organization to spy on troops. Lebanon complains about military jets and naval ships entering Lebanese territory even when there is no active conflict. 'You had a role of the UNIFIL that slowly eroded like any other peacekeeping with time that has no clear mandate,' said Joseph Bahout, the director of the Issam Fares Institute for Public Policy at the American University of Beirut. 'They don’t have permission to inspect the area without coordinating with the Lebanese army.' UNIFIL for years has urged Israel to withdraw from some territory north of the frontier, but to no avail. Hezbollah’s power has meanwhile grown, both in its arsenal and as a political influence in parliament. The Iran-backed group was essential in keeping Syrian President Bashar Assad in power when armed opposition groups tried to topple him, and it supports Iran-backed groups in Iraq and Yemen. It has an estimated 150,000 rockets and missiles, including precision-guided missiles pointed at Israel, and has introduced drones into its arsenal. Hanna says Hezbollah 'is something never seen before as a non-state actor' with political and military influence. How relevant is 1701 to ending the current hostilities? Efforts led by the U.S. and France for a temporary ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah have underscored that they still view the resolution as key. For almost a year, Washington has promoted various versions of a deal that would gradually lead to its full implementation. But the circumstances now are far more complicated than in 2006. Israel says its aerial bombardments aim to push Hezbollah back and allow its northern residents to return home safely. Hezbollah says it will stop firing rockets only once there is a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, where Israel continues to battle Hezbollah's key ally Hamas. Negotiations for a ceasefire there are gridlocked. 'You’re tying 1701 with a hundred things,' Bahout said. 'A resolution is the reflection of a balance of power and political context.' So while the Security Council resolution’s goals are still relevant, new issues have emerged that have sidelined its implementation.

Top Haitian official denounces false claim, repeated by Trump, that immigrants are eating pets	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — A strange moment in American politics paid a visit to the U.N. General Assembly on Thursday, brought there by a top Haitian official. Edgar Leblanc Fils, the president of Haiti’s transitional council, spoke to world leaders about gang violence in his country and bemoaned the large number of citizens fleeing the violence. Then he referenced false claims that Haitians living in Springfield, Ohio, were eating cats and dogs. The debunked information found its international spotlight in the U.S. presidential debate earlier this month, in which former President Donald Trump repeated the claims that have circulated on the internet and been amplified by his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance. The Republican ticket is criticizing the immigration policies of President Joe Biden’s administration, which are supported by Trump’s Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris. In his General Assembly address, Fils made clear his country’s concern about the repercussions of the false claims about fellow Haitians. 'I would like to extend a brotherly greeting to all friends of Haiti that have shown solidarity towards the migrants from our country — and in particular those living in Springfield, Ohio,' he said. The history of U.S-Haitian ties 'enables us to say with confidence that the American people reject any incitement to hate against our community,' he said. 'The passions that naturally arise during an election campaign should never serve as a pretext for xenophobia or racism in a country such as the United States, a country forged by immigrants from all countries, and which has become a model of democracy for the world.' During the debate with Harris, Trump specifically mentioned Springfield, saying that immigrants were taking over the city. 'They’re eating the dogs. They’re eating the cats. They’re eating the pets of the people that live there,' he said. ___ See more of AP’s coverage of the U.N.

Somali-Canadian rapper K’naan charged with 2010 sexual assault in Quebec City	QUEBEC CITY (AP) — Canadian rapper K’naan, known for the global hit 'Wavin’ Flag,' has been charged over an alleged sexual assault in Quebec City dating back more than 14 years. A charge sheet filed at the courthouse in Quebec City on Thursday says the rapper, whose given name is Keinan Abdi Warsame, is charged with one count of sexual assault from July 2010. The arrest warrant alleges the assault took place between July 16 and July 17, 2010, dates that coincide with the musician’s appearance at Quebec City’s popular Festival d’été de Québec. The case was before the court, but the accused wasn't present. His lawyers weren’t immediately available for comment. The victim, whose identity is protected, was 29 at the time of the alleged assault. The Somalia-born musician grew up in Toronto, but resides in Brooklyn, New York, according to the charge sheet. K’naan was given the cultural impact award at Canada’s SOCAN Awards on Tuesday for the global resonance of the 2009 hit 'Wavin’ Flag.'	https://apnews.com/article/knaan-sexual-assault-charge-quebec-city-canada-9fa6817a6be5b555f07d62e4590dd4ce	2024-09-26T10:28:26-07:00	
Argentina's poverty rate spikes in first 6 months of President Milei's shock therapy	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — Argentina's poverty rate jumped from almost 42% to 53% during the first six months of Javier Milei' s presidency, the statistics agency reported Thursday, a steep rise reflecting the pain of the country's most intense austerity program in recent memory. The government's finding that Argentina's half-year poverty rate in 2024 had surged to its highest level since 2003, when the country was reeling from a catastrophic foreign debt default and currency devaluation, marks a setback for the far-right economist. So far, foreign investors and the International Monetary Fund — to which Argentina owes $43 billion — have cheered his controversial fiscal shock therapy that has succeeded in pulling down the country's monthly inflation from 25.5% last December to 4.2% in recent months. Argentina’s inflation, now running at more than 230% annually, is among the worst in the world. Bracing for negative news hours before the poverty report's release, Milei's spokesperson sought to deflect the blow in a lengthy press conference. 'The government inherited a disastrous situation,' Manuel Adorni told reporters, lambasting the decades of unbridled spending under Milei's left-leaning Peronist predecessors that generated chronic inflation. 'They left us on the brink of being a country with essentially all of its inhabitants poor.' Unlike previous populist governments that kept consumer spending high at the cost of a massive budget deficit, Milei dismantled price controls, cut subsidies on energy and transport and devalued the peso by 54% in December after taking office. The austerity measures and deregulation have marked a brutal contraction in spending power and dragged the economy deep into recession. A political outsider who made fighting Argentina’s dizzying inflation his flagship campaign promise, Milei is betting that if his government can keep prices falling, growth will return and fuel a miraculous recovery. Milei’s austerity measures have helped drive down the yearly inflation rate from a peak of almost 300% in April. His government’s budget proposal expects annual inflation to drop to 122.9% by the end of the year. But the months ahead will be tricky, economists say. After its initial decline, monthly inflation has been stuck around 4% since July. Milei’s 2025 budget proposal aims for a fiscal surplus of over 1.3% of the country’s annual economic output. That would require further spending cuts as calls to restart frozen public works and boost pensions and wages grow louder. A thinning safety net Of the millions who can’t clear Argentina’s official poverty level of about $950 a month in local currency for a family of four, even more have tumbled into destitution. Thursday’s poverty report showed that Argentina’s extreme poverty rate had shot up to 18.1% during Milei’s first six months as president from 11.9% in the last half of 2023. Among those affected is 32-year-old Rocío Costa, who said the rapidly rising prices have sapped her family’s meager income of just over $400 a month. Comforts like hair-dye, soft drinks and pizza had long been out of reach, but in July she realized she didn’t have enough money to both buy diapers for her four-month-old and put dinner on the table for her family of five. 'There wasn’t even a package of noodles, there was nothing,' Costa said from her home in the capital of Buenos Aires. 'The Milei government is killing me.' Desperate, Costa turned to friends and volunteers and eventually secured diapers at a social assistance center and $1 second-hand sneakers for her daughter at a local parish. 'We are plugging the holes,' she said. A jobs crisis The runaway inflation — shocking even for Argentines who lived through years of annual inflation averaging above 50% — has forced middle-class Argentines to cut back on spending and drain their savings. The economy has contracted 3% so far this year. Government surveys reveal that both Argentina’s vast informal jobs market and formal workforce have hemorrhaged hundreds of thousands of jobs since Milei took office. That has put more of Argentina’s once-robust middle class in danger of sliding into poverty. 'I’m part of Argentina’s lost middle class,' said 48-year-old Leonardo Constantino. Before he lost his job six years ago, he had a regular paycheck working in restaurants and played padel, the popular racket sport, with friends whenever he could. Finding a new job has never been harder. 'It kept getting worse,' he said. Now a weekend bouncer earning just $155 a month, he said he couldn’t afford basic household items without help from the Buenos Aires municipality. Some months ago, he gave up his favorite hobby. The $6 padel court fee had become too much. Sky-high bills For decades low-paid Argentines have navigated their upside-down economy by padding their meager incomes with government cash transfers and generous subsidies that reduced the cost of utilities, food and transport. But utilities bills jumped over 200% for many after Milei scrapped the subsidies to trim the deficit. For Sofia Gonzalez Figueroa, a 36-year-old single mother who last year paid $10 a month for electricity, the pain of Milei’s austerity was instantaneous. Her utilities bill skyrocketed by 830%. Gonzalez Figueroa barters clothes for shampoo and other essentials, and uses the government’s family welfare program to buy groceries. 'It is not much, but it helps me,' she said. Those who don’t qualify for assistance have increasingly turned to side hustles to pay utilities bills. Emilce Correa, who works 42 hours a week as a lab technician at a public hospital, picks up all extra shifts she can at far-flung medical centers. 'By the middle of the month, I already have nothing,' she said. Others have joined the growing legions of workers offering to wash car windows at red lights and mining dumpsters for sustenance. Hungry but patient Débora Galluccio, a 48-year-old legal expert who lost her job in Congress during the previous administration, went from dining in restaurants to soup kitchens in less than a year. 'It’s hard, but we manage as best we can,' Galluccio said, sipping stew provided by a local nonprofit. She said she feels lucky to live in an apartment that her partner inherited. Milei’s move to relax rent-control regulations has priced most working-class Argentines out of the real estate market. Despite it all, Galluccio — like many Argentines — seems to have accepted that the immediate pain of Milei’s economic reforms is an inevitable step toward prosperity. Fed up with generations of crises under left-wing populists, Galluccio is giving the chainsaw-wielding radical a shot. 'In eight months he can’t fix the mess they made in 20 years,' she said. ___ Follow AP’s Latin America coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/argentina-poverty-milei-economy-crisis-f766deb9302aa4ddde1bb9ae26aaf7af	2024-09-26T10:11:13-07:00	
Gunfire erupts near Guinea's presidential palace and the military locks down the area	DAKAR, Senegal (AP) — Shots were fired late Thursday near the presidential palace in Guinea ’s capital Conakry, and the army briefly locked down the city center and evacuated it. Local journalist Fode Toure, who was a few hundred meters from the presidential palace, told The Associated Press he heard gunshots and saw people running away in panic. An AP reporter near the palace saw heavily armed soldiers patrolling the streets. A diplomatic official close to Guinea's leader told the AP that 11 dissident soldiers opened fire on the special forces around the presidential palace, but they were overpowered by the special forces. Three of the assailants were killed and eight others arrested, he said, adding that the situation was under control. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to talk to reporters. The official said the soldiers were loyal to Col. Celestin Bilivogui, who disappeared almost a year ago in mysterious conditions following his arrest by the special forces. Bilivogui was found dead on Wednesday, his family and lawyers said. The lockdown of the center of Conakry was later lifted. The ruling junta denied that any gunshots took place calling it a 'crazy' and 'fabricated' rumor in a statement read on national television. It urged residents of the city center to go about their business. The West African nation has been led by a military regime since soldiers ousted President Alpha Conde in 2021. The West African regional bloc known as ECOWAS has pushed for a quick transition back to civilian rule and elections are scheduled for 2025. Col. Mamadi Doumbouya, the country's leader, overthrew the president three years ago, saying he was preventing Guinea from slipping into chaos and chastised the previous government for broken promises. However, since coming to power he’s been criticized for being no better than his predecessor. In February, military leaders dissolved the government without explanation, saying a new one will be appointed. Doumbouya has rebuffed attempts by the West and other developed countries to intervene in Africa’s political challenges, saying Africans are 'exhausted by the categorizations with which everyone wants to box us in.' Several West African nations including Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso have had coups that installed military juntas. They have severed or scaled back long-standing military ties with Western powers in favor of security support from Russia. ——— Ahmed reported from Bamako, Mali.	https://apnews.com/article/guinea-gunfire-conakry-presidential-palace-76b99f2434db5df31e4c47826dc5c1da	2024-09-26T09:57:01-07:00	
New Chinese nuclear attack submarine sank during construction, US defense official says	WASHINGTON (AP) — Satellite imagery showed that China’s newest nuclear-powered attack submarine sank alongside a pier while under construction, a senior U.S. defense official said Thursday. The sinking of China's first Zhou-class submarine represents a setback for Beijing as it continues to build out the world's largest navy. Beijing has become increasingly assertive in pursuing its claim to virtually the entire South China Sea, which is crucial to international trade. Meanwhile, China faces longtime territorial disputes involving others in the region including Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam. The United States has sought to strengthen ties to its allies in the region and regularly sails through those waters in operations it says maintains the freedom of navigation for vessels there, angering Beijing. The submarine likely sank between May and June, when satellite images showed cranes that would be necessary to lift it off the bottom of the river, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to provide details about the submarine loss. China has been building up its naval fleet at a breakneck pace, and the U.S. considers China’s rise one of its main future security concerns. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said Friday he was not familiar with the topic and did not provide any information when asked about it at a Beijing press conference. The U.S. official said it was 'not surprising' that China's navy would conceal it. The submarine's current status is unknown. The identification of the sunken nuclear submarine was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. Thomas Shugart, a former U.S. Navy submariner and an analyst at the Center for a New American Security, first noticed the incident involving the submarine in July, though it wasn’t publicly known at the time that it involved the new Zhou-class vessel. Satellite images from Planet Labs PBC analyzed by The Associated Press show what appears to be a submarine docked at the Shuangliu shipyard on the Yangtze River before the incident. An image taken June 15 appears to show the submarine either fully or partially submerged just under the river’s surface, with rescue equipment and cranes surrounding it. Booms surround it to prevent any oil or other leaks from the vessel. A satellite image taken Aug. 25 shows a submarine back at the same dock as the submerged vessel. It's not clear if it was the same one. It remains unclear if the affected submarine had been loaded with nuclear fuel or if its reactor was operating at the time of the incident. However, there has been no reported release of radiation in the area in the time since. China as of last year operated six nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines, six nuclear-powered attack submarines and 48 diesel-powered attack submarines, according to a U.S. military report. News of the submarine's sinking comes as China this week conducted a rare launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile into international waters in the Pacific Ocean. Experts say it marked the first time Beijing had conducted such a test since 1980. ___ Gambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.	https://apnews.com/article/china-nuclear-submarine-sank-us-military-3c68bba0882fe81b3ace6da6c39e771b	2024-09-26T09:51:56-07:00	
North Macedonia's leader is angry at prospect of a new setback in his country's bid to join the EU	SKOPJE, North Macedonia (AP) — North Macedonia's conservative prime minister has reacted angrily to reports that his country's troubled European Union accession bid hit a new hurdle because of a dispute with neighboring EU member Bulgaria. Prime Minister Hristijan Mickoski said Thursday that the EU was trying to 'dictate' what North Macedonia should do, and suggested that he would accept no further delay in membership talks with the 27-nation bloc. Mickoski's comments followed reports that EU ambassadors meeting in Brussels on Wednesday decided to push ahead with neighboring Albania's EU accession process, independently of North Macedonia's. Up to now, the two had been moving together. Any such decision would require approval at a higher EU level. European Commission spokeswoman Ana Pisonero on Thursday declined to confirm that Albania and North Macedonia’s negotiating paths had been separated. But she did suggest that the two are on different tracks, or time frames. 'Our position is very clear, the Commission looks forward to the start of negotiations ... as soon as possible with Albania, and with North Macedonia as soon as possible once North Macedonia has met the relevant criteria,' Pisonero said. The EU started membership talks with the two Balkan countries in 2022 as the war in Ukraine forced a rethink of the bloc's enlargement process. They became EU candidates two decades ago, although their accession talks never commenced. But North Macedonia's bid was then delayed by a dispute with Bulgaria over Balkan history, language and culture. To break the impasse, the previous center-left government in Skopje accepted a Bulgarian demand to insert in North Macedonia's constitution a reference to a Bulgarian ethnic minority. However, it lacked the parliamentary majority to effect the change, and Mickoski's new conservative government says it will only amend the constitution if Bulgaria first approves North Macedonia's EU membership. Mickiski said Thursday that it was unfair to link his country's EU prospects with Bulgaria's demand. 'For me, this is a dictate,' he said. 'If this is the condition for (North) Macedonia to continue negotiations, then I said that in Brussels — no thanks!' The country's EU path was blocked for years by neighboring Greece over another dispute over history and heritage. It was settled in 2018 after North Macedonia changed its name, from the previous 'Macedonia' — which remains Mickoski's preferred usage. The main opposition Social Democrats' leader Venko Filipche blamed Mickoski's government for the new setback. 'This is a huge disaster for the future of the citizens,' Filipche said. 'This is a missed opportunity that will affect many families and a whole new generation.'	https://apnews.com/article/north-macedonia-eu-albania-bulgaria-accession-delay-22489e9a430a266b72a16ca76430e334	2024-09-26T08:42:03-07:00	
What obstacles stand in the way of an Israel-Hezbollah cease-fire?	Israel and Hezbollah each have strong incentives to heed international calls for a cease-fire that could avert all-out war — but that doesn't mean they will. Hezbollah is reeling after a sophisticated attack on personal devices killed and wounded hundreds of its members. Israeli airstrikes have killed two top commanders in Beirut in less than a week, and warplanes have pounded what Israel says are Hezbollah sites across large parts of Lebanon, killing over 600 people. So far, Israel clearly has the upper hand militarily, which could make it less willing to compromise. But it's unlikely to achieve its goal of halting Hezbollah rocket fire with air power alone, and a threatened ground invasion of Lebanon poses major risks. After nearly a year of war, Israeli troops are still fighting Hamas in Gaza. And Hezbollah is a much more formidable force. 'Hezbollah has yet to employ 10% of its capabilities,' military affairs correspondent Yossi Yehoshua wrote in Yediot Ahronot, Israel's largest daily newspaper. 'The euphoria that is evident among the decision-makers and some of the public should be placed back in the attic: the situation is still complex and flammable.' The United States and its allies, including Gulf Arab countries, have tried to offer a way out, proposing an immediate 21-day cease-fire to 'provide space for diplomacy.' But any deal would require both sides to back away from their core demands, and they may decide the price is too high. Hezbollah wants a truce in Gaza, too Hezbollah began launching rockets, drones and missiles into northern Israel after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack in the south triggered the war in Gaza. Hezbollah and Hamas are both allies of Iran, and the Lebanese militant group says it is acting in solidarity with Palestinians. Israel has responded with waves of airstrikes. Overall, the fighting has killed dozens of people in Israel, more than 1,500 in Lebanon and forced the evacuation of tens of thousands of people from communities on both sides of the border. Hezbollah has said it will halt the attacks if there is a cease-fire in Gaza. But months of negotiations over Gaza led by the United States, Qatar and Egypt have repeatedly stalled, and Hamas might be less motivated to reach a deal if it thinks Hezbollah and Iran will join a wider war against Israel. For Hezbollah, halting its rocket fire without securing any tangible gains for the Palestinians would be seen as a capitulation to Israeli pressure, with all of its recent casualties suffered in vain. Any deal involving a cease-fire in Gaza would be a hard sell for Israel, which would view it as a reward for Hezbollah rocket attacks that have displaced tens of thousands of its citizens for nearly a year. For Israel, a cease-fire might not be enough Israel’s goals in Lebanon are far narrower than in Gaza, where Prime Minister Benjmain Netanyahu has vowed 'total victory' over Hamas and the return of scores of hostages. Israel wants the tens of thousands of people who were evacuated from northern communities nearly a year ago to return safely to their homes. And it wants to ensure that Hezbollah never carries out an Oct. 7-style attack. A weekslong cease-fire — which would give Hezbollah a chance to reset after major attacks on its chain of command and communications — might not be enough. Few Israelis are likely to return if they know it's only temporary, and even an agreement for a lasting cease-fire would face skepticism. The U.N. Security Council resolution that ended the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah called for the militants to withdraw north of the Litani River, some 30 kilometers (18 miles) from the border, and for the area between to be patrolled by Lebanese forces and U.N. peacekeepers. Israel says that provision was never implemented and is likely to demand additional guarantees in any new cease-fire. But Hezbollah is far stronger than Lebanon's regular armed forces and the U.N. detachment, neither of which would be able to impose any agreement by force. Netanyahu's partners want him to fight on Netanyahu leads the most religious and nationalist government in Israel's history. His far-right coalition partners have threatened to bring down his government if he makes too many concessions to Hamas, and they are also likely to oppose any deal with Hezbollah. Bezalel Smotrich, Netanyahu's hardline finance minister, said Thursday that Israel’s campaign in the north 'should only end in one scenario – crushing Hezbollah and denying its ability to harm residents of the north.' Itamar Ben-Gvir, the far-right National Security Minister, said he would not support a temporary cease-fire and would leave the government if it becomes permanent. Although opposition parties would likely support the cease-fire, the defection of his partners would eventually bring down Netanyahu's government and force early elections, potentially leaving him even more exposed to investigations into the security failures of Oct. 7 and corruption charges that predate the war. It could even mean the end of his long political career. Iran has sent mixed signals In Lebanon, Prime Minister Najib Mikati has welcomed the cease-fire proposal, but he has little power to impose an agreement on Hezbollah. Iran, which helped establish Hezbollah in the 1980s and is the source of its advanced weapons, has more sway over the group, but it has yet to express a position on any cease-fire. It likely fears a wider war that could bring it into direct conflict with the United States, but can't stand by indefinitely while its most powerful proxy force is dismantled. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, a relative moderate elected over the summer, struck a more conciliatory tone toward the West than his predecessors when he addressed the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday. But he had sharp words for Israel and said its heavy bombardment of Lebanon in recent days 'cannot go unanswered.' ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-gaza-ceasefire-talks-challenges-71b59e0db03f0014ce06d4aa21bc2907	2024-09-26T07:53:54-07:00

Cryptocurrency exchange network accused of helping Russia hit with sanctions	WASHINGTON (AP) — A network of people and virtual currency exchanges associated with harboring Russian cybercrime were hit with sanctions on Thursday, in a government-wide crackdown on cybercrime that could assist Russia ahead of President Joe Biden's meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. U.S. Treasury sanctioned alleged Russian hacker Sergey Ivanov and Cryptex — a St. Vincent and Grenadines registered virtual currency exchange operating in Russia. Virtual currency exchanges allow people and businesses to trade cryptocurrencies for other assets, such as conventional dollars or other digital currencies. Treasury alleges that Ivanov has laundered hundreds of millions of dollars worth of virtual currency for cyber criminals and darknet marketplace vendors for the last 20 years, including for Timur Shakhmametov, who allegedly created an online marketplace for stolen credit card data and compromised IDs called Joker’s Stash. Ivanov laundered the proceeds from Joker’s Stash, Treasury says. The State Department is offering a $10 million reward for information that would lead to the arrest and possible conviction of the two men and the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Virginia has unsealed an indictment against them. Biden said in a statement announcing the sanctions Thursday that the U.S. 'will continue to raise the costs on Russia for its war in Ukraine and to deprive the Russian defense industrial base of resources.' He meets with Zelenskyy Thursday to announce a surge in security assistance for Ukraine and other actions meant to assist the war-torn country as Russia continues to invade. State Department Spokesman Matthew Miller said, 'We will continue to use all our tools and authorities to deter and expose these money laundering networks and impose cost on the cyber criminals and support networks. We reiterate our call that Russia must take concrete steps to prevent cyber criminals from freely operating in its jurisdiction.' U.S officials have taken several actions against Russian cybercriminals since the start of the invasion in February 2022. Earlier this year, Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctioned 13 firms — five of which are owned by an already sanctioned person — and two people who have all either helped build or operate blockchain-based services for, or enabled virtual currency payments in, the Russian financial sector, 'thus enabling potential sanctions evasion,' according to U.S. Treasury.	https://apnews.com/article/sanctions-treasury-russia-cryptocurrency-digital-assets-c16d796368e072d3cbc64e8872da977c	2024-09-26T07:26:10-07:00	
Haiti says it supports a UN peacekeeping mission to fight the country's violent gangs	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — The president of Haiti’s transitional presidential council announced Thursday that he supports a U.N. peacekeeping mission to fight gang violence still overwhelming authorities. It was the first public support announced by a Haitian government official since the U.S. proposed a U.N. peacekeeping mission earlier this month as one way to secure more resources for a U.N.-backed mission led by Kenya that officials say lacks personnel and funding. 'I am convinced that this change of status, whilst recognizing the errors of the past cannot be repeated, would guarantee the full success of the mission,' Edgard Leblanc Fils, council president, said at the U.N. General Assembly. On Wednesday, Fils met with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and others to talk about the state of the mission, which began when the first contingent of Kenyan police arrived in Haiti in late June. Nearly 400 Kenyan officers are now in Haiti, joined by nearly two dozen police officers and soldiers from Jamaica. The officers fall significantly short of the 2,500 pledged by various countries, including Chad, Benin, Bangladesh and Barbados for the mission. The mandate of the current mission expires soon and must be renewed by Oct. 2. 'We would like to see a thought being given to transforming the security support mission into a peacekeeping mission under the mandate of the U.N.' Leblanc said. A senior U.S. State Department official said Wednesday that the U.S. and some of its partners would like to make changes to the mandate to lay out a path 'to become a more traditional peacekeeping operation,' but the Russians and Chinese, who supported the initial mandate, have expressed concerns about doing that. The U.N. Security Council would ultimately have to vote on a peacekeeping mission, and experts have said it’s unlikely it would support one. They have noted many Haitians would likely balk at it given the introduction of cholera and sexual abuse cases that occurred when U.N. troops were last in Haiti. Since the early 1900s, there have been at least three major foreign military interventions in Haiti led by the United States and the United Nations. A U.N. peacekeeping effort was launched in September 1993 and ran until 2000. Then in February 2004, former President Jean Bertrand Aristide was overthrown a second time and flown out of Haiti by the U.S., which sent troops — as did Canada, France and Chile. They were soon replaced by troops of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti, which stayed until 2017. 'Although some of these missions have helped to temporarily stabilize the country, they also have left behind a heavy heritage,' Leblanc said. The U.N.’s 2004-2017 peacekeeping mission was marred by allegations of sexual assault by its troops and staffers and claims that peacekeepers from Nepal introduced cholera into Haiti’s largest river in October 2010 through sewage runoff from their base. The U.N. has since acknowledged it played a role in the epidemic and that it did not do enough to help fight it, but it has not specifically acknowledged it introduced the disease. The epidemic killed nearly 10,000 people. Leblanc said that while the current U.N.-backed mission has made some inroads, 'a lot still remains to be done.' He said Haitians continue to live in fear and cannot move around the country freely, unable to work or send their children to school without great risk. He said the country's security continues to deteriorate. Armed gangs that control 80% of the capital of Port-au-Prince have only grown more powerful since the July 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse. 'It’s weakening institutions, paralyzing the economy and it’s undermining hope in a better tomorrow. The future of the country is under threat,' Leblanc said. More than 3,600 people have been reported killed during the first half of this year, a more than 70% increase compared with the same period last year. The violence also has left nearly 700,000 Haitians homeless in recent years and thousands have fled Haiti, which shares the island of Hispaniola with the Dominican Republic. On Wednesday, Dominican President Luis Abinader said he would take 'drastic measures' if the mission in neighboring Haiti fails. He did not provide specifics. Also on Wednesday, Haitian Prime Minister Garry Conille noted that about 25% of Haiti’s police officers have left the country, and of those still working, about two are wounded and one killed every week. He said he expects Haiti to hold elections by November for the first time since 2016 'even though we know we will not have the highest level of security.' On Thursday, Leblanc said Haiti’s government was thinking of all the 'hard-working' Haitians who have left their country because of the insecurity and hoped they would return once conditions improve. He thanked those showing solidarity with Haitian migrants, 'especially those in Springfield.'

Leader of Palestinian Authority denounces Israeli Gaza offensive at UN, insists: 'We will not leave'	NEW YORK (AP) — The head of the Palestinian Authority denounced Israel and its offensive in the Gaza Strip in front of world leaders Thursday, appealing to other nations to stop what he called a 'genocidal war' against a place and people he said had been totally destroyed. Mahmoud Abbas used the rostrum of the U.N. General Assembly as he typically does — to criticize Israel. But this was the first time he did so since the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks by Hamas on Israel that triggered an Israeli military operation that has devastated the Gaza Strip. Abbas strode to the podium to loud applause and a few unintelligible shouts. His first words were a sentence repeated three times: 'We will not leave. We will not leave. We will not leave.' He accused Israel of destroying Gaza and making it unlivable. And he said that his government should govern post-war Gaza as part of an independent Palestinian state, a vision that Israel’s hardline government rejects. Abbas has had little influence in Gaza since Hamas overthrew his forces and seized power of the territory in 2007. His internationally recognized government administers only small semi-autonomous zones in the occupied West Bank. The U.S. has said a reformed Palestinian Authority should play a future role in Gaza, but Israel does not consider him a reliable partner and has ruled that out. 'Palestine is our homeland. It is the land of our fathers and our grandfathers. It will remain ours. And if anyone were to leave, it would be the occupying usurpers,' he said. Israel responds by dismissing Abbas' claims Israel has maintained its military operations are justified and are necessary to defend itself. South Africa has filed a genocide case against Israel in the U.N.’s top court. Israel rejects the accusations. Danny Danon, Israel's U.N. ambassador, responded to Abbas' speech within minutes with a critical assessment. 'Abbas spoke for 26 minutes and did not say the word 'Hamas’ once. Since the massacre of Oct. 7, Abbas has failed to condemn Hamas for their crimes against humanity,' he said. 'Only when he stands on the U.N. platform does he talk about a peaceful solution,' Danon said. 'There is no greater hypocrisy and lie than this: Abbas’ legacy is one of chronic weakness in the face of terrorism and hatred.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addresses the General Assembly on Friday and arrived in New York shortly before Abbas spoke. Netanyahu's visit is expected to draw protests in the neighborhood where the U.N. compound sits. A nationwide series of campus protests against Israel's operations in Gaza swept the United States in the spring and largely originated at Columbia University, about 70 blocks north of the United Nations. 'The American people are marching in the streets in these demonstrations. We are appreciative of them,' Abbas said. Israel’s campaign in Gaza has killed more than 41,500 Palestinians and wounded more than 96,000 others, according to the latest figures released Thursday by the Health Ministry. The ministry, part of Gaza's Hamas government, doesn’t differentiate between civilians and combatants, but more than half the dead have been women and children, including about 1,300 children under the age of 2. Israel began its response after Hamas attackers sneaked across the border into Israel on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and taking about 250 others hostage. The response by Netanyahu's government was swift and fierce and has continued ever since. Attention now on Lebanon In recent days, Israel has turned its attention to the border with Lebanon, where it is targeting Hezbollah militants and has inflicted civilian casualties as well. Hezbollah began attacking Israel almost immediately after the Hamas invasion, and ongoing fighting between Israel and the Lebanese militant group have driven tens of thousands of people from their homes on both sides of the border. Israel is vowing to step up its attacks on Hezbollah until its citizens can return safely to their homes. Late Wednesday, the United States, France and other allies jointly called for an 'immediate' 21-day cease-fire to allow for negotiations as fears grow that the violent escalation in recent days — following 11 months of cross-border exchange of fire — could grow into an all-out war. The United Nations says over 90,000 people have been displaced by five days of Israeli strikes on Lebanon, bringing the total to 200,000 people who have been displaced in Lebanon since Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel in support of Hamas after it stormed into Israel, sparking the Israel-Hamas war. Abbas says life in Gaza is intolerable Abbas spent big chunks of his speech at the United Nations talking about the state of life in Gaza, and he painted a bleak picture. 'Entire family names have been written out of the civil record,' he said. 'Gaza is no longer fit for life. Most homes have been destroyed. The same applies for most buildings. ... Roads. Churches. Mosques. Water plants. Electric plants. Sanitation plants. Anyone who has gone to Gaza and known it before would not recognize it anymore.' Among his demands, none of which are new: A full Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip — not 'buffer zones.' Allowing Gaza's displaced Palestinians — an estimated 90% of the population — to return to their homes. And a central role for Abbas' government in any future Gaza. 'Stop this crime. Stop it now. Stop killing children and women. Stop the genocide. Stop sending weapons to Israel. This madness cannot continue. The entire world is responsible for what is happening to our people in Gaza and the West Bank.' ___ See more of AP’s coverage of the U.N.

At least 11 killed in Israeli strike that hit a school in northern Gaza	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — An Israeli airstrike hit a school sheltering thousands of displaced Palestinians in northern Gaza on Thursday, killing at least 11 people and wounding 22, including women and children, the territory’s Health Ministry said. The Israeli military confirmed it struck the school in the Jabalia refugee camp, saying it was targeting Hamas militants inside who were planning attacks on Israeli troops. The claim couldn't be independently confirmed. Footage from the al-Falouja School showed rescue workers rushing casualties out of the school compound amid widespread debris and crowds of people. One video showed men wrapping a mangled, severed torso in a plastic sheet and putting body parts into a cooler. Gaza’s Health Ministry didn't immediately provide a breakdown of how many of the casualties were women and children. Israeli forces have repeatedly struck schools, saying Hamas fighters use them as 'command centers' to plan attacks. The military says it uses precision weapons to avoid civilian casualties. The strikes have brought heavy death tolls. Tens of thousands of Palestinians are living packed in schools across Gaza after fleeing their homes in the face of Israeli bombardment and offensives. More than 1.9 million of Gaza’s 2.4 million people have been displaced in the nearly yearlong conflict, according to the United Nations. Israel’s campaign in Gaza has killed more than 41,500 Palestinians and wounded more than 96,000 others, according to the latest figures released Thursday by the Health Ministry. The ministry’s count doesn't differentiate between civilians and combatants, but more than half the dead have been women and children, including about 1,300 children under the age of 2. Israel launched its campaign in Gaza, vowing to destroy Hamas after its Oct. 7 attack, during which militants killed around 1,200 people and took about 250 others hostage. It blames civilian deaths in Gaza on Hamas, because the group’s fighters operate in residential areas and use civilian infrastructure. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-palestinians-26-september-2024-5c2098250e347a622b7b51664126125d	2024-09-26T06:16:39-07:00	
Tone deaf and color blind? Catholic Church struggles to keep accused abusers out of religious art	BRUSSELS (AP) — Little brings more heavenly bliss to the faithful or otherworldly wonder to casual visitors than ethereal hymns cascading amid the columns of Catholic cathedrals. That is, unless the composer is a known molester or someone accused of sexual abuse. A few days before the highlight of Pope Francis' visit to Belgium, a Mass at the biggest stadium in Brussels, the specially selected choir was rehearsing a brand-new closing hymn when it became known that the composer was a priest accused of molesting young women. The hymn was hastily removed from the order of service and replaced with another composition but it was too late to reprint the official Magnificat booklet for the mass because of the number of copies required. The name of the alleged abuser, who died two weeks ago, is right there at the bottom of page 52, next to a request for donations, with bank account number, QR code and all. It was the latest controversy in the Belgian church's decades-long struggle to come to terms with an appalling history of sex abuse and cover-ups by its priests and clergy — a legacy Francis will confront in person when he meets with survivors during his visit. 'I pointed it out to them,' said the Rev. Rik Deville, a retired priest who has been a torchbearer for survivors of church abuse for three decades. 'What happened with the hymn is only a symptom of a much wider problem. They still cannot deal with the issue,' he said in an interview with The Associated Press. For over two decades, Belgium has been facing a continual cascade of abuse reports that officially total several hundred known cases but which, advocates say, are only the tip of the iceberg: Many of the victims and perpetrators have died, or the alleged crimes have exceeded their statute of limitations. Deville said victims in villages come face to face with such issues on a weekly basis. The Sunday Mass scandal only started to roll early this week when an abuse victim pointed out to a local bishop that he had warmly eulogized the recently deceased priest-composer who had, in fact, been an abuser. As a result, the Bishop of Limburg, Patrick Hoogmartens, announced he wouldn’t take part in celebratory papal events. It set off the chain of events leading to the change in the Mass program. 'It is only now because it is an international event that something is done about it,' said Deville. 'But such things happen on a weekly basis in parishes across the nation that victims are confronted like that. And then nothing is done about it.' Church authorities said the hymns were chosen in coordination with the musicians who were unaware of the case, which only came to public attention after the recent death of the priest. Hundreds of churches across Belgium still have hymnbooks with his works. Archbishop Luc Terlinden promised the church would look into it as soon as the Pope leaves. 'Every Sunday in every parish his songs are sung. So it is a wider problem. And I want to look into this as of Monday to see what we will do in the future with our policy on culprits, on facts out of respect for the victims,' Terlinden told VRT network. Debates over what to do with art, be it music or paintings when the artist has engaged in problematic or even criminal behavior, have confronted the church and society at large for centuries, long before 'cancel culture' became a buzzword. Few people argue that Caravaggio's religious masterpieces should be destroyed or taken down because of his criminal life: The man he killed is dead, as is he. But in Los Angeles four years ago, the archdiocese banned the music of Catholic composer David Haas amid an investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct, allegations Haas strenuously denied. And more recently, the mosaics of one of the Catholic Church’s most acclaimed contemporary artists, the Rev. Marko Rupnik, have come under scrutiny. Rupnik's Jesuit religious order expelled him in 2023 after more than two dozen women accused him of spiritual, psychological and sexual abuses, some while he was creating the artwork. Francis reopened a church investigation, amid suspicions that Rupnik had escaped punishment in Francis' Jesuit-friendly Vatican. Rupnik hasn't responded publicly to the allegations, but his art studio has defended him and denounced what it has called a media 'lynching'. The issue about what to do with his artwork is not minor, since Rupnik's mosaics decorate the facades and altars of some of the most-visited basilicas and churches around the world, including at Lourdes, France; Fatima, Portugal and even in the Vatican's apostolic palace. So far, the bishop of Lourdes decided to keep the Rupnik mosaics — for now — because there was no consensus within a committee of experts he formed about what to do with them. The Knights of Columbus religious fraternity decided this summer to cover the mosaics at its shrine in Washington D.C., and chapel in Connecticut. But earlier this year, the head of the Vatican’s communications department created an uproar when he defended the continued use of images of Rupnik’s mosaics on the Vatican’s own news portal, Vatican News, even as a canonical investigation is underway at the Vatican's sex crimes office. He argued, as have others, that one must separate the art from the artist. That argument didn't sit well with the pope’s top adviser on child protection and fighting clergy abuse, Cardinal Sean O’Malley. He penned a letter to the heads of all Vatican offices in June urging them to refrain from displaying Rupnik’s artwork as a gesture to abuse victims. 'Pastoral prudence would prevent displaying artwork in a way that could imply either exoneration or a subtle defense,' he wrote in June. 'We must avoid sending a message that the Holy See is oblivious to the psychological distress that so many are suffering.' ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

A misspelled memorial to the Brontë sisters gets its dots back at last	LONDON (AP) — With a few daubs of a paintbrush, the Brontë sisters have got their dots back. More than eight decades after it was installed, a memorial to the three 19th-century sibling novelists in London’s Westminster Abbey was amended Thursday to restore the diaereses – the two dots over the e in their surname. The dots — which indicate that the name is pronounced 'brontay' rather than 'bront' — were omitted when the stone tablet commemorating Charlotte, Emily and Anne was erected in the abbey’s Poets’ Corner in October 1939, just after the outbreak of World War II. They were restored after Brontë historian Sharon Wright, editor of the Brontë Society Gazette, raised the issue with Dean of Westminster David Hoyle. The abbey asked its stonemason to tap in the dots and its conservator to paint them. 'There’s no paper record for anyone complaining about this or mentioning this, so I just wanted to put it right, really,' Wright said. 'These three Yorkshire women deserve their place here, but they also deserve to have their name spelled correctly.' It’s believed the writers’ Irish father Patrick changed the spelling of his surname from Brunty or Prunty when he went to university in England. Raised on the wild Yorkshire moors, all three sisters died before they were 40, leaving enduring novels including Charlotte’s 'Jane Eyre,' Emily’s 'Wuthering Heights' and Anne’s 'The Tenant of Wildfell Hall.' Rebecca Yorke, director of the Brontë Society, welcomed the restoration. 'As the Brontës and their work are loved and respected all over the world, it’s entirely appropriate that their name is spelled correctly on their memorial,' she said.	https://apnews.com/article/bronte-sisters-memorial-westminster-abbey-dots-9c8ccbd3d4b0882de566eab4027580b0	2024-09-26T05:04:59-07:00	
Climate change destroyed an Alaska village. Its residents are starting over in a new town	MERTARVIK, Alaska (AP) — Growing up along the banks of the Ninglick River in western Alaska, Ashley Tom would look out of her window after strong storms from the Bering Sea hit her village and notice something unsettling: the riverbank was creeping ever closer. It was in that home, in the village of Newtok, where Tom's great-grandmother had taught her to sew and crochet on the sofa, skills she used at school when students crafted headdresses, mittens and baby booties using seal or otter fur. It’s also where her grandmother taught her the intricate art of grass basket weaving and how to speak the Yupik language. Today, erosion and melting permafrost have just about destroyed Newtok, eating about 70 feet (21.34 meters) of land every year. All that’s left are some dilapidated and largely abandoned gray homes scraped bare of paint by salt darting in on the winds of storms. 'Living with my great-grandmother was all I could remember from Newtok, and it was one of the first houses to be demolished,' said Tom. In the next few weeks, the last 71 residents will load their possessions onto boats to move to Mertarvik, rejoining 230 residents who began moving away in 2019. They will become one of the first Alaska Native villages to complete a large-scale relocation because of climate change. __ EDITOR’S NOTE: This is part of a series on how tribes and Indigenous communities are coping with and combating climate change. ___ Newtok village leaders began searching for a new townsite more than two decades ago, ultimately swapping land with the federal government for a place 9 miles (14.48 kilometers) away on the stable volcanic underpinnings of Nelson Island in the Bering Strait. But the move has been slow, leaving Newtok a split village. Even after most residents shifted to Mertarvik, the grocery store and school remained in Newtok, leaving some teachers and students separated from their families for the school year. Calvin Tom, the tribal administrator and Ashley's uncle, called Newtok 'not a place to live anymore.' Erosion has tilted power poles precariously, and a single good storm this fall will knock out power for good, he said. For now, the rush is on to get 18 temporary homes that arrived in Mertarvik on a barge set up before winter sets in. Alaska is warming two to three times faster than the global average. Some villages dotting the usually frigid North Slope, Alaska’s prodigious oil field, had their warmest temperatures on record in August, prompting some of Ashley Tom’s friends living there to don bikinis and head to Arctic Ocean beaches. It's the same story across the Arctic, with permafrost degradation damaging roads, railroad tracks, pipes and buildings for 4 million people across the top of the world, according to the Washington, D.C.-based Arctic Institute. In the Russian Arctic, Indigenous people are being moved to cities instead of having their eroding villages relocated and across Scandinavia, reindeer herders are finding the land constantly shifting and new bodies of water appearing, the institute said. About 85% of Alaska’s land area lies atop permafrost, so named because it's supposed to be permanently frozen ground. It holds a lot of water, and when it thaws or when warmer coastal water hits it, its melting causes further erosion. Another issue with warming: less sea ice to act as natural barriers that protect coastal communities from the dangerous waves of ocean storms. The Yupik have a word for the catastrophic threats of erosion, flooding and thawing permafrost: 'usteq,' which means 'surface caves in.' The changes are usually slow — until all of a sudden they aren't, as when a riverbank sloughs off or a huge hole opens up, said Rick Thoman, a climate specialist with the International Arctic Research Center at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. There are 144 Alaska Native communities that face some degree of infrastructure damage from erosion, flooding or permafrost melt, according to a report in January from the the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium. Six of them — Kivalina, Koyukuk, Newtok, Shaktoolik, Shishmaref and Unalakleet — were deemed imminently threatened in a Government Accountability Office report more than two decades ago. Communities have three options based on the severity of their situations: Securing protection to stay where they are; staging a managed retreat, moving back from erosion threats; or a complete relocation. Moving is hard, starting with finding a place to go. Communities typically need to swap with the federal government, which owns about 60% of Alaska's land. But Congress has to approve swaps, and that's only after negotiations that can drag on: Newtok, for example, began pursuing the Nelson Island land in 1996 and didn't wrap up until late 2003. 'That’s way too long,' said Jackie Qatalina Schaeffer, the director of climate initiatives at the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium. 'If we look back a decade at what’s happened as far as climate change in Alaska, we’re out of time,' she said. 'We need to find a better way to help communities secure land for relocation.' Kivalina last year completed a master plan for relocation and is negotiating with an Alaska Native regional corporation for the land, a process that could take 3 to 5 years, Schaeffer said. Another big hurdle is cost. Newtok has spent decades and about $160 million in today’s dollars on its move. Estimates to relocate Kivalina vary from $100 million to $400 million and rising, and there's currently no federal funding for relocation. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has disaster funding and programs, Schaeffer said, but that comes only after a disaster declaration. In 2018, a resource for Alaska communities identified 60 federal funding sources for relocation, but according to the Unmet Needs report, only a few have been successfully used to address environmental threats. But an infusion of funding into these existing programs by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act could provide benefits to threatened Alaska communities, the report said. About $4.3 billion in 2020 dollars will be needed to mitigate infrastructure damage over the next 50 years, the health consortium report says. It called for Congress to close an $80 million annual gap by providing a single committed source to assist communities. 'Alaska Native economic, social, and cultural ways of being, which have served so well for millennia, are now under extreme threat due to accelerated environmental change,' the report said. 'In jeopardy are not just buildings, but the sustainability of entire communities and cultures.' After five years of separation and split lives, the residents of Newtok and Mertarvik will be one again. The school in Newtok closed and classes started in August for the first time in a temporary location in Mertarvik. A new school building should be ready in 2026. The Newtok grocery recently moved to Mertarvik, and there's plans for a second grocery and a church, Calvin Tom said. The new village site has huge benefits, including better health, Tom said. For now, most of the people of Mertarvik are still using a 'honey bucket' system rather than toilets. But that method of manually dumping plastic buckets of waste should be replaced by piped water and sewer within the next few years. The new homes in Mertarvik are also free of black mold that crept into some Newtok homes on moisture brought by the remnants of Typhoon Merbok two years ago. Tom said there's talk of someday renaming the relocated town Newtok. Whatever the name, the relocation offers assurance that culture and traditions from the old place will continue. An Indigenous drum and dance group is practicing at the temporary school, and subsistence hunting opportunities — moose, musk ox, black bear, brown bear — abound. A pod of belugas that comes by every fall should arrive soon, and that hunt will help residents fill their freezers for the harsh winter ahead. Ashley Tom is excited by the arrival of the last Newtok residents in Mertarvik. Although their home will be different than what they’ve known for most of their lives, she’s confident they will come to appreciate it as she has. 'I really love this this new area, and I just feel whole here,' she said. ___ Thiessen reported from Anchorage. ___ This story was first published on Sep. 26, 2024.

Tropical Weather Latest: Hurricane Helene is upgraded to Category 2 as it heads toward Florida	Fast-moving Hurricane Helene was advancing Thursday across the Gulf of Mexico toward Florida, threatening a 'catastrophic' storm surge in northwestern parts of the state as well as damaging winds, rains and flash floods hundreds of miles inland across much of the southeastern U.S., forecasters said. The storm was upgraded to a Category 2 storm Thursday morning. Landfall is expected by evening. The governors of Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas and Virginia have all declared emergencies in their states. In the Pacific, former Hurricane John strengthened Thursday morning back into a hurricane as it threatened areas of Mexico’s western coast with flash flooding and mudslides. Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Isaac formed Wednesday in the Atlantic Ocean and was expected to strengthen as it moves eastward, possibly becoming a hurricane by the end of the week, forecasters said. Isaac was about 690 miles (1,115 kilometers) northeast of Bermuda with top sustained winds of 50 mph (85 kph), according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami. It was moving east at about 12 mph (19 kph). Follow AP's coverage of tropical weather at https://apnews.com/hub/hurricanes. Here's the latest: North Carolina’s governor warns residents to prepare for heavy rain and flooding North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper warned residents in western and central counties to prepare for heavy rain and 'potentially catastrophic flooding' Thursday night and Friday from Hurricane Helene. Speaking at a Thursday morning briefing, Cooper said the mountains also likely will see landslides, river flooding and debris flows. And cities not necessarily in Helene’s direct path, like Charlotte and Asheville, could see flash flooding, he said. 'The impacts of Helene should not be ignored and all North Carolinians should remain informed,' said state emergency management director Will Ray. Areas of western North Carolina could receive from 9 to 14 inches (23 to 36 centimeters) of rain, with amounts reaching 20 inches (51 centimeters) possible, Ray said. Cooper said some shelters were already open and 175 National Guard service members were activated to help in the storm response. Additionally, he said people in the mountains and foothills who don’t have to travel shouldn’t, the governor said. 'I’m concerned about our mountain areas, seeing the amount of rain that’s already on the ground and this storm coming,' he said. 'I’ve seen firsthand the devastation that it can cause.' Death toll from Hurricane John rises to 5 Mexico President Andrés Manuel López Obrador raised the death toll from Hurricane John to five Thursday as the communities along the country’s Pacific coast prepared for the storm to make a second landfall. State parks and 9 shelters open to evacuees in Georgia The Georgia Emergency Management Agency said nine shelters were opening for Hurricane Helene, mostly in the southern parts of the state. The state has also opened its state parks to evacuees, saying it’s welcoming people and pets, including horses. Parks officials say they are currently housing 15 evacuees. Biden declares an emergency in North Carolina President Joe Biden approved an emergency declaration for North Carolina on Thursday, according to the White House. The approval follows one issued for Georgia earlier in the day and one issued for Florida earlier in the week. Federal Emergency Management Agency teams were already deployed to Florida and Alabama to support local first responders. Federal authorities have positioned generators, food and water, along with search-and-rescue and power restoration teams. ‘This has been my livelihood’ ST. MARKS, Fla. — As Hurricane Helene barreled toward Florida’s Big Bend, Philip Tooke sat in a rocking chair on the back deck of his fish house overlooking the St. Marks River, watching and waiting. A commercial fisherman who took over the business his father founded in the town of St. Marks, about 5 miles (8 kilometers) north of Apalachee Bay, Tooke plans to ride out this storm like he did Hurricane Michael and others — on his boat. 'This has been my livelihood. This is what pays my bills,' Tooke said of his boats. 'If I lose that, I don’t have anything.' Tooke said he’ll wait until the water is about knee-deep and then he, his brother Richard and some of their employees will hunker down on the La Victoria, the Jenny Lee and the Susan D, loosening the lines that fasten the boats to the dock as the water rises, in the hopes they won’t be battered apart. St. Marks sits at the confluence of the St. Marks and Wakulla Rivers and is known to flood during storm events. On Thursday morning, water was already beginning to cover Riverside Drive, which runs through downtown. Filling sandbags in Clyattville, Georgia VALDOSTA, Ga. — Rain drizzled Thursday morning outside a fire station where residents filled sandbags in the unincorporated Clyattville community outside Valdosta near the Georgia-Florida line. Helene was forecast to pass nearby as a hurricane Thursday night. Jose Gonzales and his 14-year-old son, Jadin, shoveled sand into bags and piled them into the back of a pickup truck. Though their home is inland, Gonzales said heavy rains during Hurricane Idalia a year ago got blown under his doors and cracked a window. Some of the carpet inside got so wet he had to replace it. For Helene, he planned to fortify his doors in hopes of preventing it from happening again. 'If it blows sideways, we might get more water inside the house,' Gonzales said. 'It’s just mother nature.' Biden approves emergency declaration in Georgia President Joe Biden approved an emergency declaration for Georgia on Thursday morning after issuing one for Florida earlier in the week. Federal authorities have positioned generators, food and water, along with search-and-rescue and power restoration teams. And Florida officials have sent more than 130 generators to gas stations to ensure that people will be able to fill their cars after the storm, and extra fuel has been shipped into Florida, DeSantis said. John again pelts the coast of Mexico with rain MEXICO CITY — As John became a hurricane for the second time, rain continued to pelt the Pacific coast state of Guerrero in Mexico where the storm caused three deaths in its first landfall earlier this week. Authorities in Guerrero reported flooding in some low-lying neighborhoods in Acapulco. Soldiers and National Guard officers were posted outside stores in Acapulco to prevent the kind of widespread looting that broke out in the resort after Hurricane Otis hit last October. ‘This old house was built in 1903 — I think it’ll hold up’ VALDOSTA, Ga. — Joe Overby, 67, and his family were preparing Thursday to ride out the hurricane at their home in the unincorporated Clyattville community outside Valdosta, Georgia, where Hurricane Idalia a year ago toppled trees and damaged about 1,000 homes. Overby boarded up the open front of a large storage building next to his house. He had a generator to power his refrigerator and freezer and planned to move cars to his neighbor’s yard across the street where there were no trees. He said Idalia last year bent some sturdy oaks in his backyard, exposing the roots. 'I’m afraid this time they’re going to come down,' Overby said, adding that he planned to hunker down at home overnight with his wife, two children and four dogs. 'This old house was built in 1903,' he said. 'I think it’ll hold up. You can’t even pull the nails out, the wood is so hard.' Florida officials warn residents of hazards they may face even after Helene hits State officials warned Florida residents of the potential risks they face even after Hurricane Helene rips through the northern part of the state, which was expected Thursday night. Driving on roadways and tree branches falling on homes were the two biggest hazards during storms, said Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis at a news conference in Tallahassee. Drivers should stay off roads because of potential flooding and people should stay in the interior parts of their homes if they hear tree limbs snapping, which sounds like fireworks or a gun being fired, officials said. 'It will likely be dark by the time this storm passes,' DeSantis said. 'Do not try to do any work in the dark. You don’t know what hazards are out there. The sun is going to come out. You’re going to have time to take stock of this.' State emergency officials have sent more than 130 generators to gas stations to ensure that people will be able to fill their cars after the storm, and extra fuel has been shipped into Florida, DeSantis said. 'We haven’t seen fuel shortages, only some lines,' the governor said. 'So we feel good about the fuel situation.'

Photographer Gerald Herbert and videographer Stephen Smith are in Crawfordville, Florida, which is south of Tallahassee in what’s known as the Big Bend region. Reporters Brendan Farrington and Kate Payne are reporting from Tallahassee, the state’s capital. The AP also has photographer Mike Stewart, video journalist Sharon Johnson and reporter Russ Bynum reporting from Valdosta, Georgia, which is about 72 miles northeast of Tallahassee, just across the state line. Helene knocked out power and forced evacuations in western Cuba Helene knocked out power in western Cuba as it brushed past the island, affecting some 160,000 customers in the province of Artemisa and another 70,000 in the neighboring province of Pinar del Río. The hurricane also forced some 800 people in the region to evacuate flood-prone zones, according to Guerrillero, a local newspaper. Pictures posted on social media showed overflowing rivers that turned some streets into creeks as people traveled by boat with their personal belongings. On the Isle of Youth, some 25 hectares (62 acres) of tobacco seedbeds of export quality were damaged, said Raúl Fernández, director of a local company, adding that an anticipated planting schedule for October could be delayed. In addition, some 3,000 customers, about 12% of the municipality, were without power. The Cuban government was still assessing overall damage on Thursday. Airports across multiple states see flight delays and cancellations Airports in the Florida cities of Tampa, Tallahassee and Clearwater were closed Thursday, while more than half the flights to airports in Sarasota and Fort Myers were canceled Thursday morning, according to flight tracking service FlightAware. More than a hundred flights in and out of the world’s busiest airport in Atlanta had also been canceled while more than 100 others were delayed, but that’s a relatively small fraction of flights there. Airports in Charlotte, North Carolina, and the Florida cities of Miami, Fort Lauderdale and Orlando were seeing a smaller number of delays and cancellations Chances for a direct hit on Tallahassee have slightly lessened, DeSantis says TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — A shift in models nudging Hurricane Helene’s projected landfall further east lessens the chances for a direct hit on Florida’s capital city if that trajectory holds, Gov. Ron DeSantis said Thursday morning. The shift placed the storm closer to the sparsely-populated Big Bend area where two hurricanes in the past year made landfall — Idalia in August 2023 and Debby last August. The Tallahassee metro area has a population of almost 393,000 residents. Helene was expected to make landfall Thursday night, possibly as a Category 4 storm. 'That’s significant when you are talking about Tallahassee because yesterday we were talking about an eye wall that’s on the western part of the city,' DeSantis said at a news conference from the state’s emergency operations center in Tallahassee. The Tallahassee area hadn’t seen a major hurricane of Helene’s expected magnitude at landfall in recent memory, the governor said. 'The more the track shifts east, the better off for Tallahassee,' DeSantis said. Florida’s emergency operations building will be tested when Helene hits the state Even the building where Florida’s emergency response to Hurricane Helene is organized will be put to the test when the fast-moving storm plows through Tallahassee late Thursday, possibly as a Category 4 hurricane, state officials said. The building that houses the state’s emergency operations center in Tallahassee has walls that were built to withstand a Category 5 hurricane. But during construction in the 1990s, there wasn’t enough money to ensure the roof could withstand a hurricane that strong, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said during a news conference Wednesday afternoon. Backup plans were in place should there be any problems with the building. 'It should be fine, but we’ll see,' DeSantis said. 'We’ve taken precautions just in case something happens to be able to continue the continuity without any major interruption.' John strengthens into a hurricane again near southwestern Mexico MEXICO CITY — Former Hurricane John restrengthened into a hurricane on Thursday morning as it threatened areas of Mexico’s western coast with flash flooding and mudslides. Officials posted hurricane warnings for southwestern Mexico. John hit the country’s southern Pacific coast late Monday, killing at least two people, triggering mudslides, and damaging homes and trees. It grew into a Category 3 hurricane in a matter of hours and made landfall east of Acapulco. It reemerged over the ocean after weakening inland. Rain is falling and the roads are empty near where Helene is expected to make landfall PANACEA, Fla. — Rain was beginning to blow in the predawn darkness Thursday along coastal U.S. Highway 98, which winds through countless fishing villages and vacation hideaways along Florida’s Big Bend. Shuttered gas stations dotted the two-lane highway, their windows boarded up with plywood to protect against the storm. The road was largely empty at first light, with what drivers there mostly heading northeast, towards higher ground. This stretch of Florida known as the Forgotten Coast has been largely spared by the widespread condo development and commercialization that dominates so many of Florida’s beach communities. The sparsely populated region is loved for its natural wonders — the vast stretches of salt marshes, tidal pools and barrier islands; the dwarf cypress trees of Tate’s Hell State Forest; and Wakulla Springs, considered one of the world’s largest and deepest freshwater springs. Helene upgraded to Category 2 hurricane as it barrels toward Florida MIAMI — Helene was upgraded Thursday morning to a Category 2 storm and is expected to be a major hurricane — meaning a Category 3 or higher — when it makes landfall on Florida’s northwestern coast Thursday evening. As of early Thursday, hurricane warnings and flash flood warnings extended far beyond the coast up into south-central Georgia. The governors of Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas and Virginia have all declared emergencies in their states. Tropical Storm Isaac forms in the Atlantic and is expected to strengthen, forecasters say MIAMI — Tropical Storm Isaac formed Wednesday in the Atlantic Ocean and was expected to strengthen as it moves eastward, possibly becoming a hurricane by the end of the week, forecasters said. Isaac was about 690 miles (1,115 kilometers) northeast of Bermuda with top sustained winds of 50 mph (85 kph), according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami. It was moving east at about 12 mph (19 kph). Isaac is the ninth named storm in what is predicted to be a busy hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30 in the Atlantic. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts between 17 and 25 named storms, with as many as 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes. An average Atlantic hurricane season produces 14 named storms, seven of them hurricanes and three major hurricanes.	https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-helene-florida-georgia-mexico-john-00de12bc76ee8e2c5188b666e78a028b	2024-09-26T04:24:33-07:00	
The Latest: Harris and Trump offer competing visions for the economy	Vice President Kamala Harris has pledged to build an economy that is both pro-business and helps the middle class. In remarks Wednesday at the Economic Club of Pittsburgh in battleground Pennsylvania, she said she 'would take good ideas from wherever they come' as she promised to double the number of people being trained in registered apprenticeships and outlined her support for more home ownership. Meanwhile, Republican Donald Trump offered his own competing vision of the economy while visiting a furnituremaker in Mint Hill, North Carolina. He defended his idea for a special lower tax rate for U.S. manufacturers and pledged to impose tariffs high enough that there would be an 'exodus' of auto factory jobs from Japan, Germany and South Korea. Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: Republican Wisconsin congressman falsely suggests city clerk was lying about absentee ballots MADISON, Wis. — The mailing of about 2,200 duplicate absentee ballots in Wisconsin’s heavily Democratic capital city of Madison has led a Republican member of Congress to falsely suggest that the clerk was lying about the presence of barcodes on the ballots themselves. An initial statement on Monday from Madison Clerk Maribeth Witzel-Behl did not specify that it was the envelopes, not the ballots, that contain the barcodes. The statement posted on the clerk’s website was later updated to specify that the barcodes were on the envelopes, not the ballots. Republican Rep. Tom Tiffany posted a picture of an absentee ballot on the social platform X to show there was no barcode and suggested the clerk was lying. Harris issues a policy guide Vice President Kamala Harris has issued an official policy guide, a full 82 pages that push back against Republican criticism that she lacks policies. Entitled ' A New Way Forward for the Middle Class, ″ the guide is one stop-shopping for the ideas appearing in Harris’ speeches. The first section goes over her thoughts on lowering costs for groceries, energy, health care and other items. The second section outlines her ideas for constructing 3 million more homes and boosting manufacturing and entrepreneurship. But much of the guide focuses on former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee. His last name appears 135 times and the first charts cite independent analyses suggesting he would be worse for inflation and job growth than Harris. Wisconsin district attorney pursues investigation into mayor’s removal of absentee ballot drop box MADISON, Wis. — A Wisconsin district attorney said Thursday that her office is pursuing an investigation into the removal of an absentee ballot drop box by the mayor of Wausau. Mayor Doug Diny removed the drop box from outside of City Hall on Sunday. He distributed a picture of himself doing it while wearing worker’s gloves and a hard hat. Diny is a conservative opponent to drop boxes. He insists he did nothing wrong. The drop box was locked and no ballots were in it. The city clerk notified Marathon County District Attorney Theresa Wetzsteon and she said in an email on Thursday that she is requesting an official investigation with the assistance of the Wisconsin Department of Justice. Wetzsteon said she was waiting to hear back on her request. A DOJ spokesperson did not immediately return a message Thursday. It was the latest example in swing state Wisconsin of the fight over whether communities will allow absentee ballot drop boxes. Millions face new voting restrictions Millions of people face voting restrictions that did not exist during the 2020 election after states reacted to false allegations of widespread voter fraud, according to the latest assessment of the voting system by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University. In a report released Thursday, the center said about half of the 63 new restrictive laws in effect this election curtail mail voting. Eleven shorten the period to request a ballot and five either tighten the deadline for returning one or place restrictions on officials in accepting late-arriving ballots. Twelve states have laws on the books that restrict helping voters in returning their mail ballot applications or ballots, the report said. Several also reduced the number of drop boxes available for voters to return ballots. Andrew Garber, counsel in the center’s Democracy Program, expects that people in places such as Georgia, Texas and Florida 'are going to attempt to vote the same way they did a few years ago and they’re going to discover that they’ve been wrongly removed from the rolls or they’re not going to realize that the window to request and return a mail ballot is significantly shorter than it used to be.' Not all the news in the assessment is about limits on voting. At least 156 laws make it easier to vote. The report cited New York, Michigan and Virginia as leaders in the push to expand voting rights. Walz will attend Michigan-Minnesota college football game Democratic vice presidential nominee Gov. Tim Walz will campaign at a college football came in Michigan this weekend, ahead of his upcoming debate with Republican vice presidential pick JD Vance.

Walz will talk with students about the importance of voting in November. The vice presidential debate is Oct. 1. Melania Trump calls it a ‘miracle’ that her husband wasn't killed Melania Trump said it was a 'miracle' that her husband wasn’t killed during two recent assassination attempts. In an interview that aired Thursday on Fox News Channel’s 'Fox &amp; Friends,' the former first lady said a staffer alerted her to the shooting at a July rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Trump said she was in New York this month when she saw television reports of the second shooting at a golf course in Florida. 'I think something was watching over him,' Trump said of her husband surviving both attempts. 'It’s almost like, the country really needs him.' Melania Trump also described the FBI’s 2022 search on her Mar-a-Lago home as an 'invasion of privacy, saying the situation 'made me angry.' Federal prosecutors ultimately charged Trump with mishandling classified documents, but a judge tossed the charges earlier this year. Prosecutors are challenging that decision. This was the former first lady’s first interview in more than two years and comes as she promotes her new memoir. Harris makes scandal-plagued Republican the star of her campaign to win North Carolina There’s an unlikely star in Kamala Harris ′ push to win North Carolina: Mark Robinson. The state’s embattled Republican candidate for governor, Robinson is featured in conversations this week with Harris volunteers and voters on the phone and at their doorways. Democrats wave signs warning of Trump-Robinson extremism at their news conferences. Billboard trucks circulate in key cities warning that Robinson, also the state’s lieutenant governor, is 'unhinged.' And Harris is running a new television advertising campaign highlighting Donald Trump’s history of lavishing Robinson with flowery praise. No Democrat has carried this Southern state since former President Barack Obama in 2008, whose victory stands as the only Democratic win on the presidential level here in a half-century. But Trump held North Carolina by just 1.3 percentage points four years ago, and it is again emerging as one of the most competitive states in the final weeks before Election Day. A new mystery firm enters Trump’s orbit, rekindling criticism of his presidential campaign spending Launchpad Strategies was incorporated less than a year ago and has since received $15 million from Donald Trump’s election fundraising machine. For what is mostly a mystery. Campaign finance records indicate the limited liability company was hired to provide online advertising, digital consulting and fundraising. On its website, the firm boasts it is a 'full-service Republican digital agency run by expert strategists.' Yet, those expert strategists aren’t identified. An online contact form doesn't appear to work. And business registration records in Delaware provide no clues as to who owns or runs the firm. The campaign’s checks are sent to a P.O. Box in North Carolina. Campaign finance experts say Launchpad Strategies was built for anonymity and is the latest example of how the Trump campaign has used secretive businesses to obscure its spending from the public.	https://apnews.com/article/harris-trump-walz-vance-election-c136beeadbad4b1c30221a5792a00626	2024-09-26T04:15:47-07:00	
Military juntas in 3 West African nations investigate a French journalist over jihadi analysis	NIAMEY, Niger (AP) — Prosecutors in military junta-ruled Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso launched investigations on Wednesday against the French journalist and researcher Wassim Nasr into what they called his 'apology of terrorism' and 'complicity' in alleged terrorist acts, in the latest action against the Western media. In a message to The Associated Press, he condemned the move as intimidation and an attack on journalism. Nasr, who works for the French broadcaster France 24, gave a detailed analysis of a rare deadly jihadi attack in Mali's capital Bamako on Sep. 17. The prosecutors accused him of having been in contact with the attackers and that they communicated their location, objectives and death toll in real time with him. Nasr also made comments that 'amount to blatant acts of publicity and support of the terrorists,' Manzo Hadiza, the deputy prosecutor of Niger alleged during a press conference Wednesday. Prosecutors from the judicial divisions on terrorism in Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso all issued the same statement apparently in coordination, aired on their national televisions late on Wednesday. 'They are trying to intimidate anyone still contradicting their storytelling about security and control,' Nasr, who is based in France, told the AP in a WhatsApp message. He said the investigation by the three West African countries is a clear attack on journalism. 'We should all have a thought about all journalists and civil society activists who are surviving under the rule of those juntas, they are the ones who need support,' he added. Local journalists in the Sahel region, where Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso are located, are facing increased security risks, the media freedom group Reporters Without Borders said Tuesday. Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso have for more than a decade battled an insurgency fought by armed groups, including some allied with al-Qaida and the Islamic State group. Following military coups in all three nations in recent years, the ruling juntas have expelled French forces and turned to Russian mercenary units for security assistance instead But the security situation in the Sahel has worsened since the juntas took power, analysts say, with a record number of attacks and a record number of civilians killed both by Islamic militants and government forces. Over the first six months of this year, 3,064 civilians were killed by the violence, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project, a 25% increase compared to the previous six months. Meanwhile, the ruling juntas have cracked down on political dissent and journalists. Earlier this year, Malian authorities banned the media from reporting on the activities of political parties and associations. Burkina Faso suspended the BBC and Voice of America radio stations for their coverage of a mass killing of civilians carried out by the country’s armed forces. Earlier this year, Niger's authorities ordered the closure of the 'Maison de la Presse', an umbrella organization of Niger’s journalists’ associations, after it denounced press freedom violations. Nasr's employer France 24 is also suspended in all three countries over its coverage of the insurgency.	https://apnews.com/article/wassim-nasr-journalist-niger-mali-junta-jihadi-attack-d64c665bb5475cc57932150a23507920	2024-09-26T03:29:20-07:00	
Sudan military offensive sparks new fighting in Khartoum as cholera outbreak worsens	CAIRO (AP) — New fighting rocked Sudan's capital on Thursday with airstrikes and drone attacks in and around Khartoum amid a worsening cholera outbreak, officials said. Sudan’s military launched an operation in the early hours of Thursday aimed at taking control of areas in the capital that had been in the hands of its enemy, the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, or RSF. Sudanese media reported increased military movements and airstrikes in the districts of Khartoum and Omdurman, the heaviest in the capital area in months. Mohamed Ibrahim, the health ministry’s spokesperson in Khartoum, said in a statement that four civilians were killed and 14 others wounded in the latest fighting in the Karrari district of Omdurman, a city next to the Sudanese capital, Khartoum. A military spokesman confirmed the operation was underway, but declined to comment further. A military spokesman confirmed the operation was underway, but declined to comment further. The head of Sudan’s military, Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan, addressed the U.N. General Assembly in New York, saying that 'we’ve done everything we could to put an end to this war and to steer our country from the destruction being waged' by the militia. He maintained that position when he spoke to reporters at the Sudanese Mission to the United Nations on Thursday evening. 'The operation going on in Khartoum is meant to preserve the integrity of our country, the safety of our people and our armed forces,' he said. 'The military solution is the last one,' Burhan continued. 'We crave a peaceful solution that spares out people more suffering, more hunger, more displacement.' Burhan, who led a military takeover of Sudan in 2021, is a close ally of neighboring Egypt and its president, former army chief Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi. His country plunged into chaos in April 2023, when long-simmering tensions between its military led by Burhan and the Rapid Support Forces paramilitary commanded by Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo broke out into street battles in Khartoum. Fighting has spread to other parts of the country, especially urban areas and the western Darfur region. At a General Assembly whose doomsday feeling was fueled by three major wars along with inaction on global warming, the fighting and humanitarian catastrophe in Sudan took third place after the killing in the Middle East and Ukraine. The lack of focus on Sudan was bemoaned by many. The 'brutal power struggle' between Sudan’s warring generals has 'unleashed horrific violence,' including widespread rape, and a 'humanitarian catastrophe is unfolding as famine spreads,' U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres told the annual high-level gathering of the 193 member nations on Tuesday. Saudi Arabia, the United States, the European Union, and the United Nations met without measurable results Wednesday to urge Sudan’s warring parties in Sudan to hold breaks in the fighting and allow aid to reach civilians. 'More than 25 million Sudanese face acute hunger,' U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said in a statement Wednesday. 'Some 11 million have fled their homes in what has become the worst humanitarian crisis on the planet ... We must compel the warring parties to accept humanitarian pauses.' Jeremy Laurence, a spokesman for the U.N. human rights office in Geneva, said in a statement to The Associated Press on Thursday that at least 78 civilians were killed because of artillery shelling and airstrikes since the beginning of September in the Khartoum area. 'Our immediate concern is for the welfare of civilians, and the likelihood of further displacement and damage to civilian infrastructure,' he said. For months, some of the worst fighting has been in the city of El Fasher, the capital of the North Darfur state. RSF forces have laid siege to the city since May. On Thursday, U.N. Human Rights Chief Volker Türk said that artillery shelling on a market there had killed at least 20 civilians on Sep. 20 and 21. Meanwhile, the death toll from Sudan’s cholera outbreak jumped by nearly 100 or nearly 20% in only two days, Sudan’s health ministry said Wednesday, in a worrying sign that the disease is spreading more rapidly. A total of 473 people have died from cholera since the country’s rainy season began two months ago, health officials said. Sudan’s Federal Ministry of Health in a Wednesday update reported on Facebook 14,944 cholera cases across 10 states, with 386 new cases. It said that six people died on Tuesday alone in six states. The majority of cases were reported in Kassala, where UNICEF is collaborating with the ministry and the World Health Organization to carry out a second round of the oral cholera vaccination campaign that kicked off last week. UNICEF delivered 404,000 doses of the vaccine to Sudan on Sep. 9. More vaccination campaigns are expected to be rolled out in other affected states. Cholera was officially declared an outbreak on August 12 by the health ministry after a new wave of cases was reported starting July 22. The disease is spreading in areas devastated by recent heavy rainfalls and floods, especially in eastern Sudan which sheltered millions of people displaced by the conflict between the Sudanese military and the RSF. Cholera is a highly contagious disease that causes diarrhea, leading to severe dehydration and could be fatal if not immediately treated, according to WHO. It’s transmitted through the ingestion of contaminated food or water. UNICEF said in a statement last week that an estimated 3.4 million children under the age of 5 are at high risk of epidemic diseases. The war in Sudan created environments prone to disease outbreaks, impacting millions of people already experiencing food insecurity and displacement. The country plunged into war in April 2023 after tensions increased between the military and the RSF. ___ Michael Weissenstein contributed to this report from New York and Jamey Keaten contributed from Geneva.	https://apnews.com/article/sudan-fighting-kassala-cholera-deaths-vaccination-b66971649646394db2bbe7452dc96ccb	2024-09-26T03:25:27-07:00	
Harrods apologizes to women who say they were abused by former owner Mohamed Al Fayed	LONDON (AP) — The managing director of Harrods said Thursday that the London department store is 'deeply sorry' for failing employees who say they were sexually assaulted by late owner Mohamed Al Fayed. Michael Ward said it is clear Al Fayed 'presided over a toxic culture of secrecy, intimidation, fear of repercussion and sexual misconduct.' Five women have told the BBC they were raped by Al Fayed, who died last year aged 94, and several others allege acts of assault and physical violence. Lawyers for the alleged victims say they have been retained by 37 women and the list is growing. Ward said he was 'not aware of his (Al Fayed's) criminality and abuse' during the four years he worked for the Harrod's owner, though 'rumors of his behavior circulated in the public domain.' Al Fayed owned Harrods for a quarter century before selling it 2010 to a company owned by the state of Qatar through its sovereign wealth fund, the Qatar Investment Authority. 'We failed our colleagues and for that we are deeply sorry,' Ward said in a statement. He said Harrods had set up a 'settlement process' for Al Fayed’s victims. 'This was a shameful period in the business’ history,' the statement said. 'However, the Harrods of today is unrecognizable to Harrods under his ownership.' London’s Metropolitan Police say they were made aware of allegations in the past and had questioned Al Fayed in 2008 over the alleged sexual abuse of a 15-year-old, but prosecutors at the time did not take the cases forward. Al Fayed’s family has not commented. Egypt-born businessman Al Fayed moved to Britain in the 1960s and bought Harrods, an upmarket retail emporium in London’s tony Knightsbridge district, in the mid-1980s He became a well-known figure through his ownership of the store and the London soccer team Fulham. He was often in the headlines after his son Dodi was killed alongside Princess Diana in a car crash in Paris in 1997. Al Fayed spent years promoting the conspiracy theory that the royal family had arranged the accident because they did not approve of Diana dating an Egyptian. An inquest concluded that Diana and Dodi died because of the reckless actions of their driver — an employee of the Ritz Hotel in Paris owned by Al Fayed — and paparazzi chasing the couple. Separate inquiries in the U.K. and France also concluded there was no conspiracy.	https://apnews.com/article/harrods-alfayed-women-abuse-allegations-apology-london-3b65a585554f8c7421ba2e47bd98664c	2024-09-26T02:27:53-07:00	
Kremlin says changes in Russia's nuclear doctrine are intended to send a warning to the West	MOSCOW (AP) — Changes in Russia's nuclear doctrine are intended to discourage Ukraine's Western allies from supporting attacks on Russia, the Kremlin said Thursday. The Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that the revisions in the document announced by President Vladimir Putin are a 'warning signal to those countries about the consequences in case of their involvement in an attack on our country with various assets, not necessarily nuclear ones.' In a strong, new warning to the West, Putin said Wednesday that any nation’s conventional attack on Russia that is supported by a nuclear power will be considered a joint attack on his country. The threat, outlined in a revision of Moscow’s nuclear doctrine, was clearly aimed at discouraging the West from allowing Ukraine to strike Russia with longer-range weapons and appears to significantly lower the threshold for the possible use of Russia’s nuclear arsenal. Speaking during Wednesday's Security Council meeting that discussed changes in the nuclear doctrine, Putin didn’t specify whether the modified document envisages a nuclear response to such an attack, but he emphasized that Russia could use nuclear weapons in response to a conventional assault posing a 'critical threat to our sovereignty,' a vague formulation that leaves broad room for interpretation. Russia is making slow but steady gains in Ukraine as the conflict grinds through its third year, and the Kremlin is seeking to discourage stronger Western support for Kyiv. Ukraine has repeatedly struck Russian territory with missiles and drones in response to Moscow’s attacks, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been pushing the U.S. and other Western allies for permission to use the longer-range Western weapons to strike deep inside Russian territory. The Biden administration has said it hasn’t given Kyiv permission for strikes with American weapons deep inside Russia. Putin noted that the revised doctrine spells out conditions for using nuclear weapons in greater detail, noting that they could be used in case of a massive air attack. The new phrasing holds the door open to a potential nuclear response to any aerial attack -- a deliberate ambiguity intended to make the West more reluctant to allow longer-range strikes. Since Putin sent troops into Ukraine in 2022, he and other Kremlin voices have frequently threatened the West with Russia’s nuclear arsenal to discourage it from ramping up support for Kyiv. Earlier this month, Putin warned the U.S. and other NATO allies that allowing Ukraine to use Western-supplied longer-range weapons to hit Russian territory would put Russia and NATO in a direct conflict.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-putin-nuclear-doctrine-ukraine-32c389f00eff87d7138e609e5a322be9	2024-09-26T02:18:50-07:00	
Russian missiles and drones target Kyiv for 5 hours and hit Ukraine's power grid	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine’s air defenses battled an overnight Russian aerial attack on the capital Kyiv for five hours, officials said Thursday, as missiles and drones again hammered the Ukrainian power grid. The Kyiv attack injured at least two people, Ukraine’s Emergency Service said. A kindergarten, a gas pipe and around 20 cars were damaged in the city, said the Kyiv Military Administration. In western Ukraine, the air force said, Russia fired three Kinzhal hypersonic ballistic missiles — one of Russia’s most advanced weapons — 'in the direction of' Starokostiantyniv, a city in the Khmelnytskyi region, on Thursday morning. The air force said it could not make further information public, suggesting the missiles were aimed at a sensitive site. Long-range strikes have been a hallmark of Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine, now deep in its third year, often hitting civilian areas. Attacks on the electricity network have knocked out around 70% of Ukraine’s energy generation capacity, according to the United Nations, bringing blackouts as winter approaches. Air defense systems are a critical need for Ukraine, and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was due to meet President Joe Biden in Washington on Thursday in an effort to ensure continuing U.S. military support for his country. Energy infrastructure was hit in Ukraine's western Ivano-Frankivsk region, causing a blackout in parts of the regional capital of the same name, regional Gov. Svitlana Onyshchuk said. The power grid was also targeted in the southern Mykolaiv region, local authorities said without immediately providing further details. Russia launched six missiles and 78 Shahed drones at Ukraine overnight from Wednesday to Thursday, Ukraine’s air force said. Defenses destroyed four of the missiles and 66 drones in the air, it said. In the south, a missile killed a 62-year-old woman in the Odesa region, where homes and cars were damaged, regional Gov. Oleh Kiper said. In the city of Zaporizhzhia, at least 10 people were injured in the overnight attack, including a 14-year-old, said regional governor Ivan Fedorov. He published photographs of houses with their windows blown out and walls riddled with shrapnel. The Emergency Service said 12 residential buildings were damaged in the city and 18 people were evacuated. Meanwhile, in the northeastern Sumy region ordnance experts defused a 500-kilogram (1,100-pound) glide bomb that landed without exploding next to a bridge over the River Psel. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-kyiv-missiles-drones-power-grid-1a0f720d49468836bb3f565cfcfbc21e	2024-09-26T00:21:46-07:00	
Police are probing apparent cyber vandalism on Wi-Fi networks at UK train stations	LONDON (AP) — U.K. transport officials and police said Thursday they are investigating a 'cyber-security incident' after users of public Wi-Fi networks at the country’s biggest railway stations reported being shown anti-Muslim messages. Passengers trying to log onto the Wi-Fi at 19 stations, including Manchester Piccadilly, Birmingham New Street and several London terminuses, on Wednesday evening were met by a page reading 'We love you, Europe,' followed by an anti-Islam message listing a series of terror attacks. Network Rail, which manages the stations, said the Wi-Fi had been switched off and no passenger data was taken. 'British Transport Police are investigating the incident,' Network Rail said in a statement. 'This service is provided via a third party and has been suspended while an investigation is under way.' The police force confirmed it was investigating reports of 'Islamophobic messaging on some Network Rail Wi-Fi services.' Telent, the company that provides the stations' Wi-Fi, said an 'unauthorized change' to the landing page was made from a 'legitimate administrator account' and that the matter was now subject to criminal investigation. The incident follows a more disruptive cyberattack in early September on Transport for London, which runs the capital’s bus, subway and suburban train system. TFL said some customer names, contact details and potentially bank account details were exposed in the attack, which is being investigated by the National Crime Agency. A 17-year-old was arrested over the attack, questioned and bailed without being charged. Weeks on, the attack continues to affect the transit company’s ability to provide some online services such as refunds and real-time transit information.	https://apnews.com/article/uk-railway-stations-wifi-cyberattack-euston-manchester-678c9fa9d164a3a1ec323be1a7070697	2024-09-26T00:13:38-07:00	
Israel-Hamas war latest: Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon have killed nearly 700 this week	Nearly 700 people been killed in Lebanon this week, according to Lebanon's health ministry, as Israel dramatically escalated strikes, saying it is targeting Hezbollah’s military capacities. Over the past week, Israel has carried out several strikes in Beirut targeting senior Hezbollah commanders. Earlier in the day, a strike in eastern Lebanon killed 20 people, most of them Syrian migrants, according to Lebanese health officials. Also Thursday, the health ministry said two people were killed and 15 were wounded after an Israeli airstrike hit an apartment building in a southern suburb of Beirut. The Israel Defense Force said the strike killed a Hezbollah drone commander, Mohammed Hussein Surour. Lebanon's disaster risk management unit said Thursday in a report that 60 people were killed by Israeli strikes in Lebanon and 81 injured over 24 hours, bringing the total killed since Monday in Lebanon to 696. More than 1,540 people have been killed in Lebanon in the ongoing conflict between Hezbollah and Israel since last October, the report said. After the Beirut explosion, dozens of rockets were fired toward the northern Israeli city of Safed, with one hitting a street in a nearby town. In total, 175 projectiles were fired from Lebanon on Thursday, the military said. Most were intercepted or fell in open areas, some sparking wildfires. The strikes came after Israel's military chief said Wednesday that the country was preparing for a possible ground operation in Lebanon as Hezbollah launched dozens of rockets into Israel. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday that Israel is striking Hezbollah 'with full force' and won’t stop until its goals are achieved. Late Wednesday, the United States, France and other allies jointly called for an 'immediate' 21-day cease-fire to allow for negotiations as fears grow that the violent escalation in recent days — following 11 months of cross-border exchange of fire — could grow into an all-out war. The International Organization for Migration estimated Thursday that more than 200,000 people have been displaced in Lebanon since Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel in support of Hamas after it stormed into Israel, sparking the Israel-Hamas war. That figure includes the more than 100,000 who were displaced before this week’s escalation. Lebanon’s General Security agency said more than 31,000 people crossed the border from Lebanon into Syria in two days. ___ Here’s the latest: Israeli vehicles seen transporting tanks and armored vehicles toward the northern border with Lebanon KIRYAT SHMONA, Israel — Israeli military vehicles were seen transporting tanks and armored vehicles toward the country’s northern border with Lebanon on Thursday, a day after commanders issued a call-up of reservists. Several tanks arrived in Kiryat Shmona, a hard-hit town just several kilometers (miles) from the border. Earlier, Israeli air defenses intercepted a barrage of rockets fired from Lebanon. Israel’s military chief has said the army should prepare for a possible ground operation in Lebanon, and Israel has begun massing forces along the border in recent days. White House says Israel is ‘aware’ of calls for a 21-day cease-fire WASHINGTON — White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that Israel was 'aware' of the joint statement by members of the Group of Seven industrial nations, the European Union and Middle Eastern countries that calls for a 21-day cease-fire between Israel and Lebanon. Jean-Pierre said there continue to be diplomatic conversations in New York City about how to stop the conflict. Asked if the conflict amounted to a war, Jean-Pierre said, 'I’m not going to get into semantics from here.' Migration group linked to UN says 100,000 people in Lebanon have been displaced from their homes by this past week’s fighting BEIRUT — The International Organization for Migration estimated Thursday that more than 200,000 people have been displaced by the conflict in Lebanon, including more than 100,000 who were displaced before this week’s escalation. Lebanon’s General Security agency said more than 31,000 people crossed the border from Lebanon into Syria in two days. Nearly 700 killed in Lebanon by Israeli strikes since Monday BEIRUT— Sixty people were killed by Israeli strikes in Lebanon and 81 injured over the past 24 hours, the country’s disaster risk management unit said in a statement Thursday, bringing the total killed since Monday in Lebanon to 696. A total of 1,540 people have been killed in Lebanon in the ongoing conflict between Hezbollah and Israel since last October, the report said. Tens of thousands of Lebanese have fled areas targeted by heavy Israeli bombardment over the past four days. A total of 77,100 had been registered at shelters for the displaced in that period, the report said. The actual number displaced could be 'many times higher,' it said, as many people who went to stay with relatives or to their own second homes or rented apartments or hotels were not officially registered. Lebanon’s General Security agency recorded 31,730 people crossing the border from Lebanon into Syria over the past two days alone, the report said. Of those, 15,600 were Syrian and 16,130 Lebanese. Shrapnel from last in a series of rocket attacks on northern Israel injures a man JERUSALEM — Israel’s rescue services say a 45 year-old man was moderately injured by shrapnel in the last of a series of rocket attacks on northern Israel on Thursday. According to the Israeli army, some 25 rockets were launched from Lebanon in the last barrage, setting of sirens in a cluster of towns and communities east of Haifa. A total of 175 projectiles were fired so far today from Lebanon on northern Israel, according to the army, most of which were intercepted or fell in open areas. A second barrage of rockets is fired from Lebanon into Israel's north, with no reported injuries TEL AVIV — Some 45 rockets were fired from Lebanon on the northern city of Safed and surrounding communities, according to the Israeli army, shortly after Israel killed a Hezbollah commander in a strike on Beirut. Israeli police said heavy damage was caused by falling fragments, but there were no reports of injuries. It was the second heavy barrage on the area Thursday. A total of 150 projectiles were fired so far Thursday from Lebanon on northern Israel, according to the army, most of which were intercepted or fell in open areas. UK echoes urgent calls for Israel and Hezbollah leaders to accept a cease-fire LONDON — Britain's defense secretary has echoed the call for a pause in Israel's conflict with Hezbollah. 'I urge President Netanyahu and the Lebanese Hezbollah leaders to pay heed to the combined voices at the United Nations to do just that,' John Healey said after a meeting with his U.S. and Australian counterparts in London. Healey said his country has sent 700 troops to Cyprus to assist in a potential emergency evacuation of civilians in Lebanon should a full war break out. U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin pressed both Israel and Lebanon to choose the path of cease-fire and urged each side to accept a temporary pause to avoid further escalation. 'Israel and Lebanon can choose a different path,' he said. 'Despite a sharp escalation in recent days, a diplomatic solution is still viable ... All parties should seize this opportunity.' And he issued a warning to Iran and other U.S. adversaries, saying: 'No one should try to exploit this crisis or expand this conflict.' Netanyahu says Israel won't stop striking Hezbollah NEW YORK — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel is striking Hezbollah 'with full force' and won’t stop until its goals are achieved. Netanyahu spoke as he landed in New York to attend the annual U.N. General Assembly meeting and as U.S. and European officials were pressing for a 21-day halt in fighting between Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah to give time for negotiations. Netanyahu said Israel’s 'policy is clear. We are continuing to strike Hezbollah with full force. And we will not stop until we reach all our goals, chief among them the return of the residents of the north securely to their homes.' He added that he approved the 'targeted killing operation' of the head of Hezbollah’s drone unit in south Beirut Thursday. Israel has dramatically escalated strikes in Lebanon this week, saying it is targeting Hezbollah. Israeli leaders have said they are determined to stop more than 11-months of cross-border fire by the militant group into Israel, which has forced the evacuation of tens of thousands of Israelis from communities in the north. IDF says it killed a Hezbollah drone commander in Beirut airstrike TEL AVIV, Israel — The Israel Defense Force says an airstrike on Beirut has killed a Hezbollah drone commander. Israel's military said Thursday that its fighter jets attacked Beirut on Thursday and killed Mohammed Hussein Surour, who it described as a 'commander of Hezbollah’s aerial unit.' It said Surour 'promoted, directed and commanded many aerial terrorist attacks, including drone attacks, cruise missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles aimed at Israel.' Hezbollah has not commented on the claim. Lebanon says 2 killed in strike on apartment building in south Beirut BEIRUT — Lebanon's Health Ministry says two people were killed and 15 were wounded after an airstrike hit an apartment building in a southern suburb of Beirut. The health ministry said those wounded included a woman who was in critical condition. Al-Manar TV, the TV station of Lebanon’s Hezbollah group, reported earlier Thursday that an Israeli airstrike caused an explosion on an apartment building in south Beirut, but did not give further details. The Israeli military said it carried out a 'targeted strike' south of Beirut. It said more details will be released later. The strike came two days after a similar attack killed a senior Hezbollah military commander with the group’s missile unit. Blinken: The world is united in calling for a cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah NEW YORK — Secretary of State Antony Blinken says the world is united in calling for a cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah and will be seeking approval from Israeli officials after the release of a proposal for a temporary 21-day halt in fighting. 'It is now the G7 countries, the European Union, the leading Arab countries, everyone speaking with one clear voice about the need to get that cease-fire in the north,' Blinken said in an interview with MSNBC on Thursday before he met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s top strategy advisor, Ron Dermer, in New York. Netanyahu himself is en route to New York where he will speak on Friday at the UN General Assembly. His office said the cease-fire call is only a proposal and that Israel would continue to defend its land and people from attacks by Hezbollah from Lebanese territory. 'I can’t speak for him,' Blinken said of Netanyahu. 'I can just say that the world is speaking clearly for virtually all of the key countries in Europe and in the region on the need for the ceasefire.' 'What we’re saying, what the world is saying, is very clear, and we’ll be looking to work with the Israelis and all the parties throughout the rest of the day,' he added. Reports: Israeli strikes wound 5 along Lebanon-Syria border BEIRUT — Syrian pro-government media outlets say Israel’s air force has carried out airstrikes along the Lebanon-Syria border, wounding five people and destroying a bridge that links the countries. Syria’s Sham FM radio station and Dama Post reported that the airstrike wounded five people and destroyed the bridge near the Matraba border crossing on the Lebanese side in the northeastern Hermel region. Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency reported several Israeli airstrikes in Hermel. The Israeli military said it attacked infrastructure used to transfer weapons from Syria to Hezbollah in Lebanon. Hostages' families urge Israel to agree to a cease-fire with both Hezbollah and Hamas TEL AVIV, Israel — Families of Israeli hostages still held in Gaza for nearly a year are urging Israel to ensure than any possible cease-fire deal with Hezbollah includes provisions for the war in Gaza. Gil Dickmann, whose cousin, Carmel Gat, was kidnapped and was one of six Israelis killed in Hamas tunnels in August, said the families of the hostages are feeling forgotten as attention shifts to the northern front. 'We know that these things are connected to each other, the northern part and the southern part, they’re all part of the same large situation in which we are at from October 7th on. And we’re very worried that if we don’t make the right decisions now, we will miss this amazing opportunity to get the hostages out,' Dickmann said on Thursday. He slammed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for missing multiple opportunities to free his cousin over the past 11 months and begged him to agree to a cease-fire with both Hezbollah and Hamas that would include provisions for the hostages. Dickmann’s sister-in-law, Yarden Roman-Gat, was released in the week-long cease-fire deal last November, along with nearly 100 other hostages. Hamas-led militants abducted some 250 people during their Oct. 7 attack in Israel in which some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed. More than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war in Gaza since then. Netanyahu's office plays down hopes for a cease-fire TEL AVIV, Israel — The office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the cease-fire called on by the United States, France and other allies is only a proposal, and that Netanyahu, who is on a flight en route to the United States for the United Nations General Assembly, has not responded to it. The U.S. and its allies jointly called Wednesday for an immediate 21-day cease-fire to allow for negotiations in the escalating conflict between Israel and Hezbollah that has killed more than 600 people in Lebanon in recent days. Israel’s Foreign Minister Israel Katz, who is the acting prime minister during Netanyahu’s trip abroad, said there will be no cease-fire in the north, vowing to continue the fighting in the north 'with full force until victory' and returning the tens of thousands of Israeli citizens evacuated from their homes. Netanyahu's office added that the Israeli military was continuing to strike Hezbollah targets in Lebanon. Lebanese state media says an Israeli strike killed 23 Syrian workers BEIRUT — An Israeli airstrike on a village in northeast Lebanon destroyed a building housing Syrian workers, killing 23 of them and wounding another eight people. State-run National News Agency quoted the village’s mayor Ali Kassas as saying that the bodies of 23 Syrian citizens were pulled out from under the rubble, adding that four other Syrians and four Lebanese were wounded in the same airstrike late Wednesday in the village of Younine, just north of the ancient city of Baalbek in Lebanon’s eastern Bekaa Valley that borders Syria. The Lebanese Red Cross said it evacuated the bodies of nine people following the airstrike. Others were taken by Hezbollah’s paramedic arm as well as the Lebanese Civil Defense, NNA said. A country of about 6 million people, Lebanon hosts nearly 780,000 registered Syrian refugees and hundreds of thousands who are unregistered — the world’s highest refugee population per capita. Israel strikes 75 sites across Lebanon overnight, military says TEL AVIV, Israel — The Israeli military says it struck 75 sites overnight across southern and eastern Lebanon, part of a punishing air campaign in response to Hezbollah rocket fire. The military said Thursday it was targeting Hezbollah military infrastructure, including weapons storage facilities and rocket launchers. Around half a dozen Israelis have been wounded in the latest escalation. Israel strikes have killed more than 630 people in Lebanon since Monday, about a quarter of them women and children. Hezbollah has fired hundreds of projectiles towards Israel over the past week, including a surface-to-surface missile toward Tel Aviv that was intercepted Wednesday. The Israeli military said around 45 projectiles were fired from Lebanon on Thursday, all of them either intercepted or falling in open areas. There were no reports of casualties or damage. Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack ignited the war in Gaza, hoping to pin down Israeli forces. Both Hezbollah and Hamas are close allies of Iran. The fighting has driven tens of thousands of people from their homes on both sides of the border. Israel has vowed to do whatever is necessary to allow its citizens to return, and has moved thousands of troops to the northern border in preparation for what could be a ground campaign into southern Lebanon. The United States, France and other allies jointly called for an 'immediate' 21-day cease-fire in the conflict to 'provide space for diplomacy' as fears grow that the violence could become an all-out war between Israel and Hezbollah, which would further destabilize a region already shaken by the war in Gaza. Britain sends humanitarian aid for civilians in Lebanon NICOSIA, Cyprus — Britain says it’s sending $6.7 million worth of humanitarian assistance, including medical supplies, hygiene kits and fuel to Lebanon to support the civilian population there as fighting forces thousands to flee their homes. The United Kingdom said in a statement that the United Nations agency for children, UNICEF, will distribute the supplies, which will also help aid workers better deal with urgent health and nutrition needs. The U.K. earlier announced that 700 troops, including Border Force and Foreign Office officials, would be deployed to a British military base in Cyprus to prepare for possible evacuations of British citizens from the region as fighting could potentially escalate. An online portal and phone line have been reopened for British nationals in Lebanon to register their presence. Cyprus is situated approximately 210 kilometers (130 miles) west of the Lebanese capital. The east Mediterranean island nation served as a waystation for the repatriation of approximately 60,000 foreign nationals who where evacuated from Lebanon during the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war. Britain’s Minister of State for Development, Women and Equalities, Anneliese Dodds, said the U.K. will continue to support Lebanese people as it urges British nationals to leave the country. British navy ships RFA Mounts Bay and the HMS Duncan were already in the eastern Mediterranean on Thursday, while the Royal Air Force has aircraft and transport helicopters on standby to provide support if needed. US, France and other allies call for an ‘immediate’ 21-day cease-fire between Israel, Hezbollah The United States, France and other allies called Wednesday for an 'immediate' 21-day cease-fire to allow for negotiations in the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah that has killed more than 600 people in Lebanon in recent days. The joint statement, negotiated on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, says the recent fighting is 'intolerable and presents an unacceptable risk of a broader regional escalation.' 'We call for an immediate 21-day cease-fire across the Lebanon-Israel border to provide space for diplomacy,' the statement reads. 'We call on all parties, including the Governments of Israel and Lebanon, to endorse the temporary cease-fire immediately.' The signatories include the United States, Australia, Canada, the European Union, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Qatar. ___ This version revises the number of people killed in the Lebanese village of Younine to 19, in line with information from the Health Ministry.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-hamas-latest-mideast-26-september-2024-5b9819b5d3bd7b1c3da9268affb82b31	2024-09-26T00:12:12-07:00	
Taliban who banned women from public spaces say no one faces discrimination in Afghanistan	KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — The Taliban said Thursday it was absurd to accuse them of gender discrimination and other human rights violations, as four countries vow to hold Afghanistan’s rulers accountable under international law for their treatment of women and girls. Australia, Canada, Germany and the Netherlands are set to start legal proceedings against the Taliban for violating a U.N. convention on women, to which Afghanistan is a party. The countries launched the initiative on Wednesday on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, which is taking place in New York until Monday. Despite promising more moderate rule after they seized power in 2021, the Taliban have barred women and girls from education beyond sixth grade, many public spaces and most jobs. In August, the Vice and Virtue Ministry issued laws banning women’s bare faces and prohibiting them from raising their voices in public. More than 20 countries expressed their support Thursday for the proposed legal action against the Taliban. 'We condemn the gross and systematic human rights violations and abuses in Afghanistan, particularly the gender-based discrimination against women and girls,' the countries said. 'Afghanistan is responsible under international law for its ongoing gross and systematic violation of numerous obligations under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women,' they added. The countries said they did not politically recognize the Taliban as the legitimate leaders of the Afghan population. 'Afghanistan’s failure to fulfill its human rights treaty obligations is a key obstacle to normalization of relations,' they said. The Taliban’s deputy spokesman Hamdullah Fitrat said human rights were protected in Afghanistan and that nobody faced discrimination. 'Unfortunately, an attempt is being made to spread propaganda against Afghanistan through the mouths of several fugitive (Afghan) women and misrepresent the situation,' he said on social media platform X. 'It is absurd to accuse the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan of violating human rights and gender discrimination,' he added. The Taliban reject all criticism of their policies, especially those affecting women and girls, describing it as interference. They maintain that their actions are in line with their interpretation of Islamic law, or Sharia. Fereshta Abbasi, an Afghanistan researcher at Human Rights Watch, urged other countries to register their support for the four countries’ legal action and for them to involve Afghan women as the process moved forward. 'The announcement by Germany, Canada, Australia and the Netherlands may mark the beginning of a path to justice for the Taliban’s egregious human rights violations against Afghan women and girls,' said Abbasi.	https://apnews.com/article/afghanistan-taliban-women-legal-rights-gender-discrimination-93f88c497d9851059361fbc83ab8d20d	2024-09-26T00:01:22-07:00	
Partner in Israeli government threatens to quit if permanent cease-fire is reached with Hezbollah	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — A far-right partner in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government has threatened to quit the coalition if a permanent cease-fire is reached with Hezbollah. Itamar Ben-Gvir, head of the Jewish Power party, threatened to suspend cooperation with the coalition if a temporary deal is reached. 'If a temporary cease-fire becomes permanent, we will resign from the government,' he said. It was the latest sign of displeasure from Netanyahu’s hard-line government toward international cease-fire efforts. If Ben-Gvir leaves the coalition, Netanyahu would lose his parliamentary majority and could see his government come toppling down, though opposition leaders have said they would offer support for a cease-fire deal. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below. TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — The Israeli prime minister on Thursday appeared to downplay hopes of an imminent truce with Hezbollah after the United States and its allies called for an immediate 21-day cease-fire to 'provide space for diplomacy.' In a statement released as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was en route to New York to attend the U.N. General Assembly, his office said there was only a proposal on the table and that he had not yet responded to it. The statement also denied that there had been any directive to ease up on fighting on the northern border with Lebanon. The comments raised questions about a new international initiative to halt increasingly heavy exchanges of fire that have killed hundreds of people in Lebanon and threatened to trigger an all-out war between Israel and Hezbollah. The statement was issued as Israel threatens to launch a ground invasion into Lebanon to push the militant group away from the border and after an Israeli strike in Lebanon killed 20 people, most of them from Syria. The Israeli foreign minister, Israel Katz, previously said that the country would continue fighting 'with all our might until victory and the safe return of the residents of the north to their homes.' Hezbollah has not yet responded to the proposal for a pause in fighting. Lebanon's caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati has welcomed it, but his government has no sway over the group. Hezbollah has insisted it would halt its strikes only if there is a cease-fire in Gaza, where Israel has been battling Hamas for nearly a year. That appears out of reach despite months of negotiations led by the United States, Egypt and Qatar. In its statement, Netanyahu's office said that 'the fighting in Gaza will also continue until all the objectives of the war have been achieved.' Netanyahu is expected to meet with other world leaders on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly. Israel launched a massive operation in Gaza after a Hamas-led attack into southern Israel on Oct. 7 in which some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed, and some 250 were taken hostage. More than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since then, according to local officials. Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel one day after the Oct. 7 attack in support of its Hamas allies, and Hezbollah and Israel have traded fire ever since. Israeli families of the hostages said they are pushing for a possible cease-fire deal for Lebanon to include provisions for the war in Gaza, especially securing release of the roughly 70 hostages still presumed to be alive and the bodies of some 30 others. Gil Dickmann, whose cousin Carmel Gat was kidnapped and was one of six Israelis whose bodies were recovered from tunnels in Gaza in August, said the hostages' families are feeling forgotten as attention shifts to the northern front. 'We know that these things are connected to each other, the northern part and the southern part. They’re all part of the same large situation which we are in from Oct. 7 on, and we’re very worried that if we don’t make the right decisions now, we will miss this amazing opportunity to get the hostages out,' Dickmann said on Tuesday, as hopes for cease-fire deal swelled. He slammed Netanyahu for missing multiple opportunities to free his cousin and begged him not to miss another chance by agreeing to a truce with both Hezbollah and Hamas that would include provisions for the hostages. Dickmann’s sister-in-law, Yarden Roman-Gat, was released in a weeklong cease-fire deal last November, along with some 100 other hostages. Israel has carried out days of heavy strikes across Lebanon, targeting what it says are Hezbollah rocket launchers and other military infrastructure. The militants have fired hundreds of rockets into Israel and on Wednesday targeted Tel Aviv for the first time with a longer-range missile that was intercepted. On Thursday, an Israeli airstrike in Lebanon hit a building housing Syrian workers and their families, killing 19 Syrians and one Lebanese, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. It was one of the deadliest single strikes in the intensified air campaign against Hezbollah. Lebanon’s National News Agency said the strike occurred near the ancient city of Baalbek in the Bekaa Valley, which runs along the Syrian border. The news agency initially reported that 23 people were dead. Hussein Salloum, a local official in Younine, said most of the dead were women and children, and that rescue efforts lasted through the night and into Thursday morning. 'We dug through the rubble with our own hands' until a small bulldozer was brought in, Salloum told The Associated Press by telephone. 'We had very limited capabilities.' The Lebanese Red Cross said it recovered nine bodies, while others were recovered by Hezbollah’s paramedic service and the Lebanese Civil Defense. Lebanon, with a population of around 6 million, hosts nearly 780,000 registered Syrian refugees and hundreds of thousands who are unregistered — the world’s highest refugee population per capita. Israel struck 75 sites overnight across southern and eastern Lebanon, the military said. At least 45 projectiles were fired from Lebanon early Thursday, all of which were intercepted or fell in open areas, it said. Israeli strikes since Monday have killed more than 630 people in Lebanon, according to local health authorities, who say around a quarter were women and children. Several people have been wounded by shrapnel in Israel. The fighting has killed dozens of people in Israel and driven tens of thousands from their homes on both sides of the border. Israel has vowed to do whatever is necessary to allow its citizens to return, and it has moved thousands of troops to the northern border in preparation for a possible ground operation. ___ Mroue reported from Beirut.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-gaza-news-09-26-2024-486f5aecac210273611124f9ade95fc6	2024-09-25T23:46:33-07:00	
South Korea publishes compensation plan for dog meat farmers ahead of 2027 ban	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea announced plans Thursday to compensate famers and others in the country's dwindling dog meat industry before a formal ban goes effect in 2027, a move that is drawing opposition from both farmers and animal rights activists. South Korea’s parliament passed a landmark bill in January that will ban slaughtering, breeding or selling dog meat for human consumption after a three-year grace period. It will be punishable by 2-3 years in prison. The Agriculture Ministry said that farmers would receive compensation starting from 225,000 won ($170), and rising up to 600,000 won ($450) per dog if they agree to shut down their business early. It’s likely that farmers won't accept the offer, as they earlier called for 2 million won ($1,505) per dog. They've said the ban infringes on their freedom and will aggravate their economic difficulties. In a statement Tuesday, an association of dog farmers called for the law to be amended to extend the grace period and add appropriate compensation plans. Sangkyung Lee, a campaign manager at the Korean office of the anti-animal cruelty group Humane Society International, called the South Korean announcement 'an important milestone in this historic ban that will see the ban through to completion and end our country’s dog meat era for good.' But Lee said his office is 'disappointed' at the South Korean plan because it would pay farmers based on the number of dogs they have, 'potentially increasing dog breeding to get more money from the scheme and more puppies being born into suffering.' Dog meat consumption is a centuries-old practice on the Korean Peninsula. Dog meat are eaten in China, Vietnam, Indonesia and some African countries. But South Korea’s dog meat industry has drawn more attention because of the country’s reputation as a cultural and economic powerhouse. It’s also the only nation with industrial-scale dog farms. South Korea’s anti-dog meat campaign received a big boost from the country’s first lady, Kim Keon Hee, who repeatedly expressed her support for a prohibition. She was subjected to withering criticism and crude insults during demonstrations by farmers. Surveys have found that that around one in three South Koreans opposes the ban, though most people now don’t eat dog meat and favor a ban. Vice Agriculture Minster Park Beomsu told reporters that government studies found that about 466,000 dogs are currently being raised for food across South Korea. He said officials will try to convince farmers to voluntarily phase out dog breeding ahead of the ban. After the ban comes into force, Park said, the government plans to facilitate adoptions for the remaining dogs or move them to care facilities rather than euthanize them. The agriculture ministry said butchers will also be compensated, while local authorities will be responsible for dismantling dog farms and slaughterhouses. Former farmers and butchers will also get low-interests loans if they pivot to other agricultural businesses. The ministry said authorities will also offer financial assistance to traders and restaurant owners to shut down their businesses and find new jobs.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-dog-meat-ban-farmers-8f4b077a3e31a541dfd0ca4b1db2ee17	2024-09-25T21:45:52-07:00	
Pope Francis heads for Luxembourg and Belgium on a trip to a dwindling flock	VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis is traveling to once-strong bastions of Christianity in the heart of Europe to try to reinvigorate a Catholic flock that is dwindling in the face of secular trends and abuse scandals that have largely emptied the continent’s magnificent cathedrals and village churches. Francis stops first Thursday in Luxembourg, the European Union’s second-smallest country, with a population of some 650,000 people, and its richest per capita. Torrential downpours are expected, days after the 87-year-old pope canceled his audiences because of a slight flu. He seemed in fine form at the Vatican on Wednesday, during his general audience on the eve of the trip, but his respiratory health is a constant concern and his medical team will be on hand. After meeting with Luxembourg’s political leaders, Francis will speak to the country’s Catholic priests and nuns. The venue is the late-Gothic Cathedral of Notre Dame, which was built in the early 1600s by Francis’ own Jesuit order and stands as a monument to Christianity’s long and central place in European history. Francis is likely to dwell on Europe’s role past, present and future — particularly as war rages on European soil — during his visits to Luxembourg and Belgium, where he arrives later Thursday and stays through the weekend. The trip is a much-truncated version of the 10-day, 1985 tour St. John Paul II made through Luxembourg, Belgium and the Netherlands, during which the Polish pope delivered 59 speeches or homilies and was greeted by hundreds of thousands of adoring faithful. In Luxembourg alone, John Paul drew a crowd of some 45,000 people to his Mass, or some 10% of the then-population, and officials had predicted a million people would welcome him in Belgium, according to news reports at the time. But then as now, the head of the Catholic Church faced indifference and even hostility to core Vatican teachings on contraception and sexual morals, opposition that has only increased in the ensuing generation. Those secular trends and the crisis over clergy abuse have helped lead to the decline of the church in the region, with monthly Mass attendance in the single digits and plummeting ordinations of new priests. Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said that by traveling to the two countries, Francis will likely want to offer 'a word to the heart of Europe, of its history, the role it wants to play in the world in the future.' Immigration, climate change and peace are likely to be themes during the four-day visit, which was organized primarily to mark the 600th anniversary of the founding of Belgium’s two main Catholic universities. In Luxembourg, Francis has a top ally and friend in the lone cardinal from the country, Jean-Claude Hollerich, a Jesuit like the Argentine pope. Hollerich, whom Francis made a cardinal in 2019, has taken on a leading role in the pope’s multi-year church reform effort as the 'general rapporteur' of his big synod, or meeting, on the future of the Catholic Church. In that capacity, Hollerich has helped oversee local, national and continental-wide consultations of rank-and-file Catholics and synthesized their views into working papers for bishops and other delegates to discuss at their Vatican meetings, the second session of which opens next week. Last year, in another sign of his esteem for the progressive cardinal, Francis appointed Hollerich to serve on his kitchen cabinet, known as the Council of Cardinals.

Japanese court acquits a former boxer in a 1966 murder retrial after decades on death row	TOKYO (AP) — A Japanese court ruled Thursday that an 88-year-old former boxer was not guilty in a retrial for a 1966 quadruple murder, reversing an earlier wrongful conviction after decades on death row. Iwao Hakamada’s acquittal by the Shizuoka District Court makes him the fifth death-row convict to be found not guilty in a retrial in postwar Japanese criminal justice. The case could rekindle a debate around abolishing the death penalty in Japan. The court's presiding judge, Koshi Kunii, said the court acknowledged a multiple fabrications of evidence and that Hakamada was not the culprit, NHK said. Hakamada was convicted of murder in the 1966 killing of a company manager and three of his family members, and setting a fire to their central Japan home. He was sentenced to death in 1968, but was not executed due to lengthy appeals and the retrial process. He spent 48 years behind bars — most of them on death row — making him the world’s longest-serving death row inmate. It took 27 years for the top court to deny his first appeal for retrial. His second appeal for a retrial was filed in 2008 by his sister Hideko Hakamada, now 91, and the court finally ruled in his favor in 2023, paving the way for the latest retrial that began in October. Hakamada was released from prison in 2014 when a court ordered a retrial based on new evidence suggesting his conviction may have been based on fabricated accusations by investigators, but was not cleared of the conviction. After his release, Hakamada served his sentence at home because his frail health and age made him a low risk for escape. At a final hearing at the Shizuoka court in May before Thursday’s decision, prosecutors again demanded the death penalty, triggering criticism from rights groups that prosecutors were trying to prolong the trial. The extremely high hurdles for retrials have also prompted legal experts to call for a revision to the system. During the investigation that followed his arrest, Hakamada initially denied the accusations, then confessed. He later said he was forced to confess under violent interrogation by police. A major point of contention was five pieces of blood-stained clothing that investigators claimed Hakamada wore during the crime and hid in a tank of fermented soybean paste, or miso. The clothes were found more than a year after his arrest. A Tokyo High Court ruling in 2023 acknowledged scientific experiments that clothing soaked in miso for more than a year turns too dark for bloodstains to be spotted, noting a possible fabrication by investigators. Defense lawyers and earlier retrial decisions said the blood samples did not match Hakamada’s DNA, and trousers that prosecutors submitted as evidence were too small for Hakamada and did not fit when he tried them on. Japan and the United States are the only two countries in the Group of Seven advanced nations that retain capital punishment. A survey by the Japanese government showed an overwhelming majority of the public support executions. Executions are carried out in secrecy in Japan and prisoners are not informed of their fate until the morning they are hanged. In 2007, Japan began disclosing the names of those executed and some details of their crimes, but disclosures are still limited. Supporters say Hakamada’s nearly half-century detention has taken a toll on his mental health. Most of his time behind bars was spent in solitary confinement, in fear of execution. He spent a total of 48 years in prison, more than 45 of them on death row. His sister Hideko Hakamada has devoted around half of her life to win his innocence. Before Thursday's ruling, she said she was in a never-ending battle. 'It is so difficult to get a retrial started,' She told reporters in Tokyo. 'Not just Iwao, but I’m sure there are other people who have been wrongly accused and crying. … I want the criminal law revised so that retrials are more easily available.'	https://apnews.com/article/japan-retrial-boxer-hakamada-death-penalty-a99eb431ab14fbb8edeb5113e7043977	2024-09-25T20:24:14-07:00	
NASA, Boeing and Coast Guard representatives to testify about implosion of Titan submersible	Representatives for NASA, Boeing Co. and the U.S. Coast Guard are slated to testify in front of investigators Thursday about the experimental submersible that imploded en route to the wreckage of the Titanic. OceanGate co-founder Stockton Rush was among the five people who died when the submersible imploded in June 2023. The design of the company's Titan submersible has been the source of scrutiny since the disaster. The Coast Guard opened a public hearing earlier this month that is part of a high level investigation into the cause of the implosion. Some of the testimony has focused on the troubled nature of the company. Thursday's testimony is scheduled to include Justin Jackson of NASA; Mark Negley of Boeing Co.; John Winters of Coast Guard Sector Puget Sound; and Lieutenant Commander Jonathan Duffett of the Coast Guard Office of Commercial Vessel Compliance. Earlier in the hearing, former OceanGate operations director David Lochridge said he frequently clashed with Rush and felt the company was committed only to making money. 'The whole idea behind the company was to make money,' Lochridge testified. 'There was very little in the way of science.' Lochridge and other previous witnesses painted a picture of a company that was impatient to get its unconventionally designed craft into the water. The accident set off a worldwide debate about the future of private undersea exploration. The hearing is expected to run through Friday and include more witnesses. The co-founder of the company told the Coast Guard panel Monday that he hoped a silver lining of the disaster is that it will inspire a renewed interest in exploration, including the deepest waters of the world’s oceans. Businessman Guillermo Sohnlein, who helped found OceanGate with Rush, ultimately left the company before the Titan disaster. 'This can’t be the end of deep ocean exploration. This can’t be the end of deep-diving submersibles and I don’t believe that it will be,' Sohnlein said. Coast Guard officials noted at the start of the hearing that the submersible had not been independently reviewed, as is standard practice. That and Titan’s unusual design subjected it to scrutiny in the undersea exploration community. OceanGate, based in Washington state, suspended its operations after the implosion. The company has no full-time employees currently, but has been represented by an attorney during the hearing. During the submersible’s final dive on June 18, 2023, the crew lost contact after an exchange of texts about Titan’s depth and weight as it descended. The support ship Polar Prince then sent repeated messages asking if Titan could still see the ship on its onboard display. One of the last messages from Titan’s crew to Polar Prince before the submersible imploded stated, 'all good here,' according to a visual re-creation presented earlier in the hearing. When the submersible was reported overdue, rescuers rushed ships, planes and other equipment to an area about 435 miles (700 kilometers) south of St. John’s, Newfoundland. Wreckage of the Titan was subsequently found on the ocean floor about 330 yards (300 meters) off the bow of the Titanic, Coast Guard officials said. No one on board survived. OceanGate said it has been fully cooperating with the Coast Guard and NTSB investigations since they began. Titan had been making voyages to the Titanic wreckage site going back to 2021.	https://apnews.com/article/titan-titanic-oceangate-coast-guard-hearing-implosion-8aa838f7a068dde5d90b834cdd69d359	2024-09-25T20:13:17-07:00	
Helene is upgraded to Category 2 hurricane as it barrels toward Florida	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Fast-moving Hurricane Helene was advancing Thursday across the Gulf of Mexico toward Florida, threatening an 'unsurvivable' storm surge in northwestern parts of the state as well as damaging winds, rains and flash floods hundreds of miles inland across much of the southeastern U.S., forecasters said. Helene was upgraded Thursday morning to a Category 2 storm and is expected to be a major hurricane — meaning a Category 3 or higher — when it makes landfall on Florida's northwestern coast Thursday evening. As of early Thursday, hurricane warnings and flash flood warnings extended far beyond the coast up into south-central Georgia. The governors of Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas and Virginia have all declared emergencies in their states. Rain was beginning to blow in the predawn darkness Thursday along coastal U.S. Highway 98, which winds through countless fishing villages and vacation hideaways along Florida’s Big Bend. Shuttered gas stations dotted the two-lane highway, their windows boarded up with plywood to protect from the storm. The road was largely empty at first light on Thursday, with what drivers there were mostly heading northeast, towards higher ground. The storm was expected to make landfall in the Big Bend region, where Florida’s panhandle and peninsula meet, according to Jack Beven, senior hurricane specialist at the National Hurricane Center in Miami. 'Regardless of how strong it is, it is a very large storm, Beven said. 'It’s going to have impacts that cover a large area.' The National Weather Service office in Tallahassee forecast storm surges of up to 20 feet (6 meters) and warned they could be particularly 'catastrophic and unsurvivable' in Florida's Apalachee Bay. It added that high winds and heavy rains also posed risks. 'This forecast, if realized, is a nightmare surge scenario for Apalachee Bay,' the office said. 'Please, please, please take any evacuation orders seriously!' This stretch of Florida known as the Forgotten Coast has been largely spared by the widespread condo development and commercialization that dominates so many of Florida’s beach communities. The sparsely populated region is loved for its natural wonders — the vast stretches of salt marshes, tidal pools and barrier islands; the dwarf cypress trees of Tate’s Hell State Forest; and Wakulla Springs, considered one of the world’s largest and deepest freshwater springs. In Crawfordville, farther inland and about 25 miles (40 kilometers) northwest of Apalachee Bay, Christine Nazworth stocked up on bottled water, baked goods and premade meals at a Walmart. She said her family would be sheltering in place, despite Wakulla County issuing a mandatory evacuation order. 'I’m prayed up,' she said. 'Lord have mercy on us. And everybody else that might be in its path.' Along Florida's Gulf Coast, school districts and multiple universities have cancelled classes. Helene was about 320 miles (515 kilometers) southwest of Tampa on Thursday morning and moving north-northeast at 12 mph (19 kph) with top sustained winds of 100 mph (155 kph). Forecasters said it should become a Category 3 or higher hurricane, meaning winds would top 110 mph (177 kph). While Helene will likely weaken as it moves inland, its 'fast forward speed will allow strong, damaging winds, especially in gusts, to penetrate well inland across the southeastern United States,' including in the southern Appalachian Mountains, the hurricane center said. The center posted lesser tropical storm warnings as far north as North Carolina, and warned that much of the region could experience prolonged power outages, toppled trees and dangerous flooding. Helene had swamped parts of Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula on Wednesday, flooding streets and toppling trees as it passed offshore and brushed the resort city of Cancun. The storm formed Tuesday in the Caribbean Sea. In Cuba, the government preventively shut off power in some communities as waves as high as 16 feet (5 meters) slammed Cortes Bay. And in the Cayman Islands, schools closed and residents pumped water from flooded homes. Helene is forecast to be one of the largest storms in breadth in years to hit the region, said Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach. He said since 1988, only three Gulf hurricanes were bigger than Helene’s predicted size: 2017’s Irma, 2005’s Wilma and 1995’s Opal. Areas 100 miles (160 kilometers) north of the Georgia-Florida line can expect hurricane conditions. More than half of Georgia’s public school districts and several universities canceled classes. For Atlanta, Helene could be the worst strike on a major Southern inland city in 35 years, said University of Georgia meteorology professor Marshall Shepherd. Landslides were possible in southern Appalachia, and rainfall was expected as far away as Tennessee, Kentucky and Indiana. Federal authorities have positioned generators, food and water, along with search-and-rescue and power restoration teams. Helene is the eighth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which began June 1. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has predicted an above-average Atlantic hurricane season this year because of record-warm ocean temperatures. In further storm activity, Tropical Storm Isaac formed Wednesday in the Atlantic and was expected to strengthen as it moves eastward across the open ocean, possibly becoming a hurricane by the end of the week, forecasters said. Isaac was about 690 miles (1,115 kilometers) northeast of Bermuda with top sustained winds of 50 mph (85 kph), according to the hurricane center, which said its swells and winds could affect parts of Bermuda and eventually the Azores by the weekend. In the Pacific, former Hurricane John reformed Wednesday as a tropical storm and strengthened Thursday morning back into a hurricane as it threatened areas of Mexico’s western coast with flash flooding and mudslides. Officials posted hurricane warnings for southwestern Mexico. John hit the country’s southern Pacific coast late Monday, killing at least two people, triggering mudslides, and damaging homes and trees. It grew into a Category 3 hurricane in a matter of hours and made landfall east of Acapulco. It reemerged over the ocean after weakening inland. ___ Hollingsworth reported from Mission, Kansas.

Zelenskyy is visiting the White House as a partisan divide grows over Ukraine war	WASHINGTON (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is visiting Washington on Thursday as U.S. support for his country's fight against Russia faces a partisan reckoning in this year's presidential election. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee for president, has pledged to continue sending military assistance to Ukraine if she's elected, and she'll have her own meeting with Zelenskyy after the Ukrainian leader sits down with President Joe Biden. However, Zelenskyy's tumultuous relationship with former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, continued to deteriorate this week. Instead of meeting with Zelenskyy, Trump has criticized him. As for U.S. support for Ukraine, Trump complained that 'we continue to give billions of dollars to a man who refuses to make a deal' to end the war. It's the most politically treacherous landscape that Zelenskyy has encountered in Washington since the war with Russia began nearly three years ago. Ukrainian officials are anxious to maintain good relations with whoever becomes the next president of the United States, which is its biggest and most important provider of arms, money and other support. But the effort risks slipping into the political blender of the election, polarizing the discussion around a war that used to be a bipartisan cause célèbre in Washington. The latest round of sniping started on Sunday, when The New Yorker published an interview with Zelenskyy in which he criticized JD Vance, Trump's running mate, as 'too radical' for suggesting that Ukraine needs to give up some territory to end the war. Zelenskyy also dismissed Trump's boasts that he could quickly negotiate a solution, saying 'my feeling is that Trump doesn’t really know how to stop the war even if he might think he knows how.' On the same day, Zelenskyy toured a Pennsylvania factory producing munitions for the war. He was joined by Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro, a top surrogate for Harris, and Republicans criticized the visit as a political stunt in a political battleground state. House Speaker Mike Johnson demanded that Zelenskyy fire the Ukrainian ambassador to the U.S., alleging that the tour was 'designed to help Democrats and is clearly election interference.' Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, won't meet with Zelenskyy on Thursday when he makes the rounds on Capitol Hill before heading to the White House. However, Zelenskyy is expected to talk with some House members, including the Republican chairs of several committees. He's also scheduled to meet with senators in a bipartisan session hosted by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. Zelenskyy's trip to Washington coincides with the annual meeting of the U.N. General Assembly in New York, where the Ukrainian leader spoke on Wednesday. Last week, Trump said he would 'probably' meet with Zelenskyy while he was in the U.S., but a senior campaign official said there was never a meeting on the books. The official, who requested anonymity to discuss private conversations, said Trump had told Zelenskyy back in July that it would probably be better not to sit down together until after the election. A Zelenskyy aide did not respond to questions about the potential meeting. Trump was impeached during his first term over asking Zelenskyy for help investigating Biden, then a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, at a time when the Ukrainian leader was seeking support from Washington. Now there are fears that Trump would cut off or add strings to U.S. military assistance if he returned to the White House. Trump has also spoken admiringly about Russian President Vladimir Putin, and this week he praised Russia's record of winning wars. Charles Kupchan, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said Trump is not wrong to want a negotiated end to the war. However, he said, Trump risks undermining Ukraine by enabling Putin to make more gains on the battlefield. 'Neither Ukraine nor Russia is going to win this war, and the sooner that the parties try to end this, the better,' Kupchan said. 'Where Trump goes off course, and where Biden and Harris have a much stronger argument, is that we get to that point not by throwing Ukraine under the bus but by giving them sufficient support so they can block further Russian aggression.' Zelenskyy can expect a far different tone from Harris, who met with him in Munich just days before Russia invaded. During her debate with Trump earlier this month, Harris expressed pride in U.S. support for Ukraine's 'righteous defense.' 'If Donald Trump were president, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv right now,' she said. ___ Associated Press writers Aamer Madhani and Michelle Price in New York and Ellen Knickmeyer and Lisa Mascaro in Washington contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/zelenskyy-joe-biden-kamala-harris-trump-229804fd42332c584dfbe05224634e44	2024-09-25T19:13:02-07:00	
Georgia's anti-LGBTQ+ measures raise fears of hate crimes in the conservative South Caucasus nation	TBILISI, Georgia (AP) — Dozens of Georgians stood in tearful silence in a central square near parliament last week to mourn Kesaria Abramidze, a transgender actor and model who was stabbed to death the previous day in her apartment. Alongside flowers and candles, some carried banners that read, 'Hate kills.' Some in the conservative South Caucasus nation see a direct line between violent attacks, such as the one on the 37-year-old Abramidze, and a sweeping measure that severely restricted LGBTQ+ rights which was given final approval by parliament a day before the slaying. Activists fear the measure could increase hate crimes. The bill, introduced by the ruling Georgian Dream party, includes bans on same-sex marriages, adoptions by same-sex couples and public endorsement and depictions of LGBTQ+ relationships and people in the media. It also bans gender-affirming care and changing gender designations in official documents. The events were a chilling reminder of the vulnerability of LGBTQ+ people in the country of 3.7 million where the Orthodox Church wields significant influence. 'We have been saying all along, all these months, that laws like this are going to cause violence and are going to increase the number of people that are physically attacked,' Tamar Jakeli, the head of Tbilisi Pride, told The Associated Press at the vigil. 'We are quite desperate, honestly,' Jakeli added. 'We don’t know how we can survive in this country under this law, under this government.' Concerns about Russian influence Because the measure echoes similar laws in Russia, some Georgians fear they are being drawn further into Moscow's orbit after more than three decades of independence following the collapse of the USSR. Authorities in both countries believe the laws protect 'traditional family values' from what they call dangerous foreign influence. Georgian Dream introduced the anti-LGBTQ+ bill shortly after parliament adopted a law in June that requires media and nongovernmental organizations to register with authorities if they get more than 20% of their funding from abroad. This is similar to a Russian measure that the Kremlin uses against its critics and other dissenters. For years, Moscow has sought to bring Georgia back under its influence, fighting a brief war in 2008 over a breakaway province. The decade-long rule of Georgian Dream -– a party created by shadowy billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili, who made his fortune in Russia -– has raised concerns it is acting in concert with the Kremlin. Many ordinary Georgians supported Ukraine as Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his invasion in 2022. But Georgia's government refused to impose sanctions on Moscow, barred Kremlin critics from entering the country, and accused the West of trying to drag Tbilisi into the conflict. Georgia's 'foreign influence' law ignited mass protests, with critics saying it threatened democracy and jeopardized Georgia’s bid to join the European Union. Georgian Dream pressed ahead anyway, approving the anti-LGBTQ+ bill. The measure still could be vetoed by President Salome Zourabichvili, long at odds with the party, but it has enough seats to override her the same way it did with the foreign influence law. The EU's criticism and Georgia's response After the foreign influence law passed, the EU halted Georgia's effort to join the bloc that began in 2022 and froze some financial support. The U.S. also imposed sanctions on government officials and parliament members. The anti-LGBTQ+ measure further deepened that rift. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said it 'will undermine the fundamental rights of the people, increasing discrimination and stigmatization.' Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze replied that such criticism 'will not benefit the image of the European Union within Georgian society.' 'In our perception, Europe represents transparency, traditional, Christian values. For centuries, Georgians have strived toward Europe because we were united by shared Christian traditions and culture,' Kobakhidze said, arguing the measure protects families and minors. It is seen as a populist step to win conservatives' support in the Oct. 26 parliamentary election in which Georgian Dream seeks to maintain its dominance. 'They are just using the same methods and means and tools Russia is using -– to somehow … take people’s attention (away) from the real problems and create a new enemy somewhere within the society, and then defeat that enemy that doesn’t really exist,' said Giorgi Davituri of the Institute for Development of Freedom of Information in an AP interview. A setback for the vulnerable LGBTQ+ community The sweeping restrictions on LGBTQ+ rights and representation mirror those adopted in Russia over the last decade, packaged into one crippling blow. Some of them, like the ban on same-sex weddings, cement existing Georgian law that defines marriage as a 'voluntary union between a man and a woman.' Others, like the ban on gender-affirming medical care or changing one’s gender in documents, drives an entire social group, such as trans people, to the fringes. 'Everybody is really under threat, but trans people are the most vulnerable,' said Tbilisi Pride’s Jakeli, because the legislation bans 'any kind of physical intervention which is needed for trans people to continue living.' Giorgi Gogia, associate director of the Europe and Central Asia division at Human Rights Watch, told AP the legislation's impact may be far-reaching, limiting multiple rights, including to health care, peaceful assembly and education. It's at odds with Georgia’s laws that ban discrimination based on gender identity, among other things, Gogia said. More dangerously, it 'perpetuates already existing negative stereotypes about LGBTQ+ people in the country and encourages hate speech, and could lead to further violent incidents,' he said. Gogia pointed to the stabbing death of Abramidze, even though he believed it's unlikely the developments are directly linked. A 26-year-old man was detained, and police opened an investigation on a charge of 'premeditated murder committed with particular cruelty and aggravating circumstances on gender grounds.' Abramidze was famous in Georgia as 'a symbol of the freedom and fight and a very strong woman,' said Taki Mumladze, a director, actor and screenwriter. Mumladze, who co-wrote and starred in a movie depicting a same-sex relationship and later directed a play about it, told AP the killing shocked Georgians, whatever side of the issue they were on. Georgia was 'very, very homophobic' at one point, she said, recalling anti-gay demonstrations two years ago on the day her movie premiered. Such protests are common in the country. Last year, hundreds of opponents of gay rights stormed an LGBTQ+ festival in Tbilisi, forcing its cancellation, and tens of thousands marched in the capital this year to promote 'traditional family values.' But Mumladze said attitudes had begun to change in recent years, thanks to NGOs educating society and providing support for the LGBTQ+ community. She says her own conservative, religious parents saw her movie and play, and really liked both. 'So I felt very good. And now with this law … even my art will be forbidden,' she said. 'It’s crazy that the government is trying to stop this progress.' She and Jakeli are pinning their hopes on the upcoming election. 'We are mobilizing for the elections,' Jakeli said. 'We are urging everybody to go and vote, go and vote for Georgia’s European future, which also includes human rights for all, including us.' Added Mumladze: 'I hope with the elections we will change this because if not, we will lose this country for a long, long time.' —- Litvinova reported from Tallinn, Estonia. __ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Stock market today: Wall Street follows global markets higher on reports of more China stimulus	Wall Street traded higher before the bell Thursday, following global markets that surged on reports that China plans to spend billions of dollars to help rebuild the capital of state-run banks and provide other fiscal support for the economy. Futures for the S&amp;P 500 rose 0.8% in premarket trading, while futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4%. The slowdown in China’s economy has weighed on trade and global growth, and blasts of stimulus from Beijing have lifted markets this week. Bloomberg and other reports cited unnamed sources as saying that the Chinese government would spend 1 trillion yuan ($142 billion) on capital injections for lenders. Earlier this week, Li Yunze, head of the National Financial Regulatory Commission, told reporters in Beijing that regulators would increase capital at six large banks, but he gave no dollar amount. Banks interest margins and profits have shrunk, so 'It is necessary to coordinate various channels such as internal and external channels to replenish capital,' Li said at a news conference that showcased a raft of policies aimed at countering a prolonged downturn in the property sector. Hong Kong's Hang Seng jumped 4.2% to 19,924.58, and the Shanghai Composite index surged 3.6% to 3,000.95. Elsewhere in Asia, the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo advanced 2.8% to 38,925.63. South Korea's Kospi jumped 2.9%, to 2,671.57 after semiconductor maker SK Hynix launched production of a new memory chip for artificial intelligence. SK Hynix shares jumped 9.4%. In Australia, the S&amp;P/ASX 200 picked up 1% to 8,203.70. 'Asian stocks shrugged off Wall Street’s stumble and surged ahead on Thursday, riding high on renewed optimism over China’s stimulus push. It seems like China hasn’t run out of kitchen sinks just yet,' Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary. Germany’s DAX gained 1.2%, the CAC 40 in Paris was up 1.6% and in London, the FTSE 100 rose 0.2%. In off-hours trading, U.S. chipmaker Micron jumped 17% after it breezed past Wall Street's profit and revenue estimates and gave a strong forecast, boosted by 'robust AI demand,' the company said. Oil companies are under pressure again, and crude prices fell for the second day after The Financial Times reported through sources that Saudi Arabia is preparing to abandon its unofficial price target of $100 a barrel for crude as it prepares to increase output. Chevron, Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips were all down between 1% and 2% before the bell. Benchmark U.S. crude fell below $70 per barrel this week and on Thursday, shed $1.81 to hit $67.88 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard, gave up $1.77 to $71.13 per barrel. The U.S. dollar fell to 144.27 Japanese yen from 144.76 yen. The euro was trading at $1.1156, up from $1.1133. The next date on the calendar circled for a potentially big market move is next week's monthly update on the U.S. job market. Investors are concerned over slowing hiring now that inflation has eased significantly from its peak two summers ago. The number of layoffs remains relatively low, but U.S. employers are also more hesitant to hire. The Fed kept its main interest rate at a two-decade high for more than a year in hopes of slowing the U.S. economy enough to stifle inflation. Last week, it swung toward protecting the job market by cutting the federal funds rate by a larger-than-usual half of a percentage point. Critics say it may be moving too late. On Wednesday, the S&amp;P 500 slipped 0.2% to 5,722.26, a day after setting an all-time high for the 41st time this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.7% to 41,914.75 after likewise setting a record the day before. The Nasdaq composite edged up by less than 0.1%, to 18,082.21.	https://apnews.com/article/stock-market-rates-china-hynix-f58b8c824feec1ffabb48b0ae608791f	2024-09-25T19:01:33-07:00	
Hong Kong court to sentence 2 former Stand News editors in landmark sedition case	HONG KONG (AP) — A Hong Kong court is set to sentence two journalists Thursday in a landmark sedition case that is widely seen as an indicator of media freedom in a city once known as a beacon of press freedom in Asia. Stand News former editor-in-chief Chung Pui-kuen and former acting editor-in-chief Patrick Lam were the first journalists convicted under a colonial-era sedition law since the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997. The now-shuttered news outlet was one of last in Hong Kong that dared to criticize authorities as Beijing imposed a crackdown on dissidents following massive pro-democracy protests in 2019. The closure came months after the demise of pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily, whose jailed founder Jimmy Lai is battling collusion charges under a tough national security law imposed by Beijing in 2020. Last month, the court found Chung and Lam guilty of conspiracy to publish and reproduce seditious publications, along with Best Pencil (Hong Kong) Ltd., the outlet’s holding company. They face up to two years in prison and a fine of 5,000 Hong Kong dollars (about $640). Judge Kwok Wai-king wrote in his verdict that Stand News had become a tool for smearing the Beijing and Hong Kong governments during the 2019 protests. He ruled that 11 articles published under the pair’s leadership carried seditious intent, including commentaries written by activist Nathan Law and veteran journalists Allan Au and Chan Pui-man. Chan, who is also Chung’s wife, earlier pleaded guilty in the Apple Daily case and is in custody awaiting her sentence. Kwok said Lam and Chung were aware of and agreed with the seditious intent, and that they made Stand News available as a platform to incite hatred against Beijing or Hong Kong's government and the judiciary. On Thursday morning, dozens of residents were in lines to secure a seat in the courtroom. Former Stand News reader Andrew Wong, 35, said he wanted to attend the hearing to show his support though he felt like 'attending a funeral.' Wong, who works in a non-governmental organization, said he had expected the convictions last month but he still felt 'a sense that we've passed a point of no return' when he heard about the verdict. 'Everything we had in the past is gone,' he said. Their trial, which began in October 2022, lasted some 50 days. The verdict was postponed several times for reasons including a wait for an appeal outcome in another landmark sedition case. Their lawyer Audrey Eu argued for the pair to be sentenced to up to time served, saying their case was different because they were journalists whose responsibility was to report on the city's situation and different people's views. The pair also stressed their journalistic mission in their mitigation letters. The pair was detained for nearly a year after their arrests before being released on bail in late 2022. Eu said Lam has been diagnosed with a rare disease and has had to undergo chemotherapy. Lam, who has a young daughter, lost his chance to pursue overseas studies due to this case, she said. Chung has been out of work and his wife is now in custody, she added. Hong Kong was ranked 135 out of 180 territories in Reporters Without Borders’ latest World Press Freedom Index, down from 80 in 2021, and 18 in 2002. Self-censorship has also become more common during the political crackdown on dissent following the 2019 protests, with increased reports of harassment against journalists in recent months. In March, the city government enacted another new security law that raised concerns about further curtailment of press freedom. ___ Follow AP's Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific	https://apnews.com/article/hong-kong-stand-news-editors-sentencing-patrick-lam-chung-puikuen-6ba89ae7da4df43265f1228950dd9718	2024-09-25T17:49:45-07:00	
What to know from the UN: Ukraine doesn't want the world to forget, and attention turns to Lebanon	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Sometimes the issues brought forward at the United Nations signature annual meeting may feel a bit familiar. Climate change is always in focus, especially in the past few years. There are regular disputes about who is on the security council. Pleas to stop wars and address hunger. But this year, it's what's not getting as much attention that has Ukraine concerned. The war in Ukraine was center stage the last two times that world leaders convened for the high-level meeting of the General Assembly. But this year, the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and the escalating developments along the Israeli-Lebanese border have gotten much of the spotlight. Ukraine president VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, at the podium, implored world leaders not to give in to calls for a ceasefire that doesn't guarantee Ukraine's sovereignty. 'When some propose alternatives, half-hearted settlement plans, so-called sets of principles, it not only ignores the interests and suffering of Ukrainians who are affected by the war the most, it not only ignores reality, but also gives Putin the political space to continue the war,' Zelenskyy said. Here’s your daily guide to what’s going on at the United Nations this week, day by day: From the podium French President EMMANUEL MACRON told the U.N. General Assembly that 'Israel cannot, without consequence, just expand its operations to Lebanon.' He urged Israel to cease the escalation, and Hezbollah to cease missile launches to Israel. Panama President JOSE RAUL MULINO drew attention to the humanitarian crisis playing out in his country. More than half a million migrants crossed the Darien jungle last year that joins Colombia and Panama. 'Panama today is the new border of the United States,' Mulino said, noting that the migrants crossing his country are seeking a better life in the U.S. 'I ask you to see the magnitude of what is happening because we feel like we don’t have the international support we are due.' On the sidelines The chance of a ceasefire proposal to try to stop fighting between Israel and Lebanon took up a lot of oxygen behind the scenes on Wednesday. Rumors floated through the halls, and France called a last-minute session to discuss the conflict. At the session, French Foreign Minister JEAN-NOEL BARROT said later in a meeting of the Security Council that France was working with the U.S. on a proposal for a 21-day ceasefire. Climate moment In a special high-level summit to address the impacts of rising seas, small island nations pleaded for the survival and insisted on their sovereignty despite overflowing oceans. Sea level rise 'threatens the well-being of our peoples’ cultures, food security and livelihoods,' said Samoan Prime Minister FIAME NAOMI MATA'AFA, speaking for 39 small island nations. Marshall Islands President HILDA HEINE and others said even if their lands are submerged, their nations should still be recognized, asking the world not to 'rig the map and try to erase us with a pencil… sovereignty ultimately rests with our people, not in distant diplomatic centers.' U.S. Secretary of State ANTONY BLINKEN said the United States is committed to counter — or at least adapt to — rising sea levels that pose an existential threat to many coastal communities around the world. Blinken also said that the Biden administration would oppose any effort to limit or curtail the rights of any countries affected by it.

Trump says Ukraine is 'dead' and dismisses its defense against Russia's invasion	Former President Donald Trump described Ukraine in bleak and mournful terms Wednesday, referring to its people as 'dead' and the country itself as 'demolished,' and further raising questions about how much the former president would be willing if elected again to concede in a negotiation over the country's future. Trump argued Ukraine should have made concessions to Russian President Vladimir Putin in the months before Russia's February 2022 attack, declaring that even 'the worst deal would’ve been better than what we have now.' Trump, who has long been critical of U.S. aid to Ukraine, frequently claims that Russia never would have invaded if he was president and that he would put an end to the war if he returned to the White House. But rarely has he discussed the conflict in such detail. His remarks, at a North Carolina event billed as an economic speech, come on the heels of a debate this month in which he pointedly refused to say whether he wanted Ukraine to win the war. On Tuesday, Trump touted the prowess of Russia and its predecessor Soviet Union, saying that wars are 'what they do.' The Republican former president, notoriously attuned to slights, began his denunciation of Ukraine by alluding to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's recent criticism of Trump and running mate JD Vance. Zelenskyy, who is visiting the U.S. this week to attend the U.N. General Assembly, told The New Yorker that Vance was 'too radical' for proposing that Ukraine surrender territories under Russian control and that Trump 'doesn’t really know how to stop the war even if he might think he knows how.' Said Trump, 'It's something we have to have a quick discussion about because the president of Ukraine is in our country and he’s making little nasty aspersions toward your favorite president, me.' Trump painted Ukraine as a country in ruins outside its capital, Kyiv, short on soldiers and losing population to war deaths and neighboring countries. He questioned whether the country has any bargaining chips left to negotiate an end to the war. 'Any deal — the worst deal — would’ve been better than what we have now,' Trump said. 'If they made a bad deal it would’ve been much better. They would’ve given up a little bit and everybody would be living and every building would be built and every tower would be aging for another 2,000 years.' 'What deal can we make? It’s demolished,' he added. 'The people are dead. The country is in rubble.' Zelenskyy is pitching the White House on what he calls a victory plan for the war, expected to include an ask to use long-range Western weapons to strike Russian targets. While Ukraine outperformed many expectations that it would fall quickly to Russia, outnumbered Ukrainian forces face grinding battles against one of the world’s most powerful armies in the country's east. A deal with Russia would almost certainly be unfavorable for Ukraine, which has lost a fifth of its territory and tens of thousands of lives in the conflict. Trump laid blame for the conflict on President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, his Democratic rival in November. He said Biden 'egged it all on' by pledging to help Ukraine defend itself rather than pushing it to cede territory to Russia. 'Biden and Kamala allowed this to happen by feeding Zelenskyy money and munitions like no country has ever seen before,' Trump said. Notably, Trump did not attack Putin's reasoning for launching the invasion, only suggesting Putin would not have started the war had Trump been in office. He did say of Putin, 'He's no angel.'	https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-ukraine-putin-zelenskyy-0f4d539aa73a943474d779716e5fe42a	2024-09-25T11:21:38-07:00	
A zoo in Finland is returning giant pandas to China because they're too expensive to keep	HELSINKI (AP) — A zoo in Finland has agreed with Chinese authorities to return two loaned giant pandas to China more than eight years ahead of schedule because they have become too expensive for the facility to maintain amid declining visitors. The private Ähtäri Zoo in central Finland some 330 kilometers (205 miles) north of Helsinki said Wednesday on its Facebook page that the female panda Lumi, Finnish for 'snow,' and the male panda Pyry, meaning 'snowfall,' will return 'prematurely' to China later this year. The panda pair was China’s gift to mark the Nordic nation’s 100 years of independence in 2017, and they were supposed to be on loan until 2033. But since then the zoo has experienced a number of challenges, including a decline in visitors due to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic and the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, as well as an increase in inflation and interest rates, the facility said in a statement. The panda deal between Helsinki and Beijing, a 15-year loan agreement, had been finalized in April 2017 when Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Finland for talks with Finland's then-President Sauli Niinistö. The pandas arrived in Finland in January 2018. The Ähtäri Zoo, which specializes in typical northern European animals such as bears, lynxes and wolverines, built a special panda annex at a cost of some 8 million euros ($9 million) in hopes of luring more tourists to the remote nature reserve. The upkeep of Lumi and Pyry, including a preservation fee to China, cost the zoo some 1.5 million euros annually. The bamboo that giant pandas eat was flown in from the Netherlands. The Chinese Embassy in Helsinki noted to Finnish media that Beijing had tried to help Ähtäri to solve its financial difficulties by, among things, urging Chinese companies operating in Finland to make donations to the zoo and supporting its debt arrangements. However, declining visitor numbers combined with drastic changes in the economic environment proved too high a burden for the smallish Finnish zoo. The panda pair will enter into a monthlong quarantine in late October before being shipped to China. Finland, a country of 5.6 million, was among the first Western nations to establish political ties with China, doing so in 1950. China has presented giant pandas to countries as a sign of goodwill and closer political ties, and Finland was the first Nordic nation to receive them.	https://apnews.com/article/finland-giant-pandas-china-449b913189d85e7fef7ded9897db7f9d	2024-09-25T09:12:42-07:00	
Remains of South African freedom fighters arrive home from Zimbabwe and Zambia	JOHANNESBURG (AP) — The remains of 42 South African freedom fighters who died while exiled in Zimbabwe and Zambia during the struggle against white minority rule arrived in their home country Wednesday. The remains were received by government officials and family members at Waterkloof Air Force Base in the capital Pretoria after being exhumed for reburial in the country of their birth. This was part of a government program to bring closure to families, whose loved ones died away from home while serving in the underground structures of both the African National Congress and Pan Africanist Congress, according to officials. Before the apartheid system ended in South Africa in 1994, many activists left the country to receive military training elsewhere with the aim of returning home to wage an armed struggle. Others left the country to avoid being arrested by the apartheid regime for their involvement in anti-apartheid activities, and chose Zimbabwe and Zambia where the underground structures were the strongest. After it was banned in South Africa, the African National Congress party of Nelson Mandela, shifted its headquarters to the Zambian capital, Lusaka. Many died in exile and were buried in those countries. Among the remains returned to South Africa were those of freedom struggle stalwarts Duma Nokwe, Florence Mophosho and Basil February. Speaking during a Heritage Day event in South Africa on Tuesday, South Africa's Deputy President Paul Mashatile said the repatriation was part of efforts to teach future generations about the role played by many in the struggle against apartheid. 'As a national memory project, this initiative aims to commemorate, celebrate, educate, promote, preserve, conserve, and provide a durable testament to South Africa’s road to freedom,' Mashatile said. President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to host a homecoming ceremony for the repatriated remains on Friday before they are handed over to families for reburials. The government said Wednesday it was in the process of repatriating the remains of other South Africans from Lesotho, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Angola, Russia and other countries. 'I hope this process will culminate in getting more people in other countries who died under difficult conditions. We welcome them back to connect with their families,' Deputy Defense Minister Bantu Holomisa said. ___ Follow AP's Africa coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/africa	https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-mortal-remains-repatriation-struggle-heroes-dd026b4e58dad42ebf98bfba4e8fe86e	2024-09-25T08:57:53-07:00	
Bahamas seeks help to pay off debt brought by huge storms, result of climate change	NEW YORK (AP) — The Bahamas is stuck in a financial pickle, much of it because of the whims of climate change, bureaucracy and the fossil fuel industry, said its prime minister, who adds that he is tired of promises of help but little action. And he's not alone. Like many other countries in the Global South, Bahamas has a lot of debt from warming-connected weather disasters its leaders say it did little to cause. In October 2016, a powerful Category 4 Hurricane Matthew slammed into the Bahamas, causing more than $7 million in damage. Then in 2019 Hurricane Dorian, the strongest storm to hit his country on record, caused $3.4 billion in damage. By comparison the country’s annual revenue is only $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion a year, Davis said. So just four days wiped out more than a year’s worth of revenue. The country is now in debt by about $10 billion. Its leaders are seeking more help, more money, from the Global North and oil companies themselves, Bahamas Prime Minister Philip Davis said in an interview with The Associated Press. Climate finance — which is about the annual $2.4 trillion need for developing nations dealing with climate change and shifting to a greener economy — is a key issue this week at the United Nations and in November in international climate negotiations in Azerbaijan. But when Bahamas tries to get financial aid from already established funds, the country is told it's too well off. That's something other countries, especially small island nations, have complained about. Research shows that, generally, climate change has made the most powerful storms stronger and wetter. The Bahamas produces less heat-trapping carbon dioxide in one year than the United States does in four hours, according to figures from the Global Carbon Project, which tracks national emissions. Barbados prime minister calls for dramatic changes in debt relief Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley, who has been a leader in the call for changes in the climate financial system, earlier this week told a climate week session that 70% of the world's poor live in countries considered middle income and the system of financial help doesn't work for them, calling on dramatic changes in multi-national bank lending and debt relief. 'We have seen some changes. We have seen some initiatives taken, but the problem is that the temperatures are moving faster than we are making changes,' Mottley said. 'If that is the case we will have a bigger problem than we anticipated.' One of the biggest sticking points in international climate finance negotiations is not just how much is paid, but who pays it. Rich nations say the need is so big that all the money can't be grants from developed nations, and must include investments from private industry, including the banking sector. Both Davis and Mottley said they understand rich governments don't have enough money by themselves, so private help will play a role. But they add a catch. It should be as part of a 'polluters pay' system that especially targets companies such as the fossil fuel industry that are heavily responsible for the climate change problem. 'Some of the oil producing companies ought to pay at least 2% of their profits into a fund to help us in the global South,' Davis said. But he said he doubts that they'll do so willingly, so the Bahamas attorney general is pushing later this year to ask an international court to make the firms pay. Rising water, shrinking land Bahamas like other island nations is watching its land shrink and sink because of sea level rise, Davis said. There are 700 islands but they are only ten feet (three meters) above sea level. 'We are standing on ground that is quickly disappearing,' Davis said. Still, Davis said even though many islands will be under water in 50 years or so, he refuses to see parts of his country 'wiped off the map,' adding how important sovereignty is for island nations that may get submerged, an issue that will be discussed in a special United Nations General Assembly sea level rise summit Wednesday. 'I’m optimistic because I believe in human ingenuity. I believe that once we come together, you could defeat this existential threat to humanity,' Davis said. 'Over the years, humankind has overcome many, many challenges. And this is just another one.' ___ Read more of AP’s climate coverage at http://www.apnews.com/climate-and-environment ___ Follow Seth Borenstein on X at @borenbears ______ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Thousands are pouring into Syria, fleeing worsening conflict in Lebanon	JDEIDET YABOUS, Syria (AP) — Families fleeing the escalating conflict in Lebanon poured into Syria in growing numbers on Wednesday, waiting for hours in heavy traffic to reach the relative safety of another war-torn country. U.N. officials estimated that thousands of Lebanese and Syrian families had already made the journey. Those numbers are expected to grow as Israel targets southern and eastern Lebanon in an aerial bombardment that local officials say has killed more than 600 people this week, at least a quarter of them women and children. Israel says it is targeting Hezbollah fighters and weapons. Lines of buses and cars extended for several kilometers (miles) from the Syria border beginning on Monday, and some families were seen making the journey on foot. Once in Syria, people waited hours more to be processed by overwhelmed border officials, and relief workers handed out food, water, mattresses and blankets. 'Many will have to spend the night outdoors waiting their turn,' Rula Amin, a spokesperson for the U.N.'s refugee agency, said in a statement. Amin said some of the people arriving from Lebanon had visible injuries suffered from recent attacks. The cross-border flow was a striking reversal in fortunes given that Lebanon is still hosting more than one million Syrian refugees who fled the war in their country that began in 2011. That’s when an initially peaceful anti-government uprising was met by a brutal government crackdown and spiraled into an ongoing civil war. In the Syrian border town of Jdeidet Yabous, some families sat glumly on the side of the road when Associated Press journalists visited the area. Some used their bags as seats, waiting for taxis, buses or relatives to pick them up. Many said they had spent eight or nine hours in traffic just to get into Syria. Before crossing the border, crowds packed into a government office to be processed by immigration officers and, in the case of Syrian citizens, to change $100 to Syrian pounds before entering — a measure imposed in an attempt to prop up the local currency by bringing more dollars into the country. Due to the sudden spike in demand, the supply of Syrian pounds at the border ran short. Some were returning refugees, like Emad al-Salim, who had fled Aleppo in 2014. He was living in the southern coastal city of Tyre when Monday’s bombardment began. He gathered his wife and six children and fled again. 'There were houses destroyed in front of me as we were coming out,' he said. 'It took us three days to get here.' Nada Hamid al-Lajji returned with her family after seven years in Lebanon with her husband. They are from eastern Syria, but al-Lajji said she doesn't know if they will return there. 'Where am I going to go?' she said. 'I don’t even have a house anymore. I don’t know where I will go.' Many Lebanese families were also fleeing. Mahmoud Ahmad Tawbeh from the village of Arnoun in the country's south had come with an extended family of 35 people, planning to stay in a rented house in a Damascus suburb. 'We left with difficulty, there were a lot of bombs dropping above our heads,' he said. Five or six houses in the village were destroyed and several neighbors were killed, he said. For many in Lebanon, particularly those living in the Bekaa Valley in the east, Syria appeared to be the quickest route to safety. Israeli strikes across the country this week have wounded more than 2,000. Many of the Lebanese arriving at the border refused to speak to journalists or would not give their full names because of the sensitivity of the situation. One woman from the town of Harouf in southern Lebanon, who gave her family name, Matouk, said she had come with her brother’s wife, who is Syrian, to stay with in-laws. Several families near where they lived were killed, she said, and she was worried about her father and siblings who she had left behind. While the war in Syria is ongoing, active fighting has long been frozen in much of the country. Lebanese citizens, who can cross the border without a visa, regularly visit Damascus. And renting an apartment is significantly cheaper in Syria than in Lebanon. Even before the latest escalation, some Lebanese had rented in Syria as a Plan B in case they needed to flee. Apart from those who fled the war, many Syrians come to Lebanon for work or family reasons, and regularly cross the border. However, many of those who came as refugees have been reluctant to return out of fear they could be arrested for real or perceived ties to the opposition to Syrian President Bashar Assad or forcibly conscripted to the army. If they leave Lebanon they could also lose their refugee status. Earlier this week, Assad issued an amnesty for crimes committed before Sept. 22, including those who dodged compulsory military service. He had issued similar amnesties over the past years, but they largely failed to convince refugees to return, as have efforts by Lebanese authorities to organize 'voluntary return' trips. ___ Sewell reported from Beirut.	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-syria-refugees-displaced-8a1fbde03c81fb3672e27d479f5b5a34	2024-09-25T08:25:58-07:00	
Dominican president warns of 'drastic measures' if anti-gang mission in Haiti fails	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — The president of the Dominican Republic warned Wednesday that his administration would take 'drastic measures' to protect the country if a U.N.-backed mission in neighboring Haiti targeting gang violence fails. Luis Abinader did not provide details of what action he might take during his speech at the U.N. General Assembly in New York. Gangs in Haiti control 80% of the capital, Port-au-Prince, and they have grown more powerful since the July 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse. More than 3,600 people have been reported killed during the first half of this year, a more than 70% increase compared with the same period last year. The violence also has left nearly 700,000 Haitians homeless in recent years and thousands have fled Haiti, which shares the island of Hispaniola with the Dominican Republic. Abinader thanked Kenya, which is leading the mission in Haiti with nearly 400 police officers from the East African country recently joined by nearly two dozen police and soldiers from Jamaica and two senior military officers from Belize. Another 300 police from Kenya are expected to deploy within a month. The personnel, however, falls significantly short of the 2,500 pledged by various countries for the mission, which the U.S. government warns is lacking resources as it considers a possible U.N. peacekeeping mission. Abinader said the current mission needs to be fully established so that free and transparent elections can be held. Haiti has not held elections since 2016, and a transitional presidential council was ordered to do so by February 2026. 'Practically one year from the holding of elections, the conditions are still not in place to do so,' Abinader said as he expressed concern over the future of the mission. 'We cannot allow the effort made to date to fail. If that were to happen, Haiti’s collapse would be imminent.' Earlier this year, gangs launched coordinated attacks targeting critical government infrastructure. They raided more than two dozen police stations, opened fire on the main international airport, forcing it to close for nearly three months, and stormed Haiti’s two biggest prisons, releasing roughly 4,000 inmates. The attacks led to the resignation of former Prime Minister Ariel Henry and the creation of a transitional presidential council. 'More than three years of instability in our neighboring country has put significant pressure on our own security,' Abinader said. 'The Dominican state has shouldered a high responsibility in the Haitian crisis, far more than should be expected of it.' Abinader said that last year, 10% of medical appointments involved Haitians and that 147,000 of 200,000 foreign minors in the Dominican education system are Haitian in origin. 'The crisis in Haiti warrants particular attention,' he said. 'We can’t do it alone.' Under Abinader, Dominican officials last year deported more than 170,000 people believed to be Haitians, according to government data. But the U.N.’s International Organization for Migration has estimated the number is closer to more than 224,000. Activists have long criticized Abinader and his administration for what they say is the ongoing violation of the human rights of Haitians and those born in the Dominican Republic to parents of Haitian descent. Abinader has rejected the accusations, reiterating Wednesday that 'the Dominican government is profoundly committed to protecting human rights.' In his speech, he noted that the Dominican Republic’s 19% poverty rate is the lowest in the country’s history, and the murder rate has dropped to 10 killings for every 100,000 inhabitants, compared with 13 in 2022. The president of Haiti’s transitional presidential council, Edgard Leblanc Fils, is scheduled to speak Thursday at the U.N. General Assembly. He and other government officials did not respond to messages for comment following Abinader’s speech. Also on Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who recently traveled to Haiti, met with other officials at the U.N. to discuss the mission. They talked about the status of contributions, the timeline of other deployments and the possibility of a U.N. peacekeeping mission as one option to secure funds and personnel. A senior U.S. State Department official said the most urgent priority is to renew the mission's mandate, which expires Oct. 2. The official said the U.S. and some of its partners would like to make changes to the mandate to lay out a path 'to become a more traditional peacekeeping operation,' but the Russians and Chinese, who supported the initial mandate, have expressed concerns about doing that. The main benefit of modifying the mandate would be securing a more stable funding stream for the mission: 'We’re optimistic that the renewal will happen in some form,' the official said. Prime Minister Garry Conille said during the meeting that while Haiti’s situation has improved a bit, 'we’re nowhere near winning this.' He said about 25% of Haiti’s police officers have left the country, and of those still working, about two are wounded and one killed every week. 'The police force right now is underequipped to be able to handle this and will need further support and help and accompaniment if we’re to be successful,' Conille said. He said he expects Haiti to hold elections by November 'even though we know we will not have the highest level of security.' During the meeting, Blinken announced an additional $160 million to help Haitians and U.S. Treasury Department sanctions against former Haitian lawmaker Prophane Victor, accused of supporting and arming gangs. Also sanctioned was gang leader Luckson Elan, accused of human rights abuses. Neither could be reached for comment. In a message delivered to officials who met to talk about the mission, U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said the first deployments were a positive step but warned gangs are still committing 'egregious human rights abuses' and that funding for the mission 'remains totally inadequate.' 'Improving security is crucial to creating the conditions necessary for these elections,' he said as he described the situation in Haiti as 'one of the most disastrous humanitarian situations in the world.' ___ Associated Press diplomatic writer Matthew Lee in New York contributed. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/un-haiti-dominican-republic-gangs-06ddf6972aee4e9fbe3c64893dc47e5f	2024-09-25T08:25:26-07:00	
Putin lowers threshold of nuclear response as he issues new warnings to the West over Ukraine	MOSCOW (AP) — In a strong, new warning to the West, President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday that any nation’s conventional attack on Russia that is supported by a nuclear power will be considered a joint attack on his country. The threat, outlined in a revision of Moscow’s nuclear doctrine, was clearly aimed at discouraging the West from allowing Ukraine to strike Russia with longer-range weapons and appears to significantly lower the threshold for the possible use of Russia’s nuclear arsenal. Speaking at a meeting of Russia’s Security Council that considered changes in the doctrine, Putin announced that a revised version of the document states that an attack against his country by a nonnuclear power with the 'participation or support of a nuclear power' will be seen as their 'joint attack on the Russian Federation.' Putin didn’t specify whether the modified document envisages a nuclear response to such an attack, but he emphasized that Russia could use nuclear weapons in response to a conventional attack posing a 'critical threat to our sovereignty,' a vague formulation that leaves broad room for interpretation. Russia is making slow but steady gains in Ukraine as the conflict grinds through its third year, and the Kremlin is seeking to discourage stronger Western support for Kyiv. The change in the doctrine follows Putin’s warning to the U.S. and other NATO allies that allowing Ukraine to use Western-supplied longer-range weapons to hit Russian territory would mean that Russia and NATO are at war. Since Putin sent troops into Ukraine in 2022, he and other Kremlin voices have frequently threatened the West with Russia's nuclear arsenal to discourage it from ramping up support for Kyiv. The current doctrine says Moscow could use its nuclear arsenal 'in response to the use of nuclear and other types of weapons of mass destruction against it and/or its allies, as well as in the event of aggression against the Russian Federation with the use of conventional weapons when the very existence of the state is in jeopardy.' Russia's hawks have been calling for toughening the doctrine for months, criticizing the current version as too vague and weak. They argue it has failed to deter the West from increasing aid to Ukraine and has created the impression that Moscow won’t ever resort to nuclear weapons. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he will seek permission from his allies in the U.S. and Europe to use the longer-range weapons to strike deep inside Russian territory, another red line for some of Ukraine’s supporters. The Biden administration has said it hasn’t given Kyiv permission for strikes with U.S. weapons deep inside Russia. Putin emphasized that the revised doctrine spells out conditions for using nuclear weapons in greater detail, noting they could be used in case of a massive air attack. 'Conditions for Russia's move to use nuclear weapons are clearly stated' in the revisions, he said. 'We will consider such a possibility when we receive reliable information about a massive launch of air and space attack assets and them crossing our state border,' Putin added, citing 'strategic and tactical aircraft, cruise missiles, drones, hypersonic and other flying vehicles.' The broad formulation appears to significantly broaden the triggers for possible nuclear weapons use, compared with the current version of the document, which states Russia could tap its atomic arsenal if its receives 'reliable information is received about the launch of ballistic missiles targeting the territory of Russia or its allies.' Ukraine has repeatedly struck Russian territory with missiles and drones in response to Moscow's attacks. The new phrasing holds the door open to a potential nuclear response to any aerial attack -- a deliberate ambiguity intended to make the West more reluctant to allow longer-range strikes. 'Regardless of whether you think this is a bluff or not, it’s never good when a major nuclear power loosens the conditions for nuclear use in its declaratory policy,' said Samuel Charap, senior political scientist at RAND, in a post on X. Putin also said the revised doctrine envisages that Russia could use nuclear weapons in response to an aggression against its ally Belarus, adding that he has agreed on the issue with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus with an iron hand for more than 30 years, has relied on Russia's subsidies and support. He has let Russia to use his country's territory to send troops into Ukraine and allowed the Kremlin to deploy some of Russia's tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-nuclear-doctrine-putin-aggressor-fd2f2664c2589cdadfe84bd0bdb7275e	2024-09-25T08:16:01-07:00	
Residents of northern Israel's largest city face Hezbollah fire and brace for the worst	HAIFA, Israel (AP) — The sandy beaches of Haifa, Israel’s third-largest city, are empty. Businesses are shutting early, and many restaurants are closed. The only places filling up, as the threat of a wider war with Hezbollah mounts, are public bomb shelters. Haifa, a seaside city of nearly 300,000 people, is the cultural and economic capital of northern Israel. It has increasingly come into Hezbollah 's sights since fighting with Israel escalated this week and residents are bracing for what many fear will be the worst round of violence since a war nearly two decades ago pounded the city with rockets. 'Everything is lousy. The air raid sirens don’t stop,' said David Maman, a Haifa resident who was out taking a breather from a bomb shelter. Israel and Hezbollah are locked in their most intense round of fighting since the monthlong 2006 war, which ended in a draw. The Iran-backed Lebanese militant group began firing at Israel a day after Hamas attacked it on Oct. 7, and there have been fears ever since that the sides could end up in all-out war. This week’s escalation has brought the region the closest its been over the past year to that point, with Israel stepping up its strikes in Lebanon and Hezbollah expanding its fire deeper into Israel, including to Haifa. On Wednesday, Lebanese officials said Israeli strikes killed dozens of people. That raised the death toll from the past three days to more than 600, with more than 2,000 people wounded. Fleeing families have flocked to Beirut and the coastal city of Sidon, and thousands have fled into neighboring Syria. Haifa was hit by a barrage of some 300 rockets during the monthlong 2006 war, with about 100 of those causing damage to homes, according to Gil Meller, the city’s deputy spokesperson. Israel now has a robust air-defense system helping to shoot down incoming rockets and tufts of white smoke could be seen over the city as interceptors blasted Hezbollah rockets in the sky. But the threat from the rockets remains, and, on Sunday, one slammed into a suburb of Haifa, damaging homes and cars. The Israeli military said five rockets have been launched toward the city since Sunday. With fear of a looming wider war, Meller said Haifa has opened 110 public shelters for the roughly 40% of the city’s population that doesn’t have access to a bomb shelter in their homes or apartment buildings, mostly older structures. Those shelters are equipped with air conditioning, generators, water and wireless internet, he said, adding that the municipality was prepared to use more than a dozen underground parking lots should the need arise. 'Haifa is ready,' he said. The city has taken other measures to protect its citizens. Some 60,000 children and teens are studying remotely and the city’s main hospital earlier this week moved patients to a fortified underground ward. About 11% of the city's population is of Palestinian origin, making it one of the few predominantly Jewish Israeli cities with a sizable Arab population. For many, the biggest concern of a wider war is the economic effect it might have on residents, according to Amal Oraby, a local activist. 'It's a blow to businesses. Businesses say, ‘If I open, I lose money. If I close, I lose money,’' said Oraby. Israel's Palestinian citizens are on the whole poorer than Jewish Israelis and so could suffer the effects more keenly. Outside one public shelter, residents seated on plastic chairs gathered in anticipation of the next siren. Inside the shelter, thin mattresses were splayed out on the floor beside people’s few belongings: diapers, plastic cups, backpacks. Young children, off school, sat inside aimlessly. 'There is endless shelling here,' said Orly Betesh, a Haifa resident spending her days near the shelter because her own home has no protective space. 'This is the only place we have to protect ourselves.' ___ Goldenberg reported from Tel Aviv, Israel.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-north-hezbollah-bomb-shelters-rockets-haifa-65a6e07dfc42325d3cea9b2ec8d11da8	2024-09-25T07:44:56-07:00	
Pope expels a bishop and 9 other people from a Peru movement over 'sadistic' abuses	VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis took the unusual decision Wednesday to expel 10 people – a bishop, priests and laypeople -- from a troubled Catholic movement in Peru after a Vatican investigation uncovered 'sadistic' abuses of power, authority and spirituality. The move against the leadership of the Sodalitium Christianae Vitae, or Sodalitium of Christian Life, followed Francis’ decision last month to expel the group’s founder, Luis Figari, after he was found to have sodomized his recruits. It was announced by the Peruvian Bishops Conference, which posted a statement from the Vatican embassy on its website that attributed the expulsions to a 'special' decision taken by Francis. The statement was astonishing because it listed abuses uncovered by the Vatican investigation that have rarely if ever been punished canonically — such as hacking someone's communications — and cited the people the pope held responsible. According to the statement, the Vatican investigators uncovered physical abuses 'including with sadism and violence,' sect-like abuses of conscience, spiritual abuse, abuses of authority, economic abuses in administering church money and the 'abuse in the exercise of the apostolate of journalism.' The latter was presumably aimed at a Sodalitium journalist who has attacked critics of the movement on social media. Figari founded the SCV, as it is known, in 1971 as a lay community to recruit 'soldiers for God,' one of several Catholic societies born as a conservative reaction to the left-leaning liberation theology movement that swept through Latin America, starting in the 1960s. At its height, the group counted about 20,000 members across South America and the United States. It was enormously influential in Peru. Victims of Figari’s abuses complained to the Lima archdiocese in 2011, though other claims against him reportedly date to 2000. But neither the local church nor the Holy See took concrete action until one of the victims, Pedro Salinas, wrote a book along with journalist Paola Ugaz detailing the twisted practices of the Sodalitium in 2015, entitled 'Half Monks, Half Soldiers.' An outside investigation ordered by Sodalitium later determined that Figari was 'narcissistic, paranoid, demeaning, vulgar, vindictive, manipulative, racist, sexist, elitist and obsessed with sexual issues and the sexual orientation' of Sodalitium’s members. The investigation, published in 2017, found that Figari sodomized his recruits and forced them to fondle him and one another. He liked to watch them 'experience pain, discomfort and fear,' and humiliated them in front of others to enhance his control over them, the report found. Still, the Holy See declined to expel Figari from the movement in 2017 and merely ordered him to live apart from the Sodalitium community in Rome and cease all contact with it. The Vatican was seemingly tied in knots by canon law that did not foresee such punishments for founders of religious communities who weren’t priests. Victims were outraged. But according to the findings of the latest Vatican investigation, the abuses went beyond Figari. They included Sodalitium clergy and also involved harassing and hacking the communications of their victims, all while covering up crimes committed as part of their official duties, according to the statement. The investigation was carried out by the Vatican's top sex crimes investigators, Maltese Archbishop Charles Scicluna and Monsignor Jordi Bertomeu, from the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith, who travelled to Lima last year to take testimony from victims. The highest-ranking person ordered expelled was Archbishop Jose Antonio Eguren, whom Francis already forced to resign as bishop of Piura in April over his record, after he sued Salinas and Ugaz for their reporting. In addition to Figari’s own abuses, their reporting had exposed the alleged forced eviction of peasants on lands in Eguren’s diocese by a Sodalitium-linked real estate developer. Ugaz, the journalist, welcomed the expulsions and said the reference to Sodalitium hacking referred to her: She said her communications had been hacked in 2023 after she reported on the Sodalitium's off-shore holdings and other financial dealings, and said she believed the group was trying to identify her sources. 'It is a demonstration that in Peru, the survivors would never have found justice and reparation (without Bertomeo and Scicluna) because the Sodalitium is an organization with a lot of political, social and economic power,' she said in a statement to The Associated Press. Salinas, for his part, repeated that the group should be dissolved entirely and that some key figures were not included on the list. 'It's very good news after 24 years of impunity,' he said in a message to AP. 'It is to be hoped that this historic and memorable news is only the first of more, perhaps more impactful than what we know today.' The release of such detailed information by the Vatican was highly unusual for an institution that is known more for secrecy, opacity and turning a blind eye to even obvious church crimes. It is unclear how exactly the expulsions can be enforced or what they will mean in practical terms, especially for the laypeople involved. But at a minimum, the very public announcement would suggest that at least for this particular group, Francis was willing to take an unorthodox approach to interpreting the church's in-house laws to send a message. 'To take such a disciplinary decision, consideration was given to the scandal that was produced by the number and gravity of the abuses that were denounced by victims, which are particularly contrary to the balanced and liberating experience of the evangelical councils,' the Vatican embassy statement said in explaining the rationale for the punishments. The Vatican statement said the Peruvian bishops joined Francis in 'seeking the forgiveness of the victims' while calling on the troubled movement to initiate a journey of justice and reparation. There was no immediate response to a request for comment from the Sodalitium.	https://apnews.com/article/pope-abuse-peru-sodalicio-068c8f57dfc37aa86f14198ad08f9157	2024-09-25T07:42:12-07:00	
Intelligence officials have briefed the Trump campaign on Iranian threats. A look at what's known	WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. officials briefed Donald Trump 's campaign this week on Iranian threats against the Republican presidential nominee, but the briefing centered on previously reported threats and not a new plot. The Secret Service boosted Trump's security protection in July following news of an Iranian threat on his life. Iranian hackers also stole information they retrieved from Trump's campaign. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that officials have been tracking Iranian threats against a number of officials including Trump and some who serve in President Joe Biden 's administration. The attention to Iranian threats comes at a sensitive moment in the campaign following two assassination attempts targeting Trump. There's no evidence though connecting these events to Iran. Here's what we know: Trump campaign requested intelligence briefing Trump's campaign said Tuesday that it had received a briefing from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence on Iranian threats targeting Trump. In a statement, campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said the meeting included information about 'real and specific' threats to 'assassinate him in an effort to destabilize and sow chaos in the United States.' Intelligence officials held the briefing at the request of the Trump campaign, according to a U.S. official familiar with the matter. The official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, added that the information presented to the campaign did not include any suggestion of a new threat against Trump and some of the information that was presented to the campaign was years old. Trump's campaign has sought to make Iran's threats a political issue, suggesting Iran considers Democrat Kamala Harris weak on foreign policy. It has mischaracterized some details to falsely suggest Harris's campaign sought to benefit when Iran hacked into his campaign. During a speech Wednesday Trump called for a belligerent response to Iranian threats. 'If I were the president I would inform the threatening country, in this case Iran, that if you do anything to harm this person we’re going to blow your largest cities and the country itself to smithereens.' Longtime concerns about Iran Along with Russia and China, Iran has also mounted an extensive online influence operation designed to stoke discord and polarization ahead of the November election, intelligence officials have said. It has especially targeted Trump, seeing him as the candidate more likely to increase tension between Washington and Tehran. Iranian hackers stole information from Trump’s campaign and sought, unsuccessfully, to interest news organizations and President Joe Biden’s campaign in the material. There’s no indication that any of the recipients responded. But U.S. concerns about the threats Iran poses to the U.S. go well beyond this year's election. Iranian leaders vowed revenge after the Trump administration ordered the killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani in 2020. In July, authorities said they had received word of an Iranian threat on Trump’s life and boosted security for the candidate as a result. The following month a Pakistani man alleged to have links to Iran was charged in a plot to carry out political assassinations on U.S. soil. Law enforcement did not name the targets of the alleged plot, but legal filings suggest Trump was a potential target. In 2022 an Iranian operative was charged in a plot to murder former National Security Adviser John Bolton in presumed retaliation for Soleimani's death. On Wednesday, Blinken said authorities have been investigating Iran’s threats against 'a number of senior officials' including Trump as well as people now serving in President Joe Biden’s administration. 'This is something we’ve been tracking very intensely for a long time,' Blinken said on CBS This Morning. The National Security Council said in a statement sent to The AP that Iran's threats against Trump and were prompted by Solemaini's killing. 'We consider this a national and homeland security matter of the highest priority, and we strongly condemn Iran for these brazen threats,' the council said. No connection to attempts on Trump's life In his speech Wednesday, Trump linked Iran to the recent assassination attempts — 'they may or may not involve, or possibly do, Iran.' Authorities have made no such connection. In the first attempt at a rally in Pennsylvania in July, authorities shot and killed the gunman who shot Trump. Law enforcement officials have said the shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, searched online for events of both Trump and Biden, and viewed the Trump rally as a 'target of opportunity. ' The FBI has said it believes Crooks acted alone. The suspect in the second assassination attempt, Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, was apprehended following a chase after the Secret Service spotted him lying in wait at Trump's Florida golf course this month. Routh's past social media posts don't easily align with either party, but his views on Trump seemed to sour in recent years. The FBI said Routh wrote a letter detailing his plans to kill Trump. The Secret Service declined to comment on Wednesday when asked whether they’ve taken actions recently in response to any new Iranian threats against Trump. But the agency has already said that since the July attempt, Trump is receiving the highest levels of protection it can provide. __ Associated Press writer Rebecca Santana in Washington and Jonathan J.

France and US are working on a plan for a 21-day cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah	NEW YORK (AP) — France’s foreign minister said Wednesday that his country and the United States are working on a proposal for a 21-day cease-fire proposal 'to allow for negotiations' in the escalating conflict between Israel and Hezbollah that has killed more than 600 people in Lebanon in recent days. Jean-Noël Barrot told the U.N. Security Council during a meeting about the conflict that the proposal would be released shortly. 'We are counting on both parties to accept it without delay,' he said. Barrot said France and the U.S. had consulted with the sides on 'final parameters for a diplomatic way out of this crisis,' adding that 'war is not unavoidable.' Earlier Wednesday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. administration was 'intensely engaged with a number of partners to deescalate tensions in Lebanon and to work to get a cease-fire agreement that would have so many benefits for all concerned.' Blinken and other advisers to President Joe Biden have spent the past three days at and on the sidelines of the annual U.N. General Assembly meeting of world leaders in New York lobbying other countries to support the plan, according to U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic conversations. Americans hope such a cease-fire could lead to longer-term stability along the border between Israel and Lebanon. Months of Israeli and Hezbollah exchanges of fire across the border drove tens of thousands of people from their homes on both sides of the border, and escalated attacks this week have rekindled fears of a broader war in the Middle East. Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan and senior advisers Brett McGurk and Amos Hochstein have been meeting with Middle East allies in New York and have been in touch with Israeli officials about the proposal, one of the U.S. officials said. McGurk and Hochstein have been the White House’s chief interlocutors with Israel and Lebanon since the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Hamas, another Iranian-backed militant group. An Israeli official said Netanyahu has given the green light to pursue a possible deal, but only if it includes the return of Israeli civilians to their homes. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were discussing behind-the-scenes diplomacy. A Lebanese official called them 'very serious efforts,' and when asked about the possibility of a halt in the fighting taking effect Thursday, he said it was 'not wishful thinking.' Hezbollah has maintained that it will not halt its fire until there's a truce in Gaza. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to share details with the media, said Lebanon still does not accept separating the fronts in the Palestinian territory and Lebanon but would not say if or how the proposal might deal with Gaza. Earlier Wednesday, Biden warned in an appearance on ABC’s 'The View' that 'an all-out war is possible' but thinks the opportunity also exists 'to have a settlement that can fundamentally change the whole region.' Biden suggested that getting Israel and Hezbollah to agree to a cease-fire could help achieve a cessation of hostilities between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. That war is approaching the one-year mark after Hamas raids in southern Israel on Oct. 7 killed about 1,200 people. Israel responded with an offensive that has since killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials, who do not provide a breakdown of civilians and fighters in their count. 'It's possible and I'm using every bit of energy I have with my team … to get this done,' Biden said. 'There's a desire to see change in the region.' The U.S. and other international mediators have tried and failed for months to broker a cease-fire in Gaza that also would release hostages held by Hamas. The U.S. government also raised the pressure with additional sanctions Wednesday targeting more than a dozen ships and other entities it says were involved in illicit shipments of Iranian petroleum for the financial benefit of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard and Hezbollah. Meanwhile, the chief of Israel's army said Wednesday that the military is preparing for a possible ground operation in Lebanon as Hezbollah hurled dozens of projectiles into Israel, including a missile aimed at Tel Aviv that was the militant group’s deepest strike yet. Blinken has been urging both Israel and Hezbollah to step back from their intensifying conflict, saying that all-out war would be disastrous for the region and that escalation was not the way to get people back to their homes on the Israel-Lebanon border. 'It would be through a diplomatic agreement that has forces pulled back from the border, create a secure environment, people return home,' Blinken told NBC News. 'That’s what we’re driving toward because while there’s a very legitimate issue here, we don’t think that war is the solution.' France has called a special U.N. Security Council meeting on Lebanon for later Wednesday at which the U.S. proposal may be discussed. ___ AP reporters Zeke Miller and Darlene Superville in Washington, Josef Federman in Jerusalem and Bassem Mroue in Beirut contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/biden-israel-hezbollah-war-ff2ec626f5d8883014f577b9a0cfaf1e	2024-09-25T07:04:26-07:00	
For European astronauts, this place in Germany is the next best thing to the moon	COLOGNE, Germany (AP) — Donning heavy spacesuits and visors to protect them from sunlight, astronauts Thomas Pesquet of France and Matthias Maurer of Germany, accompanied by their trusty canine robot, move slowly on what looks like the lunar surface. But it's not the moon. It will be years before the European Space Agency can send one of its astronauts there. For now, they are practicing in a facility the agency opened in Germany on Wednesday where lunar conditions have been replicated. The LUNA facility at the European Astronaut Center near Cologne has 900 tons of ground-up volcanic rock like that on the moon spread over a surface a bit bigger than a basketball court. The moon’s low-gravity environment will be simulated using movable ceiling-mounted trolleys that follow a suspended astronaut or rover’s movements. In a preopening briefing, ESA astronaut Alexander Gerst said the facility will offer 'most aspects that we will encounter on the moon.' 'It’s the surface, it’s the lunar dust, the rocks, the lighting,' he said. 'We will work in spacesuits that limit our movement, limit our view.' ESA Director General Josef Aschbacher said at the opening ceremony that the facility 'marks a significant milestone in Europe's space exploration efforts.' ESA has negotiated for three spots on future moon missions under the NASA-led Artemis program by 2030, depending on the progress of the program. It currently relies on NASA and others to get its astronauts to space. The agency is building the service module for the Orion crew capsule that will fly to the moon as part of Artemis. 'We need to prepare for the moon because currently we are only flying to low-Earth orbit to the International Space Station,' said ESA astronaut Matthias Maurer. 'But the next missions will bring us to the moon.' The facility’s lunar soil is made of volcanic rock mined in the Siebengebirge mountain range, not far from where the facility is located, and then ground and sifted until it’s as close to the moon’s surface as possible. The facility is opening several years later than planned, delayed by the pandemic and the discovery of protected lizards at the site just as construction was about to begin, forcing relocation. Plans are to use the facility, jointly operated by ESA and the German Aerospace Agency, to test lunar rovers and practice walking on the moon’s surface in cumbersome space suits, among other things.	https://apnews.com/article/european-space-agency-esa-space-artemis-0c27c98f81a007450f88d8e8d1d676cc	2024-09-25T06:15:28-07:00	
Who's afraid of the big bad wolf? The EU moves to loosen protections for the animals	BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union is moving toward backing plans to remove some of its protections for wolves on the continent as their population grows, in the latest political clash between farmers and environmentalists. Ambassadors of the 27 EU nations reached a qualified majority Wednesday to seek to loosen protection rules now enshrined in the European Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats. A ruling is expected in December, though EU ministers must officially vote on the bloc's position in the coming weeks. Farmers in many members have been increasingly angered by attacks on their livestock by wolfpacks as the animals have taken hold in woods and fields close to agricultural lands. The issue was brought to the EU’s doorstep two years ago when a wolf killed a pony belonging to EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. On Wednesday, the Commission welcomed the tentative vote and said that 'adapting the protection status will be an important step to address the challenges posed by increasing wolf populations while keeping the overall objective to achieve and maintain a favorable conservation status for the species.' Experts and environmental groups estimate that up to 19,000 wolves may be present in the 27 EU member countries, with large populations thought to roam in Bulgaria, Greece, Italy, Poland, Romania and Spain. Wolves remain a 'strictly protected' species in most of Europe, but their numbers are estimated to have grown by 25% over the last decade. Under the plans the EU backs, wolves would be downgraded from 'strictly protected' to 'protected,' allowing for more measures to keep them at bay from farmers and the population. Last month Dutch authorities urgently warned parents not to take young children to a popular forest area near the city of Utrecht following two recent close encounters with a wolf displaying 'atypical and worrying' behavior. Growing numbers of the EU's environmental rules and regulations have come under pressure over the past two years, with populist and hard right parties criticizing the measures as being thought up by urban elites with little knowledge of rural life. The main EU farm lobby Copa-Cogeca welcomed Wednesday's vote. 'We are glad to see the European Union institutions listening to the needs of farmers and rural dwellers despite the many pressures from those who often don’t have to deal with the consequences of attacks. This decision will provide European livestock farmers with greater peace of mind,' it said in a statement. The Eurogroup for Animals NGO said in a statement that EU nations 'are ignoring their citizens’ calls and science. Facilitating culling sends a dramatic message on the future of conservation and coexistence.'	https://apnews.com/article/european-union-wolves-protection-agriculture-7c0ff76c79389be9272e904774a03043	2024-09-25T06:12:11-07:00	
Ukraine urges world leaders not to seek 'an out' from Russia's war instead of true peace	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Ukraine’s president urged global leaders Wednesday to stand with his country and not seek 'an out' instead of a 'real, just peace' more than two years into Russia's war. At a time when he faces growing pressure from Western allies and some of his fellow Ukrainians to negotiate a cease-fire, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told the U.N. General Assembly there's no alternative to the 'peace formula' he presented two years ago. Among other things, it seeks the expulsion of all Russian forces from Ukraine and accountability for war crimes. 'Any parallel or alternative attempts to seek peace are, in fact, efforts to achieve an out instead of an end to the war,' he said. 'Do not divide the world. Be united nations,' he implored. 'And that will bring us peace.' Russia hasn't yet had its turn to speak at the assembly's annual gathering of presidents, prime ministers, monarchs and other high officials. Low-level Russian diplomats occupied the country's seats in the huge assembly hall during Zelenskyy's speech. Russian President Vladimir Putin is not attending this year's high-level meetings at the General Assembly. The war in Ukraine was center stage the last two times that world leaders convened for the U.N.’s signature annual meeting. But this year, the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and the escalating developments along the Israeli-Lebanese border have gotten much of the spotlight. Ukraine and Russia, with one of the world’s most potent armies, are locked in a grinding fight along a 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line. The war began when Russia invaded in February 2022 and has killed tens of thousands of people. Russia has gained momentum in Ukraine’s east; Ukraine, meanwhile, startled Russia by sending troops across the border in a daring incursion last month. Zelenskyy argued Tuesday at the U.N. Security Council that Russia needs to ' be forced into peace,' saying there’s no point in pursuing peace talks with Putin. In Moscow, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov responded Wednesday that the Ukrainian president’s call for compulsion was 'a fatal mistake' and 'a profound misconception, which, of course, will inevitably have consequences for the Kyiv regime.' Zelenskyy is expected to present a victory plan this week to U.S. President President Joe Biden. ___ See more of AP’s coverage of the U.N.

Attacks between Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah raise fears of a wider Mideast war with Iran proxies	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Cross-border attacks between Israel and the Lebanese militia Hezbollah have reignited concerns that the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip could break out into a regional conflict, nearly a year after it began. That wider war could draw in Iran, and other regional militias that it has armed for decades could play a role in any attack. Here's a look at Iran's history of arming militias, its allies in the region and what part they could play. Why has Iran armed proxy forces? Iran's policy of arming militias took root in the aftermath of the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Before it, the U.S. provided major weapon systems including F-14 Tomcat fighter jets to the government of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. After the revolution and the U.S. Embassy hostage crisis, those shipments and needed maintenance programs stopped. Iran's eight-year war with Iraq in the 1980s destroyed much of its arsenal. International sanctions on Iran, including over its nuclear program, also have kept it from receiving new arms while Israel and Gulf Arab states allied with the U.S. have received advanced weapons. While developing its own missile program, Iran can't match those sophisticated weapons. It relies on militias as an asymmetric threat to squeeze both Israel and the United States. Who are Iran's regional allies? Iran's arming began in earnest in the 1980s with Shiite forces in Lebanon fighting against Israel. They became the Hezbollah militia. The arming expanded with the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq that toppled dictator Saddam Hussein, a longtime foe of Tehran. Iran strongly backed Syrian President Bashar Assad in his country's long war. And Iran has continued when the opportunity has arisen, even arming Sunni militants while viewing itself as the world's defender of Shiite Muslims. Those relationships are managed by Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, one of the most powerful armed groups in the Middle East. The militias in Iran's self-described 'Axis of Resistance' include these: Iraqi militias In Iraq, Iran supported a slew of forces that mobilized in 2014 to battle the Islamic State group. Those state-sanctioned, mainly Shiite militias, known as the Popular Mobilization Forces, have grown into a powerful political faction, armed with rockets, drones and other weaponry. The International Institute for Strategic Studies puts their strength at some 180,000 fighters. Other smaller or little-known militant groups have emerged and claimed attacks against U.S. forces as well amid this Israel-Hamas war. Iran-backed armed groups attacked U.S. personnel in Iraq more than 60 times between October and Feb. 4, according to the Congressional Research Service. The deadliest came on Jan. 28, when the U.S. said a drone launched by Iranian-backed Iraqi militias hit a facility known as Tower 22 in Jordan on the Syrian border, killing three American troops and wounding dozens of others. In response, U.S. airstrikes hit more than 85 targets at seven locations, including command and control headquarters, intelligence centers, rockets and missiles, drone and ammunition storage sites and other facilities connected to the militias or the Guard's expeditionary Quds Force. Lebanon's Hezbollah Hezbollah formed in 1982 amid Israel's occupation of southern Lebanon. Israel remains highly wary of Hezbollah, particularly over the vast missile arsenal it is believed to possess and its battle-hardened forces who also supported Assad in Syria. While Israel has sophisticated missile defenses including its Iron Dome system, a mass barrage of fire from Hezbollah and others at the same time could overwhelm the country. Estimates suggest Hezbollah has an arsenal of 150,000 rockets and missiles, including precision-guided missiles. The militia also has been blamed for suicide bombings in the past, including a 1983 bombing in Beirut that killed 241 American servicemen, though the group maintains it wasn't behind the attack. Hezbollah also has drones and surface-to-air missile systems. Hezbollah's forces number as many as 25,000 full-time fighters, with additional tens of thousands in reserves, according to an Israeli military assessment. Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah in 2021 said the group had 100,000 trained fighters. Palestinian militant forces Despite being Sunni, both the Palestinian militant group Hamas and Islamic Jihad have received weaponry and other materiel from Iran. The groups, however, have been struck hard by Israel since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack that began the war, which saw militants kill 1,200 people and take 250 others hostage. Israel's war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip since has killed over 41,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count. Yemen's Houthi rebels The Houthis have held Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, since 2014 as part of that country’s ruinous war. They follow the Shiite Zaydi faith, a branch of Shiite Islam that is almost exclusively found in Yemen. While broadly an insurgent force, the group with Iran's support is now able to launch drone and missile attacks that have drastically disrupted shipping in the Red Sea corridor and now even reach Israel. The U.S. Navy's efforts at stopping the shipping attacks have led to the most intense continuous combat its sailors have faced since World War II, but has yet to end the assaults. The amount of direct command Iran wields over the Houthis, however, remains a matter of debate among experts. The Houthis' attacks have raised their international profile while cracking down on dissent at home. The rebels claim they've recruited 200,000 additional fighters since launching their attacks. The rebels and their allies have a fighting force of some 20,000 fighters, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies. What risk does the cross-border fire between Israel and Hezbollah pose? For days now, Israel and Hezbollah have been launching strikes against each other. A wave of Israeli strikes on Monday and Tuesday killed at least 560 people in Lebanon and forced tens of thousands to flee. Israel now has called up some reservists and hasn't ruled out a ground offensive in Lebanon — which could lead to bloody fighting. The Houthis, who have momentarily paused their attacks on shipping without explanation, also could join the fray. Iran so far has called for restraint, but could find itself drawn in. In April following an Israeli attack on the Iranian Embassy compound in Syria, Iran launched 170 bomb-carrying drones, more than 30 cruise missiles and more than 120 ballistic missiles toward Israel. Israel, the U.S. and other nations shot down many of the projectiles, some of which came from Yemen. But Iran could launch a similar attack, though questions remain over the accuracy of its ballistic missiles.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-gaza-war-hamas-hezbollah-iran-proxies-c1bcc770721e39859ab7ffa9dbab6ea3	2024-09-25T04:57:53-07:00	
UK political magazine The Spectator's new editor is Michael Gove	LONDON (AP) — Michael Gove, who was a longtime U.K. Cabinet minister under successive Conservative Party governments, has been appointed the editor of The Spectator, one of the world’s oldest political magazines. Wednesday's announcement came little more than two weeks after hedge fund manager Paul Marshall bought the magazine via his company Old Queen Street Ventures. The Spectator has a long-standing reputation of supporting the Conservative Party and providing intellectual ballast to its discussions both in and out of power. Marshall, who was worth 875 million pounds ($1.2 billion) in the most recent Sunday Times Rich List of people resident in the U.K., is already the co-owner of GB News, which launched three years ago as a right-leaning, Fox News-style British alternative to mainstream news channels. 'Alongside his political and journalistic nous, Michael brings a love of books, philosophy, art, opera — and a mischievous sense of humor,' said Freddie Sayers, chief executive of new owner OQS. 'He is perfectly suited to this role, and I can’t wait to work together to bring The Spectator to new audiences.' Gove, who served in the successive governments of Prime Ministers David Cameron, Theresa May, Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak, will take up his new role at the start of October. Gove served in a variety of Cabinet positions from 2010 until July, when the Conservative Party suffered its worst election defeat for nearly two centuries. The Tories lost power after 14 years, with the Labour Party taking the reins. Before he became a lawmaker after the 2005 general election, Gove had been a prominent journalist at The Times and was considered a close confidante of its owner Rupert Murdoch. The Spectator is one of the world’s oldest politics and current affairs magazines, established in 1828 in London’s Old Queen Street, which has given its name to Marshall's OQS venture.	https://apnews.com/article/spectator-magazine-new-editor-michael-gove-tories-c856d90c23dca55463b7fddfc13e6b34	2024-09-25T04:48:06-07:00	
Tropical Weather Latest: Fast-moving Hurricane Helene is expected to be a major storm upon landfall	Helene strengthened into a hurricane Wednesday, and forecasters warned that the storm would intensify as it crosses the Gulf of Mexico on a path to Florida. The storm had already prompted residents to evacuate, schools to close and officials to declare emergencies in Florida and Georgia. The hurricane was about 500 miles (810 kilometers) southwest of Tampa, Florida, and had sustained winds of 80 mph (130 kph), according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center. Forecasters said it is expected to become a major hurricane with its center making landfall in the Big Bend area of Florida’s northwestern coast as soon as late Thursday. The center has issued hurricane warnings for part of Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula and Florida’s northwestern coastline, where large storm surges of up to 15 feet (4.5 meters) were expected. Meanwhile, Tropical Storm John is expected to strengthen into a hurricane again, threatening areas of Mexico's western coast anew. Follow AP's coverage of tropical weather at https://apnews.com/hub/hurricanes. Here's the latest: More Georgia schools cancel classes ATLANTA — Even more Georgia school systems are cancelling in-person classes for Thursday and Friday, including a number of large metro Atlanta school systems that had previously held off. Gwinnett County, the state’s largest, said it would operate a virtual learning day on Thursday and call off classes entirely on Friday. The University of Georgia canceled all classes at its main Athens campus on Thursday and Friday, while Georgia Tech in Atlanta said it would cancel in-person classes. Georgia officials warn Helene’s destructive wind will likely blow throughout the state ATLANTA — Officials in Georgia are telling everyone in the state to brace for Helene’s impact, saying the fast-moving storm will likely affect all 159 of the state’s counties. Because the storm is moving faster than previously forecast, hurricane warnings have been extended even farther inland. State meteorologist Will Lanxton said tropical-storm force winds are expected throughout the state. Due to the high winds, Helene could cause one of the most significant electrical outages the state has seen in a while, James Stallings, director of the Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency. 'I think we’re going to see some significant power outages, probably nothing like we’ve seen, because it’s 159 counties wide,' Stallings said. Stallings said he also expected significant delays and cancellations at Atlanta’s airport, the world’s largest by passenger volume. Like officials in Florida, those in Georgia warned that people should be prepared to be self-sufficient for as long as 72 hours after the storm. Stallings said the state has opened a logistics staging area at a state-owned building in Macon, where it’s stockpiling generators, water, food, sandbags and tarps. Georgia has activated 250 National Guard soldiers beginning Thursday and will stage them for rapid deployment. State game wardens, foresters and Department of Correction teams will also help provide swift-water rescues and other emergency responses. Mets-Braves games both rescheduled as Helene approaches ATLANTA — The last two games of the pivotal series between the New York Mets and Atlanta Braves have been postponed as Atlanta saw heavy rain while Hurricane Helene loomed in the Gulf of Mexico. The games, originally scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday, will be made up as a doubleheader Monday in Atlanta. The Braves beat the Mets 5-1 on Tuesday night. Florida residents in Helene’s path decide whether to evacuate or shelter in place CRAWFORDVILLE, Fla. — As officials warn that Hurricane Helene is projected to pound Florida’s Big Bend with life-threatening storm surge, residents in coastal Wakulla County are under a countywide mandatory evacuation order. But it doesn’t mean they’ll all leave. Shelby Hill made a stop at a Walmart in the city of Crawfordville with her husband and three kids Wednesday afternoon to pick up the fixings for a chicken enchilada casserole – some comfort food to ease their nerves. 'You can feel the energy. Everybody’s moving,' Hill said. 'You can tell everybody’s actually really nervous and wants to be prepared.' Hill said her family will soon be hitting the road to stay the night with her in-laws in the next county to the north, Leon County. After that, they plan to continue on to Georgia, in the hopes of outrunning the worst of Helene. A couple aisles over in the frozen food section, Christine Nazworth said she considered evacuating her home in 2018 ahead of Hurricane Michael and again this week ahead of Helene. Both times, she said she was 'outvoted' by other family members, so they’ll be sheltering in place. 'Hating to leave but hating to stay too,' Nazworth said. 'So just kinda go with the flow.' Tropical Storm John expected to strengthen into a hurricane again Tropical Storm John is expected to strengthen into a hurricane, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center. On Wednesday afternoon, the center issued a hurricane warning for a portion of Mexico’s southwestern coastline, where tropical storm conditions could begin later in the day. Additionally, the existing tropical storm warning and hurricane watch were extended further west. The center also said John would bring additional rainfall to coastal portions of southwest Mexico through Friday. John first formed as a tropical storm in the Pacific on Monday before quickly intensifying into a hurricane, hitting Mexico’s southern Pacific coast late Monday, killing at least two people, triggering mudslides, and damaging homes and trees. The storm weakened after moving inland but later reemerged over the ocean. John re-formed as a tropical storm Wednesday and threatened areas of Mexico’s western coast anew. Florida is helping people evacuate the Big Bend region via bus and Uber ORLANDO — The state of Florida was providing buses to evacuate people in the state’s Big Bend region and taking them to shelters in Tallahassee on Wednesday. State emergency officials also were partnering with Uber to take residents to shelters in communities under evacuation orders, as Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that Helene could be as strong as a Category 4 hurricane when it makes landfall late Thursday and then plows through the Tallahassee area. 'The way this is tracking, it’s a storm that is stronger than what we’ve seen in the region, I think, in anyone’s memory,' DeSantis said Wednesday afternoon at a news conference at the state emergency operations center in Tallahassee. 'Some of this may be unchartered ground, certainly for most people who are living here now.' Airports in St. Petersburg, Tallahassee and Tampa also were planning to close on Thursday, and 62 hospitals, nursing homes and assisted living facilities had evacuated their residents Wednesday in anticipation of the storm. Law enforcement planned to close bridges once winds reached 40 mph at a sustained level, officials said. Nearly half of Georgia’s public school districts cancel classes Nearly half of Georgia’s public school districts, from the top to the bottom of the state, have canceled classes because of the approaching storm. Schools, including in the cities of Atlanta, Columbus and Savannah will be closed Thursday and Friday, or dismissing early Thursday and closed Friday. None of the state’s largest school districts, all in suburban Atlanta, have announced closure plans yet. South Carolina’s governor declares state of emergency COLUMBIA, S.C. — Gov. Henry McMaster has declared a state of emergency in South Carolina, saying Hurricane Helene is going to be a dangerous storm even as the state avoids the brunt of the impacts. Wednesday’s declaration allows the state to put in place emergency plans to coordinate between agencies and the federal government and opens the doors for counties and local governments to request assistance. The coast and much of the western half of South Carolina is expecting tropical storm-force winds; a flash flood watch is also in effect. Parts of the mountains in extreme northern South Carolina could see up to 15 inches (38 centimeters) of rain, the National Weather Service said. 'Although South Carolina will likely avoid the brunt of Hurricane Helene’s impacts, the storm is still expected to bring dangerous flooding, high winds, and isolated tornadoes to many parts of the state,' McMaster said in a statement. Helene’s size and speed could mean extra damage, experts say Hurricane experts worry that Helene’s overall size and whip-fast forward speed will cause extra damage, keeping its strength longer as it penetrates inland into Georgia and beyond. With tropical storm force winds expected to extend for more than 200 miles (322 kilometers), Hurricane Helene is forecast to be one of the largest storms in seven years to hit the Gulf of Mexico region, according to Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach. He said since 1988, only three Gulf of Mexico hurricanes have been bigger: 2017’s Irma, 2005’s Wilma and 1995’s Opal. 'By every measure, this makes it worse,' said University of Miami senior hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy. 'Hurricane force winds are just going to plow their way into Georgia too. Places that are not used to experiencing hurricanes are going to experience one.’’ Larger-sized storms mean hurricane-force and tropical storm-force winds will hit more people than in smaller storms, McNoldy said. It also means a larger storm surge piling up on the coast, he said. Given the storm’s size and where it is forecast to hit, Gallagher Re, an insurance firm, is predicting between $3 billion to $6 billion in privately insured damages with another $1 billion in public insurance damage, including flood insurance. Florida shoppers squeeze in grocery runs ahead of Helene’s arrival There was a steady stream of shoppers squeezing in one more pre-storm grocery run Wednesday afternoon at a Publix in Crawfordville, Florida, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) south of Tallahassee. Inside, shoppers loaded up on essentials and filled prescriptions. Some shelves of water and bread were thinned out, but staff were working to keep the store stocked in the calm before the storm. Tallahassee resident Connie Dillard stopped in after visiting friends in town to pick up a case of water and ice for the cooler stowed in the back of her pickup truck, her service dog Bubba sitting in the passenger seat. 'We got food for everybody. And tonight, laying in a motel that hopefully has a microwave, we’ll cook it all up and we’ll be set for a couple days if the power goes out,' Dillard said. Dillard said she planned to make one more stop before heading west toward Fort Walton Beach, hoping to get out of the direct path of Hurricane Helene. 'These storms are so unpredictable. And once they get into the Gulf with the warm waters, they pick up so much strength and move so fast,' Dillard said. 'Just hope and pray that everybody’s safe. That’s all you can do.' Helene could bring major flooding to Atlanta, meteorology professor says ATLANTA — Hurricane Helene isn’t going to be just a coastal storm. All 159 counties in Georgia from Savannah to the Blue Ridge Mountains are under either a hurricane watch or warning or a tropical storm watch or warning. 'We’re setting up for a shocking, intense storm from one end of the state to the other,' University of Georgia meteorology professor Marshall Shepherd said. Helene is quite big for an Atlantic hurricane and is moving fast — a combination that could mean major flooding and days if not weeks of power outages in Atlanta some 250 miles (402 kilometers) away from where the hurricane is expected to make landfall. South Georgia can expect hurricane force winds while no part of the state will likely avoid some kind of dangerous weather, Sheppard said. And for Atlanta, Helene could be the worst strike on a major Southern inland city in 35 years. 'It’s going to be a lot like Hugo in Charlotte,' Sheppard said of the 1989 storm that struck the major North Carolina city, knocking out power to 85% of customers and leveling some 80,000 trees as winds gusted above hurricane force. Walt Disney World water park and golf courses closed Thursday ORLANDO — Walt Disney World outside Orlando said Wednesday that it will be open on Thursday, except for its miniature golf courses and the Typhoon Lagoon water park. The theme park resort also said its Mickey’s Not-So-Scary Halloween Party was canceled for Thursday. 'We are closely monitoring the projected path of Hurricane Helene as we continue to prioritize the safety of our guests and cast members,' Disney said in a statement. ‘Do what you got to do to get through it’ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — Will Marx of Crawfordville has lived in Florida for the past five years and he says he’s always stayed at home during every storm that’s passed him. Originally from Massachusetts, Marx said Wednesday that he was not as worried about Hurricane Helene since the storm is moving fast. While he didn’t put hurricane shutters up, he parked his car in an open area so that it wouldn’t be affected by falling branches. 'Do what you got to do to get through it,' he said. 'It’s the slow moving ones that are really bad.' Tampa airport to suspend operations early Thursday TAMPA, Fla. — Tampa International Airport in Florida will suspend operations early Thursday ahead of when Hurricane Helene is expected to make landfall in the U.S. The airport said in a statement Wednesday that 'all commercial and cargo operations beginning at 2 a.m.' would be suspended, with the airport remaining closed to the public until any damage can be assessed. Additionally, it said three other public airports managed by the Hillsborough County Aviation Authority — Peter O. Knight, Tampa Executive and Plant City — would close at the same time. The airport advised travelers to contact their airlines for more information and noted that the airport 'will not be open for public use and is not equipped to function as a shelter for people or vehicles.' More than 30 Georgia counties are under a hurricane warning ALBANY, Ga. — Concerns deepened Wednesday afternoon that Helene’s hurricane-force winds could be felt far inland when the storm is forecast to move rapidly northward into southern Georgia after striking Florida. More than 30 counties in southern Georgia were under a hurricane warning from the National Weather Service on Wednesday, including some rural areas roughly 100 miles north of the Georgia-Florida line. The hurricane warning area for Georgia included Albany, southwest Georgia’s largest city with a population of 67,000, as well as Valdosta, home to 55,000 along Interstate 75. Helene approached barely a year after Valdosta and surrounding Lowndes County took a beating from Hurricane Idalia, which damaged more than 1,000 homes and inflicted more than $6 million in damage. ‘Lord willing, the oysters will survive’ TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Oyster farmer Cainnon Gregg is spending Wednesday in a wetsuit, sinking his floating cages full of oysters to the bottom of Oyster Bay near Spring Creek, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of Tallahassee. It’s an attempt to keep his prized bivalves and the specialized aquaculture equipment that houses them from being blown apart by Hurricane Helene. 'Lord willing, the oysters will survive. But the main goal is to keep the equipment,' Gregg said. 'If you lose your equipment, most of us can’t afford $50,000, $100,000 to start over.' Gregg is part of a coalition of oyster farmers along what’s known as Florida’s Forgotten Coast, a largely undeveloped stretch of the state where for generations commercial fishing has been an industry and a way of life. Gregg said he hopes to harvest one last truckload of his signature Salty Birds and Big Gulp oysters — banking on one final paycheck before Helene does its worst. 'I was sitting here yesterday after we got done working and we were drinking a beer before we left. And I was looking around and I was like, ‘man, this might be the last time we sit here’,' Gregg said. 'There’s a good chance that we come back and it’s not here.' Where to find more information about Florida evacuation orders Ahead of Hurricane Helene’s arrival in Florida, at least 24 counties in the state were under an evacuation order by midday Wednesday, according to the state Division of Emergency Management. While some orders were voluntary, others were mandatory — applying in part or entirely to a given county. Some orders also specifically applied to individuals in one of at least evacuation zones: A, B or C. Florida residents looking for more information about evacuation zones and evacuation orders in their area can visit the division’s website. North Carolina’s governor declares state of emergency ahead of Helene RALEIGH, N.C. — North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper declared a State of Emergency ahead of Hurricane Helene on Wednesday as the state prepares for severe weather impacts that could threaten life and property across North Carolina through Saturday morning. 'Helene threatens heavy rain, flash flooding, landslides, and damaging winds to the mountains and Piedmont areas of our state,' Cooper said. 'Now is the time for North Carolinians to prepare, make sure emergency kits are up-to-date and pay attention to the weather alerts in your area.' The State Emergency Response Team is deploying equipment, personnel and resources to support impacted communities, including resources from the North Carolina National Guard. ‘We’re certainly worried about the intensity of this one’ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — Paulette and Ben McLin are going to be spending the storm in their Tallahassee home, but Ben McLin said they are worried about whether their summer home in Alligator Point will still be intact after Helene blows through. Ben McLin said that they’ve owned the home since 1963 and as a Tallahassee native, he’s no stranger to storms. 'You know, Kate was the worst one we went through and it was a Category 1,' he said. 'We got a Category 3 now, so we’re certainly worried about the intensity of this one.' He said they prepared the house with shutters, but said they’ve done all they can to prepare. Now, the couple has their fingers crossed that it’ll be fine. Officials warn of potentially catastrophic flooding inland In the mountains of North Carolina, Georgia and South Carolina, emergency officials are warning of potentially catastrophic flooding from back-to-back blows of heavy rain. The National Weather Service is predicting up to 15 inches (38 centimeters) could fall over the next three days — first from a front over the region and then from Helene itself as the storm rushes through. The impact could be similar to Tropical Storm Fred in 2021, when a heavy rain event just before combined with the tropical storm rains to cause floods that killed six people and damaged close to 1,000 homes and two dozen bridges. 'We’re three years out from that major flood. It’s very fresh in our minds,' Haywood County Emergency Services spokesperson Allison Richmond said. Haywood County was hard hit in part because the extent of the 2021 flood wasn’t apparent until just before it struck. The county has added several river and stream gauges upstream in the higher ground of the county to have longer warnings and more precise data on the severity of any flooding, Richmond said. ‘People are taking heed and hightailing it out of there for higher ground’ TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — As residents of Florida’s Big Bend batten down their homes ahead of Hurricane Helene’s expected landfall, the memories of Hurricane Michael in 2018 are fresh on the minds of many. That storm rapidly intensified before crashing ashore as a Category 5 that laid waste to Panama City and parts of the rural Florida Panhandle. 'I don’t think there’s this lackadaisical attitude where … ‘It’ll be fine, it’s only a Cat 3.’ Well, a Cat 3 can escalate to a Cat 5 pretty quickly,' said Kristin Korinko, a Tallahassee resident and the commodore of the Shell Point Sailboard Club, which sits on the Gulf Coast in Wakulla County, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) south of the state capital. Korinko said most of her friends on the coast are following Wakulla’s countywide mandatory evacuation order issued by local officials. The county isn’t opening any emergency shelters. 'People are taking heed and hightailing it out of there for higher ground,' Korinko said. Hurricane or not, one Florida resident is still serving up barbecue TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Pitmaster Edwin Barcus of E&amp;J’s BBQ on Tallahassee’s south side wasn’t letting Hurricane Helene get in the way of him serving up plates of barbecue ribs and chicken on Wednesday. 'Rain or shine, it’s barbecue time,' Barcus said. Smoke billowed off the smoldering pecan and cherry wood in Barcus’ twin smokers. While other Tallahassee residents were filling up on gas and securing their homes, Barcus was tending his racks of pork ribs — the first batch of which he got on the smoker around 5 a.m. He intends to keep serving customers until about 4:30 Wednesday afternoon, regardless of the ferocious storm charting a collision course with the Florida Panhandle. 'Sometimes peoples’ lights go out early. So I try to come early to help the community out so they won’t have to worry about eating,' Barcus said. 'I always try to give something back.' ‘I hope when we come back our house is still the same as it was’ TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Roommates Frank Pinkney and Kameron Benjamin were filling up sandbags Wednesday at a community center in Tallahassee to protect their apartment. The 19-year-old at Florida A&amp;M students planned to evacuate after they were done. 'It’s different with this storm,' Benjamin said. 'I’m from South Florida so we get a lot of hurricanes but they usually go through islands before it gets to us. But this hurricane is heading straight to Tallahassee, so I really don’t know what to expect. 'I hope that it kind of just blows over and it’s not as intense as it is being made to seem.' Like his roommate, Pinkney said he hoped the storm didn’t tear up Tallahassee. 'I hope when we come back our house is still the same as it was, as we left it. But not really nervous, just cautious about what is going on around us.' John has re-formed as a tropical storm in the Pacific off Mexico’s western coast, forecasters say MIAMI — In the Pacific, former Hurricane John re-formed as a tropical storm Wednesday and threatened areas of Mexico’s western coast anew. John had hit the country’s southern Pacific coast late Monday, killing two people, blowing tin roofs off houses, triggering mudslides and toppling scores of trees, officials said Tuesday. It grew into a Category 3 hurricane in a matter of hours and made landfall about 80 miles (128 kilometers) east of the resort city of Acapulco. It weakened to a tropical storm after moving inland but later reemerged over the ocean. On Wednesday, officials issued a hurricane watch for the coast from Acapulco to Zihuatanejo and tropical storm warnings from Punta Maldonado to Lazaro Cardenas. John was about 110 miles (180 kilometers) southwest of Acapulco with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (65 kph) and was moving east at 2 mph (4 kph). DeSantis warns Florida residents to make final preparations for Helene TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned residents they needed to make their final preparations on Wednesday ahead of Hurricane Helene making landfall in the Panhandle as anywhere from a Category 1 to Category 4 hurricane in the next day or two. The governor urged coastal communities to heed evacuation orders, saying residents don’t need to drive hundreds of miles away from their homes but just find higher ground at a shelter, hotel or friend’s house. 'The models vary on how intense this could be, but there’s clearly a pathway for this to rapidly intensify prior to making landfall,' DeSantis said at a news conference in Tampa. As of early Wednesday, 61 out of 67 counties in Florida were under a state of emergency, and another three counties were under a warning or watch, with landfall expected Thursday evening in northern Florida, DeSantis said. Impacts may be felt as far as 250 miles (402.34 kilometers) from the center of the storm, and some outer bands already were being felt in the Florida Keys Wednesday morning, said Kevin Guthrie, director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management. Helene strengthens into a hurricane MIAMI — Helene strengthened into a hurricane Wednesday, and forecasters warned that the storm would intensify as it crosses the Gulf of Mexico on a path to Florida. The hurricane was about 500 miles (810 kilometers) southwest of Tampa, Florida, and had sustained winds of 80 mph (130 kph), according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center. Forecasters said it is expected to become a major hurricane with its center making landfall in the Big Bend area of Florida’s northwestern coast as soon as late Thursday. Helene became a tropical storm Tuesday in the western Caribbean Sea and caused flooding in the Cayman Islands. Heavy rainfall was forecast for the southeastern U.S. starting Wednesday, with a life-threatening storm surge along the entire west coast of Florida, according to the hurricane center. Evacuation orders issued in several Florida counties Several counties on Florida’s west and northwestern coasts have issued evacuation orders as Tropical Storm Helene makes its way along Mexico’s coast toward the U.S. Multiple school districts, including in the areas around Tampa and the state capital Tallahassee, plan to close schools or reduce hours starting Wednesday. The University of Tampa also issued a mandatory campus evacuation order Wednesday morning. The school said in a post on the social platform X that 'residence halls will be closed after the evacuation concludes, and there will be no entry allowed into residential buildings until they are reopened following the storm.' The evacuation order goes into effect at 1 p.m. Empty supermarket shelves and gas stations running out of fuel TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — With Tropical Storm Helene moving north along Mexico’s coast toward the U.S., gas stations in the Tallahassee area were already starting to run out of gas on Monday, and supermarket shelves were being emptied of water and other supplies. Florida State and Florida A&amp;M universities were shut down ahead of the storm and government offices were closing as of Wednesday afternoon. About 80 percent of the region was without power after Hurricane Hermine in 2016, a Category 1 storm, and it took more than a week to restore electricity for many customers. Known for its large oak trees and canopy roads, Tallahassee is still recovering from tornadoes that slammed through the heart of the city in May, damaging homes and businesses and destroying scores of trees. The storms caused extensive damage in the city’s beloved Railroad Square district of art studios and offbeat shops. Hunkering down in Florida CRAWFORD, Fla. — Will Marx stopped at the hardware store before hunkering down Wednesday in his double-wide trailer 13 miles (20.92 kilometers) inland in Crawfordville, Florida. He said people were stocking up on gas and tarps. Marx, a 64-year-old retiree, figured he was as ready as he could be. He had extra water and a charged phone, and moved his vehicle away from trees that might fall in high winds. 'We will know tomorrow I guess,' he said. He said he lived in New England before moving to Florida. 'If you don’t like snow, I guess it ain’t a good place to live and you have to be prepared for it. It is just a different mindset down here — you have to be prepared. But I guess it’s like anywhere in this country, whether it be twisters or earthquakes. You know, you don’t get it totally without some risk.' ‘This is going to be a large and strong storm,’ researcher says ORLANDO, Fla. — Because Helene is such a fast-moving storm, it won’t dump as much rain on Florida as past hurricanes have done, but its winds may impact places as far inland as northern Georgia, Brian McNoldy, a senior research associate at the University of Miami’s Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science, said Wednesday. 'You are going to see destructive winds not only in Tallahassee but in Atlanta,' McNoldy said. 'You are going to have a major hurricane plowing inland, and storms take a little time to decay once they’re inland.' The models are showing a big wind field, which is why 64 out of 67 counties are under either an emergency order, a watch or warning, he said. 'That this is going to be a large and strong storm,' McNoldy said. 'It is going to be moving very quickly.' Cattle moved to higher ground in Cuba HAVANA — In western Cuba, authorities moved cattle to higher ground and took measures to protect tobacco leaves as fishermen pulled boats to dry land. Seven medical brigades were dispatched to communities usually cut off by storms. Tropical Storm Helene was expected to dump heavy rain on the western part of an island already struggling with severe water shortages and chronic power outages. Helene is pelting Mexico’s Caribbean coast resorts with rain and strong winds MEXICO CITY — Tropical Storm Helene was pelting Mexico’s Caribbean coast resorts from Cozumel to Cancun with rain, high waves and strong winds early Wednesday. Mara Lezama, the governor of the coastal state of Quintana Roo, shared photos of downed trees and rain-swept streets, and videos of the normally placid, turquoise waters off the island of Cozumel being whipped into angry waves that broke over the seawall of the coastal boulevard. In Cancun, heavy waves threatened to worsen the resort’s ongoing problem with beach erosion. Helene’s hurricane-force winds could spread damage to inland Georgia, forecasters say VALDOSTA, Ga. — Forecasters warned that Tropical Storm Helene’s hurricane-force winds could spread damage far inland as the storm races northward from the Gulf Coast. Fifteen counties in southern Georgia were under a hurricane warning Wednesday, including some rural areas roughly 90 miles (144.84 kilometers) north of the Georgia-Florida line. The hurricane warning area for Georgia included Valdosta, a city of 55,000 along Interstate 75. Helene approached barely a year after Valdosta and surrounding Lowndes County took a beating from Hurricane Idalia, which damaged more than 1,000 homes and inflicted more than $6 million in damage. Forecasters have predicted an above-average hurricane season Helene is the eighth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which began June 1. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has predicted an above-average Atlantic hurricane season this year because of record-warm ocean temperatures. It forecast 17 to 25 named storms before the season ends Nov. 30, with four to seven major hurricanes of Category 3 or higher. Biden has declared a state of emergency in Florida President Joe Biden declared an emergency in Florida and deployed Federal Emergency Management Agency teams to Florida and Alabama to support local first responders. Federal authorities were positioning generators, food and water, along with search-and-rescue and power restoration teams, the White House said. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis also issued an emergency for most of the state’s counties, while Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp declared an emergency in his state as well. Tornadoes could be possible in parts of Florida, Georgia and South Carolina Forecasters warned of the possibility of tornadoes Wednesday night over parts of the western Florida peninsula and southern Alabama and said the tornado risk would increase Thursday, expanding across Florida and into parts of Georgia and South Carolina. Tropical storm warnings are in effect for parts of Florida and Georgia The National Weather Service says tropical storm warnings are in effect for: — The upper Florida Keys — The southern Florida Peninsula — The northeast coast of Florida — Altamaha Sound, Georgia Hurricane watches, which are a step down from warnings, are also in effect for parts of western Cuba and Florida, including the Tampa Bay area. A tropical storm watch is in effect for the South Carolina coast north of the Savannah River to the South Santee River. Where is Helene now? An 8 a.m. ET forecast from the National Weather Service showed Helene was located about 60 miles (100 kilometers) east-northeast of Cozumel, Mexico, and about 100 miles (160 kilometers) west-southwest of the western tip of Cuba as it moved northwest at 9 mph (15 kph) with maximum sustained winds of 70 mph (110 kph). Tropical Storm Helene strengthens as hurricane Tropical Storm Helene is rapidly strengthening in the Caribbean Sea and is expected to become a hurricane Wednesday while moving north along Mexico’s coast toward the U.S., prompting residents to evacuate, schools to close and officials to declare emergencies in Florida and Georgia. The storm is forecast to be 'near hurricane strength' when it passes near Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula early Wednesday, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said, and to 'intensify and grow in size' as it moves north across the Gulf of Mexico. Heavy rainfall was forecast for the southeastern U.S. starting Wednesday, with a 'life-threatening storm surge' along the entire west coast of Florida, according to the center. Helene is expected to become a major hurricane — a Category 3 or higher — on Thursday, the day it’s set to reach Florida’s Gulf Coast, according to the hurricane center. The center has issued hurricane warnings for part of Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula and Florida’s northwestern coastline, where large storm surges of up to 15 feet (4.5 meters) were expected. National Hurricane Center issues hurricane warnings for parts of Florida and Mexico The U.S. National Hurricane Center has issued hurricane warnings for northwestern Florida’s coastline and part of Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula as Tropical Storm Helene approaches the area. Helene is expected to strengthen into a hurricane Wednesday and could become a major hurricane Thursday. Areas of western Cuba and Florida, including Tampa Bay, were under hurricane watches Tuesday evening. A tropical storm warning was issued for parts of Cuba and Florida’s southwestern coastline, including the Florida Keys. A storm surge warning was in effect for Florida’s Tampa Bay, Charlotte Harbor, and from Indian Pass south to Flamingo. Florida and Georgia’s eastern coasts, from Palm Beach to the Savannah River, were under a tropical storm watch.	https://apnews.com/article/tropical-storm-helene-john-florida-mexico-3a4f69117f23bf298a0fc4b47c8fac3b	2024-09-25T04:44:57-07:00	
The Latest: Candidates will try to counter criticisms of them in dueling speeches	Derided by Donald Trump as a 'communist,' Vice President Kamala Harris is playing up her street cred as a capitalist. Attacked by Harris as a rich kid who got $400 million from his father on a 'silver platter,' Trump is leaning into his raw populism. The two presidential candidates are set to deliver dueling speeches Wednesday that reflect how they’re honing their economic messages for voters in battleground states. Both are trying to counter criticism of them while laying out their best case for a public that still worries about the economy’s health. Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: Trump's supporters gather at a manufacturing plant ahead of speech Trump was set to address a relatively small crowd inside a massive Charlotte-area manufacturing plant. The Republican former president’s supporters gathered among metal machines and and palettes of red, white and blue tubing. Trump’s podium was flanked by rows of work stations, metal beams and a large campaign sign that proclaimed, 'JOBS! JOBS! JOBS!' Harris will do a sit down interview with MSNBC Vice President Kamala Harris will sit down with Stephanie Ruhle of MSNBC on Wednesday in Pittsburgh. The Democratic candidate is visiting the city to give a speech on the economy and manufacturing. Harris has faced criticism for avoiding media interviews during her abbreviated campaign for the presidency. The conversation with Ruhle will be her first one-on-one interview with a national network since becoming her party’s nominee. Harris previously sat down with CNN’s Dana Bash alongside Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, her running mate. Top Muslim-voter organization endorses Harris as Middle East conflict escalates Vice President Kamala Harris has secured the endorsement of one of the nation’s largest Muslim American voter mobilization groups, marking a significant boost to her campaign since many Muslim and Arab American organizations have opted to support third-party candidates or not endorse. Emgage Action, the political arm of an 18-year-old Muslim American advocacy group, endorsed Harris’ presidential campaign Wednesday, saying in a statement provided first to The Associated Press that the group 'recognizes the responsibility to defeat' former President Donald Trump in November. The group, based in Washington D.C., operates in eight states, with a significant presence in the key battlegrounds of Michigan and Pennsylvania. The organization will now focus its ongoing voter-outreach efforts on supporting Harris, in addition to down-ballot candidates. A tale of crushing security lapses and missed chances to stop the man who shot Trump The acting director of the Secret Service was incensed at what had happened that July evening. 'What I saw made me ashamed,' Ronald Rowe Jr. said. 'I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured.' The unguarded roof, easily within shooting distance of the rally stage, is just one of the myriad questions behind the worst Secret Service security failure in decades. The more that investigators unpack from that day, the more missed opportunities that could have prevented the attack are revealed. As the United States grapples with a second attempt on Donald Trump’s life, in Florida, there remains a reckoning to be done from the Pennsylvania shooting on July 13 that killed one man and wounded three — the ex-president among them.	https://apnews.com/article/harris-trump-walz-vance-election-efe6f3269a8f54f455904ea78a048463	2024-09-25T04:24:33-07:00	
Czech central bank cuts its key interest rate to 4.25%	PRAGUE (AP) — The Czech Republic’s central bank on Wednesday cut its key interest rate for the seventh time in a row as inflation remains low and amid the economy’s slow recovery. The cut, which had been predicted by analysts, brought the interest rate down by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.25%. The bank started to trim borrowing costs by a quarter-point on Dec. 21, the first cut since June 22, 2022. Further cuts of half a percentage point each time followed on Feb. 8, March 20, May 2 and June 27. Another cut by a quarter of a percentage point came on Aug 1. The size of the Czech economy was up by 0.6% up year-on-year in the second quarter of 2024, and increased by 0.3% compared with the previous three months, according to the Czech Statistics Office. The bank predicts growth of 1.2% for 2024. Inflation was at 2.2% year-on-year in August, the same as the previous month, close to the bank’s target of 2.0%. The European Central Bank cut its key interest rate on Sept. 12 from 3.75% to 3.5% for the second time to prop up tepid growth with lower borrowing costs for companies and home buyers. The U.S. Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate on Sept. 19 by an unusually large half-point, a dramatic shift after more than two years of high rates that helped tame inflation. but also made borrowing painfully expensive for American consumers.	https://apnews.com/article/czech-central-bank-interest-rates-b6d43be72c7f3a67bf80bef558795cdd	2024-09-25T04:06:09-07:00	
What's behind China's launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — China test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile into the Pacific Ocean on Wednesday in a rare occurrence, adding to tensions in the region where multiple countries have overlapping territorial claims and both Beijing and Washington seek to project their influence. The launch was part of routine training by the People’s Liberation Army’s Rocket Force, which is in charge of conventional and nuclear missile operations, and was not aimed at any country or target, the Defense Ministry said in a statement. The ICBM, carrying a dummy warhead, landed in a designated area in the sea, the ministry said, without specifying where exactly. China rarely tests ICBMs out in international waters, with some experts tracing the last such deployment back to May 1980, when Beijing launched a DF-5 missile into the South Pacific. Usually, the PLA test-fires ballistic missiles in China’s remote Xinjiang region or in the Bohai Sea. Why the Pacific, why now? China choosing the Pacific Ocean as the location for test-firing its missile comes across as both a display of its increased nuclear capabilities and as a warning to the United States and its allies in the region, experts say. 'There is no other potential audience, as China does not expect to have to confront the EU or the U.K. militarily,' said Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute in London. The test also comes weeks ahead of an expected call between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and U.S. President Joe Biden. It marks an increase in regional security tensions with U.S. allies Japan and the Philippines, and a continuation of frictions with the self-ruled island of Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its own territory. Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said Wednesday it was monitoring the missile launch, along with other military exercises by China in the region. The launch, coinciding with the U.N. General Assembly meeting in New York, 'is a pretty blunt signal' to the international order, said Drew Thompson, a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore and a former U.S. defense official. 'China is signaling that its forbearance has limits, that it is prepared to use its most powerful weapons to deter adversaries or punish them if needed, if deterrence fails,' he said. Wednesday's launch also follows a series of corruption arrests this year that ensnared several leading officers in its rocket corps on allegations of misconduct. Its aim could be to both provide assurances at home and signal to the world that the issues have been resolved. How strong is China's military? China boasts the world’s largest standing army and the biggest navy. Its military budget is the second highest in the world, after that of the U.S. According to the U.S., China also has the largest air force in the Indo-Pacific, with more than half of its fighter planes consisting of fourth or fifth generation models. China also boasts a massive stockpile of missiles, along with stealth aircraft, bombers capable of delivering nuclear weapons, advanced surface ships and nuclear-powered submarines. In his more than a decade in power, Xi, who is also chairman of the Central Military Commission, has spearheaded the armed forces’ modernization, with investments in high-tech military technologies from stealth fighters to aircraft carriers and a growing arsenal of nuclear weapons. China’s defense budget has more than doubled since 2015, even as the country’s economic growth rate has slowed considerably. A U.S. Department of Defense report last year said China has continued to strengthen the PLA’s ability to 'fight and win wars against a strong enemy.' How China's missiles compare to those of others? The U.S. report also estimated China had more than 500 operational nuclear warheads as of May 2023 and was on track to accumulate more than 1,000 operational nuclear warheads by 2030. China has not revealed the size of its nuclear arsenal. In comparison, Russia is believed to have a total inventory of more than 5,580 warheads — including 4,380 stockpiled warheads for operational forces, as well as an additional 1,200 retired warheads awaiting dismantlement — according to a report this year by the Federation of American Scientists. The same report put the U.S. nuclear warheads at 5,044. How common are missile tests in the region? Few countries have ICBMs in their arsenal, and testing is usually restricted to their own territory. North Korea has carried out multiple ICBM tests since 2017, including firing a developmental solid-fueled missile in December that came down in the waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan. The U.S. earlier this year fired two unarmed ICBMs equipped with reentry vehicles from California and brought them down on an American test site in the Marshall Islands. ___ Associated Press journalists Emily Wang Fujiyama in Beijing and David Rising in Bangkok contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/china-icbm-eplainer-416dfcfe14019c3a70fb182b6f619ff7	2024-09-25T03:25:46-07:00	
Their churches no longer feel safe. Now Nicaraguans are taking their worship home	When their church no longer felt safe, deacon Francisco Alvicio and his congregation made a plan. Cautiously, discreetly, they took their worship to their homes. 'If I’m pursued at the church, I still have my Bible,' the 63-year-old Nicaraguan said. Praying in hiding became his last resort before fleeing his country in 2023. Like him, several evangelical pastors, Catholic priests and human rights organizations have denounced the surveillance, harassment and the imprisonment of Nicaraguan faith leaders in recent years. 'Arriving with a weapon is not kind-hearted,' Alvicio said from Costa Rica, where he currently lives. 'If someone goes into a church wearing a uniform, speaking loudly, it’s to intimidate.' The relationship between Nicaraguan religious communities and the government has been strained since President Daniel Ortega’s crackdown on massive street protests in 2018. Ortega asked the Catholic Church to play a role as a mediator when political tensions arose, but the dialogue didn’t last long. After priests sheltered demonstrators inside their parishes and expressed concern about excessive use of force, Ortega targeted them as 'terrorists' who backed opposition efforts to overthrow him. Among evangelicals, relatively few pastors have openly supported the president. Most congregations have refrained from any political participation, though this has not prevented leaders from being imprisoned and hundreds of organizations from being closed. In northern Nicaragua, where Alvicio was born, most of the Indigenous Miskito people are evangelicals. The Moravian Church — to which the deacon belonged — was established in Nicaragua in 1894. Until its closure alongside more than 1,600 nongovernmental organizations last August, it had about 350,000 members in the country. For decades, Alvicio said, the Miskitos could profess their faith freely. Services took place every Wednesday, Friday and Sunday. Elders and children alike gathered at the church, where clergy read the Bible and ceremonies ended by singing a Miskito hymn. Things started shifting when the government imposed new rules on the congregation. First came a tax that its members had never paid. Then, an order to replace their logo. 'We did not accept,' Alvicio said. 'We can’t change something just because the government wants to. The only path we follow is the one of God.' Before long, black-clad strangers started showing up at his church. Those too afraid to attend a public service decided to pray at home. Some read their Bibles in solitude. Others with spare chairs turned their tiny houses into makeshift churches, calling in a few neighbors and leaders like Alvicio. By changing venues every day, lowering their voices and gathering as early as 4 a.m. to avoid detection, they kept worshipping. How evangelicals have been affected by Ortega’s government According to CSW, a British-based organization that advocates for religious freedom, violations against the faith practice of Nicaraguan Protestants have been less visible than those against the Catholic Church. Anna Lee Stangl, CSW’s head of advocacy, noted in a recent publication that the Catholic Church is a single religious organization whose structure spreads geographically and has a clear, public hierarchy. 'The Protestant Church is made up of many different denominations and independent churches, some of which may be dominant in one part of the country and absent in another, and which do not necessarily work together or even communicate,' she said. In both Catholic and Protestant communities, violations reported by organizations and faith leaders are similar: restrictions on the length, location and frequency of services; prohibition of processions; invasion of masked men into churches; theft or destruction of religious objects and infiltration of informants. 'The situation has seriously worsened,' said Martha Patricia Molina, a Nicaraguan lawyer who keeps a record of religious freedom violations. According to her latest report, 870 violations were committed against the Catholic Church between 2018 and 2024, and 100 against Protestants in the same period. Additionally, said human rights organization Nicaragua Nunca Más, more than 256 evangelical churches have been closed by the government in the past four years, while 43 Catholic groups have been targeted since 2022. At least 200 religious leaders have fled Nicaragua, the organization said. More than 20 were stripped from their citizenship and 65 have been indicted for conspiracy and other charges. The Nicaraguan government did not immediately respond to a request for comment. An American pastor’s tale Pastor Jon Britton Hancock didn't see it coming. How could he suspect that 11 pastors from his evangelical church could be arrested if Ortega’s government had greenlighted their operations for years? He and his wife, both Americans and founders of Mountain Gateway, started working in Nicaragua in 2013. Two years later, they sent their first missionaries and began collaborating with local pastors. For the next decade, they developed fair-trade coffee practices, offered disaster relief to families affected by hurricanes and organized mass evangelism campaigns. But then, it all suddenly changed. In December 2023, 11 of his church’s pastors and two lawyers were arrested; their families didn't hear from them for months. It wasn’t until Sept. 5 that they were released on humanitarian grounds. Hancock wondered why this happened. Though he never engaged in political discourse, he had preached in Congress and to the national police. He had met with officials. Ortega and his wife, Vice President Rosario Murillo, had sent notes congratulating him on his church’s work. 'I think the real reason is the Gospel is a threat to totalitarian ideas,' Hancock said. 'Our perspective is about personal relationship with God and it’s based on love. And love doesn’t thrive if there’s control or coercion.' With Ortega’s measures against faith communities, he said, not only freedom is lost. Confiscations by the government have been a blow to church investments. And, in many cases, pastors imprisoned or forced into exile are the providers for their homes. Mountain Gateways’ local leader, Walder Blandon, was arrested with his wife, so they were both separated from their 2-month-old baby. He and his brother, who is two years older, had to be taken in by their grandmother, who had health issues, until their parents were released in September. 'So, whether or not the Nicaraguan government intends for people to be fearful, I can promise you that there is much fear and people are responding,' Hancock said. He, too, has heard of multiple people holding house meetings to pray. Parishioners’ modest sound systems are no longer an option, he said, because a guitar or a piano could attract police asking for a registration, so congregations have gone underground. 'It’s not very known what’s happening with evangelicals in Nicaragua,' he said. 'Evangelical pastors don’t take their stands in the same way that Catholic priests do, so it’s kind of gone under the radar, but it’s certainly there.' There’s nothing left but leaving One pastor had already gotten used to police watching his sermons and strangers listening to his conversations, but when someone told him 'they’re after your head,' he decided he should flee. 'The government wants to control everything,' said the evangelical leader, who agreed to an interview on the condition his name and new home base be withheld for safety reasons. 'They fear that if one speaks against the government, the people will rise.' In his hometown, he said, he was targeted by informants who would seek to make his acquaintance, then surreptitiously use their phones to record sounds or video that the government might find of interest. Now, with him gone, his family no longer goes to church. They worship at home and he joins them from a distance, praying for his people and the government, for justice and peace. Alvicio, too, has kept his faith strong. His church might be gone and he yearns to return to his country, but through his prayers, he remains tied to his land. 'We, the Moravians, believe that wherever we are, we can pray to God,' he said. 'So I can walk and speak and think bearing that power, knowing that, even if I’m alone, he’ll be with me.' ____ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Strike by more than 1,000 Samsung workers enters a third week in India	NEW DELHI (AP) — A strike by more than 1,000 workers at a Samsung India Electronics plant has entered its third week, and management is at an impasse over their demands for recognition of the employees’ union and higher pay, a workers union spokesman said on Wednesday, The employees strike in the plant near Chennai, the capital of the southern state of Tamil Nadu, started on Sept. 9 with a key demand for a 25-30% pay hike in the average monthly salary of 30,000-35,000 rupees ($425), said K.C. Gopi Kumar, the spokesman for the Samsung India Electronics workers union. 'Our foremost demand is recognition of the union and its rights by the management,' Kumar said. A Samsung official said that management was prepared to discuss the workers’ demands. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to talk to reporters, said the company wanted to negotiate directly with the employees’ representatives rather than through the Center of Indian Trade Unions, or CITU. The CITU is an Indian trade union aligned with a communist party. Samsung said that it paid 1.8 times more in India than the average salary of similar workers employed at other regional companies. The workers’ union says that up to 70% of production has been disrupted at the Sriperumbudur facility in southern India, which produces televisions, refrigerators and washing machines. However, the Samsung official said that after an initial disruption of 50% production, the plant was running at near average capacity with nonstriking workers, apprentices and newly hired staff on the job. The electronics company appealed to striking workers to resume their jobs. In a communication with the workers, Samsung assured them that it wouldn't take action against those employees who wished to resume work, but warned them of termination if they continued with their protest, the Press Trust of India news agency reported.	https://apnews.com/article/samung-strike-india-a61306e6c8d8a37713daa0345077e8f8	2024-09-25T01:19:08-07:00	
The leaders of Germany's Greens are quitting after several election defeats	BERLIN (AP) — The leaders of Germany's Greens, one of three parties in Chancellor Olaf Scholz's troubled coalition government, announced Wednesday that they will step down after the latest in a string of disappointing election results. The environmentalist party's support declined sharply in the European Parliament election in June. This month, it fared poorly in three state elections in eastern Germany. Voters ejected it from two state legislatures, most recently in Brandenburg on Sunday. Co-leader Omid Nouripour said in a hastily arranged statement to reporters that the result in Brandenburg 'is evidence of our party’s deepest crisis for a decade.' 'It is necessary and it is possible to overcome this crisis,' he said. The party leadership has decided that 'a new beginning is needed' and 'it is time to put the destiny of this great party in new hands,' he added. Nouripour and the party's other co-leader, Ricarda Lang, took the helm of the party in early 2022 after predecessors Robert Habeck and Annalena Baerbock joined Scholz's government as vice chancellor and foreign minister respectively. The party has seen its popularity decline since, along with that of its coalition partners. The mainstream conservative opposition Union bloc leads national polls ahead of a national election expected next year, while the far-right Alternative for Germany is polling strongly. The national government — an uneasy combination of Scholz's center-left Social Democrats with the Greens, who also lean left, and the pro-business Free Democrats — has angered Germans by bickering at length over poorly explained projects that sometimes raise fears of new costs. Those included a plan drawn up by Habeck's economy and climate ministry to replace fossil-fuel heating systems with greener alternatives. There have been frequent tensions between the Greens, who were strong advocates of Germany's exit from nuclear power and have a relatively liberal approach to migration, and the Free Democrats, who saw their own support reduced to microscopic levels in this month's state elections. Meanwhile, Germany's economy is struggling to generate any growth. The plan is for new party leaders to be elected at a previously scheduled party congress in mid-November, Nouripour said. 'New faces are needed to lead this party out of this crisis,' Lang said. 'You can imagine that this decision isn't easy, but we are taking it out of conviction.' Neither Nouripour nor Lang are part of Scholz's Cabinet. Their decision does not affect the Greens' five Cabinet ministers. In the European Parliament election, the Greens slumped to 11.9% of the vote from an exceptionally successful 20.5% five years earlier, losing ground among young voters in particular. In Germany's last national election in 2021, when Baerbock made the party's first run for the chancellery, the party won 14.8%. Baerbock said in July that she wouldn't make another bid for Germany's top job in the next election, scheduled for September 2025. The party hasn't yet decided whether it will put up a candidate for chancellor again, though Habeck is widely believed to be keen to run. Habeck told German news agency dpa that the leaders' resignation is 'a great service to the party' and 'they are clearing the way for a strong new beginning.'	https://apnews.com/article/germany-greens-leaders-resign-government-270a7bd460fdc18574168412ee78f61a	2024-09-25T00:24:07-07:00	
Pakistan brings arrested nurse before cameras to answer questions about her alleged bombing attempt	QUETTA, Pakistan (AP) — Pakistani authorities brought a nurse they said was arrested over the weekend before state-run media on Wednesday to answer questions about her alleged suicide bombing attempt. The government-organized interview in Balochistan province was broadcast on national and local television channels. The southwestern Balochistan province has for years been the scene of a long-running insurgency, with several separatist groups staging attacks that target mainly security forces in their quest for independence. The province also has an array of militant groups that are active there. Pakistan’s government has also long battled militants and insurgents of various groups across the entire country — fighting that has killed hundreds, both civilians and members of the security forces. Authorities are likely eager to show that they are gaining the upper hand in the fight. In Wednesday's interview in Quetta, the provincial capital of Baluchistan, the nurse identified herself as Adeela Baloch and said she had worked at a government hospital in the district of Turbat before she was 'misguided by terrorists' and recruited to carry out a suicide attack. She said she was arrested before she could carry out the attack. It was not clear if she spoke under duress. She did not name the group that had allegedly enlisted her or describe the target of the planned attack. The Associated Press could not independently confirm her identity or verify her claims. Officials contacted by the AP declined to provide details and only said she would not be prosecuted because she did not carry out the attack. Last month, the outlawed separatist Balochistan Liberation Army, said a woman was among a group of its fighters who had killed more than 50 people in the restive province. Earlier on Wednesday, a roadside bomb targeting police in Quetta wounded 12 people, according to local officials.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-nurse-arrested-balochistan-1182431fc24ee5303b3dcf59d06ce334	2024-09-25T00:11:55-07:00	
Netanyahu will address the UN as Israel, bogged down by one war, barrels toward another	JERUSALEM (AP) — From the dais of the U.N. General Assembly just a year ago, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu triumphantly hailed a new peace he said would sweep through the Middle East. A year later, as he travels back to that same world stage, that vision is in tatters. The devastating war in Gaza is about to hit the one-year mark. Israel is on the cusp of a wider regional war with the Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah. And the country finds itself increasingly isolated internationally and led by a polarizing leader whose handling of the conflict has sparked protests both in global capitals and on the streets of his own country. And it’s not just the mushrooming regional conflicts weighing Israel down. Netanyahu will head to New York burdened also by what could be an imminent warrant for his arrest by the International Criminal Court, what would put him in a fellowship of sorts with Russian President Vladimir Putin and former Sudanese leader Omar al-Bashir. 'He arrives almost at a point of being persona non grata,' said Alon Liel, a former director-general of Israel’s Foreign Ministry and outspoken critic of Netanyahu. He's known for his UN speeches, but will this year be different? Netanyahu is set to address the General Assembly on Friday. A gifted orator, he has long viewed speeches from such venerated perches as the optimal way to deliver a message and score political points with Israelis enthralled by his flawless English and fiery delivery. In July, he championed Israel's case for the war in Gaza in front of a joint session of the U.S. Congress, where he received multiple ovations and plaudits even from some critics back home. 'In his view, any such trips to New York, to the grand stage of world affairs, he considers an advantage,' said Yossi Shain, a professor of international relations at Georgetown and Tel Aviv University. He said Netanyahu’s speeches abroad were often meant to impress audiences at home, and this one was no different. Netanyahu is known for his showmanship at the United Nations and has repeatedly used the pulpit to try make a case for his ideology and policies. At a speech in 2012, Netanyahu famously brandished a placard with a cartoon bomb to illustrate what he said was Iran's race toward a nuclear weapon. In 2009, he showed up with a copy of the plans for the Nazi death camp Auschwitz-Birkenau, using it to highlight what he said was the former Iranian leader's 'antisemitic rants.' Last year, his focus was on what appeared to be a burgeoning normalization with Saudi Arabia that he said showed how a broader Middle East peace was not contingent on resolving the conflict with the Palestinians. He held up his prop, a map of the region, and used the word 'peace' 42 times. The map appeared to show Gaza and the West Bank — territories claimed by the Palestinians for a future state — as being encompassed by Israel. But Netanyahu arrives at the United Nations this week at a time when his own diplomatic capital and legitimacy, as well as that of the country he represents, are at a low. Critics say that aside from a moment in the spotlight, it's not clear what Netanyahu will achieve with the visit. 'He is a great believer in speechmaking,' said Tal Schneider, an Israeli political commentator. 'He thinks that if he delivers a speech in English, he can convince people in the justness of his ways,' she said, adding that that demonstrated he was 'disconnected from reality.' Netanyahu's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Miki Zohar, a Cabinet minister who is close to Netanyahu, said the U.N. was a 'very important stage' to lay out Israel's position and he hoped the speech would bolster international support. Some may not want to hear what he has to say At the U.N., Netanyahu will seek to persuade a world growing increasingly exasperated by Israel’s war in Gaza that its aims are righteous. He may try to galvanize the world behind an Israeli war against Hezbollah. And he is likely to lay blame for the region’s chaos on Iran, a repeated focus of his speeches at home and abroad. That he is making the trip at all, at a time of escalating violence with Hezbollah, points to how much significance he places on the speech. But Netanyahu’s words may fall on deaf ears. The Israeli leader 'actually believes that his U.N. speeches have transformative effects on history. They do not,' said Alon Pinkas, a former Israeli consul general in New York. Netanyahu's visit, Pinkas added, comes as Israel is now globally perceived as being 'on the precipice of a condemned pariah state' with its leader seen as a 'rogue war-monger.' Protests are expected during his visit. New York is home to Columbia University, site of some of the most intense campus demonstrations of recent years this spring — by students objecting to the bloodshed in Gaza. Netanyahu, Israel's longest-serving leader, has been a divisive figure internationally for years, with his hard-line approach to the Palestinians in particular frustrating world leaders. But his handling of the war in Gaza has further stained his global perception. The war was set off by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, which killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw 250 people dragged as hostages into Gaza. Many Israelis blame Netanyahu and his policies for allowing Hamas to develop the military capacity for being able to burst through Israel's vaunted defenses and stage the attack. The war has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, according to health officials in Gaza, and has often wiped out multiple members of the same family. It has displaced most of the tiny territory's 2.3 million population, in many cases several times, and set off a humanitarian crisis that has caused widespread hunger and lack of access to basic services. U.S.-led cease-fire efforts have stalled, and at home, Netanyahu has come under criticism for his failure to bring home the roughly 70 hostages still presumed to be alive and the bodies of some 30 others. In the aftermath of Hamas' unprecedented attack, Israel initially had the backing of its allies to punish the militant group. But the fierceness of the retaliatory assault and the staggering toll it has taken on civilians have soured the international mood against Israel. Over time, the Biden administration has grown increasingly impatient and has slowed some weapons deliveries. Britain said earlier this month it was suspending some arms exports to Israel over the risk that their use could violate international law. The request by the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court for an arrest warrant against Netanyahu will also loom large over the visit and could cast a leader who views himself as an international statesman as a global pariah instead. Liel guessed that very few heads of state will agree to meet him on the sidelines of the assembly and that the visit could turn out to be a bust for Netanyahu. 'There is no doubt that he knows how to deliver a speech,' Liel said, adding: 'I think the world buys his chatter less and less.' ___ See more of AP’s coverage of the U.N.

Asian Development Bank raises growth forecast for region, but warns of risks from trade sanctions	Developing economies in Asia are forecast to grow at a 5.0% annual pace this year, helped by a strong U.S. economy and surging demand for computer chips that power artificial intelligence, the Asian Development Bank said in a report Wednesday. The forecast was revised upward slightly from the ADB's April estimate of 4.9% growth. However, the regional lender warned of the potential threat of more protectionist measures, such as higher tariffs on exports from China, depending on the outcome of the U.S. presidential election. The report highlighted several positive trends, including a rebound in exports from Asia of computer chips and other advanced electronics this year due to rapid adoption of artificial intelligence. It also noted that energy and food prices are moderating, though inflation remains painfully high in countries such as Pakistan, Laos and Myanmar. The upturn in global demand for semiconductors and related electronics materials and components has helped drive stronger growth in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea, and to a lesser extent, the Philippines and Thailand, and that trend is expected to continue. The report cited data from World Semiconductor Trade Statistics projecting that spending on memory chips, vital for AI applications, will expand 77% this year. Other types of exports, especially autos from China and South Korea, also are growing quickly, it said. The U.S. presidential election is a major source of uncertainty. 'The election could result in higher blanket tariffs by the U.S. on all global imports, and a broad-based and steep increase in tariffs on all U.S. imports from the PRC (China),' the report said. 'This would significantly escalate U.S.-PRC trade tensions, with potential negative spillovers to developing Asia through real and financial channels.' Former President Donald Trump has pledged to stop U.S. businesses from shipping jobs overseas and to take other countries’ jobs and factories away by relying heavily on sweeping tariffs. Vice President Kamala Harris has criticized Trump’s plan to impose large tariffs on most imported goods, which she says would severely raise the cost of goods. Asia's developing economies are also vulnerable to other U.S. moves that might affect their currencies or the cost of borrowing on foreign loans, the report said. China's ailing property market remains a key risk and the report kept its forecasts for growth for the world's second-largest economy at 4.8% in 2024 and 4.5% next year. The ADB's chief economist, Albert Park, welcomed a flurry of fresh measures announced Tuesday by Beijing to cut borrowing costs and encourage more home purchases. 'It's good to see. Certainly there's room for monetary policy expansion,' he told reporters in a briefing before the report's release. 'Whether that will work remains to be seen.' Among other positive developments, the report noted that energy inflation has returned to levels seen before the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020. That alleviates pressures on some economies that depend heavily on imports of oil and other fuels, such as Sri Lanka, China and Japan. Food inflation is still slightly higher, but falling. Rice prices fell by 12% to $589 per metric ton in late August after hitting a 16-year peak of $669 per metric ton in late January, the report said. They are expected to fall further, as rice harvests are projected to hit record levels in the 2024-2025 growing year, and prices for wheat and maize also have declined. Crops are likely to benefit from the La Nina climate phenomenon, which could bring beneficial higher rainfall to some regions though it also could cause destructive flooding in others.	https://apnews.com/article/asia-economies-china-nina-trade-growth-042c810aab3de314b80402a42b28f59e	2024-09-24T23:16:21-07:00	
Australia's treasurer will visit China this week in the latest sign that bilateral ties are mending	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Treasurer Jim Chalmers will this week become the first Australian government minister in that key economic role to visit China in seven years, in the latest sign that strained bilateral relations are mending. Chalmers flies to Beijing on Thursday for a two-day visit. The last Australian treasurer to visit China was Scott Morrison in 2017. Morrison rose to become prime minister a year later and bilateral relations further soured under his rule until his conservative government was replaced by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese’s center-left Labor Party after the 2022 general election. Chalmers said Wednesday that the main purpose of his visit was to co-chair the Australia-China Strategic Economic Dialogue on Thursday with Zheng Shanjie, chair of China’s National Development and Reform Commission. Discussions will focus on growing trade and investment with China and opportunities for Australian and Chinese businesses to cooperate, government documents say. 'This is another really important step towards stabilizing our economic relationship with China,' Chalmers told reporters in Brisbane. 'It will be part of the Albanese government‘s methodical and coordinated efforts to reestablish dialogue with China, Australia’s largest trading partner,' Chalmers added. The dialogue was last held in 2017. The bilateral relationship plumbed new depths in 2020 after the Morrison government called for an independent investigation into the origins of and responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. China imposed a series of official and unofficial bans in 2020 on Australian products, including coal, cotton, wine, barley, beef, lobsters and wood that cost Australian exporters up to 20 billion Australian dollars ($13 billion) a year. Most of those trade obstacles have been removed since the conservative government was ousted after nine years in office. In November, Albanese became the first Australian prime minister to visit China in seven years. In June, Li Qiang became the first Chinese premier to visit Australia in seven years. But Australia remains wary of China as a trading partner despite improving relations and is keen forge closer economic ties to the world’s most populous nation, India. Indian Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal met with his Australian counterpart Don Farrell in Australia on Wednesday to discuss progress on a new bilateral free trade deal that furthers a 2022 pact. 'As a testimony of the importance that the Australia relationship is to India, we are looking at significantly upscaling our partnerships in trade, investment, tourism and technology and therefore one of the first announcements I’d like to make is that we shall shortly be setting up in Sydney an office covering all these four areas,' Goyal told reporters in Farrell’s hometown of Adelaide. Australia has had a free trade agreement with China since 2015.	https://apnews.com/article/australia-china-chalmers-treasurer-visit-7d010706eb04e26e5b691f0f7f24dcfe	2024-09-24T21:59:56-07:00	
Hezbollah fires missile at Tel Aviv as Israel activates reserve troops in response to rising tension	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Hezbollah hurled dozens of projectiles into Israel early Wednesday, including a missile aimed at Tel Aviv that was the militant group's deepest strike yet, and the Israeli military said it would activate reserve troops in response to the rising tensions. The Israeli military said it intercepted the surface-to-surface missile, which marked a further escalation after Israeli strikes on Lebanon killed hundreds of people. The missile set off air-raid sirens in Tel Aviv and across central Israel. There were no reports of casualties or damage. The military said it struck the site in southern Lebanon where the missile was launched. The launch ratcheted up hostilities as the region appeared to be teetering toward another all-out war, even as Israel continues to battle Hamas in the Gaza Strip. A wave of Israeli strikes on Monday and Tuesday killed at least 560 people in Lebanon and forced thousands to seek refuge. Fleeing families have flocked to Beirut and the coastal city of Sidon, sleeping in schools turned into shelters, as well as in cars, parks and along the beach. Some sought to leave the country, causing a traffic jam at the border with Syria. The United Nations said more than 90,000 people have been displaced by five days of Israeli strikes on Lebanon. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said Wednesday that a total of 200,00 people have been displaced in Lebanon since Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel nearly a year ago, drawing Israeli retaliation. Hezbollah said it fired a Qader 1 ballistic missile targeting the headquarters of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency, which it blames for a recent string of targeted killings of its top commanders and for an attack last week in which explosives hidden in pagers and walkie-talkies killed dozens of people and wounded thousands, including many Hezbollah members. The Israeli military said it was the first time a projectile fired from Lebanon had reached central Israel. Hezbollah claimed to have targeted an intelligence base near Tel Aviv last month in an aerial attack, but there was no confirmation. The Palestinian Hamas militant group in Gaza repeatedly targeted Tel Aviv in the opening months of the war. The announcement about reserve troops indicated that Israel is planning even tougher action against Hezbollah. The army said it would call up two reserve brigades for missions in the north. 'This will enable the continuation of combat against the Hezbollah terrorist organization,' the military said. Hezbollah's latest strikes included dozens of rockets fired Wednesday into northern Israel, the military said. Two people suffered shrapnel wounds in the agricultural community of Kibbutz Saar, according to Israel's Magen David Adom rescue service. Israel responded with its own new strikes on Hezbollah. In Lebanon, at least three people were killed and nine wounded in an Israeli strike near Byblos, according to the country's Health Ministry. The coastal town is north of Beirut and far from Hezbollah's main strongholds. The Israeli military has said there are no immediate plans for a ground invasion, but it has declined to give a timetable for the air campaign. Tensions between Israel and the Lebanese militant group have steadily escalated over the last 11 months. Hezbollah has been firing rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza and its ally Hamas, a fellow Iran-backed militant group. Israel has responded with increasingly heavy airstrikes and the targeted killing of Hezbollah commanders while threatening a wider operation. The U.N. Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting on Lebanon for Wednesday at the request of France. Nearly a year of fighting between Hezbollah and Israel had already displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border before this week’s escalation. Israel has vowed to do whatever it takes to ensure its citizens can return to their homes in the north, while Hezbollah has said it will keep up its rocket attacks until there is a cease-fire in Gaza, something that appears increasingly remote. The rocket fire over the past week has disrupted life for more than 1 million people across northern Israel, with schools closed and restrictions on public gatherings. Many restaurants and other businesses are shut in the coastal city of Haifa, and there are fewer people on the streets. Some who fled south from communities near the border are coming under rocket fire again. Israel has moved thousands of troops who had been serving in Gaza to the northern border. It says Hezbollah has some 150,000 rockets and missiles, including some capable of striking anywhere in Israel, and that the group has fired some 9,000 rockets and drones since last October. Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, an Israeli military spokesperson, said the missile fired Wednesday had a 'heavy warhead' but declined to elaborate or confirm it was the type described by Hezbollah. He dismissed Hezbollah's claim of targeting the Mossad headquarters, located just north of Tel Aviv, as 'psychological warfare.' The Iranian-made Qader is a medium-range surface-to-surface ballistic missile with multiple types and payloads. It can carry an explosive payload of up to 800 kilograms (1,760 pounds), according to the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. Iranian officials have described the liquid-fueled missile as having a range of 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles). Cross-border fire began ramping up Sunday in the wake of the pager and walkie-talkie bombings, which killed 39 people and wounded nearly 3,000, many of them civilians. Lebanon blamed Israel, but Israel did not confirm or deny responsibility. On Sunday, Hezbollah launched around 150 rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel. The next day, Israel said its warplanes struck 1,600 Hezbollah targets, destroying cruise missiles, long- and short-range rockets and attack drones, including weapons concealed in private homes. The strikes racked up the highest one-day death toll in Lebanon since Israel and Hezbollah fought a bruising monthlong war in 2006. An Israeli airstrike in Beirut on Tuesday killed Ibrahim Kobeisi, whom Israel described as a top Hezbollah commander with the group’s rocket and missile unit. Military officials said Kobeisi was responsible for launches toward Israel and planned a 2000 attack in which three Israeli soldiers were kidnapped and killed. Hezbollah later confirmed his death. It was the latest in a string of assassinations and other setbacks for Hezbollah, which is Lebanon's strongest political and military actor and is widely considered the top paramilitary force in the Arab world. Lebanon’s Health Ministry said six people were killed and 15 were wounded in the strike in a southern Beirut suburb, an area where Hezbollah has a strong presence. The country’s National News Agency said the attack destroyed three floors of a six-story apartment building. The U.N.’s High Commissioner for Refugees in Lebanon said one of its staffers and her young son were among those killed Monday in the Bekaa region, while a cleaner under contract was killed in a strike in the south. Hezbollah fired 300 rockets on Tuesday, injuring six Israeli soldiers and civilians, most of them lightly, according to the Israeli military. The Lebanese Health Ministry said at least 564 people have been killed in Israeli strikes since Monday, including 50 children and 94 women, and that more than 1,800 have been wounded, a staggering toll for a country still reeling from the deadly pager and walkie-talkie bombings last week. ___ Chehayeb reported from Beirut.

Belgium's appalling abuse legacy clouds pope's trip as survivors pen letter seeking reparations	VATICAN CITY (AP) — Fresh off a four-nation tour of Asia, where he saw record-setting crowds and vibrant church communities, Pope Francis travels to Belgium this week as the once-staunchly Catholic country again confronts its appalling legacy of clergy sex abuse and institutional cover-up. He will receive a sobering welcome: Abuse survivors have penned an open letter to Francis, asking him to launch a universal system of church reparations and assume responsibility for the wreckage that abuse has wrought on their lives. The open letter, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press, will be hand delivered to Francis when he meets with 15 survivors during his four-day visit starting Thursday, according to the Rev. Rik Deville, who has been advocating on behalf of abuse survivors for over a quarter-century. Another unpleasant welcome has come from Belgium’s parliament, which spent the past year hearing victims recount harrowing stories of predator priests and this week announced a follow-on investigation. The scope? How Belgian judicial and law enforcement authorities bungled a massive 2010 criminal investigation into the church’s sex crimes. None of this was foreseen when Belgian King Philippe and Queen Mathilde met with Francis in the Vatican Apostolic Palace on Sept. 14, 2023 and invited him to visit to commemorate the 600th anniversary of the founding of Belgium’s two Catholic universities. That anniversary is technically the reason for Francis’ trip, which also includes a stopover in Luxembourg on Thursday and a Mass on Sunday in Brussels to beatify a 17th century mystic nun. And in Belgium, Francis will speak about two of his pet priorities during visits to the French and Flemish campuses of the Leuven university: Immigration and climate, according to Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni. But Bruni acknowledged in a rare preview that Francis will certainly raise Belgium’s abuse record. 'Clearly the pope is aware of the difficulty, and that for years there has been suffering in Belgium, and certainly we can expect a reference in this sense,' Bruni said. Revelations of Belgium’s horrific abuse scandal have dribbled out in bits over a quarter-century, punctuated by the bombshell year in 2010, when the country's longest-serving bishop, Bruges Bishop Roger Vangheluwe, was allowed to resign without punishment, after admitting he had sexually abused his nephew for 13 years. Two months later, Belgian police staged what were then unprecedented raids on Belgian church offices, the home of the country’s recently retired Archbishop Godfried Danneels and even the crypt of a prelate — a violation the Vatican decried at the time as 'deplorable.' Danneels, a longtime friend of Francis, was caught on tape trying to persuade Vangheluwe’s nephew to keep quiet until the bishop retired. And finally, in September 2010, the church released a 200-page report compiled by child psychiatrist Peter Adriaenssens who said 507 people had come forward with stories of being molested by priests, including when they were as young as two. He identified at least 13 suicides by victims and attempts by six more. And despite everything that was known and already in the public domain, the scandal reared its head in a shocking new way last year, when a four-episode Flemish documentary, 'Godvergeten' (Godforsaken) aired on public broadcaster VRT in the weeks surrounding the royal visit to the Vatican. For the first time, Belgian victims told their stories on camera one after another, showing Flemish viewers in their living rooms the scope of the scandal in their community, the depravity of the crimes and their systematic cover-up by the Catholic hierarchy. 'We brought nothing new. We just put it all together. We brought the voices together,' said Ingrid Schildermans, the researcher and filmmaker behind Godvergeten. 'We put all the things that happened on a timeline, so that they couldn't say ‘It’s one rotten apple.’' 'That was the thing that the documentary made clear, like this really is a system and there are really people who look away or people don’t care,' she said in an interview. Amid the public outrage that ensued, both a Flanders parliamentary committee and Belgium’s federal parliament opened official inquests and heard months of testimony from victims, experts and the Catholic hierarchy. Their testimonies cast new attention on a scandal that had already been blamed for the steep decline in the Catholic Church over a generation in Belgium, where church authorities don't even publish statistics of weekly Mass attendance because the monthly rate is already in the single digits. By March, with a papal visit already announced, Francis finally took action and defrocked Vangheluwe, 14 years after he admitted to molesting his nephew. The laicization was seen as a clear bid by the Vatican to tamp down the outrage and remove an obvious problem clouding Francis' visit. The parliamentary inquiries wrapped up in May, before the country’s elections. But one issue remained outstanding: What ever became of Operation Chalice, the much-touted police raids on Danneels' residence and other church offices in 2010. Hundreds of boxes of documents that police seized were ordered returned to the church in 2014, and the criminal investigation essentially shelved, according to victims' lawyers Christine Mussche and Walter Van Steenbrugge. They have denounced what they call a 'hallucinatory sequence of irregularities and illegalities (that) has decapitated the investigation and deprived survivors of clerical sexual abuse of their fundamental right to a fair trial.' The parliamentary inquest, as part of its mandate, had been looking into the 'possible dysfunctions' in the criminal investigation and specifically whether there was 'any political, financial, national or foreign interventions, instigation, pressure and influence,' on the failed case. Because the investigation didn’t conclude before new elections, a follow-on investigation was announced Tuesday looking into 'Operation Chalice.' All of which has left a rather bitter taste among the Belgian public ahead of Francis' visit, not least because Francis remained tight with Danneels even after his cover-up was exposed, and again showed ignorance of Belgium's problem when he named the retired bishop of Ghent a cardinal in 2022. The bishop declined the honor because of his poor record dealing with abuse. The visit has also in some cases retraumatized victims, some of whom had sought to meet with the pope only to be told by church authorities they didn't make the cut, said Schildermans. 'It’s for them a very, very stressful and frustrating time,' she said. It's a far different atmosphere than the rapturous welcome Francis received in Asia less than two weeks ago and far removed from the excitement that surrounded St. John Paul II when he toured Belgium in 1985. Even De Standaard, one of Belgium’s main dailies which long was seen as the most Catholic, had a big weekend takeout under the headline 'How revolutionary is Pope Francis really?' The dead giveaway: Not really. Tuesday brought further evidence of how Belgium's dreadful record of abuse, cover-up and insensitivity to victims had clouded Francis' visit. Bishop Patrick Hoogmartens of northern Limburg announced he wouldn't take part in celebratory papal events, after revelations that he had just warmly eulogized a priest who was known to have been involved in an abuse case. 'I didn’t make the assessment that it would hurt an abuse victim from the 1970s,' he told TV Limburg. ___ Casert reported from Brussels. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Israel-Hamas war latest: Israel intercepts Hezbollah's farthest strike yet in 11 months of exchanges	Hezbollah launched dozens of rockets into Israel, including a longer-range projectile that set off air raid sirens in Tel Aviv and across central Israel. It was the group’s farthest strike yet in nearly a year of exchanges. Israel said it intercepted the projectile, and there were no reports of casualties or damage. Hezbollah said it had fired a ballistic missile at the headquarters of Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency, which it said was responsible for the targeted killing of its senior leaders. Israel said it struck the site the missile was launched from in southern Lebanon. Israel killed a top Hezbollah commander Tuesday as part of a two-day bombing campaign that left more than 560 people dead and prompted thousands in southern Lebanon to seek refuge from the widening conflict. Hezbollah has launched hundreds of projectiles towards Israel, causing some damage to buildings and homes and lightly injuring a number of people. Israel and Hezbollah have been trading fire since the Israel-Hamas war began. Israel’s military says it will do 'whatever is necessary' to push Hezbollah away from Lebanon’s border with Israel. Meanwhile, 700 British troops were due to arrive Wednesday to the eastern Mediterranean island of Cyprus as it prepared for the possible evacuation of its citizens from Lebanon. ___ Here’s the latest: Israel intercepts a missile from Lebanon JERUSALEM — The Israeli military intercepted a missile launched from Lebanon into central Israel on Wednesday morning in the latest escalation of hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah. Israel Rescue Services said there were no injuries or damage reported from the missile, which triggered sirens in Tel Aviv and Netanya, two large cities in central Israel. It was Hezbollah's farthest strike yet in nearly a year of exchanges.

Britain sends troops to prepare for possible evacuation of its citizens from Lebanon LONDON — Britain will send 700 troops to the eastern Mediterranean island of Cyprus as it prepares for the possible evacuation of its citizens from Lebanon. Cyprus is located across a strip of water from Lebanon, and Beirut harbor has been used before to evacuate foreign nationals by sea from Lebanon. During the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war, tens of thousands of foreigners were evacuated by sea to Cyprus in a fleet of commercial and military vessels, many supplied by American, British, European and other naval forces. The British troops and members of the Border Force were to arrive Wednesday, even as the government made repeated appeals for its nationals to immediately evacuate Lebanon. Britain retains sovereign military base areas in Cyprus, which are considered its territory. 'We continue to urge all sides to step back from conflict to prevent further tragic loss of life. Our government is ensuring all preparations are in place to support British Nationals should the situation deteriorate,' said British Defense Secretary John Healey. 'The Royal Air Force also have aircraft and transport helicopters on standby to provide support if necessary,' Healy said. Israel’s envoy to the U.N. says his country doesn’t want to send troops into Lebanon but will do 'whatever necessary' to halt the Hezbollah rocket fire that has driven tens of thousands of Israelis from their country’s north.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-hamas-latest-mideast-25-september-2024-1b76480b8f91d8fd536d7f639f95433b	2024-09-24T20:58:57-07:00	
Sri Lanka's new leader must balance ties between regional powerhouses India and China	COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) — The Marxist lawmaker who won Sri Lanka’s presidency faces a key challenge in how to balance ties with his country’s two most crucial partners, India and China, as he seeks to draw foreign investment and pull the economy out of the doldrums. Anura Kumara Dissanayake, 55, won the weekend election in an extraordinary political upset against an old political guard that voters blame for tipping the country into its worst economic crisis two years ago. Dissanayake must now deliver on promises to improve Sri Lankans’ lives, clean up government and ease austerity measures imposed by international lenders. But looking beyond Sri Lanka's borders, he also must navigate the rivalry between regional powerhouses India, the country's next-door neighbor, and China, which Dissanayake's party traditionally has leaned toward. Located on one of the world’s busiest shipping routes, Sri Lanka has long been eyed by the two regional rivals. Sri Lanka governments have swung between the two camps, and New Delhi and Beijing have intensely jockeyed for influence in the island nation of 22 million. 'Dissanayake will try to keep both India and China at an equal distance' but his ability to balance them is likely to be tested in the coming weeks, said Veeragathy Thanabalasingham, a Colombo-based political analyst. 'It’s going to be a tightrope walk,' he added. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping both congratulated Dissanayake soon after he won. The victory was by the National People's Power coalition led by Dissanayake's People's Liberation Front — also known as Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, or JVP — which considers itself Marxist, though it now expresses support for a free market economy. Dissanayake and his party have in the past been seen as more ideologically aligned with China. Analysts say that could mean drawing more Chinese investment, which slowed after the Sri Lankan government was blamed for taking on too many Chinese loans that added to the country’s debt as its economy collapsed in 2022. Chinese money quickly became a cautionary tale in the country, while the economic crisis allowed India to gain some sway as it stepped in with massive financial and material assistance to its neighbor. Just after Dissanayake was sworn in, Beijing said it wants to work with the new government on boosting development and cooperation in building China’s Belt and Road Initiative. Under Dissanayake, 'there’s a possibility of more Chinese money coming into Sri Lanka,' said Happymon Jacob, founder of the New Delhi-based Council for Strategic and Defense Research, adding that this could concern India. For New Delhi, Dissanayake and his JVP party could throw up fresh challenges. The party has previously criticized what it called 'Indian expansionism' in the region, and Dissanayake has rejected devolving more power to Sri Lanka’s north and east, where most of the country’s Tamil minority lives - an issue close to India, given the community’s cultural links to the country’s Tamil Nadu state. While campaigning, Dissanayake also said he would shut down a wind power project funded by Indian billionaire Gautam Adani who is seen to be close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, calling it a 'corrupt deal.' Indian analysts say that Dissanayake's victory comes as a number of neighboring countries have recently drifted towards Beijing, including Nepal and the Maldives, which now have more pro-China leaders, and Bangladesh, where the ouster of a pro-India leader last month is also testing New Delhi’s regional power. But Chinese grants and lines of credit into South Asia overall have slowed down in the past four years, said Constantino Xavier, senior fellow at the Centre for Social and Economic Progress. This has made countries in the region 'realize that they have to reset their relations with India,' he added. Similarly, Dissanayake has been pragmatic in his approach towards India so far, with New Delhi also keen to engage. In February, months before the election was announced, the leader was invited to India where he met with the country’s foreign minister. And the Indian envoy in Colombo was the first to meet Dissanayake after the results were announced. As a neighboring country, 'we need to be concerned over India’s stability, national interests and national security when taking decisions,' Dissanayake told The Associated Press in an interview a few weeks before the election. 'Our main objective is the safety of the region and we will not allow any party to use our land, sea and air to create instability,' he added. In the past, Chinese research ships docked at Sri Lankan ports have stoked security concerns in New Delhi over Beijing’s growing influence in the Indian Ocean. Thanabalasingham, the Colombo-based analyst, said Dissanayake’s party has largely transformed into a liberal democratic party for practical purposes so that it is easier to deal with a range of countries and partners. Although he remains head of a Marxist party, he now says he supports a free market economy. But Dissanayake may need to woo domestic voters who backed him, including a nationalist segment of the population that is anti-India, which could add pressure to court China more. 'He is likely to initially play up China to polish his credentials at home - even if only to extract maximum bargaining power with India,' said Xavier. ——- Pathi reported from New Delhi.	https://apnews.com/article/sri-lanka-dissanayake-balancing-india-china-cddc402be327fc6a9a4377d663b9999c	2024-09-24T20:15:16-07:00	
US missile system will remain in the Philippines despite China's alarm	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — American and Filipino security officials have agreed to keep a U.S. mid-range missile system in the northern Philippines indefinitely to boost deterrence despite China's expressions of alarm, two Philippine officials said Wednesday. The U.S. Army transported the Typhon missile system, a land-based weapon that can fire the Standard Missile-6 and the Tomahawk Land Attack Missile, to the northern Philippines as part of combat exercises in April with Philippine troops and to test its deployability aboard an Air Force aircraft. Tomahawk missiles can travel over 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers), which places China within their target range. Officials are considering keeping the missile system in the northern Philippines up to April next year, when U.S. and Philippine forces are scheduled to hold their annual Balikatan — Tagalog for 'shoulder-to-shoulder' — large-scale combat exercises, he said. The two officials spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the sensitive U.S. missile deployment publicly. There was no immediate immediate comment from U.S. officials. Chinese diplomats have repeatedly conveyed their alarm to the Philippine government, warning that the deployment of the missile system could destabilize the region. A Philippine army spokesperson said earlier that the system was scheduled to be removed from the country by the end of this month. Philippine Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr. refused to confirm or deny the extension. But Teodoro rejected China’s demands as interference in the Philippines internal affairs, speaking to reporters Tuesday on the sidelines of an Asian defense industry exhibition in Manila. 'China is saying that they are alarmed but that is interference into our internal affairs. They are using reverse psychology in order to deter us from building up our defensive capabilities,' Teodoro said. 'Before they start talking, why don’t they lead by example? Destroy their nuclear arsenal, remove all their ballistic missile capabilities, get out of the West Philippines Sea and get out of Mischief Reef,' Teodoro said. 'I mean, don’t throw stones when you live in a glass house.' Teodoro used the Philippine name for the disputed South China Sea and for a contested reef off the western Philippines that Chinese forces seized in 1995 and is now one of seven missile-protected island bases China maintains in the disputed waters. Philippine military chief Gen. Romeo Brawner Jr. said he has asked U.S. military officials to keep the missile system in the Philippines, but declined to say what was their response. 'If I were given the choice, I would like to have the Typhon here in the Philippines forever because we need it for our defense,' Brawner told reporters. Last month, Philippine Foreign Secretary Enrique Manalo said his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi expressed China’s 'very dramatic' concern over the U.S. mid-range missile deployment to the Philippines during their recent talks in Laos on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations meetings with Asian and Western countries. Manalo said Wang warned the presence of the U.S. missile system could be 'destabilizing,' but he said that he disagreed. 'They’re not destabilizing' and the missile system was only in the Philippines temporarily, Manalo said he told Wang. Although the missile system was transported to the Philippines for joint combat exercises in April, it was not fired during the joint drills by the longtime treaty allies, according to Philippine and U.S. military officials. China has strongly opposed increased U.S. military deployments to the region, including to the Philippines, saying they could endanger regional stability and peace. The U.S. and the Philippines have repeatedly condemned China’s increasingly assertive actions to fortify its territorial claims in the South China Sea, where hostilities have flared since last year with repeated clashes between Chinese and Philippine coast guard forces and accompanying vessels. Aside from China and the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan also have overlapping claims in the busy waterway, a key global and security route which is also believed to be sitting atop vast undersea deposits of gas and oil. ___ Associated Press journalist Aaron Favila contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/us-philippines-china-military-typhon-midrange-missile-system-69242b99335eb55032894fbc83d75135	2024-09-24T20:14:24-07:00	
Cambodia hopes a new canal will boost trade. But it risks harming the Mekong that feeds millions.	PREK TAKEO, Cambodia (AP) — The Mekong River is a lifeline for millions in the six countries it traverses on its way from its headwaters to the sea, sustaining the world’s largest inland fishery and abundant rice paddies on Vietnam's Mekong Delta. Cambodia's plan to build a massive canal linking the Mekong to a port on on its own coast on the Gulf of Thailand is raising alarm that the project could devastate the river's natural flood systems, worsening droughts and depriving farmers on the delta of the nutrient-rich silt that has made Vietnam the world's third-largest rice exporter. Cambodia hopes that the $1.7 billion Funan Techo canal, being built with Chinese help, will support its ambition to export directly from factories along the Mekong without relying on Vietnam, connecting the capital Phnom Penh with Kep province on Cambodia's southern coast. At an Aug. 5 groundbreaking ceremony, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet said the canal will be built 'no matter what the cost.' By reducing costs of shipping to Cambodia's only deep-sea port, at Sihanoukville, the canal will promote, 'national prestige, the territorial integrity and the development of Cambodia,' he said. Along with those promises comes peril. Here is a closer look. The threat to the Mekong The Mekong River flows from China through Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam. It supports a fishery that accounts for 15% of the global inland catch, worth over $11 billion annually, according to the nonprofit World Wildlife Fund. Flooding during the wet season makes the Mekong Delta one of the world's most productive farm regions. The river already has been disrupted by dams built upstream in Laos and China that restrict the amount of water flowing downstream, while rising seas are gnawing away at the southern edges of the climate-vulnerable Mekong Delta. Brian Eyler, director of the Washington-based Stimson Center’s Southeast Asia Program, warns that high embankments along the 100-meter (328 feet)-wide, 5.4-meter (17.7 feet)-deep canal will prevent silt-laden floodwater from flowing downstream to Vietnam. That could worsen drought in Vietnam's rice bowl and Cambodia's floodplains, an area stretching over roughly 1,300-square kilometers (501 square miles). The view from Vietnam's rice bowl A drier Mekong Delta is a concern for Vietnam’s agricultural sector, which powers 12% of its economy. The southwestern provinces of An Giang and Kien Giang would likely be most impacted. The delta's latticework of rivers crisscrossing green fields is vital for Vietnam’s own plans of growing 'high quality, low emission rice' on 1 million hectares of farmland by 2030. The aim is to cut earth-warming greenhouse gases, lower production costs and increase farmers’ profits. Water from the river is 'essential' not just for Vietnam's more than 100 million people but also for global food security, said Nguyen Van Nhut, director of rice export company Hoang Minh Nhat. Vietnam’s exports of 8.3 million metric tons (9.1 U.S. tons) of rice in 2023 accounted for 15% of global exports. Most was grown in the Mekong Delta. The amount of silt being deposited by the river has already dropped and further disruptions will worsen salinity in the area, hurting farming, Nhat said. 'This will be a major concern for the agriculture sector of the Mekong delta,' he said. Cambodia's view Cambodia says the canal is a 'tributary project' that will connect to the Bassac River near Phnom Penh. President Hun Sen claimed on social media platform X that this means there would be 'no impact on the flow of the Mekong River.' But blueprints show the canal will connect to the Mekong's mainstream and in any case the Bassac consists entirely of water from the Mekong, Eyler said. Cambodian authorities are downplaying the potential environmental impacts of the project. 'This is their logic-defying basis for justifying no impact to the Mekong River,' he said. A document submitted in August 2023 to the Mekong River Commission — an organization formed for cooperation on issues regarding the Mekong — does not mention using water from the canal for irrigation, though Cambodia has since said it plans to do so. The Stimson Center added it was 'logical' that irrigation would be needed during dry months, but that would require negotiating an agreement with the other Mekong countries. The Mekong River Commission told The Associated Press all major projects on the Mekong River 'should be assessed for their potential transboundary impacts.' It said it was providing technical support to 'increase transparency and cooperation among concerned countries.' Sun Chanthol, the Cambodian deputy prime minister who oversees the project, didn’t respond to a request for comments. Nationalistic rhetoric and tense neighbors Cambodia has rejected criticism of the canal, which is widely seen as an effort by the country's ruling elite to curry support for Prime Minister Hun Manet, who succeeded his father Hun Sen, who led Cambodia for 38 years. The canal is to be built jointly by Chinese state-owned construction giant China Road and Bridge Corporation and Cambodian companies. But it is enveloped in nationalistic rhetoric. The canal would provide Cambodia a 'nose to breathe through' by reducing its dependence on Vietnam, Hun Sen has said. Vietnam has avoided openly criticizing its neighbor, instead communicating its concerns quietly. Vietnamese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Pham Thu Hang said at a press conference in May that Hanoi had asked Cambodia to share information and assess the environmental impacts of the project to 'ensure the harmony of interests' of Mekong countries. Many Cambodians remain suspicious of Vietnam’s intentions, believing it may want to annex Cambodian territory. Given the contentious past between the two countries, bigger and richer Vietnam is taking care not to appear to be impinging on Cambodian sovereignty, said Nguyen Khac Giang, an analyst at Singapore’s ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute. 'Although in Vietnam, there are big concerns,' he said. Lost in Cambodia's nationalistic rhetoric are the concerns of people like Sok Koeun, 57, who may lose her home. The tin-roofed cottage where she has lived with her family since 1980 is right where the canal is due to be built. The river provides her with fish to feed her family when she struggles to get by selling sugarcane juice and recycling plastic cans. No one has been in touch, she says, to answer her mounting questions: Will she get compensated? Will she get land? Or cash? Where will they go? 'I only learned about it (the canal) just now,' she said. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Stock market today: Wall Street drifts near record highs following recent big moves	NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are drifting around their records as financial markets around the world take a pause following big recent moves. The S&amp;P 500 was up 0.1% in early trading Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat, and so was the Nasdaq composite. Treasury yields were holding relatively steady, a day after sinking on a surprisingly weak update on consumer confidence. The worst drop in confidence in three years raised worries about the economy, but it also raised expectations that the Federal Reserve will deliver another dose of relief through a bigger-than-usual cut to interest rates at its next meeting. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below. Trading on Wall Street was quietly mixed before the opening bell Wednesday as markets hovered around record highs. Futures for the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average were essentially unchanged from Tuesday's close. KB Home tumbled more than 6% in premarket after the homebuilder missed Wall Street profit expectations as demand softened early in the summer. The Los Angeles company noted that orders picked up in August as mortgage rates came down. SAP fell 2.3% after Bloomberg News reported that the U.S. Department of Justice was investigating the German software giant for conspiring with the American company Carahsoft Technology to overcharge U.S. government agencies. Other companies are also being investigated, according to the report. Online fashion styling service Stitch Fix slid 25% in off-hours trading after it posted a wider-than-expected fourth-quarter loss. Shares in the San Francisco company, which traded above $100 each early in the pandemic, are poised to open below $3. Global markets had surged after Beijing announced a flurry of measures aimed at reviving the housing market after a prolonged downturn. That news also boosted prices for oil, copper and other commodities. However, the cheer brought on by news of a coordinated effort to rev up growth in the world’s second-largest economy appeared to dissipate as the day wore on. Germany's DAX lost 0.4% to 18,915.00 and the CAC 40 in Paris shed 0.5% to 7,563.77. In London, the FTSE 100 edged 0.1% higher, to 8,290.08. In Asian trading, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 0.7% to 19,129.10 after jumping 1.8% earlier in the day and gaining more than 4% the day before. The Shanghai Composite index was 1.2% higher at 2,896.31. 'Chinese policymakers are throwing everything they’ve got to fight off deflation and breathe life into growth. Will it work long-term? Who knows,' Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 shed 0.2% to 37,870.26, while South Korea's Kospi sank 1.3% to 2,596.32. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 slipped 0.2% to 8,126.40. The Federal Reserve's drastic turn last week in how it sets interest rate has buoyed markets. It’s now lowering rates to ease pressure on the U.S. economy after keeping them high for years in hopes of extinguishing high inflation. Inflation has eased substantially from its peak two summers ago and the main worry occupying investors is that a slowdown in hiring by U.S. companies may worsen. A report released Tuesday showed U.S. households are feeling more worried about the job market. Their overall confidence level sank in September, according to the Conference Board, instead of rising like economists expected. That’s a big deal because spending by U.S. consumers is the heart of the U.S. economy. In early Wednesday trading, U.S. benchmark crude oil was down 90 cents at $70.66 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, lost 79 cents to $73.68 per barrel. The dollar rose to 144.35 Japanese yen from 143.23 yen. The euro climbed to $1.1194 from $1.1180. Gold continued to surge past record highs, hitting $2,681.10 per ounce. On Tuesday, U.S. stocks drifted to more records, with the S&amp;P 500 closing 0.3% higher at 5,732.93, the 41st all-time high for this year. Gains were tentative, though, and the index wavered up and down following a surprisingly weak report on U.S. consumer confidence. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.2% to its own record set the day before, closing at 42,208.22. The Nasdaq composite gained 0.6% to 18,074.52.	https://apnews.com/article/stock-markets-rates-china-commodities-65e246f0fa3ca132d7f63da4257ed590	2024-09-24T19:18:26-07:00	
NTSB engineer to testify before Coast Guard in Titan submersible disaster hearing	An engineer with the National Transportation Safety Board is scheduled to testify in front of the Coast Guard on Wednesday about the experimental submersible that imploded en route to the wreckage of the Titanic. Engineer Don Kramer is slated to testify as the investigation continues into the implosion of OceanGate's Titan submersible. OceanGate co-founder Stockton Rush was among the five people who died when the submersible imploded in June 2023. The Coast Guard opened a public hearing earlier this month that is part of a high level investigation into the cause of the implosion. Some of the testimony has focused on the troubled nature of the company. Earlier in the hearing, former OceanGate operations director David Lochridge said he frequently clashed with Rush and felt the company was committed only to making money. 'The whole idea behind the company was to make money,' Lochridge testified. 'There was very little in the way of science.' Lochridge and other previous witnesses painted a picture of a company that was impatient to get its unconventionally designed craft into the water. The accident set off a worldwide debate about the future of private undersea exploration. The hearing is expected to run through Friday and include several more witnesses, some of whom were closely connected to the company. Other witnesses scheduled to testify Wednesday were William Kohnen of Hydrospace Group Inc. and Bart Kemper of Kemper Engineering. The co-founder of the company told the Coast Guard panel Monday that he hoped a silver lining of the disaster is that it will inspire a renewed interest in exploration, including the deepest waters of the world’s oceans. Businessman Guillermo Sohnlein, who helped found OceanGate with Rush, ultimately left the company before the Titan disaster. 'This can’t be the end of deep ocean exploration. This can’t be the end of deep-diving submersibles and I don’t believe that it will be,' Sohnlein said. Coast Guard officials noted at the start of the hearing that the submersible had not been independently reviewed, as is standard practice. That and Titan’s unusual design subjected it to scrutiny in the undersea exploration community. OceanGate, based in Washington state, suspended its operations after the implosion. The company has no full-time employees currently, but has been represented by an attorney during the hearing. During the submersible’s final dive on June 18, 2023, the crew lost contact after an exchange of texts about Titan’s depth and weight as it descended. The support ship Polar Prince then sent repeated messages asking if Titan could still see the ship on its onboard display. One of the last messages from Titan’s crew to Polar Prince before the submersible imploded stated, 'all good here,' according to a visual re-creation presented earlier in the hearing. When the submersible was reported overdue, rescuers rushed ships, planes and other equipment to an area about 435 miles (700 kilometers) south of St. John’s, Newfoundland. Wreckage of the Titan was subsequently found on the ocean floor about 330 yards (300 meters) off the bow of the Titanic, Coast Guard officials said. No one on board survived. OceanGate said it has been fully cooperating with the Coast Guard and NTSB investigations since they began. Titan had been making voyages to the Titanic wreckage site going back to 2021.	https://apnews.com/article/titan-titanic-oceangate-coast-guard-hearing-implosion-f1ee1b9d4e48bf782af328590c417f03	2024-09-24T19:17:20-07:00	
Mexico's most popular president in decades is retiring. What will he leave behind?	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Many Mexicans will feel a deep sense of loss when folksy, charismatic, nationalistic President Andrés Manuel López Obrador leaves office on Sept. 30 — and that’s no surprise. López Obrador himself has spent an inordinate amount of time talking about his own legacy — and his place in history — over his six-year term, something he brings up at almost every one of his marathonic daily 7 a.m. media briefings. But what legacy will the rumpled, grinning López Obrador leave behind? It is perhaps the main question for a man who is obsessed with history, and one thing appears clear: he has changed the way politics is done in Mexico, perhaps forever. Unlike decades of reserved and distant presidents, López Obrador has built a deep personal connection with many Mexicans. He has stripped the office of the thousands of presidential guards, limousines and walled compounds that once characterized it, saying 'you can't have a rich government with poor people.' 'He is a politician who evokes familiarity, he reminds people of a father, an uncle, a grandfather,' said Carlos Pérez Ricart, a political analyst at Mexico’s Center for Economic Research and Teaching. That's not a coincidence, either. López Obrador constantly praises the traditional family and says it has saved the country. 'He does feel nostalgia for some of the social structures of the 1970s in Mexico and nostalgia for the family,' said Pérez Ricart. Will his legacy be like that of U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose New Deal created lasting institutions like Social Security and home mortgage programs that resulted in an enormous, stable middle class? The Mexican leader stakes his movement on cash social-benefit programs, he likes to compare himself to Roosevelt and many Mexicans think of him with the same fondness that the more patrician FDR inspired in his day. 'I think he's going to be remembered as a president who started big changes, who thought about the people,' said Armando López, 60, who works as a street cleaner. Marina Fiesco, an office worker taking a break at a Mexico City park with her 11-year-old son, voiced similar feelings. 'I feel he does think about the people,' said Fiesco. 'It's not about left or right, a president has to look out for the people.' Part of that connection is that he talks more, and fields more questions, than probably any other leader in the world. In his six years in office, he has held about 1,400 televised morning briefings that last an average of 2 1/2 hours each. He tells jokes, talks about his favorite foods, lashes out at critical journalists, makes fun of the opposition and sometimes plays his favorite music videos. Most briefings end with him saying, 'Let's go get breakfast.' He frequently says things that are not true. He claims Mexico doesn't produce fentanyl — the deadly synthetic opioid that kills about 70,000 Americans every year — even though his own officials have contradicted him. When homicides spiked this year — despite his claims to have achieved an 18% reduction — he simply ignored the figures. Many Mexicans seem willing to tolerate the untruths, in part because López Obrador, 70, has mastered a key Mexican folk saying: 'He who gets angry, loses.' He brushes real contradictions and problems off with a chuckle, a stony refusal to discuss them, or his stock phrase, 'I have other data.' He's probably the most skillful politician ever to rule Mexico and seems to enjoy some unstoppable motivating force: in all of his thousands of hours of talking, never once has he sat down, taken one sip of water or gone off to use the bathroom. Influenced by Mexican presidents of the 20th century, López Obrador would have liked to make his mark with big infrastructure projects — he is obsessed with railroads and oil refineries — and big state-owned companies like the ones that dominated Mexico’s economy in the 1970s, his formative years. But his building projects have been often ill-planned and will be subject to the withering trends of economic and energy transition. Unlike his heroes from the past, he hasn’t been able to nationalize any industry, and has only been able to fight a rear-guard action to defend the indebted, struggling state-owned oil and electric power companies he inherited. Nor has he been able to make much of a mark in foreign policy, apart from a few rather pointless, unresolved disputes with Spain, the Vatican, Ecuador and Peru. In the face of U.S. pressure, he has used the 120,000-member national guard he created not to confront drug cartels, but to prevent migrants from reaching the U.S. border. And his social programs — like the $150-per month payment to people over 65 — can fade, be defunded or eviscerated by inflation. So could López Obrador turn out to be a figure like Argentina’s president in the 1940s and 50s, Juan Perón, who left behind an ideologically amorphous legacy that was fought over by disparate wings of his movement for decades? 'I think that what we are going to see is the ‘balkanization’ of Obrador-ism,' said Pérez Ricart, 'a dispute between the left and the right to own the term, a bit like what happened with Peronism in Argentina.' Or he could go down in history as the person who, however briefly, revived the nearly century-old Mexican tradition of a 'state party', like the old PRI, where López Obrador began his political career. The PRI ruled Mexico for 70 years, before corruption, internal disputes and economic crises brought it down. Some of López Obrador’s most devoted followers seem surprisingly willing to take the chance of another PRI. 'If after 70 years we’ve found we made a mistake, well, that’s life,' Fiesco said. López Obrador may be part of a region-wide revival of old, populistic state-party models, both on the left and right. For example, El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele stresses that his administration — which won even greater margins of reelection than López Obrador's Morena — is a 'hegemonic party, not a state party.' That's almost exactly how Morena supporters describe their movement, but the instant any party starts to use the power of the government to keep itself in power, that distinction disappears. Most people think it’s unlikely that Morena will last as long in power as the seven-decade run of the PRI. 'Times have changed, that's not possible anymore,' said Armando López, the street cleaner. 'People will support him as long as they see something (in return). They're not going to follow him blindly.' The Morena party was cobbled together by López Obrador out of old PRI members like himself and people from more leftist backgrounds. López Obrador is Morena's star, its guide, its moral authority. Once he's gone, the tensions within the party — already palpable — will likely grow stronger. López Obrador is very aware of that, and from the start he has consciously built structures to guard his legacy, which he views as his own, not the party's. He has handed more economic and law-enforcement power over to the armed forces than any other Mexican president, because the army obeys him unquestioningly and he trusts them. His longest-lasting legacy may be those structural changes: the militarization of law enforcement and large swaths of the economy, the elimination of all independent regulatory and oversight agencies, the frequent attacks on the media and a judicial overhaul that critics say will weaken democratic checks and balances. Mexico's armed forces now run airports, trains, customs facilities — and even an airline. 'The truth is that there is one really important legacy, and that is the legacy of militarization,' said Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, an associate professor at George Mason University. ___ Follow AP's Latin America coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-lopez-obrador-amlo-legacy-55df42c3ebaea69ca2df1d3ccbfe6205	2024-09-24T19:16:55-07:00	
Zelenskyy's victory plan sets Ukraine's terms in a desperate war against Russia	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The victory plan that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will present to the White House this week asks the Biden administration to do something it has not achieved in the two and a half years since Russia invaded Ukraine: act quickly to support Kyiv’s campaign. While Western dawdling has amplified Ukraine's losses, some Ukrainian officials, diplomats and analysts fear Kyiv's aim to have the plan implemented before a new U.S. president takes office in January may be out of reach. U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, reportedly briefed on the plan, said it 'can work' but many privately question how. The specifics of Zelenskyy’s blueprint have been kept under wraps until it can be formally presented to President Joe Biden, but contours of the plan have emerged, including the need for fast action on decisions Western allies have been mulling since the full-scale invasion began in 2022. It includes the security guarantee of NATO membership, according to Zelenskyy’s chief of staff Andrii Yermak — a principal demand of Kyiv and Moscow’s key point of contention. Western allies, including the U.S., have been skeptical about this option. Zelenskyy has said he will also seek permission to use long-range weapons to strike deep inside Russian territory, another red line for some of Ukraine's supporters. 'Partners often say, ‘We will be with Ukraine until its victory.’ Now we clearly show how Ukraine can win and what is needed for this. Very specific things,' Zelenskyy told reporters ahead of the trip. 'Let’s do all this today, while all the officials who want victory for Ukraine are still in official positions.' Meanwhile, outnumbered Ukrainian forces face grinding battles against one of the world’s most powerful armies in the east. As Zelenskyy pitches his plan to Biden on Thursday, Ukrainian servicemen will be grappling to hold defensive lines in the key logistics point of Vuhledar in the Donetsk region. For some of them, it is essential that Biden buys into Zelenskyy’s plan. 'I hope that allies will provide us with what we need,' said Kyanin, a soldier fighting in the Donetsk region. 'Not 10 or 31 tanks, but a thousand tanks, thousands of weapons and ammunition.' Kyiv sets the terms The victory plan is Kyiv’s response to rising pressure from Western allies and war-weary Ukrainians to negotiate a cease-fire. A deal with Russia would almost certainly be unfavorable for Ukraine, which has lost a fifth of its territory and tens of thousands of lives in the conflict. Unless, Kyiv calculates, its western partners act quickly. Ukraine's allies have routinely mulled over requests for weapons and capabilities, granting them often after their strategic value is diminished. Under the plan, from October to December, they must dramatically strengthen Kyiv's hand. The plan comprises military, political, diplomatic and economic elements. Aside from the demand for NATO membership, it seeks to bolster Ukraine’s defenses, including air defense capabilities, enough to force Moscow to negotiate. A request to ramp up sanctions to weaken Russia's economy and defense industry is also expected. Zelenskyy has said without elaborating that Kyiv’s military incursion into Kursk, in Russia, is part of the victory plan. That offensive, which embarrassed President Vladimir Putin as the Kremlin scrambled to counterattack, has not yielded any strategic gains. But it has shown the Russian public and doubtful Western allies that Russian is not invincible and Kyiv still has offensive capabilities despite being battered on the eastern front. The cost of inaction Zelenskyy has described his proposal as 'a bridge to the Peace Summit' that he has proposed for November but that Russia says it will not attend. No international players capable of swaying Moscow agreed to his earlier 10-point peace plan, which calls for the full withdrawal of Russian forces. Ukrainian presidential advisors and lawmakers have told The Associated Press that Kyiv will only agree to a cease-fire with Russia if Putin’s ability to invade the country again is crippled. Any other arrangement would not benefit Ukraine’s future or honor the sacrifices of its people. Ukrainian officials have rejected competing proposals from China and Brazil, believing they would merely pause the war and give Moscow time to consolidate its battered army and defense industry. 'It will lead to a freezing of the conflict, nothing more: Occupied territories are considered occupied. Sanctions against Russia remain. The intensity of war drops significantly but it continues,' said one presidential advisor, who requested anonymity to speak freely. He predicted that Moscow would recalibrate and attack again, likely from Mykolaiv and Odesa in the south, 'within two, three, four years, or maybe even earlier, depending on the state of Russia. That’s the scenario.' Russia's conditions for ending the war are spelled out in a 17-page draft agreement penned in April 2022. The time element Prolonging the status quo will only play into Russia’s hands in the long-term, analysts said. 'Ukraine will lose more than 1,000 square kilometers (600 miles) by the end of the year,' if current conditions continue, said Oleksandr Kovalenko, a military analyst for Information Resistance, a Kyiv-based think tank. 'We need to understand that if (allies) don’t defend Ukraine, it will make this war last for many more years, and finally, make it possible for us to lose the war,' he said. Time will also allow Russian forces to build up its weapons industry, as it did at a frightening pace in the last year, said Kovalenko. 'We lack every kind of weapon, and Russia produces their weapons 24 hours a day,' Kovalenko said. Russia has updated its aerial glide bombs, for which Ukraine has no effective countermeasure. They now weigh 3,000 pounds, which is six times bigger than when they were first used in the battle for Bakhmut in 2022, he said. Soldiers in eastern Ukraine and analysts said long-range Western weapons would be the most effective countermeasure against glide bombs, which have been deployed along the frontline, including in Vuhledar. The mining town's fall would compromise supply lines feeding the southern front and strike a devastating blow to Ukrainian morale. In his final address to the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday, Biden urged Ukraine’s backers to stand firm. 'We cannot grow weary,' he said. 'We cannot look away.' ___ Associated Press journalists Tony Hicks and Volodymyr Yurchuk contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/zelenskyy-peace-plan-biden-russia-ukraine-d5e0d1aa9bf7d17e13609c2564d26489	2024-09-24T19:09:50-07:00	
Young people in island nations face an existential question: Should they stay or should they go?	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — It's the uncomfortable talk that as a young woman, she knows she should have with her parents. They alluded to it, once, but couldn't quite address it directly. And Grace Malie was glad to avoid the subject with them, though she and her friends do discuss it. As her home, the tiny but shrinking island of Tuvalu, slowly erodes from climate change's rising seas, should she rough it out on the remaining high land? Or should she flee her home, her culture, her heritage and her past to go to Australia — in what her government negotiated as 'Plan B?' The 25-year-old, who on Wednesday addresses a special U.N. General Assembly summit on sea level rise as a representative for her country, has years to decide — decades, even. But it's a decision that, like the mythical sword of Damocles, hangs over a nation's entire generation. And two of the biggest issues facing the summit are what to do about people like Grace Malie and how countries like Tuvalu will keep the sovereignty even when they lose their land. 'This is not about leaving,' said Kamal Amakrane, managing director of the Global Center for Climate Mobility and climate envoy to the president of the General Assembly. 'This is not about giving up. This is not about giving in. This is about agency.' Your whole world could be gone Such a situation is like no other. It can't be compared to when other climate, conflict or economic refugees have to flee with little or no notice as storms hit or drought takes away livelihoods, said Alex Randall, the United Kingdom-based coordinator of the Climate and Migration Coalition. The vast majority people permanently fleeing climate-related disasters stay within their own country and travel short distances — such as those who left New Orleans after 2005's Hurricane Katrina. This is about young people today making a long-term, stay-or-go decision that lingers in the back of their minds. It's a conversation that's happening now, even though the fleeing won't happen until later. 'It’s a very difficult conversation, very emotional,' Malie said in an interview. 'And it’s 50-50. Some of us wish to stay. Some of them, because they have families,' will probably head to Australia. And that's what Malie thinks will be her own future. If she has children, she would think about 'the life of my children. I would have to opt for Plan B. Worst comes to worst, relocate.' 'I want them to have a safe and to have access to quality living, access to quality water, quality life. And in order for me to have that for them to have that, relocation is an option,' she said. 'But if I were to live by myself, you know, no children in the future as planned, then I would choose to stay.' Her parents wouldn't come right out and say it, but they have dropped hints that she should think about going to Australia, Malie said. She said they want what's best for her. Tuvalu Climate Minister Maina Talia has had the same discomfort but from the father’s point of view. He said he talked to his four young children about the inexorable threat of sea-level rise on their home and future, but he has not yet quite raised the idea of leaving the island to them. Talia said he fears that if his children leave Tuvalu for higher ground, 'their identity would be compromised.' 'It’s not an easy conversation because I want my kids to grow up the way I grew up,’’ Talia said. 'It’s an emotional thing to go through.' How do you parse the words ‘existential threat’? Talia calls sea-level rise 'an existential threat.' And it's those two words — 'existential threat'' — that are at the heart of Wednesday's summit. For years, small island nations have used that phrase, as have leaders of the United Nations and climate activists. But now it's coming back to bite them because island nations want their sovereignty, their culture, to exist — even if their land does not. 'We’ve been trying really hard to as (the Alliance of Small Island States) to move away from that concept of existential threat given the fact that if we say that that means, does that mean that the State no longer exists? The people no longer exist? And that’s not the case,' said Michai Robertson, an advisor to the small island states' alliance. Belize Prime Minister John Briceño said: 'Sovereignty is defined by the will of the people, not by the whims of climate change. Once a state is established, it will endure and thrive, no matter the challenges it faces.' The UN's Amakrane said Wednesday's summit main aims is to re-affirm the issue of sovereignty despite what the oceans do. 'The land is still there,' he said. 'It's just the surface is submerged under water.' For most of the young people's lives, if not all, there will be some land on Tuvalu, just less and less of it — with more of it inundated during storms, king tides and the rise of the oceans. And if she doesn't have to worry about a family, Malie said the increasing hardship of living there will be worth it. The threat of her home disappearing, slowly, has been hanging over her head since birth. Even when she went to school in Fiji, she and her fellow Tuvalu students 'were usually mocked as the `sinking island kids,'' she said. 'That's something that pushes us to continue our fight.' ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Israel has landed heavy blows on Hezbollah. The victory it seeks could prove elusive	It has been a devastating week for Hezbollah and the people of Lebanon. Bombs hidden in the group's pagers and walkie-talkies killed dozens of people and wounded thousands — many of them Hezbollah members. An Israeli strike in Beirut killed one of its top commanders. And Israel has bombed what it said were 1,600 militant sites across large parts of Lebanon, killing hundreds of people and displacing thousands. Israel says its objective is to secure the border so that tens of thousands of people who fled under Hezbollah fire nearly a year ago can return to their homes. But it's far from clear that its recent operations — as tactically successful as they were — will bring that about. 'No one either in or out of the defense establishment has any clue as to how to translate these brilliant operational achievements into political benefit, into a real victory that will stop the war in the north,' columnist Nadav Eyal wrote in Israel’s Yediot Ahronot newspaper. 'As long as Hezbollah retains any firepower, the northern border will not be able to return to normal.' Hezbollah began firing into Israel the day after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack triggered the war in Gaza. Its stated aim was to pin down Israeli forces in the north to help its ally Hamas, which — like Hezbollah — is backed by Iran. The Lebanese militant group has said it would cease the attacks if there is a cease-fire in Gaza, which appears increasingly unlikely. Hezbollah's response to the past week's escalation has seemed meager. The hundreds of rockets and drones it has fired into northern Israel — including areas much farther from the border than it hit previously — have caused few casualties and only scattered damage. But experts say it can weather Israeli strikes and is likely holding its most potent weapons in reserve. Israeli air power has its limits The footage on Monday of Israeli strikes sending up plumes of dust and smoke seemed grimly familiar. The American-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, the NATO campaign in Libya in 2011, and the U.S.-led war against the Islamic State group in 2014 all began with massive airstrikes lighting up the sky. In each case, the war dragged on for months or years, and ground forces played a crucial role. Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza began with nearly three weeks of heavy airstrikes across the territory, followed by a full-scale ground invasion. Nearly a year later, Hamas is still putting up a fight and holding scores of hostages. With Hezbollah, Israel has so far adopted narrower objectives — not the disarmament or defeat of the Lebanese militant group, but a new arrangement in which militants retreat from the border and halt their attacks. But even that may not be possible without a ground invasion. There's also the risk of mission-creep, as America discovered after its wars in Iraq and Afghanistan ground on for years after the toppling of Saddam Hussein and the Taliban. NATO airstrikes initially aimed at preventing a feared massacre in Benghazi morphed into a seven-month campaign of regime change from which Libya has yet to fully recover. Hezbollah likely has capabilities we haven't seen yet Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Gallant boasted that Monday's strikes alone had taken out tens of thousands of Hezbollah's rockets and missiles. 'This is the most difficult week for Hezbollah since its establishment,' he added. 'A blow has been dealt to the chain of command, to the terrorists themselves on different levels, to their shooting capabilities and to their morale.' Hezbollah has acknowledged suffering heavy blows, but even if Gallant's assessment is correct, it still has considerable resources. 'The rocket unit is still active, Hezbollah has absorbed the initial shock, and the battle has only begun,' said Qassim Qassir, a former Hezbollah member who wrote a book about the group. 'Hezbollah has only used a small part of its capabilities.' The militant group was established with the help of Iran following Israel's 1982 invasion and occupation of Lebanon, and it seeks Israel’s destruction. It has survived countless battles with Israeli forces, replaced several slain commanders over the years and rearmed after a monthlong war in 2006. Hezbollah claims to have some 100,000 fighters. Before the latest hostilities, it was believed to have some 150,000 rockets and missiles, including long-range projectiles capable of hitting anywhere inside Israel, and some precision-guided missiles. Its more sophisticated weapons are likely being held in reserve as it seeks to avoid triggering an all-out war. Sarit Zehavi, a former Israeli military intelligence analyst and founder of the Alma Research and Education Center, a think tank focused on the northern border, said Hezbollah has concealed its weapons in different parts of the country, including in areas close to Beirut where it has a strong presence. 'Hezbollah was building redundancy, so they spread their munitions and infrastructure all over, and that’s why that many targets are being attacked, because it’s everywhere,' she said. Hezbollah is far more advanced militarily than Hamas. Hezbollah also has a far larger area in which to operate, extensive supply lines linking it more directly to Iran, and networks of tunnels potentially even more extensive than those in Gaza. In the event of a ground invasion, Hezbollah fighters could be joined by thousands of fighters from fellow Iran-backed groups from Iraq, Yemen and elsewhere in the region. Neither side has good options Israel says it has no immediate plans for a ground invasion but is prepared for one, and has sent thousands of battle-hardened forces from Gaza to the northern border. If the air campaign fails to bring Hezbollah to heel, Israeli leaders will be tempted to send them in. Even if the goal is only to carve out a buffer zone to better secure the north, the risks are great. Most Israelis are insulated from the air war by distance and Israel's missile defense systems, but a ground invasion would mean more casualties and protracted fighting for soldiers and reservists already weary from a year of war in Gaza. Hezbollah waged an 18-year-long insurgency against Israel the last time it occupied Lebanon, eventually forcing it to withdraw, and another prolonged occupation could be similarly costly. Israel has already faced international outrage over the war in Gaza, including ongoing investigations by top world courts, and risks even greater isolation if it launches a similar campaign in Lebanon. Hezbollah also has few good options. Halting its rocket fire on the north in the face of Israeli pressure would likely be seen by its supporters — and its patron Iran — as a humiliating capitulation and an abandonment of the Palestinians. Escalating its attacks, either by launching more sophisticated rockets or targeting major cities like Tel Aviv, could bring an even more crushing Israeli response or an all-out war that devastates Lebanon — with Hezbollah at risk of being blamed. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah already faces criticism from many Lebanese who accuse him of tying their country’s fate to Iran and inviting war at a time of financial ruin. That leaves it stuck with the status quo, in which Israel carries out increasingly heavy strikes while Hezbollah makes do with a relatively restrained response. For Hezbollah, and the Lebanese people, that might make the coming weeks even worse. ___ Associated Press reporters Melanie Lidman in Tel Aviv and Bassem Mroue in Beirut contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-conflict-military-strategy-cce53839bbcf0a9a36af45ed2fa7dbb4	2024-09-24T19:06:43-07:00	
China test-fires an intercontinental ballistic missile into the Pacific Ocean	BEIJING (AP) — China test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile into the Pacific Ocean on Wednesday. The ICBM carried a dummy warhead and fell into a designated area of the sea, the Defense Ministry said in a statement. The launch by the People's Liberation Army was part of routine annual training. It added the launch complied with international law and was not directed against any country or target. It is unclear how often China conducts tests over such a distance. In 1980, China launched an ICBM into the South Pacific. A map published in Chinese newspapers at the time showed the target area as roughly a circle in the center of a ring formed by the Solomon Islands, Nauru, the Gilbert Islands, Tuvalu, western Samoa, Fiji and the New Hebrides.	https://apnews.com/article/china-missile-us-taiwan-9eba29cf62b21a19c15a8e119736182c	2024-09-24T18:37:01-07:00	
Residents in India-controlled Kashmir vote in the second phase of polls surrounded by heavy security	SRINAGAR, India (AP) — Under elaborate security, residents in Indian-controlled Kashmir began casting their votes Wednesday in the second phase of a staggered election for a local government. About 2.6 million residents are eligible to elect 26 of the 239 candidates in six districts, including in the biggest regional main city of Srinagar, where voters in some polling booths queued outside early in the morning. It is the first such election in a decade, and the first since Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist government scrapped the Muslim-majority region’s semi-autonomy in 2019. The former state was also downgraded and divided into two centrally governed union territories, Ladakh and Jammu-Kashmir. Both are ruled directly by New Delhi, allowing it to appoint administrators to run them along unelected bureaucrats and security setup. The region has since been on edge with civil liberties curbed and media freedoms gagged. The vote also comes for the first time in over three decades without any boycott call from separatists who challenge Indian’s sovereignty over Kashmir. Polls in the past have been marked with violence, boycotts and vote-rigging, even though India called them a victory over separatism. Authorities erected checkpoints and laid razor wire in the voting districts as government forces wearing flak jackets and carrying assault rifles patrolled the constituencies. The third phase is scheduled for Oct. 1 and votes will be counted on Oct. 8, with results expected that day. Voting began Sept. 18 with about 59% voter turnout in what the region’s chief electoral officer said was an 'incident-free and peaceful' first round of polls. Authorities have limited access of foreign media to polling stations and denied press credentials to most journalists working with international media, including to The Associated Press, without citing any reason. India and Pakistan each administer part of Kashmir, but both claim the territory in its entirety. Militants in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir have been fighting New Delhi’s rule since 1989. Many Muslim Kashmiris support the rebels’ goal of uniting the territory, either under Pakistani rule or as an independent country. India insists the Kashmir militancy is Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. Pakistan denies the charge, and many Kashmiris consider it a legitimate freedom struggle. Tens of thousands of civilians, rebels and government forces have been killed in the conflict. The multistage election will allow Kashmir to have its own truncated government and a local legislature, called an assembly, rather than being directly under New Delhi’s rule. However, there will be a limited transition of power from New Delhi to the local assembly as Kashmir will remain a 'Union Territory' — directly controlled by the federal government — with India’s Parliament as its main legislator. Kashmir’s statehood must be restored for the new government to have powers similar to other states of India.	https://apnews.com/article/kashmir-election-phase-2-india-pakistan-2db71b1cd46d801fc89743da8c414ba1	2024-09-24T18:12:33-07:00	
12 Singaporean military personnel injured when 2 armored vehicles collide in Australia	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Twelve military personnel have been injured when two Singaporean armored vehicles collided during a training exercise in Australia, officials said Wednesday. The personnel 'sustained non-serious injuries' when one Hunter Armored Fighting Vehicle 'rear-ended another' Tuesday at Shoalwater Bay Military Training Area in Queensland state, a Singapore Defense Ministry statement said. All 12 received medical care and had rejoined their unit by Wednesday, the Singapore Army said in a statement. The army paused the exercise overnight 'to remind drivers to maintain proper distance' between vehicles, the defense ministry statement said. 'Following the sharing of the incident, with emphasis on the need to maintain the safety distance, especially when driving in poor visibility, training has resumed,' the army statement said. Eleven of the injured were flown in two helicopters on Tuesday to the Rockhampton Hospital for treatment, Queensland Ambulance Service said in a statement. The hospital said in a statement the last of the injured was discharged on Wednesday. The army did not provide details of where the 12th person who was not flown to Rockhampton was treated. The Singapore Armed Forces are conducting Exercise Wallaby, its largest overseas unilateral exercise involving 6,200 personnel. The annual exercise involving army and air force has been conducted in a training area that covers an expanse of remote Australian coastline four times larger than Singapore since 1990. The exercise began on Sept. 8 and will continue eight weeks until Nov. 3. The defense ministry said the armored vehicles had been returning to base at Shoalwater Bay when they collided.	https://apnews.com/article/singapore-military-training-injuries-shoalwater-bay-australia-014c0f986e3e30469e4409fc40398b34	2024-09-24T18:11:59-07:00	
Deadly flooding in Central Europe made twice as likely by climate change	WASHINGTON (AP) — Human-caused climate change doubled the likelihood and intensified the heavy rains that led to devastating flooding in Central Europe earlier this month, a new flash study found. Torrential rain in mid-September from Storm Boris pummeled a large part of central Europe, including Romania, Poland, Czechia, Austria, Hungary, Slovakia and Germany, and caused widespread damage. The floods killed 24 people, damaged bridges, submerged cars, left towns without power and in need of significant infrastructure repairs. The severe four-day rainfall was 'by far' the heaviest ever recorded in Central Europe and twice as likely because of warming from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, World Weather Attribution, a collection of scientists that run rapid climate attribution studies, said Wednesday from Europe. Climate change also made the rains between 7% and 20% more intense, the study found. 'Yet again, these floods highlight the devastating results of fossil fuel-driven warming,' said Joyce Kimutai, the study's lead author and a climate researcher at Imperial College, London. To test the influence of human-caused climate change, the team of scientists analyzed weather data and used climate models to compare how such events have changed since cooler preindustrial times to today. Such models simulate a world without the current 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) of global warming since preindustrial times, and see how likely a rainfall event that severe would be in such a world. The study analyzed four-day rainfall events, focusing on the countries that felt severe impacts. Though the rapid study hasn't been peer-reviewed, it follows scientifically accepted techniques. 'In any climate, you would expect to occasionally see records broken,' said Friederike Otto, an Imperial College, London, climate scientist who coordinates the attribution study team. But, 'to see records being broken by such large margins, that is really the fingerprint of climate change. And that is only something that we see in a warming world.' Some of the most severe impacts were felt in the Polish-Czech border region and Austria, mainly in urban areas along major rivers. The study noted that the death toll from this month's flooding was considerably lower than during catastrophic floods in the region in 1997 and 2002. Still, infrastructure and emergency management systems were overwhelmed in many cases and will require billions of euros to fix. Last week, European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen pledged billions of euros in aid for countries that suffered damage to infrastructure and housing from the floods. The World Weather Attribution study also warned that in a world with even more warming — specifically 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming since preindustrial times, the likelihood of ferocious four-day storms would grow by 50% compared to current levels. Such storms would grow in intensity, too, the authors found. The heavy rainfall across Central Europe was caused by what's known as a 'Vb depression' that forms when cold polar air flows from the north over the Alps and meets warm air from Southern Europe. The study's authors found no observable change in the number of similar Vb depressions since the 1950s. The World Weather Attribution group launched in 2015 largely due to frustration that it took so long to determine whether climate change was behind an extreme weather event. Studies like theirs, within attribution science, use real-world weather observations and computer modeling to determine the likelihood of a particular happening before and after climate change, and whether global warming affected its intensity. ___ Read more of AP’s climate coverage at http://www.apnews.com/climate-and-environment ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Ukraine's president calls for unspecified global 'action' to force Russia into peace	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Ukraine’s president dismissed the notion of peace talks with Moscow on Tuesday, calling instead for unspecified global 'action' to force Russia into peace for invading his country and to comply with the U.N. Charter’s requirement that every country respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all other nations. Volodymyr Zelenskyy told the U.N. Security Council that Russian President Vladimir Putin is committing 'an international crime' and has broken so many international rules that he won’t stop on his own. 'And that’s why this war can’t simply fade away. That’s why this war can’t be calmed by talks,' Zelenskyy said at a meeting on the sidelines of the annual gathering of world leaders at the General Assembly. 'Russia can only be forced into peace, and that is exactly what’s needed — forcing Russia into peace as the sole aggressor in this war, the sole violator of the U.N. Charter.' The high-level meeting on the more than 2½-year war in Ukraine was attended by ministers from 14 of the council's 15 member nations. Russia chose to send its lower-level U.N. ambassador. Vassily Nebenzia opened the meeting protesting that Zelenskyy was being given the U.N. spotlight again. He also criticized Slovenia — which holds the rotating council presidency this month — for allowing the Ukrainian leader's 'chorus' to speak. He meant about 10 European Union and NATO members who aren’t on the council but march 'in lockstep' every time they come to the council 'to malign the Russian Federation.' 'When it comes to listening to these hackneyed statements, and these cookie-cutter statements, we have no intention of wasting time on that,' Nebenzia said. Ukraine's sovereignty is defended U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres briefed the council, reiterating the United Nations’ strong support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity under the U.N. Charter. 'Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 – following the illegal annexation of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and city of Sevastopol a decade ago – is a clear violation of these principles,' the U.N. chief said. Zelenskyy said Ukraine knows some countries want to talk to Putin. But, he asked, 'What could they possibly hear from him — that he’s upset because we are exercising our right to defend our people, or that he wants to keep the war and terror going just so no one thinks he was wrong?' China has repeatedly called for talks between Ukraine and Russia. Its foreign minister, Wang Yi, told the council that the suffering and destruction and increasing volatility in the region 'must be turned around.' Wang stressed that Chinese President Xi Jinping believes 'the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries should be respected.' China is pursuing peace talks and conducting shuttle diplomacy, Wang said, and its efforts have received wide international support. He pointed to a joint China-Brazil peace plan issued earlier this year. Zelenskyy also went after countries that supply weapons and ammunition to Russia, telling the council Moscow has no legitimate reason to make Iran and North Korea 'de facto accomplices.' The U.S. includes China, Iran and North Korea in its accusations U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken raised similar issues but also accused China, which has close ties to Russia, of providing Russia with machine tools, microelectronics and other items it is using 'to rebuild, restock and ramp up its war machine and sustain its brutal war.' Wang, who spoke after him, didn't directly respond but said: 'I also wish to make it clear that on the Ukraine issue, any move to shift responsibility onto China or attack and smear China is irresponsible and will lead nowhere.' Blinken also accused Iran of providing armed drones to Russia since 2022 and transferring hundreds of short-range ballistic missiles a few weeks ago – which its new president, Masoud Pezeshkian, has denied. North Korea has also delivered trainloads of weapons and ammunition to Russia including ballistic missiles and artillery rounds, Blinken said. 'The more Russia relies on their support, the more Iran and North Korea extract in return,' Blinken said. 'And the more Putin gives to Pyongyang and Tehran, the more he exacerbates threats to peace and security.' To those who ask how the United States and others can help Ukraine defend itself and criticize countries supplying military materiel to Russia, Blinken said the answer is simple: 'Russia is the aggressor, Ukraine is the victim.' ___ Edith M.

What to know from the UN: Biden stops by, Gaza takes the spotlight, a dour world outlook prevails	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The world's leaders gathered in New York for the beginning of their annual meeting at the U.N. General Assembly. Let’s just say the vibe was pretty grim. Leader after leader spoke of the wars in Ukraine, Gaza, and Sudan, climate problems, exclusion from U.N. decision making, poor nations struggling to feed their populations. 'I cannot recall a time of greater peril than this,' said KING ABDULLAH II of Jordan. A few speakers, including U.S. President JOE BIDEN, tried to push a message of hope for the future. 'We are stronger than we think. We are stronger together than alone,' Biden said. 'And what the people call impossible is just an illusion.' But the U.S. was the target of much veiled criticism for acting unilaterally on the response to the Gaza war: 'Impunity' was the word of the day. Here’s your daily guide to what’s going on at the United Nations this week, day by day: From the podium WAR IN GAZA: Many delegates focused their speeches on the war in Gaza. Jordan’s Abdullah said Israel’s campaigns are undermining a key part of the international system protecting human rights. He listed as examples: the bombing of U.N. shelters and schools; inability for U.N. workers to assist; and humanitarian workers being subsumed by the conflict. As for the idea of Palestinians finding new homes in Jordan, he said, forced displacement is a war crime and 'that will never happen.' Turkish President RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN called the U.N. a 'dysfunctional, unwieldy and inert structure,' and told delegates that 'international peace and security are too important to be left to the arbitrariness of the privileged five' permanent members of the Security Council. He called for the Security Council to impose sanctions on Israel and said the general assembly should recommend the use of force to achieve an immediate cease-fire in Gaza, the exchange of prisoners, and the unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid. Brazilian President LUIZ INÁCIO LULA DASILVA said: 'The right to self defense became a right for vengeance, which prevents a deal for the release of hostages and delays a ceasefire.' Biden repeated his calls for a cease-fire and the return of hostages: 'Full-scale war is not in anyone’s interest.' IRAN: In his first speech at the U.N. General Assembly’s annual gathering of world leaders, President MASOUD PEZESHKIAN struck a somewhat more measured tone than his predecessors often have in recent years. 'I aim to lay a strong foundation for my country’s entry into a new era, positioning it to play an effective and constructive role in the evolving global order,' said Pezeshkian, a heart surgeon who ran as a reformer. He took office in July. LGBTQ+ RIGHTS: Erdogan criticized the opening ceremony of the Paris Olympics in July, which featured drag queens and was widely misinterpreted as a representation of Christ’s last supper with his disciplines. He called it a 'disgrace' that 'revealed the dimensions of the threat we face as humanity.' Erdogan, whose government has clamped down on LGBTQ+ events in recent years, added: 'Anyone who raises a voice against this destruction project and shows the slightest reaction is silenced and becomes the target of lynching campaigns,' he said. 'Turkey is determined to break this siege and resist this climate of fear at all cost.' On the sidelines Israel’s envoy to the U.N. says his country doesn’t want to send troops into Lebanon but will do 'whatever necessary' to halt the Hezbollah rocket fire that has driven tens of thousands of Israelis from their country’s north. 'We prefer a diplomatic solution. But if it’s not working, we are using other methods to show the other side that we mean business,' said Ambassador DANNY DANON. White House Principal Deputy National Security Adviser JON FINER said that Biden administration officials were in talks with allies to help find an off-ramp to the escalating tensions between Israel and Hezbollah. 'We’re working on that it real time right here in New York and in capitals around the world,' Finer said in an appearance at an event hosted by the news site Axios. He sidestepped questions about whether the fighting has already become the all-out war that the U.S. had been pressing Israel to avoid with Lebanon as it continues its nearly year-long conflict in Gaza. But he underscored that a 'big war, a wider war' is neither in Israel or Lebanon’s interest. Climate moment In the buildup to introducing Biden for a climate speech in New York, actress and activist JANE FONDA changed some words, some accidentally, some not so to call attention to climate change. In talking about Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, Fonda slipped and started to called it the 'Inflammation' Reduction Act and then corrected it, saying inflammation actually works too, given global temperatures. Then in discussing fossil fuels that cause climate change, Fonda was blunt and profane: 'Forget natural gas, but the f—-ing fossil gas.

Voices you might have missed Several leaders from Africa complained again this year about the lack of permanent representation on the U.N. Security Council. 'Africa and its 1.4 billion people remain excluded from its key decision-making structures,' said CYRIL RAMAPHOSA, the president of South Africa. 'The U.N. Security Council must be reformed as a matter of urgency. It must become more inclusive so that the voices of all nations are heard and considered.' El Salvador President NAYIB BUKELE boasted of his country’s security turnaround, moving the tiny Central American nation from one of the world’s most dangerous countries to one of its safest. Bukele was reelected by a landslide to an unprecedented second term in February largely on his security record of crippling the country’s once-powerful street gangs. The media-savvy millennial leader has locked up more than 81,000 people under a state of emergency now in place for more than 2 ½ years that suspends some fundamental rights. 'Some say that we have jailed thousands, but the reality is that we have freed millions,' Bukele said. 'Now it’s the good (people) who live free, without fear, with their freedoms and human rights totally respected.' ___ 'Security is not only about having strong armies and weapons of mass destruction.

Qatar is the second Muslim nation whose citizens can travel to the US without a visa	NEW YORK (AP) — The Gulf nation of Qatar on Tuesday became just the second Muslim-majority country to be admitted into a program that allows its citizens to travel to the United States without first obtaining a U.S. visa. The departments of State and Homeland Security jointly announced that Qatar had met stringent eligibility requirements to join the visa waiver program. Those requirements include a low visa refusal rate, a low rate of visa overstays and a demand of reciprocal treatment of American travelers, who are already allowed to visit Qatar without a visa for up to 30 days. 'Qatar has been an exceptional partner for the United States, and our strategic relationship has only grown stronger over the past few years,' the departments said in a statement. 'This is further evidence of our strategic partnership and our shared commitment to security and stability.' Qatar, which has played a key role in trying to negotiate a cease-fire deal in Gaza and was an instrumental U.S. partner before and during the American withdrawal from Afghanistan, is the 42nd country to be admitted to the program. Most countries whose citizens can visit the U.S. without a visa are longstanding allies in Europe and Asia. The only other Muslim-majority country in the program is the tiny Southeast Asian nation of Brunei. Although Qatar's population is just over 3 million people, only a small percentage of those — about 320,000 — are actually Qataris who would be eligible for the program if they hold valid passports. The vast majority of people who live in Qatar are foreign workers and other expatriates who do not hold Qatari passports. The program allows citizens of qualifying nations to enter the U.S. for business or tourism without a visa for up to 90 days, although they must still obtain approval through the Electronic System for Travel Authorization, or ESTA, which is done online and doesn't require an in-person interview as visa applications do. After Oct. 1, U.S. citizens will be allowed to stay in Qatar without a visa for 90 days. Israel was the last country admitted to the program in 2023, and it was allowed in despite significant concerns that it does not treat Palestinian Americans, Arab Americans or Muslim Americans the same as other U.S. passport holders.	https://apnews.com/article/united-states-qatar-visa-free-travel-fd7cbb98ce42af12a6bb71f5e25b5ff5	2024-09-24T10:00:38-07:00	
US is sending $375 million in military aid to Ukraine and will announce billions more	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration said Wednesday that the U.S. will send Ukraine an undisclosed number of medium-range cluster bombs and an array of rockets, artillery and armored vehicles in a military aid package totaling about $375 million; a U.S. official also said billions more in assistance over the coming months would be announced Thursday. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced the $375 million package as global leaders met at the U.N. General Assembly this week and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy used his appearance there to rally support. Zelenskyy will meet with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris in Washington on Thursday to continue his push to get them to allow his troops to use long-range weapon s to strike deeper into Russia. The package announced by Blinken includes air-to-ground bombs, which have cluster munitions and can be fired by Ukraine's fighter jets, as well as munitions for the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), Javelin and other anti-armor systems, Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles, bridging systems and other vehicles and military equipment. 'The United States is committed to Ukraine’s defense against Russia’s brutal aggression,' Blinken said in a statement. 'We will deploy this new assistance as quickly as possible to help Ukraine protect its territory and its people.' The latest package of weapons, provided through presidential drawdown authority, is one of the largest approved recently and will take stocks from Pentagon shelves to deliver the weapons more quickly to Ukraine. It comes as nearly $6 billion in funding for aid to Ukraine could expire at the end of the month unless Congress acts to extend the Pentagon’s authority to send weapons from its stockpiles to Kyiv. A U.S. official said, however, that the Biden administration is expected to notify Congress on Thursday of its intent to spend the remaining amount of money under presidential drawdown authority contained in the supplemental budget for Ukraine after the current fiscal year that ends Sept. 30. That amount, $5.5 billion, must either be used or notified to Congress by Sept. 30 or be lost and returned to the Treasury. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to preview the expected move, said lawmakers would be told that the administration will spend the money in multiple aid packages that will be announced after Oct. 1, in the next budget year. Ukrainian and Russian forces are battling in the east, including hand-to-hand combat in the Kharkiv border region where Ukraine has driven Russia out of a huge processing plant in the town of Vovchansk that had been occupied for four months, officials said Tuesday. At the same time, Ukrainian troops continue to hold ground in Russia’s Kursk region after a daring incursion there last month. The aid announcement also came on the heels of Zelenskyy's highly guarded visit on Sunday to a Pennsylvania ammunition factory to thank the workers who are producing 155 mm shells, one of the most critically needed munitions for his country’s fight to fend off Russian ground forces. Including this latest package, the United States has provided more than $56.2 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since Russian forces invaded in February 2022. ___ Lee reported from New York.	https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-russia-war-weapons-missiles-a4a109e2eb4581e59d5d1455deb92b09	2024-09-24T08:47:16-07:00	
Italy's automotive workers plan to strike on Oct. 18 over a fall in output at Stellantis	ROME (AP) — Workers in Italy's automotive sector will go on strike on Oct. 18, the main metalworkers unions said Tuesday, in protest of declining output from Stellantis, the biggest carmaker in the country. The unions also called for a national demonstration in Rome on the same day. Stellantis, which was created in 2021 from the merger of Fiat-Chrysler with PSA Peugeot, registered a sharp drop in output at most of its Italian plants in the first half of 2024, according to data provided by the FIM-CISL union. Projections are now for just over half a million vehicles produced by Stellantis in Italy in the full year, down from 751,000 in 2023, the union said. Over the past 17 years, the struggling carmaker has slashed its Italian production by nearly 70%. Stellantis, which counts the Jeep and Ram trucks among its brands, is currently looking for a new CEO to succeed Carlos Tavares, in what the company described as a normal leadership succession plan. The company added that it’s possible Tavares will stay on longer. Tavares oversaw the merger of PSA Peugeot and Fiat-Chrysler but has come under fire from U.S. dealers and the United Auto Workers union after a dismal financial performance in the first half of the year. Its North American operations had been the company’s main source of profits, but they have struggled this year amid larger market changes. In Italy, Stellantis has been in talks for months with the right-wing government over plans to increase output there, but no agreement has been reached so far. In a statement issued later Tuesday, Stellantis confirmed its commitment to finding 'shared solutions to address the challenges regarding the automotive sector.' The group also stressed that the energy transition is a priority that can no longer be postponed and requires 'huge and urgent measures' aimed at reducing production costs. 'We are confident that close collaboration with trade unions and the Italian government will allow us to find effective and sustainable solutions for our common future, transforming this crisis into an opportunity,' it added.	https://apnews.com/article/italy-unions-stellantis-carmaker-strike-output-falls-7136d63eb2b4b1e76c540f4c42ffbddc	2024-09-24T08:01:25-07:00	
What is Hezbollah, the group battling Israel in Lebanon?	BEIRUT (AP) — After almost a year of trading fire, Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah are now engaged in ferocious confrontations that threaten to turn into a full-blown war. Israel faces a much more formidable foe in Hezbollah than it faced in Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Many consider the Iran-backed group the strongest paramilitary force in the region — but the group also has political and social wings with considerable power in Lebanon. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has warned Israel that his group has new weapons and capabilities, and it has published surveillance drone footage taken deep inside northern Israel that showed the port of Haifa and other sites far from the Lebanon-Israel border. In the past few days, it has struck deeper into Israel than at any time in the past year. What is Hezbollah? Founded in 1982 during Lebanon’s civil war, Hezbollah was initially devoted to ending Israel’s occupation of southern Lebanon. It achieved that in 2000 following a long war of attrition that eventually forced Israel to withdraw. But it has continued its battle and seeks Israel’s destruction. Shiite Muslim Hezbollah is part of a collection of Iranian-backed factions and governments known as the Axis of Resistance. It was the first group that Iran supported and used as a way to export its brand of political Islamism. In addition to being an armed group, Hezbollah is also a political party with lawmakers in the Lebanese parliament and has had representatives in most Lebanese governments for decades. It also provides extensive social services, including running schools and health clinics, in southern Lebanon and other parts of the country where it has a strong presence. In its early days, the group attacked U.S. interests, causing Washington to designate it a terrorist organization. Those attacks included taking U.S. hostages in Beirut and the infamous 1983 truck bombing of a Marine Corps barracks in Beirut that killed 241 American service members. 'Iran’s support has helped Hezbollah consolidate its position as Lebanon’s most powerful political actor as well as the most-equipped military actor supported by Iran in the whole of the Middle East,' said Lina Khatib, the director of the SOAS Middle East Institute in London. In 2006, Hezbollah fighters ambushed an Israeli patrol and took two Israeli soldiers hostage in a cross-border raid. That sparked a monthlong war between Hezbollah and Israel that ended in a draw, but Israeli bombardment wreaked widespread destruction in southern Lebanon. Israel’s objective was eliminating Hezbollah, but the Lebanese group came out stronger and became a key military and political power on Israel’s northern border. Domestic opponents have criticized Hezbollah for maintaining its arsenal and for coming to dominate the government. Hezbollah’s reputation also suffered when it briefly seized a section of Beirut in May 2008 after the Lebanese government took measures against its private telecommunications network. What are Hezbollah’s military capabilities? Hezbollah is the Arab world’s most significant paramilitary force with a robust organizational structure as well as a sizeable arsenal. It claims to have some 100,000 fighters Hezbollah’s military capabilities have surged over the years, and it has played a key role in the Syrian civil war, helping keep President Bashar Assad in power there. It has also helped train Iran-backed militias in Syria and Iraq, as well as Yemen’s Houthi rebels. Israel estimates Hezbollah has some 150,000 rockets and missiles, including guided missiles and long-range projectiles capable of striking anywhere in Israel. Throughout its latest conflict with Israel, Hezbollah has gradually introduced new weapons to its arsenal. While Hezbollah initially began launching anti-tank missiles and rockets, it eventually introduced explosive drones and surface-to-air missiles for the first time. Nasrallah said the drones are locally manufactured, and they have many at their disposal. The group sustained a severe blow last week, when thousands of communications devices, used mainly by its members, exploded in different parts of Lebanon, killing 39 and wounding nearly 3,000, many of them civilians. The attack — an embarrassing breach of Hezbollah’s supply chain — is widely blamed on Israel. Israel has recently also assassinated several of the group’s senior leaders, including a top military commander. Who Is Hassan Nasrallah? Born in 1960 into a poor Shiite family in the Beirut suburb of Bourj Hammoud and later displaced to south Lebanon, Nasrallah studied theology and joined the Amal movement, a Shiite political and paramilitary organization, before becoming one of Hezbollah’s founders. He became Hezbollah’s leader in 1992 after his predecessor was killed in an Israeli strike. Idolized by many for presiding over Israel’s withdrawal from the south and leading the 2006 war, his image appears on billboards and on gadgets in souvenir shops in Lebanon, Syria and other countries across the Arab world. But he also faces opposition among Lebanese who accuse him of tying their country’s fate to Iran. Nasrallah is also considered to be pragmatic, able to make political compromises. He has lived in hiding for years, fearing Israeli assassination, and delivers his speeches from undisclosed locations.	https://apnews.com/article/what-is-hezbollahisrael-lebanon-b4daa0a6084df27099cef45b59120034	2024-09-24T07:42:06-07:00	
Tren de Aragua gang started in Venezuela's prisons and now spreads fear in the US	MIAMI (AP) — Former federal agent Wes Tabor says his phone has been lighting up with calls from police departments around the U.S. for advice on how to combat the growing threat from the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. Tabor was in charge of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration’s office in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas in 2012 when the gang was still new and when Tabor had barely heard of it. Venezuela had long been a major transit zone for cocaine smuggled by Colombian guerrillas, with a leftist government that had close ties to some of America’s top adversaries, from Iran to Russia. So the homegrown street gang, although a concern to U.S. Embassy personnel in their daily movements around Venezuela’s dangerous capital, was not considered a major security risk to the United States. Now, more than a decade later, the gang has become a menace even on American soil and has exploded into the U.S. presidential campaign amid a spree of kidnappings, extortion and other crimes throughout the western hemisphere tied to a mass exodus of Venezuelan migrants. 'What sets this group apart is the level of violence,' said Tabor, now retired from the DEA. 'They’re aggressive, they’re hungry and they don’t know any boundaries because they’ve been allowed to spread their wings without any confrontation from law enforcement until now.' That's starting to change. In July, the Biden administration sanctioned the gang, placing it alongside MS-13 from El Salvador and the Mafia-styled Camorra from Italy on a list of transnational criminal organizations and offering $12 million in rewards for the arrest of three leaders. Then, this month, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott declared Tren de Aragua a Tier 1 threat, directing state police to target the gang and paving the way for stiffer penalties for members. Other states may soon follow suit. Gang gains notoriety in the US Focus on the gang jumped after footage from a security camera surfaced on social media showing a group of heavily armed men brazenly entering an apartment in the Denver suburb of Aurora, Colorado. That prompted former President Donald Trump to vow to ' liberate Aurora ' from Venezuelans he falsely said were 'taking over the whole town.' Police have called the reports exaggerated but nonetheless acknowledged that it is investigating 10 gang members for involvement in several crimes, including a July homicide. Among them is a Venezuelan who was arrested in another Denver suburb and accused of helping someone else steal a motorcycle and pointing an AR-15 at a tow truck driver who had asked him to move his car. Another was suspected of stealing designer Gucci sunglasses in Boulder and has a multi-state criminal record, including for carjacking and vehicular assault. Elsewhere, from the heartland to major cities like New York and Chicago, the gang has been blamed for sex trafficking, drug smuggling and police shootings as well as the exploitation of migrants. The size of the gang and the extent to which its actions are coordinated across state lines and with leaders believed to be outside the U.S. are unclear. The Tren originated in an infamous prison The Tren, which means 'train' in Spanish, traces its origin more than a decade ago to an infamously lawless prison with hardened criminals in the central state of Aragua. It nonetheless has expanded in recent years as more than 8 million desperate Venezuelans fled economic turmoil under President Nicolás Maduro’s rule and migrated to other parts of Latin America or the U.S. One of the founders is Hector Guerrero, who was jailed years ago for killing a police officer, according to InSight Crime, a think tank that monitors organized crime in the Americas. Guerrero, better known by his alias El Nino, Spanish for the 'boy,' later escaped and then was recaptured in 2013. He fled prison again more recently, as Venezuela's government tried to reassert control over its prison population, and is believed to be residing in Colombia. Authorities in countries such as Chile, Peru and Colombia — all with large populations of Venezuelan migrants — have accused the group of being behind a spree of violence in a region that has long had some of the highest murder rates in the world. Some of its more sensationalist crimes, including the beheading and burying alive of victims, have spread panic in poor neighborhoods where the gang extorts local businesses and illegally charges residents for 'protection.' Republican lawmakers make an issue of the gang Now there are concerns about its ruthless tactics reaching U.S. shores as members infiltrate the nearly 1 million Venezuelan migrants who have crossed into the U.S. in recent years. Eleven Republicans led by Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, the vice chair of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, wrote in a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland last week calling for a coordinated strategy from the Biden administration to combat the gang. 'The administration's weak enforcement of immigration laws allows gangs, like Tren de Aragua, to control routes and exploit migrants,' the letter said. Venezuelan officials express bafflement Meanwhile, back in Venezuela, officials have watched the attention on Tren de Aragua in the U.S. and have expressed their bafflement. A year ago, President Nicolas Maduro's government claimed it had dismantled the gang after retaking control of the prison where the group was born. In July, Foreign Minister Yván Gil declared that the Tren de Aragua is a 'fiction created by the international media.' More recently, Diosdado Cabello, a longtime ruling party-leader, linked the criminal group to an alleged plot backed by the U.S. and the opposition to kill Maduro and some of his allies following the July 28 presidential election. 'The United States knows how to carry out destabilization operations,' Cabello said Friday when he announced the arrest of several people, including a U.S. citizen, for their alleged roles in the foiled anti-Maduro plan. 'Why don’t they stop them?' ___ AP writers Colleen Slevin in Denver, Regina Garcia Cano in Caracas, Venezuela, and Astrid Suarez in Bogota, Colombia, contributed to this report. ___ This version has corrected the retired DEA agent's first name to Wes not Was.	https://apnews.com/article/tren-de-aragua-gang-venezuela-us-a12c8fee9dc4a0ca73769ea893e09e53	2024-09-24T07:40:45-07:00	
Election 2024 Latest: Trump makes first campaign stop in Georgia since feud with Kemp ended	Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is making his first campaign visit to battleground Georgia since a feud between the former president and Republican Gov. Brian Kemp ended last month with Kemp endorsing Trump. Trump is speaking Tuesday in Savannah, Georgia, which has one of the busiest ports in the country for cargo shipped in containers. He’s set to reveal incentives for foreign firms to leave other countries and migrate to the U.S. The former president wants to personally recruit foreign companies and to send members of his administration to do the same. Some Republicans fear Georgia has gotten more politically competitive in the two months since Vice President Kamala Harris launched her presidential bid after President Joe Biden abandoned his reelection efforts. Harris spoke Friday in Atlanta, calling Trump a threat to women’s freedoms and warning voters he would continue to limit access to abortion if elected president. Trump’s running mate JD Vance is holding a rally later this week in Georgia as well as paying a visit to Macon. Georgia is one of several presidential swing states that have new or recently altered state laws setting the rules for November's election. In Georgia, election workers will have to hand count the number of ballots cast after voting is completed. In North Carolina, some students and university staff can use their digital IDs to vote. In Wisconsin, ballot drop boxes are newly legal again, although not every voting jurisdiction will use them. Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: Trump campaign says the former president has been briefed on Iran threats Donald Trump’s campaign says the former president has been briefed on 'real and specific' threats from Iran to 'assassinate him in an effort to destabilize and sow chaos in the United States.' Spokesman Steven Cheung said in a statement that Trump was briefed by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and that officials have identified that 'continued and coordinated attacks have heightened in the past few months.' Law enforcement agencies are working to ensure Trump is protected 'and free from interference,' Cheung said. He added that Iran 'is terrified' of Trump’s 'strength and resolve.' Trump flubs off-script reference to Charlottesville during economic policy speech Donald Trump flubbed the name of Charlottesville, Virginia, while going off script during a speech otherwise focused on economic policy, slamming Vice President Kamala Harris for lying about 'Charlottestown.' The former president was talking about imposing tariffs and other steps he’d take to bolster U.S. manufacturing when he veered off topic and began arguing that he won the recent debate. 'She didn’t say anything except lies like bloodbath, like Charlottestown,' Trump said of Harris. He didn’t acknowledge the error directly, but quickly added that he was, 'finishing this topic, because they’ll say, ‘Oh, he fell into a trap’' -- when in fact he’d already made a conspicuous mistake. Trump was trying to refer to the deadly 2017 violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, between white supremacists and anti-racist protesters. Trump has faced years of criticism from Harris and other top Democrats for blaming 'both sides' for what occurred. Georgia justices weigh whether to disqualify 2 candidates from presidential ballot Georgia Supreme Court justices are expressing skepticism that votes for presidential candidates Cornel West and Claudia De la Cruz should count. Tuesday’s hearing could set the stage for disqualifying the candidate from the Georgia’s ballots. Democrats are trying to prevent others from siphoning votes from Vice President Kamala Harris. They argue West and De la Cruz failed to qualify because their presidential electors didn’t each submit a separate petition to access Georgia’s ballots. Lawyers for the candidates say such a ruling would create an unconstitutionally high barrier to ballot access. If justices disqualify West and De la Cruz, their names would likely appear on Georgia’s ballots. But votes for them wouldn’t be counted. Harris backs eliminating filibuster to pass law guaranteeing abortion rights Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris says she supports reforming Senate rules in order to pass a law that would restore abortion protections lost when Roe fell. The rules are around the filibuster. When a senator wants to prevent a vote on a bill they refuse to yield the floor. And it takes 60 votes to force them to stand down — and that means almost any major bill requires 60 votes to pass. The Senate is split 50-50 and the tie-breaking vote goes to the Vice President. But the rules mean GOP senators could block any effort to reform abortion rights. Harris said on Wisconsin Public Radio that she favored eliminating the filibuster for Roe, to 'get us to the point where 51 votes would be what we need to put back into law the protections.' It’s a position President Joe Biden has also supported. He does not support eliminating it all together - just the exception to pass abortion rights. Poll shows strong Harris strengthening support among Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander voters A new survey finds that around 6 in 10 Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander registered voters have a very of somewhat favorable opinion of Harris, compared to just 3 in 10 for Trump. AAPI voters are also more likely to believe that she is the candidate who better represents their background and policy views. The survey from AAPI Data and APIAVote marks an increase in favorability for Harris since October 2023, when an AP-NORC/AAPI Data poll found that about half of AAPI adults had a somewhat or very favorable view of her. Opinions of Trump among this group have remained stable. Harris is both Black and South Asian American, and has worked to rally AAPI voters in swing states like Georgia where their numbers are growing. But while the poll indicates that AAPI voters are much more likely to see their own cultural identity reflected in her than in Trump — about half of AAPI voters say Harris better represents their background and culture, while only about 1 in 10 say this about Trump — it’s not clear how much this is influencing their perspectives on the candidates. Trump listens to farmers before raucous Pennsylvania rally Trump spoke Monday to a small group of farmers in Smithton in rural Pennsylvania, breaking with his usual campaign form by listening more than he talked. The former president asked questions and offered a few jokes. But he mostly listened quietly as farmers from the area explained their economic difficulties. Trump also stopped at a market and gave a woman checking out a $100 bill to help pay for groceries — further showing off a softer side. He reverted back to form during a raucous evening event in Indiana, Pennsylvania, sharply criticizing Vice President Kamala Harris and suggesting without evidence that this year’s contest would be the last election should he lose. 'I don’t like anybody that doesn’t like me, I’ll be honest,' he said before adding, 'sounds childish' but 'that’s the way it is ... call it a personality defect.' Walz slams Trump's ‘drill baby, drill’ catchphrase, warns about climate change Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz told a group of about 30 donors focused on climate change that Trump’s energy catchphrase to 'drill baby, drill' is 'not a solution to things, and the public knows that it’s a cheap, easy thing.' The Democratic vice presidential nominee, speaking at a midtown Manhattan hotel to an audience that included former presidential candidate Tom Steyer and Hollywood producer Jeffrey Katzenberg, called climate change an 'existential threat' but also 'an incredible opportunity to grow our economy.' Walz cited farmers who use their land to generate wind energy in addition to growing crops. He also praised Harris for casting the tie-breaking vote in the U.S. Senate on the Inflation Reduction Act, Biden’s 2022 law to flight climate change. Walz is scheduled to speak at a series of fundraisers in New York on Monday. Vance and Walz pick stand-ins to prepare for vice presidential debate Doppelgangers have been selected to help prepare for the vice presidential debate next week.

Tropical Weather Latest: Tropical Storm Helene forms in Caribbean, Tropical Storm John weakens	Two major weather systems are bringing heavy rain, high winds and more to Mexico's southern Pacific coast on one side and the Caribbean on the other. Tropical Storm John struck Mexico late Monday with life-threatening flood potential after growing into a Category 3 hurricane in a matter of hours. It came ashore near the town of Punta Maldonado before weakening back to tropical storm status early Tuesday and was expected to weaken rapidly. Still, the U.S. National Hurricane Center warned that the storm’s slow pace and heavy rains could cause potentially catastrophic flash flooding and mudslides. Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Helene formed in the Caribbean Sea on Tuesday after bringing heavy rains and big waves to the Cayman Islands. Forecasters warned the storm could strengthen into a major hurricane en route to the southeast U.S. Hurricane watches were in effect for Florida’s Tampa Bay and from Englewood to Indian Pass, as well as for eastern Mexico from Cabo Catoche to Tulum and for Cuba’s Pinar del Rio province. Follow AP's coverage of tropical weather at https://apnews.com/hub/hurricanes. Here's the latest: Some Floridians evacuate as Helene strengthens Hal Summers is taking no chances as experts warned that a tropical storm in the Caribbean Sea could strengthen into a major hurricane. The restaurant worker in Mexico Beach, Florida, was headed inland Tuesday to stay with a friend. In 2018, he barely survived Hurricane Michael, a Category 5 hurricane, which rapidly intensified and caught residents off guard before plowing a destructive path across the western Florida Panhandle. When it hit, water began to rise inside his parents’ home. Summers waded through it with his cat in his arms to get to safety. Their house and his home were destroyed. This time, he plans to ride out the storm in the town of Marianna. He said, 'That was such a traumatic experience that that is not the place I needed to be for myself.' ▶ Read more here. Florida's chief financial officer says state will have a quicker recovery if Helene follows previous paths If Tropical Storm Helene follows the same paths as two previous hurricanes that hit Florida in the past year, the state will have a quicker recovery and won’t take as big an economic hit, Florida’s chief financial officer said Tuesday. That’s because Hurricane Idalia, which hit Florida in August 2023, and Hurricane Debby, which came ashore last month, took down vulnerable structures and trees that would have caused debris, said Florida Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis. Both storms made landfall in Florida’s Big Bend region, where some models have Helen making landfall. 'When Idalia hit, debris was everywhere. When Debby hit, the debris wasn’t as great,' Patronis said during a news conference at a fire station in St. Johns County, Florida. Patronis urged Floridians to take photos and videos of their homes to help ease the process if they need to make claims with their insurance companies because of storm damage. 'Your house may be a total loss, but now you have video evidence,' Patronis said. 'You will have video evidence of what that claim needs in it so that you can be made whole.' Georgia governor issues state of emergency ahead of Helene ATLANTA — gov. Brian Kemp has declared a state of emergency in Georgia ahead of Tropical Storm Helene's potential impact Kemp said the state would open its emergency operations center and designate 500 members of the National Guard who could be called up for active service as needed. Kemp also suspended some rules about limits on commercial trucking operations and declared that rules against price gouging are in effect. Biden deploys FEMA to Florida and Alabama ahead of Helene WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden has been briefed on Tropical Storm Helene and his administration is in touch with officials from states in the storm, the White House said on Tuesday. 'Federal resources and personnel are prepositioned, including generators, food, and water, along with search and rescue and power restoration teams. At the direction of the President, FEMA has also deployed teams to Florida and Alabama to embed with local emergency response personnel to support their efforts, as needed,' White House spokesperson Jeremy Edwards said in a statement. FAMU postpones upcoming home game against Alabama A&amp;M because of threat of Helene TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Florida A&amp;M University postponed its upcoming college football game against Alabama A&amp;M because of Tropical Storm Helene. The Rattlers rescheduled the game for Friday, Nov. 29, in anticipation of Helene strengthening into a major hurricane Wednesday while moving north toward the United States. Several models have Helene making landfall just south of Tallahassee. Florida State, meanwhile, might need to adjust its travel schedule before playing at Southern Methodist University on Saturday. 'We’re continuing to track that. There’s still a lot of information (to come),' Seminoles coach Mike Norvell said Tuesday. 'Today is a big day for gaining more information of what could be our reality. I feel good about the plans that we have. I feel good about any potential adjustments, if necessary. But it’s something that we’re absolutely tracking.' Helene formed into a tropical storm Tuesday in the Caribbean Sea. Hurricane watches were issued for parts of Cuba, Mexico and a stretch of the Florida coastline, including Tampa Bay, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. A tropical storm warning has been issued for parts of the Florida Keys. Ferry service offered to tourists on coastal island of Holbox MEXICO CITY — Authorities in Mexico are offering free ferry service to move tourists off the low-lying coastal island of Holbox. The offer was made Tuesday by Mara Lezama, the governor of the Caribbean coast state of Quintana Roo, home to resorts like Cancun, Playa del Carmen and Tulum. Holbox is known among tourists for its tranquil, shallow waters and flocks of flamingos. It is easily flooded. Tropical Storm Helene forms in the Caribbean Sea MIAMI — Tropical Storm Helene formed Tuesday in the Caribbean Sea and could strengthen into a major hurricane while moving north toward the U.S., forecasters said. Hurricane watches have been issued for parts of Cuba, Mexico and a stretch of the Florida coastline, including Tampa Bay, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. A tropical storm warning has been issued for parts of the Florida Keys. The storm was located 170 miles (275 kilometers) southeast of the western tip of Cuba and had sustained winds of 45 mph (75 kph). It could strengthen into Hurricane Helene as it approaches the Gulf Coast. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency in dozens of counties before the storm's arrival. Florida governor declares state of emergency in most of the state's counties TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency in 61 of the state’s 67 counties ahead of the storm expected to become Hurricane Helene. DeSantis is urging residents across a broad swath of the state to prepare for potentially significant impacts, from the rural Panhandle region down the Gulf Coast to southwest Florida. 'We’re anticipating impacts, I mean, 100, 200 miles (161 to 322 kilometers) outside the eye of the storm, you could see with winds and you could see with surge,' DeSantis said. 'We are going to see significant impacts no matter what happens.' In a Tuesday morning update from the state’s emergency operations center in Tallahassee, DeSantis said it’s telling that forecasters are already projecting the storm system may become a major hurricane — even before it’s technically formed into a tropical storm. DeSantis said the storm is reminiscent of Hurricane Michael, a category 5 hurricane that rapidly intensified and caught many residents off guard before plowing a path of destruction across the western Panhandle. Communities that are still rebuilding from previous storms could get battered again, DeSantis warned. 'The Big Bend and Panhandle should be especially prepared for direct impact,' DeSantis said. 2 dead after John hits Mexico’s Pacific coast PUERTO ESCONDIDO, Mexico — Two people are dead after former hurricane John barreled into Mexico’s southern Pacific coast, blowing tin roofs off houses, triggering mudslides and toppling scores of trees, officials said Tuesday. John grew into a major hurricane in a matter of hours Monday and made landfall about 80 miles (130 kilometers) east of the resort of Acapulco before declining to a tropical storm after moving inland. John came ashore near the town of Punta Maldonado late Monday as a Category 3 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 120 mph (190 kph). It weakened back to tropical storm status early Tuesday with maximum sustained wind speeds of 50 mph (85 kph) and was expected to weaken rapidly. Evelyn Salgado, the governor of the coastal state of Guerrero, said two people died when the storm sent a mudslide crashing into their house on the remote mountain of Tlacoachistlahuaca (TLAH-ko-chis-tla-waka), further from the coast. ▶ Read more here. Storm walloping Cayman Islands expected to become Tropical Storm Helene Heavy rains and big waves lashed the Cayman Islands on Tuesday as forecasters warned that a nearby cluster of thunderstorms could soon become a major hurricane en route to the southeast U.S. Hurricane watches were in effect Tuesday for Florida’s Tampa Bay and from Englewood to Indian Pass, as well as for eastern Mexico from Cabo Catoche to Tulum and for Cuba’s Pinar del Rio province. Hurricane conditions could be possible in parts of Cuba and Mexico early Wednesday and in parts of Florida late Wednesday and early Thursday, according to the National Hurricane Center. 'Now is the time to start preparing. If you’re in an evacuation zone, you should evacuate,' said Lisa Bucci, a hurricane specialist at the center. 'Don’t be fooled by the way the storm looks at the moment. We are expecting it to rapidly intensify.' She said people in regions under watches and warnings should be prepared to lose power and should have enough food and water for at least three days. The disturbance is expected to move 'over extremely deep and warm waters' that would fuel its intensification. The disturbance is expected to become Tropical Storm Helene on Tuesday and then strengthen into a Category 3 hurricane before approaching the northeast Gulf Coast. ▶ Read more here.	https://apnews.com/article/tropical-weather-hurricane-john-helene-mexico-caribbean-5a878562087e527a9ef7ba4d0b50de32	2024-09-24T05:56:19-07:00	
Thailand legalizes same-sex marriage, allows couples to wed starting in January	BANGKOK (AP) — Thailand’s landmark marriage equality bill was officially written into law Tuesday, allowing same-sex couples to legally wed. The law was published in the Royal Gazette after endorsement by King Maha Vajiralongkorn, and will come into effect in 120 days. This means LGBTQ+ couples will be able to register their marriage in January next year, making Thailand the third place in Asia, after Taiwan and Nepal, to allow same-sex marriage. The bill, which grants full legal, financial and medical rights for marriage partners of any gender, sailed through both the House of Representatives and the Senate in April and June respectively. 'Congratulations to everyone’s love,' Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra wrote on X, adding the hashtag #Love Wins. Thailand has a reputation for acceptance and inclusivity but struggled for decades to pass a marriage equality law. Thai society largely holds conservative values, and members of the LGBTQ+ community say they face discrimination in everyday life. The government and state agencies are also historically conservative, and advocates for gender equality had a hard time pushing lawmakers and civil servants to accept change. Bangkok Deputy Governor Sanon Wangsrangboon said last week that the city officials will be ready to register same-sex marriages as soon as the law gets enacted. The legislation amended the country’s Civil and Commercial Code to replace gender-specific words such as 'men and women' with gender-neutral words such as 'individual.' The government led by the Pheu Thai party has made marriage equality one of its main goals. It made a major effort to identify itself with the annual Bangkok Pride parade in June, in which thousands of people celebrated in one of Bangkok’s busiest commercial districts. The organizers of Bangkok Pride announced on Facebook that it will organize a wedding for couples who wish to register their marriage on the very first day that the law becomes effective.	https://apnews.com/article/thailand-marriage-equality-law-e0df9fa2d38afc81c53dda81ce489be5	2024-09-24T05:41:42-07:00	
Marley Brothers upholds father's legacy with first tour in 2 decades	LOS ANGELES (AP) — Bob Marley's musical legacy of harmony and peace has hit the road with his sons bringing their late father's timeless message to life in a multi-city tour. The reggae giant's footsteps are being filled by his five sons — Ziggy, Stephen, Julian, Ky-Mani and Damian — during the Marley Brothers: The Legacy Tour. It's the first time the siblings have performed together on tour in two decades. Marley's sons are honoring his work, performing about 30 of their father's songs including massive hits like 'No Woman, No Cry,' 'Could You Be Loved,' 'Is This Love' and 'Three Little Birds.' The 22-date tour kicked off in Vancouver and will conclude in early October in Miami. 'This was very important,' Ziggy said about the tour while his brothers Stephen and Julian sat beside him after a recent rehearsal in Los Angeles. The multi-Grammy winner said it was important for them to collectively find time in their busy schedules and pay homage to their father — who would have turned 80 in February 2025. 'When the opportunity arise, we can come get together, cherish and appreciate it,' he continued. 'That's the big part of it — just being able to do this together. Time is moving.' The Marley Brothers have their own reggae sounds but found a way to blend it all together. They’ve performed together since childhood including a Red Rocks performance in Colorado last year. Two or three have hit the stage in other shows, like when Damian and Stephen performed at the Hollywood Bowl last month. Julian said years of collaboration have fostered a deep musical synergy between his siblings — a natural extension of their shared lineage. 'His message goes beyond barriers. It breaks down barriers,' Julian said. 'No matter which country you go to, the people need the same message. That's why this is so everlasting. Never ending. That is the reason we are here and doing this mission.' Marley rose from the gritty Kingston, Jamaica, slum of Trench Town to reach superstar status in the 1970s with hits such as 'Get Up, Stand Up' and 'I Shot the Sheriff.' His lyrics promoting social justice and African unity made him a global icon before he died from cancer in 1981 at age 36. But Marley’s legacy has lived on through several projects including an immersive exhibit in New York and his biopic 'Bob Marley: One Love,' which debuted No. 1 at the box office in February. On Sunday, the brothers were presented a proclamation that declared Sept. 22 as 'Marley Brothers Day' in the Queens borough of New York. His sons have upheld their father’s heritage while forging their own successful paths including Julian — who won his first-ever Grammy in February. Ziggy and Stephen have each won eight Grammys; Damian has taken home five trophies and Ky-Mani has received a nomination. Along with the tour, Stephen said they are looking to work on a new album together and push their father's message of positivity forward. He said it'll take some time but they aspire to get it 'done in the near future.' 'The message in the music is what it's really all about,' said Stephen, who curated the tour's setlist. 'For me, that message is so necessary now. Our father is one of those powerful ones that got this message across. That's why we're here.'	https://apnews.com/article/marley-brothers-tour-2024-interview-660acfcf2dea1d16a6dc7c0a26e0f185	2024-09-24T05:22:28-07:00

Italian designer Alberta Ferretti resigns as creative director of the brand she founded 43 years ago	ROME (AP) — Italian designer Alberta Ferretti announced on Tuesday she is stepping down as creative director of the eponymous brand she founded more than 40 years ago. 'On Sept. 17th, you attended my last fashion show,' Ferretti wrote in a letter sent out by email. 'Yes, it’s time for me to make room for a new chapter for my brand, a new narrative. It was a difficult, complicated, but a very thoughtful choice,' she added. Ferretti, 74, said the brand will continue to bear her name and she will announce her successor soon. Fashion group Aeffe -- which owns the Alberta Ferretti brand along with Philosophy di Lorenzo Serafini, Moschino and Pollini -- said that Ferretti will retain her role as vice president of the group. At her last show during Milan’s fashion week, Ferretti presented her summery creations in the courtyard of a former cloister, now a science museum, with an elegant dome rising in the background, emphasizing the artisanal heritage in her collection. 'They are real summer clothes, because the world in the summer is very warm. I know a show is supposed to be a show but reality is important,’’ she said backstage, without hinting at her decision of stepping down soon. Ferretti, who grew up in her family’s dressmaking shop before opening her own boutique as a teenager, has remained true to her signature gentle feminine silhouettes since the launch of the brand in 1981. 'The Alberta of that day is in many ways still the Alberta of today, even if in the meantime a small family business has become a company with 1500 employees,' she wrote in her letter.	https://apnews.com/article/alberta-ferretti-resignation-aeffe-fashion-brand-milan-a7058c8f008170bf46106c7af67606a2	2024-09-24T04:59:59-07:00	
Media freedom group sounds alarm on increased security risks for local journalists in the Sahel	DAKAR, Senegal (AP) — Local journalists in the Sahel region of Africa are facing increased security risks, a media freedom group said Tuesday, as extremist attacks and military coups have shaken the region in recent years. At least two community radio journalists were killed and two kidnapped by armed groups in Mali and Chad since November last year, Reporters Without Borders said in a statement calling for the protection of local journalists. 'These crimes illustrate once again the deteriorating security context in which journalists in the Sahel are working,' Anne Bocandé, Editorial Director of Reporters Without Borders, said. 'They are still present in these territories, to which no other information professional has access any more,' she added. Three nations in the Sahel, an arid swath of land south of the Sahara in Africa, have been wracked by coups in recent years. Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso are now ruled by military leaders who took power by force, pledging to provide more security to citizens. But the security situation in the Sahel has worsened since the juntas took power, analysts say, with a record number of attacks and a record number of civilians killed both by Islamic fighters and government forces. Over the first six months of this year, 3,064 civilians were killed by the violence, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project, a 25% increase compared to the previous six months. Meanwhile, the ruling juntas have cracked down on political dissent and journalists. Earlier this year, Malian authorities banned the media from reporting on the activities of political parties and associations. Burkina Faso suspended the BBC and Voice of America radio stations for their coverage of a mass killing of civilians carried out by the country’s armed forces. In June, at least three journalists in Burkina Faso disappeared under suspicious circumstances, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.	https://apnews.com/article/media-freedom-sahel-reporters-without-borders-journalists-fc10aef159ffc631c58140efdb3b7934	2024-09-24T04:53:31-07:00	
In the gateway to the Arctic, fat, ice and polar bears are crucial. All three are in trouble.	ON HUDSON BAY (AP) — Searching for polar bears where the Churchill River dumps into Canada's massive Hudson Bay, biologist Geoff York scans a region that's on a low fat, low ice diet because of climate change. And it's getting lower on polar bears. There are now about 600 polar bears in the Western Hudson Bay, one of the most threatened of the 20 populations of the white beasts. That's about half the number of 40 years ago, says York, director of research at Polar Bear International. His latest study, with a team of scientists from various fields, shows that if the world doesn't cut back more on emissions of heat-trapping gases 'we could lose this population entirely by the end of the century,' he says. More than polar bears are threatened in this changing gateway to the Arctic, where warmer waters melt sea ice earlier in the year and the open ocean lingers longer. For what grows, lives and especially eats in this region, it's like a house's foundation shifting. 'The whole marine ecosystem is tied to the seasonality of that sea ice cover,' University of Manitoba sea ice scientist Julienne Stroeve said. When the sea ice melts earlier it warms the overall water temperature and it changes algae that blooms, which changes the plankton that feed on the algae, which changes the fish, all the way up the food web to beluga whales, seals and polar bears, scientists say. 'What we're seeing is a transformation of an Arctic ecosystem into more of a southern open ocean,' York says in August from the bobbing up-and-down edge of a 12-foot Zodiac boat. 'We're seeing a transformation from high-fat plankton that leads to things like beluga whales and polar bears to low-fat plankton that end up with the final part of the food chain being jellyfish.' Here, fat is good. 'To live in the Arctic you need to be fat, or live fat, or both,' said Kristin Laidre, a University of Washington marine mammal scientist who specializes in Arctic species. The polar bear — the symbol of both climate change and an area warming four times faster than the rest of the world — is the king of fat. When mother polar bears nurse their young — as an Associated Press team witnessed on rocks outside of Churchill, Manitoba, the self-proclaimed polar bear capital of the world — what comes out in the milk is 30% fat, York says. 'If you think of the heaviest of heavy whipping cream, it would be just like drinking that,' York says. 'This why you can have cubs that are born the size of my fist in January emerge in March at 20 to 25 pounds.' Fewer of these cubs are being born or survive the first year because their mothers aren't fat enough or strong enough to even get pregnant, York says. Polar bears feed like crazy in the ice-covered spring. They use the sea ice platforms as bases to hunt their favorite prey, high-fat seals, especially baby seals. In the Hudson Bay, unlike other areas where polar bears live, sea ice naturally disappears in the summer. So the polar bears lose their food supply. This has always happened, but now it's happening earlier in the year and the ice free area is lasting longer, say York and Stroeve. So most polar bears go hungry. Recent studies have shown that even hunting on land — caribou, birds, human trash — takes so much energy that bears that do it don't really gain any more calories than those that just sit and starve. 'Here on Hudson’s Bay, we know from the long term research that the bears today are spending up to a month longer on shore than their parents or grandparents did. That’s 30 days longer without access to food, and that’s on average,' York says. Some years the bears get near the starvation threshold of 180 days. Polar bears can fast for less than that and do well, mostly because they are so good at gathering and storing fat for these lean periods, York says. During that lean time period, researchers monitoring bears found that 19 out of 20 of them lost 47 pounds in just three weeks, about 7% of their body weight. Sea ice in the Arctic has shrunk by about 13% per decade — falling in large steps and plateaus — since 1979, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. While Arctic sea ice hit its fourth lowest extent on record for late August, in Western Hudson Bay unusual winds have meant longer lasting ice than usual, but it's a temporary and very localized respite. A peer-reviewed study this year from Stroeve and York looked at sea ice levels, that 180-day hunger threshold and climate simulations based on different levels of carbon pollution. The researchers found that once Earth warms another 1.3 or 1.4 degrees Celsius (2.3 to 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit) from now, the polar bears likely will cross that point of no return. Bears will be too hungry and this population likely dies out. Studies, including those by the United Nations, that look at current efforts to curb carbon dioxide emissions project warming of about 1.5 degrees to 1.7 degrees Celsius (2.7 to 3.1 degrees Fahrenheit) from now by the end of the century. 'The populations will definitely not make it,' Stroeve said. There's about 4,500 polar bears in the three Hudson Bay populations and 55,000 beluga whales. Together, that's more than 141 million pounds of fat large mammals. That seems huge, but those white beasts are losing a battle to an even larger weight: the amount of heat-trapping carbon dioxide the world spews into the air. It's 154 million pounds every minute. It's not just polar bears. University of Washington's Laidre said some scientists think the smallest water zooplankton called copepods are the most important animals in the Arctic. They're fat heavy and the staple of bowhead whales. But copepods live on the smaller plant plankton that's changing. The timing of when copepods can prosper is changing and new species are moving in, 'and they are not as lipid rich,' Laidre said. 'It's not that nothing lives out there,' York says while gazing on the Bay. 'It's that the things that are living in the North are changing and looking a lot more like the South.' What’s happening in the Hudson Bay is a preview of what will hit further north, Stroeve said. An ice scientist, Stroeve says there is just something about polar bears that is so special. 'It really just makes you so happy to see them, to see an animal living in such a harsh environment,' Stroeve said. 'And somehow they have survived. And are we going to make it so that they can't survive? That makes me sad.'' ___ Read more of AP’s climate coverage at http://www.apnews.com/climate-and-environment ___ Follow Seth Borenstein on X at @borenbears ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Sri Lanka's new president calls a parliamentary election for November to consolidate his mandate	COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) — Sri Lanka’s new President Anura Kumara Dissanayake dissolved Parliament late Tuesday and called for a parliamentary election in less than two months in an effort to consolidate power after his weekend election victory. A government notification said that Parliament was dissolved effective midnight Tuesday, and that the parliamentary election was set for Nov. 14, in an expected move that Dissanayake had vowed to take during his election campaign. Dissanayake’s party holds only three seats in the 225-member Parliament and the snap election could help him take control of the chamber while his approval ratings remain intact following his win in Saturday's polling. The dissolution came hours after Dissanayake swore in a female lawmaker in his coalition as his prime minister, making her the country’s first woman to head the government in 24 years. Harini Amarasuriya, 54, a university lecturer and activist, comes from a similar background as Dissanayake and both are members of the Marxist-leaning National People’s Power coalition, which remains in the opposition in Parliament. His victory in Saturday’s election over ex-President Ranil Wickremesinghe and opposition leader Sajith Premadasa came as Sri Lankans rejected the old political guard whom they blamed for pushing the country into an unprecedented economic crisis. The last woman to serve as prime minister, the second most-powerful position after the president, was Sirimavo Bandaranaike. She was also the world’s first female head of government when she took up the post in 1960, and served three terms until 2000. Dissanayake's lack of a majority makes it difficult for him to appoint a fully fledged Cabinet, and he had vowed during the campaign to dissolve Parliament and call a snap election. The present Parliament’s five-year term ends next August. Amarasuriya also assumed duties of four other ministries covering justice, health, women, trade and industries. Another lawmaker from Dissanayake’s party, Vijitha Herath, was appointed minister in charge of six departments including foreign affairs, transport, public security, environment, port and civil aviation. Dissanayake’s first major challenge will be to act on his campaign promise to ease the crushing austerity measures imposed by his predecessor Wickremesinghe under a relief agreement with the International Monetary Fund, after Sri Lanka defaulted on its debt. Wickremesinghe has warned that any move to alter the basics of the bailout agreement could delay the release of a fourth tranche of nearly $3 billion. Sri Lanka’s crisis was largely the result of staggering economic mismanagement combined with fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, which along with 2019 terrorism attacks devastated its important tourism industry. Sri Lanka’s politics have mostly been dominated by men since the island nation introduced universal suffrage in 1931. It’s a trend seen in most countries globally — in 2023, a Pew Research Center analysis found only 13 of the 193 member states of the United Nations had women as the head of government. Bandaranaike’s younger daughter, Chandrika Kumaratunga, later became the country’s first and only female president, holding office from 1994 to 2005.	https://apnews.com/article/sri-lanka-prime-minister-election-66fd3b9e7f42a0ec7fb3f37e60ad0ca6	2024-09-24T04:11:42-07:00	
US Navy replenishment ship operating in Mideast was damaged in an incident, officials say	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — A U.S. Navy replenishment ship operating in the Middle East sustained damage in an incident which is under investigation, officials said Tuesday. The damage to the USNS Big Horn comes after the oiler has supplied the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier strike group and remains in the region amid heightened tensions over the Israel-Hamas war and Israel's ongoing strikes targeting Hezbollah in Lebanon. A U.S. Navy official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss matters yet to be made public, said the damage happened in the Mideast, but declined to elaborate on its location. A photo released by the U.S. military dated Sept. 5 showed sailors aboard the Lincoln receiving supplies from the Big Horn, while another on Sept. 11 showed the Big Horn alongside the Lincoln. The Lincoln is patrolling the Arabian Sea. The official said the Big Horn's crew was safe and there was no sign of an oil leak from the vessel. Another U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity for the same reason, said the vessel was being supported by private tugboats and an assessment was still ongoing for the vessel. Rumors about the Big Horn's condition began circulating early Tuesday after images posted to a website tracking shipping called gCaptain showed flooding purportedly on board the Henry J. Kaiser-class fleet replenishment oiler. The website described the Big Horn as having 'ran aground ... and partially flooded off the coast of Oman.' Though the Lincoln is powered by a nuclear reactor, its strike group has vessels powered by fossil fuel that need to be resupplied at sea. The aircraft aboard the Lincoln also need jet fuel. The Big Horn and other ships like it also provide other supplies. ___ Copp reported from Washington.	https://apnews.com/article/us-navy-big-horn-mideast-israel-hamas-war-2e03c24dece6807bac359bf86c5a81dd	2024-09-24T03:59:47-07:00	
New Caledonia marks anniversary of French colonization with tight security and simmering tensions	NOUMEA, New Caledonia (AP) — New Caledonia marked the anniversary on Tuesday of France's takeover of the Pacific archipelago with tight security and simmering tensions between the pro-independence Indigenous Kanak people and the white settler communities loyal to Paris. The 171st anniversary of the French colonization of New Caledonia, which is east of Australia and 10 time zones ahead of Paris, comes four months after protests by Kanaks against French President Emmanuel Macron’ s voting reforms in New Caledonia turned violent, leaving 13 people dead and widespread destruction. The violence on the archipelago of about 270,000 people widened the gap between communities that have long faced an existential dilemma over New Caledonia's status within France. At least 6,000 police officers have been deployed in and around the capital, Noumea, since unrest started in May. On Tuesday, security forces were on high alert to prevent any violence during the Sept. 24 anniversary, a public holiday known as Citizenship Day. It marks the day in 1853 when French Admiral Auguste Febvrier-Despointes declared French sovereignty over New Caledonia in the name of Emperor Napoleon III, Napoleon’s nephew and heir. It became an overseas territory after World War II, with French citizenship granted to all Kanaks in 1957. Underlining how far apart the communities stand on the territory's future, the loyalists in Noumea on Tuesday celebrated New Caledonia's French identity, waving national flags, honking car horns to the sounds of the French national anthem, La Marseillaise, and other patriotic songs, blasting from a radio broadcast, and vehicles carrying police officers and firefighters joining in. For the Indigenous people, who once suffered from strict segregation policies and widespread discrimination, Sept. 24 is a reminder to continue their struggle for independence. The National Council of Chiefs of the Kanak people was meeting on Mare Island, across from Noumea, and was expected to unilaterally declare sovereignty over the Kanak nation on their customary territories. In Paris, New Caledonia's pro-independence Kanak lawmaker, Emmanuel Tjibaou, hailed people in his faraway homeland for 'peacefully marking this Citizenship Day' and showing that 'we stand steadfast in our fight for dignity ... that is non-negotiable,' he said in a social media post. Nicolas Metzdorf, New Caledonia’s loyalist lawmaker, was beaming with pride over the Pacific archipelago's French identity and vowed that his supporters have every intention of keeping the territory a part of France. On Citizenship Day, New Caledonia 'celebrates our attachment to France,' Metzdorf said. 'It's a celebration of all citizens, including those who are still excluded from voting,' he said in reference to those residents, who have recently settled in the archipelago but can't vote in local elections in line with the 1998 Noumea Accord that gives New Caledonia more political power and broader autonomy. In the spring, Macron rushed a bill through Parliament aimed at amending France’s constitution and changing the electoral register in New Caledonia to grant voting rights to residents who have settled there in the last decade, leaving the Indigenous people in fear of further erosion of their rights and erasure of their identity. The adoption of the controversial bill by both houses of the French Parliament in May led to mass demonstrations that turned violent, prompting Macron to declare a state of emergency and fly thousands of police and army reinforcements to the faraway territory. Thirteen people, mostly Kanaks, and two police officers were killed and nearly 3,000 people have been arrested. Among those detained in broad police raids were 11 Kanak activists with the pro-independence group known as The Field Action Coordination Unit, which has organized protests against French rule since April. Seven of the detained activists, including Christian Tein, a Kanak leader, were flown 17,000 kilometers (10,500 miles) away from home to seven prisons in mainland France for pretrial detention. Macron sidelined the controversial voting reform in June after he dissolved Parliament and called early legislative elections. France held three referendums in New Caledonia on independence between 2018 and 2021 as part of an agreement known as the Noumea Accords that followed a 1988 peace deal that ended violence between rival factions. A majority of voters chose to remain part of France instead of backing independence. The pro-independence Kanak people rejected the results of the last referendum in 2021, which they boycotted because it was held at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic that severely affected the Kanak community. ___ Associated Press writer Barbara Surk in Nice, France, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/france-new-caledonia-colonisation-anniversary-1f5102f1390a469ab4d01da4a3bb844a	2024-09-24T03:51:18-07:00	
Iran believes all remaining workers have died in coal mine explosion, raising death toll to 49	TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iran said Tuesday it believes the remaining workers trapped by an explosion at a coal mine in the country's east have died, bringing the death toll in one of its worst industrial disasters to at least 49. A provincial emergency official, Mohammad Ali Akhoundi, gave the death toll in a report carried by Iranian state television from the mine in Tabas. Figures for the numbers of miners inside the mine at the time have fluctuated since a methane gas leak Saturday sparked an explosion at the coal mine in Tabas, about 540 kilometers (335 miles) southeast of the capital, Tehran. Around 70 people had been working at the time of the blast. Bodies recovered so far showed no signs of blast injuries, suggesting many of the workers died from the gas before the blast. Such gases are common in mining, though modern safety measures call for ventilation and other measures to protect workers. It wasn’t immediately clear what safety procedures were in place at the privately owned Tabas Parvadeh 5 mine, operated by Mandanjoo Co. The firm could not be reached for comment. On Tuesday, a lawmaker and member of parliament's mine committee said the safety system of the mine was not working and 'even the central alarm system was broke or did not exist.' Lawmaker Zahra Saeedi added that workers learned of the safety issue just before the disaster but couldn't leave in time. Two of the dead were health and safety experts at the mine, she said. Iran’s new reformist president, Masoud Pezeshkian, in New York for the U.N. General Assembly, has said he ordered all efforts be made to rescue those trapped and aid their families. He also said an investigation into the explosion was underway. Iran’s mining industry has been struck by disasters before. In 2017, a coal mine explosion killed at least 42 people. Then-President Hassan Rouhani, campaigning ahead of winning reelection, visited the site in Iran’s northern Golestan province and angry miners besieged the SUV he rode in, kicking and beating the armored vehicle in a rage. In 2013, 11 workers were killed in two separate mining incidents. In 2009, 20 workers were killed in several incidents. Lax safety standards and inadequate emergency services in mining areas were often blamed for the fatalities.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-coal-mine-explosion-tabas-4bab4ae815fcaddfcdb4317c41473245	2024-09-24T03:06:06-07:00	
Floodwater reservoir becomes Poland's hero for preventing major flooding	WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Grateful Poles are heaping praise — and coming up with fond names — to honor their silent hero that just saved them: a floodwater reservoir that spared the cities of Opole and Wroclaw from imminent flooding that ravaged parts of Central Europe. 'National Hero,' the 'King of Gold' and 'Raciborz Reservoir the Great.' Some social media entries even suggest that the Lower Raciborz Reservoir floodplains should be named after Poland's famous goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny. Located on the Oder River, the anti-flood reservoir was built following lesson from the 1997 'flood of the century' that devastated the two cities. It took a decade and some 2 billion zlotys ($520 million) to build and two villages had to be resettled. Part of the funds came from the European Union and the World Bank. It opened in 2020 on some 26 square kilometers (10 square miles) of wildland, and has the capacity of holding 185 million cubic meters of floodwater. It passed the test by effectively flattening the Oder's giant flood wave as torrential rains inundated Central Europe this month. Mindful of the 1997 disaster, residents of Opole and Wroclaw watched with apprehension as the river was cresting to the brims — but never spilled into the streets or houses. Some places not covered by the Raciborz Reservoir system suffered heavy flooding as the amount of rain in just four days equaled a six-month volume.	https://apnews.com/article/poland-flood-wroclaw-oder-reservoir-b047703afff41a8b5747ad5efa793c6b	2024-09-24T02:41:05-07:00	
North Korea vows response to US submarine's visit to South Korea	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — The powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un vowed Tuesday to boost the country’s nuclear war capability and take other steps to protest the recent arrival of a nuclear-powered U.S. submarine in South Korea. North Korea has repeatedly vowed to expand its nuclear arsenal, but the latest threat by Kim Yo Jong came after North Korea dialed up regional tensions by unveiling a uranium-enrichment facility and testing a new ballistic missile earlier this month. In a statement carried by state media, Kim Yo Jong said that the submarine's visit 'clearly reveals the frantic military and strategic attempt of the U.S.' She said North Korea’s nuclear war deterrent must be bolstered 'both in quality and quantity continuously and limitlessly' in response. 'The U.S. strategic assets will never find their resting place in the region of the Korean Peninsula,' she said. 'We will continue to inform that all the ports and military bases of the ROK are not safe places.' ROK stands for the Republic of Korea, South Korea’s formal name. Her comments suggested North Korea may test-fire a missile whose range covers a South Korean site where the U.S. submarine is docked, some observers say. South Korea’s military said the USS Vermont, a nuclear-powered and fast-attack submarine, arrived at the southeastern South Korean port city of Busan on Monday to take on supplies and allow its crew to rest. Temporary deployments of powerful U.S. military assets like aircraft carriers, nuclear-powered submarines and bombers to South Korea are not unusual, but Washington has boosted them over the last year in a show of force against North Korea’s evolving nuclear threats. Pyongyang often responds furiously to such visits, calling them proof of hostile intentions, and reacts with missile tests. On Sept. 13, North Korea’s state media published photos of a secretive facility to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons. It was North Korea’s first unveiling of a uranium-enrichment facility since it showed one at the country’s main Yongbyon nuclear complex to visiting American scholars in 2010. Last week, North Korea tested a newly built ballistic missile designed to carry what it calls 'a 4.5-ton super-large conventional warhead' and a modified cruise missile. Since late May, North Korea has also floated thousands of trash-carrying balloons toward South Korea in a Cold War-style psychological campaign, prompting South Korea to restart anti-Pyongyang propaganda loudspeaker broadcasts at border areas. South Korea’s military warned on Tuesday of unspecified military action if the North pushes its balloon campaign to a point that seriously threatens the safety of South Korean civilians. Military spokesperson Lee Sung Joon didn’t say what action South Korea could take, but he reiterated that the military isn’t considering shooting down the balloons midair because they could be carrying hazardous substances. So far, North Korea’s balloon activities haven't caused serious damage. ___ Associated Press writer Kim Tong-hyung contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-kim-sister-nuclear-699257b1f32b1ff6b501c956e208d0ba	2024-09-24T02:06:39-07:00	
Turkish prosecutors charge 13 over Istanbul nightclub fire that killed 29	ISTANBUL (AP) — Prosecutors in Turkey have charged 13 public officials over a fire that killed 29 people at an Istanbul nightclub that was undergoing renovation, state-run media reported Tuesday. The defendants, who include current and former officials from the Besiktas municipality and fire service officers, face up to 17 years in prison for abuse of office and causing death through negligence, Anadolu news agency said. The blaze in April trapped workers and employees inside the Masquerade nightclub while it was closed for renovations. The venue was located on the ground and basement floors of a 16-story residential building in the Besiktas district on the European side of Istanbul. The indictment prepared by the Istanbul Chief Prosecutor’s Office identified discrepancies in safety checks and operating licenses granted to the nightclub’s management since 2006. The Istanbul 33rd High Criminal Court combined the case with the prosecution of nine other defendants, including the business owners, who were previously charged with similar offenses.	https://apnews.com/article/nightclub-fire-istanbul-besiktas-prosecutors-indictment-f3d0d3986274513c122e98de25bea408	2024-09-24T02:05:45-07:00	
Several people are detained in Switzerland in connection with suspected death in a 'suicide capsule'	GENEVA (AP) — Police in northern Switzerland said Tuesday that several people have been detained and a criminal case opened in connection with the suspected death of a person in a new 'suicide capsule.' The 'Sarco' suicide capsule, which has never been used before, is designed to allow a person sitting in a reclining seat inside to push a button that injects nitrogen gas into the sealed chamber. The person is then supposed to fall asleep and die by suffocation in a few minutes. Prosecutors in Schaffhausen canton were informed by a law firm that an assisted suicide involving the Sarco had taken place Monday near a forest cabin in Merishausen, regional police said in a statement. It said 'several people' were taken into custody and prosecutors opened an investigation on suspicion of incitement and accessory to suicide. Dutch newspaper Volkskrant reported Tuesday that police had detained one of its photographers who wanted to take pictures of the use of the Sarco. It said Schaffhausen police had indicated the photographer was being held at a police station but declined to give a further explanation. The newspaper declined to comment further when contacted by the AP. Exit International, an assisted suicide group based in the Netherlands, has said it is behind the 3D-printed device that cost over $1 million to develop. In a statement, the group said a 64-year-old woman from the U.S. Midwest — it did not specify further — who had suffered from 'severe immune compromise' had died Monday afternoon near the German border using the Sarco device. It said Florian Willet, co-president of The Last Resort, a Swiss affiliate of Exit International, was the only person present and described her death as 'peaceful, fast and dignified.' Dr. Philip Nitschke, an Australian-born trained doctor behind Exit International, has previously told the AP that his organization received advice from lawyers in Switzerland that use of the Sarco would be legal in the country. In the Exit International statement on Tuesday, Nitschke said he was 'pleased that the Sarco had performed exactly as it had been designed ... to provide an elective, non-drug, peaceful death at the time of the person’s choosing.' Swiss law allows assisted suicide so long as the person takes his or her life with no 'external assistance' and those who help the person die do not do so for 'any self-serving motive,' according to a government website. Switzerland is among the only countries in the world where foreigners can travel to legally end their lives, and is home to a number of organizations that are dedicated to helping people kill themselves. Some lawmakers in Switzerland have argued that the law is unclear and have sought to close what they call legal loopholes. On Monday, Health Minister Elisabeth Baume-Schneider was asked in Swiss parliament about the legal conditions for the use of the Sarco capsule, and suggested its use would not be legal. 'On one hand, it does not fulfill the demands of the product safety law, and as such, must not be brought into circulation,' she said. 'On the other hand, the corresponding use of nitrogen is not compatible with the article on purpose in the chemicals law.' ___ EDITOR’S NOTE — This story includes discussion of suicide. If you or someone you know needs help, the national suicide and crisis lifeline in the U.S. is available by calling or texting 988. There is also an online chat at 988lifeline.org. The Swiss government refers queries about suicide prevention to a group called 'Dargebotene Hand', or The Offered Hand. ___ In July, Swiss newspaper Blick reported that Peter Sticher, a state prosecutor in Schaffhausen, wrote to Exit International's lawyers saying any operator of the suicide capsule could face criminal proceedings if it was used there — and any conviction could bring up to five years in prison. Prosecutors in other Swiss regions have also indicated that use of the suicide capsule could lead to prosecution. Over the summer, a 54-year-old U.S. woman with multiple health ailments had planned to be the first person to use the device, but those plans were abandoned. ___ Associated Press writers Mike Corder in The Hague, Netherlands, and Geir Moulson in Berlin contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/switzerland-suicide-capsule-people-detained-06d38d708d8b8b4b771bb2df047adfd0	2024-09-24T01:35:14-07:00	
China says it will investigate fashion firm PVH for suspected boycott of Xinjiang products	BEIJING (AP) — China’s Commerce Ministry said Thursday that it will investigate the fashion company PVH, which owns brands like Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein, for suspected violations of trade rules. The ministry said Thursday in statements posted online that it would investigate the company’s suspected boycott of products from the far western Xinjiang region, where China’s ruling Communist Party is accused of holding members of mostly Muslim ethnic groups in detention camps. Washington has blocked some imports from Xinjiang, while Beijing has protested against such moves. China denies any abuses and says steps it has taken are necessary to combat terrorism and a separatist movement. Companies that buy clothing, cotton, tomatoes and other goods from Xinjiang face pressure from western consumers over alleged human rights violations in the region, while Beijing has whipped up Chinese anger at brands that express concern about possible forced labor. 'The U.S. PVH Group is suspected of violating normal market trading principles and unreasonably boycotting Xinjiang cotton and other products without factual basis, seriously damaging the legitimate rights and interests of relevant Chinese companies and endangering China’s sovereignty, security and development interests,' the Commerce Ministry said. PVH says in a statement on its website that it complies with laws and regulations wherever it does business, 'including with respect to U.S. government policy regarding the Xinjiang' region. The Commerce Ministry said the investigation would be under the rules of China's 'Unreliable Entities List,' which is used as a counter-sanction against measures taken against Beijing. PVH was expected, within 30 days of Tuesday's announcement, to provide information to China to explain if it had taken discriminatory measures against Xinjiang-related products in the past three years, it said.	https://apnews.com/article/pvh-hilfiger-china-xinjiang-trade-2f0f414f0fcc3fd432bc9229856ec21c	2024-09-24T01:33:29-07:00	
Israel and Hezbollah renew fire after the deadliest day in Lebanon since 2006	BEIRUT (AP) — Israel and Hezbollah traded strikes again Tuesday as the death toll from a massive Israeli bombardment climbed to nearly 560 people and thousands fled from southern Lebanon with the two sides on the brink of all-out war. Displaced families slept in shelters hastily set up in schools in Beirut and the coastal city of Sidon. With hotels quickly booked to capacity or rooms priced beyond the means of many families, those who did not find shelter slept in their cars, in parks or along the seaside. Issa Baydoun fled the village of Shihine in southern Lebanon when it came under bombing and came to Beirut in a convoy of cars with his extended family. They slept in the vehicles on the side of the road after discovering that the shelters were full. 'We struggled a lot on the road just to get here,' he said. Baydoun rejected Israel’s contention that it hit only military targets. 'We evacuated our homes because Israel is targeting civilians and attacking them,' he said. 'That’s why we left our homes, to protect our children.' Well-wishers offered up empty apartments or rooms in their houses in social media posts, while volunteers set up a kitchen at an empty gas station in Beirut to cook meals for the displaced. In the eastern city of Baalbek, the state-run National News Agency reported that lines formed at bakeries and gas stations as residents rushed to stock up on essential supplies in anticipation of another round of strikes on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the border crossing with Syria saw massive traffic jams as a result of people escaping from Lebanon to the neighboring country. The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah said it launched missiles overnight at eight sites in Israel, including an explosives factory in Zichron, 60 kilometers (37 miles) from the border. The Israeli military said Tuesday morning that 55 rockets were fired from Lebanon into northern Israel, setting fires and damaging buildings. Military officials said they carried out dozens of airstrikes on Hezbollah targets, including on a cell that fired rockets overnight, and that tanks and artillery struck targets near the border. Galilee Medical Center, a northern Israel hospital, said that two patients arrived with minor head injuries from a rocket falling near their car. Several others were being treated for light wounds from running to shelters and traffic accidents when alarms sounded. The renewed exchange came after Monday's barrages racked up the highest death toll in any single day in Lebanon since Israel and Hezbollah fought a bruising monthlong war in 2006. Israel said it targeted sites where Hezbollah had stored weapons. Data from American fire-tracking satellites analyzed Tuesday by The Associated Press showed the wide range of Israeli airstrikes aimed at southern Lebanon, covering an area of over 1,700 square kilometers (650 square miles). NASA’s Fire Information for Resource Management System typically is used to track wildfires across rural areas of the U.S. However, it can also be used to track the flashes and burning that follow airstrikes. That’s particularly true when an airstrike ignites flammable material on the ground, such as munitions or fuel. Data from Monday showed significant fires breaking out across southern Lebanon and in the Bekaa Valley. Several areas showed intense, multiple fires, including near the southern coastal town of Naqoura, which hosts a base for the U.N. peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon known as UNIFIL. Others were in mountainous rural areas or villages. The sides appear on the verge of war again after tensions have steadily escalated over the last 11 months. Hezbollah has been firing rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel in solidarity with the Palestinians and its ally Hamas, a fellow Iran-backed militant group, in Gaza. Israel has responded with increasingly heavy airstrikes and the targeted killing of Hezbollah commanders while threatening a wider operation. Thousands of Lebanese fled the southern part of the country on Monday after the Israeli military ordered people to evacuate areas where it accuses Hezbollah of positioning rocket launchers and other weapons, in the biggest exodus since the monthlong war waged 18 years ago. The Lebanese Health Ministry said the strikes since Monday killed at least 558 people, including 50 children and 94 women, and wounded more than 1,800 people — a staggering one-day toll for a country still reeling from a deadly attack on communication devices last week. Nearly a year of cross-border fire had already emptied out communities near the border, displacing tens of thousands of people on both sides. Israel has vowed to do whatever it takes to ensure its citizens can return to their homes in the north, while Hezbollah has said it will keep up its rocket attacks until there is a cease-fire in Gaza, which appears increasingly remote. The Israeli military says it has no immediate plans for a ground invasion but is prepared for one, after moving thousands of troops who had been serving in Gaza to the northern border. It says Hezbollah has launched some 9,000 rockets and drones into Israel since last October, including 250 on Monday alone. The military said Israeli warplanes struck 1,600 Hezbollah targets Monday, destroying cruise missiles, long- and short-range rockets and attack drones, including weapons concealed in private homes. Lebanese officials have said many of the victims were civilians, including more than 90 women and children killed. Israel estimates Hezbollah has some 150,000 rockets and missiles, including guided missiles and long-range projectiles capable of striking anywhere in Israel. Monday's escalation came after a particularly heavy exchange of fire Sunday. Hezbollah launched around 150 rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel in retaliation for strikes that killed a top commander and dozens of fighters. Last week, thousands of communications devices, used mainly by Hezbollah members, exploded in different parts of Lebanon, killing 39 people and wounding nearly 3,000, many of them civilians. Lebanon blamed Israel, but Israel did not confirm or deny responsibility. ___ Associated Press writers Jon Gambrell in Dubai, Bassem Mroue and Fadi Tawil in Beirut and Julia Frankel in Jerusalem contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-gaza-news-09-24-2024-640a0046aceea1b5cfb395a54ff36bce	2024-09-24T00:24:58-07:00	
Tropical Storm John strikes Mexico’s southern Pacific coast with 'life-threatening' flood potential	PUERTO ESCONDIDO, Mexico (AP) — Tropical Storm John struck Mexico’s southern Pacific coast with life-threatening flood potential after growing into a major hurricane in a matter of hours. It came ashore near the town of Punta Maldonado late Monday night as a Category 3 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 120 mph (190 kph). It weakened back to tropical storm status early Tuesday with maximum sustained wind speeds of 70 mph (110 kph) and was expected to weaken rapidly. Still, the United States National Hurricane Center warned that the storm’s slow pace and heavy rains could cause potentially catastrophic flash flooding and mudslides in some Mexican states. 'Seek higher ground, protect yourselves and do not forget that life is the most important thing; material things can be replaced. We are here,' Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador wrote on the social media platform X. The storm was expected to batter Punta Maldonado and the nearby tourist hubs Acapulco and Puerto Escondido before being weakened over the high terrain inland. The center said heavy rainfall over coastal southwest Mexico through the week was likely to cause 'significant and possible catastrophic, life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides' in parts of Chiapas, Oaxaca, and Guerrero states. Monday's unexpected surge in strength caught scientists, authorities and residents of the area by surprise, something AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Matt Benz attributed to warmer oceans, which add fuel to hurricanes. As a result, surprise surges in hurricanes' strength have become increasingly common, Benz said. 'These are storms that we haven’t really experienced before,' he said. 'Rapid intensification has occurred more frequently in modern times as opposed to back in the historical record. So that’s telling us there’s something going on there.' Residents were tense in Oaxaca’s coastal cities as the forecast shifted and authorities responded. Laura Velázquez, the federal coordinator of civil protection, told residents of Pacific coastal cities they should evacuate their homes and head to shelters in order to 'protect theirs and their family's lives.' 'It's very important that all citizens in the coastal zone … take preventive measures,' Velázquez said. Ana Aldai, a 33-year-old employee of a restaurant on the shores of the tourist hub Puerto Escondido, said businesses in the area began closing after authorities ordered the suspension of all work on the area's main beaches. The governments of Guerrero and Oaxaca states said classes would be suspended Tuesday in a number of coastal zones. Oaxaca's governor said the state government evacuated 3,000 people and set up 80 shelters. It also said it sent out 1,000 military and state personnel to address the emergency. Videos on social media from Puerto Escondido showed flip-flop-clad tourists walking through heavy rain and fishers pulling their boats out of the water. Strong rains in previous days have already left some roads in the region in a precarious position. The storm is bleak news for the region, which was walloped by Otis, a similar rapidly intensifying hurricane, in 2023. Otis devastated the resort city of Acapulco, where residents had little warning of the strength of what was about to hit them. One of the most rapidly intensifying hurricanes ever seen, scientists at the time said it was a product of changing climate conditions. Otis blew out power in the city for days, left bodies scattered on the coast and desperate family members searching for lost loved ones. Much of the city was left in a state of lawlessness and thousands scavenged in stores, scrambled for food and water. The government of López Obrador received harsh criticism for its slow response to Otis, but authorities have since pledged to pick up their speed. President-elect Claudia Sheinbaum said her government planned to work on improving an early alert system, similar to what the country has with earthquakes. Through Thursday, John is expected to produce 15 to 30 centimeters (6 to 12 inches) of rain across coastal areas of Chiapas state with more in isolated areas. In areas along and near the Oaxaca coast to southeast Guerrero, between 25 and 50 centimeters (10 and 20 inches) of rain with isolated higher totals can be expected through Thursday. 'You’re going to feel the impacts of the storm probably for the next couple of weeks to a couple of months,' meteorologist Benz added. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-john-mexico-pacific-b56193c39433fa96cd06d83ae2228157	2024-09-23T22:25:58-07:00	
Two tales from one city show the challenges Pope Francis faces to retain his flock in Europe	HALLE, Belgium (AP) — The congregation at the Don Bosco church solemnly took the holy host after it was blessed during a Sunday service by Nancy Speeckaert — a woman. Only a week earlier, to equal excitement, she had also blessed a wedding. On both occasions, the humble neighborhood church was filled to near capacity with generations of joyous faithful. And if a key tenet of Catholic doctrine was breached by a woman celebrating the sacrament, it was all covered by a coat of religious love. Two miles southwest, in the center of the same town of 44,000 near Brussels, less than half of Halle's big Saint Martin's Basilica was filled for Sunday's main Mass, where within minutes of the liturgy starting, words about guilt and calls of 'go away, Satan' echoed among the stone pillars. Pope Francis will be visiting Belgium from Thursday to Sunday, facing a flock ravaged by countless scandals of priest sexual abuse and dwindling in the face of modernity, where women and gay people insist on an equal role and rights. For years now, progressive Don Bosco had increasingly sought its own way and in March, the Flemish Brabant Mechelen vicarship said it could no longer function as a Catholic parish 'partly because of the different views on the celebration of the sacraments.' The Catholic leadership, however, allowed the Don Bosco community to continue its activities in the church as it prepares to become 'an independent religious community.' 'They were coloring outside the lines,' admonished the Rev. Guy De Keersmaecker, the Catholic priest working beyond retirement age to take on the more orthodox but dwindling Saint Martin's parish. 'Come on. In our church, we do have something like a constitution.' At Don Bosco, the community feels it needs fixing, countered Speeckaert. 'We have a lawyer in our group who said a constitution may have been written once, but we always must consider whether it needs change to improve society and the world,' she said. Coming off a trip to sweltering Southeast Asia, where churches are full and Francis drew record-setting crowds, a European homecoming in this once overwhelmingly Catholic nation, where some churches have now turned into sports clubs or fashion shops, might feel a lot colder for Francis. 'Parish without a Pope' In the back of Don Bosco, retired priest Rik Deville is still a regular in the parish he molded, decades after he decried the Catholic Church in his 1992 book 'The Last Dictatorship.' With his call for 'a parish without a pope' he reaped a whirlwind of criticism from bishops, right up to the Vatican. To his amazement though, he had broken through another barrier. People started calling him up, and broke down over the phone reliving long-suppressed memories of sexual abuse and rape by priests and clergy. 'One person after another, and then another — and then another,' he remembers. He became a torchbearer for those victims. What had often been rumors of rampant abuse gained credibility in a groundswell of scandal that engulfed priests, bishops the nation's cardinal who was once tipped as a papal candidate. Each time the abuse and cover-up proved more deep-seated than previously thought, a pattern seen across many of Europe's most devout nations like Ireland, Spain and Poland. Within his Human Rights in the Church group alone, 'we wrote around the year 2000 that we had a lot of files — 84 — and I thought it was a lot. Now we are running up to 2,000, some 1,950 children that have been abused in this little speck of land,' he said. 'At first, I went to the cardinal,' said Deville. 'Nothing happened. He knew nothing. Could do nothing. Or wrote: ‘I prayed for you.’' When Bruges Bishop Roger Vangheluwe admitted with little apparent remorse in 2010 that he had sexually abused his nephew, the Vatican imposed no stern punishment. Pope Francis only defrocked him earlier this year — 14 years later — in a move widely seen as a bid to stem criticism ahead of his visit. The pope will be meeting with abuse victims in private during his trip. But Deville said he has seen how a small number are being handpicked, expecting they will not cause a stir. 'The pope has been in so many nations where there has been a clamor over sexual abuse — Ireland, Canada and others. Each time, here too, he will address victims, a tap on the shoulder. We will pray for you. A rosary as gift,' Deville said. 'The pope will get on the plane and the file will remain as is.' 'Careful he is as the captain' During all those years, church attendance sank throughout most of Europe and Belgium — certainly in Saint Martin's, where a decades-long renovation restored the splendor of stone but hardly filled the pews. Priest De Keersmaecker knows what is wrong. 'The situation is totally changed now. We have had the whole sexual abuse scandal and the Vangheluwe case,' he said. 'It has left deep scars in our church.' Yet, unlike Deville, he is sticking with the Vatican, Pope Francis and with Mass celebrations that easily fill pensioners with memories of their youth. 'The pope is someone who doesn't let go of the core of our religion. So, yes, careful — careful he is as the captain of the ship of the church which is going through rough waters.' These days only 8.9% of Belgians go to Mass at least once a month. No figures for weekly attendance, so long the standard, were immediately available. De Keersmaecker said he would like to see more progressive elements, including for women, but Europe is held back by others. 'It is something that needs to be looked at. We are within a global church and there are regions and continents where it is still not thought possible,' he said, calling for 'loyalty with the wider Catholic community,' which Don Bosco refused to show. Speeckaert was only drawn into an ever bigger role at Don Bosco because when Deville retired in 2009, there simply was no one to replace him. Since the days when every parish had its priest, Belgium is increasingly hard-pressed to find men who want to be priests. In a nation of 11 million, only 9 were ordained as priests in 2022. Don Bosco took it step by step, literally putting on paper how it wanted to celebrate Mass. 'We practiced behind closed doors how to do it all,' said Speeckaert. And gradually, commitments and involvement grew until suddenly it included women celebrating the sacraments. 'I never had the feeling that I was passing over a threshold because it all came gradually,' she said. For church authorities, action came late, long after they seemed to accommodate the wayward parish. Speeckaert said they might have brought on their own expulsion when they started confronting church authorities. 'We felt a more strict line was coming and that a number of things amounted to infringements on human rights.' With the expulsion as a parish, which is to be complete by the end of next year, Don Bosco said it will miss out on 60,000 euros of funds a year while it remains unclear exactly what they can do with the church building. Speeckaert hoped it could have been different. 'I am rather naive and believe in the kindness of people and thought: Come on, they will dare to do it! And they didn't,' she said. 'It hit me hard.' There will be a service in Don Bosco — with a woman presiding — at the very minute Pope Francis holds mass for 35,000 at the King Baudouin stadium Sept. 29. If the pope draws some faithful away, Speeckaert won't mind. 'It is not because people think more conservatively that we cannot deal with it.' 'Everyone can do their own thing in their own way.'	https://apnews.com/article/belgium-pope-bf42fb22867649ce7b14a06311656f41	2024-09-23T21:17:48-07:00	
Israel-Hamas war latest: Two-day death toll from Israeli strikes in Lebanon reaches 564	Lebanese health authorities on Tuesday raised the death toll from two days of Israeli airstrikes targeting Hezbollah militants to 564. Palestinian officials in Gaza, meanwhile, said new Israeli strikes killed at least two dozen people. Israel’s military says it will do 'whatever is necessary' to push Hezbollah away from Lebanon’s border with Israel. Israel and Hezbollah have been trading fire since the Israel-Hamas war began. On Monday, Israel launched hundreds of airstrikes in southern and eastern Lebanon, killing nearly 500 people and wounding more than 1,600 others. Thousands of people fled southern Lebanon, jamming the main highway to Beirut in the biggest exodus since the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war. It's a staggering toll for a country still reeling from a deadly attack on communication devices the week before. Lebanon blamed the attacks on Israel, but Israel did not confirm or deny its responsibility. Hezbollah again launched some 100 projectiles toward Israel on Tuesday, the Israeli military said. ___ Here’s the latest: Iran's president urges the U.S. to begin a new era of relations with Iran TEHRAN, Iran — Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian urged the U.S. to begin a new era in its relations with Iran. While criticizing the U.S. military presence in Iran’s neighborhood, the U.S. sanctions against Iran, and the killing of Iranian top Gen. Qassem Soleimani in 2020, Pezeshkian said during his speech at the U.N. General Assembly, 'We can go beyond these limits and begin a new era. The new era begins by recognizing Iran’s security concerns as well as joint work on joint issues.' He said his message addresses all governments that follow unconstructive strategies toward Iran. Pezeshkian said despite the bitterness of years of sanctions, Iran has achieved strong will and self-confidence and is ready to work with the world, 'Iran is ready to have economic, political and security equal-base cooperation for building a better world with world powers and neighbors.' He said Iran expects that the world does not answer Iran’s message for cooperation by imposing more sanctions, 'Implementations of (world) commitments for lifting sanctions, improving the economic situation for people of Iran, paving the ground for more agreements.' Pezeshkian also urged the international community to work toward a permanent cease-fire as soon as possible and to 'stop Israeli insane brutality in Lebanon before it sets the region and the world on fire.' Pezeshkian reiterated that his country is against the Russia-Ukraine war and supports any peaceful solution to end the war and added that Iran 'believes that this crisis will end only through dialogue.' Israeli airstrikes in the Nuseirat refugee camp in Gaza injure many, including children DEIR AL BALAH, the Gaza Strip — Israeli airstrikes in Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza left multiple Palestinians injured, including children, who were rushed to Awda and Al-Aqsa hospitals. AP footage shows two children with face injuries rushed inside Al-Aqsa hospital, while a man lying on a stretcher inside an ambulance was wailing in pain as two other men were lying face down. Several children were brought in with injuries to their legs and faces. At the hospital morgue, a mother is seen crying and bidding farewell to her twin sons, Osama and Bilal Fayad, two young men who were killed in the strikes in Nuseirat. 'I raised those two boys.. they were killed together after being struck,' said their father Ahmed Fayad. 'They were born together and died together.' Over a dozen people gathered outside the hospital to perform a funeral prayer as the bodies of the twins were in front of them on the ground wrapped in white shrouds before they were loaded onto a motorbike to be taken for burial. The strike that killed the Fayad twins in Nuseirat camp also killed three women and injured over 20 people were also injured, according to Awda hospital, where they were taken. The Israeli strikes in Nuseirat and Bureij camps on Tuesday killed a total of 29 Palestinians, including 14 children and 6 women, hospital officials told the AP. Israel's military identifies 3 drones crossing from Lebanon into Israel TEL AVIV — The Israeli military says three drones were identified crossing from Lebanon into Israel a short while ago, setting off sirens in coastal towns just south of Haifa — more than 50 km (31 miles) from the border with Lebanon. It said two of the drones were intercepted. There were no reports of injuries. Altogether, more than 300 projectiles have been launched today from Lebanon at northern Israel, according to the Israeli military. The army said strikes will continue in Lebanon. In the last two hours, Israeli jets carried out a 'number of extensive strikes' on targets in the Bekaa region and in southern Lebanon, according to the army, hitting rocket launchers and infrastructure that the army says was used to store weapons. Turkey's president accuses Israel of carrying out ‘a clear genocide’ and calls on UN to impose sanctions UNITED NATIONS — Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly he wanted to state 'loudly and clearly' that the Israeli government is disregarding human rights, trampling on international law, and 'is practicing ethnic cleansing' against the Palestinians. He also accused Israel at Tuesday’s opening of the annual global gathering of carrying out 'a clear genocide against a nation a people, and occupying their lands, step by step.' 'Israel’s behavior has once again demonstrated that it is imperative for the international community to develop a protection mechanism for Palestinian civilians,' Erdogan said. '70 years ago, just as Hitler was stopped by an alliance of humanity, (Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu and his murder network must be stopped, must be stopped by an alliance of humanity.' Israel’s U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon called Erdogan’s remarks 'shameful' and told reporters the reference to Hitler is 'beyond imagination.' Erdogan called for the Security Council to impose 'coercive measures against Israel' – U.N. language for sanctions – and said the General Assembly should recommend the use of force to achieve an immediate cease-fire in Gaza, the exchange of prisoners, and the unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid. In language aimed at Israel’s supporters, especially the United States, Erdogan said their backing 'is the reason why this aggression is still going on' in Gaza. While 'supposedly working for a cease-fire,' he said, they continue to send arms and ammunition to Israel. The U.S., Qatar and Egypt have been working for months for a cease-fire in Gaza, and the United States has blamed Hamas for refusing the latest deal. But Erdogan claimed it’s Israel 'that doesn’t want peace, by constantly dragging its feet making a settlement much more difficult, almost impossible.' Israel's UN envoy says Israel does not want to send troops into Lebanon but will do what is necessary to halt Hezbollah fire UNITED NATIONS — Israel’s envoy to the U.N. says his country doesn’t want to send troops into Lebanon but will do 'whatever necessary' to halt the Hezbollah rocket fire that has driven tens of thousands of Israelis from their country’s north. Asked during at a news conference Tuesday at U.N. headquarters whether Israel was contemplating a ground invasion of its northern neighbor, Ambassador Danny Danon said his country is 'not eager to start any ground invasion anywhere.' 'We prefer a diplomatic solution. But if it’s not working, we are using other methods to show the other side that we mean business,' he said. 'We will do whatever necessary to bring the residents back to the north,' he added. He spoke in a week that has seen rapid intensification of hostilities between Israel and the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah, including a wave of Israeli airstrikes that killed more than 550 Lebanese on Monday. At the same time, Israel is nearly a year into its fight with Hamas militants in Gaza. The war was launched in response to Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack but has drawn criticism from many countries for the extent of death, destruction and suffering in the Palestinian territory. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu still plans to come to the U.N. to speak Friday at the General Assembly’s annual meeting of world leaders, Danon said. But he noted that 'things are dynamic,' and an update on Netanyahu’s plans could come Wednesday. Israel's Defense Minister says forces are ready to carry out more strikes after Hezbollah suffers ‘extremely severe blows’ TEL AVIV — Israel’s Defense Minister said Tuesday that Hezbollah has suffered 'extremely severe blows' and Israel has 'more strikes ready.' Speaking to troops after an IDF drill that simulated a ground offensive in Lebanon, Yoav Gallant said 'The Hezbollah of today is not the Hezbollah of a week ago. The sequence of blows it faced in its command and control, its operatives, its weapons -- all these things are extremely severe blows.' Mourners carry bodies through streets in Lebanon, some draped in Hezbollah flags SAKSAKIEH, Lebanon — In the Lebanese village of Saksakieh, some 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of the Lebanon-Israel border, mourners carried 11 bodies through the streets Tuesday, including those of four women, an infant and a 7-year old girl. All had been killed in Israel’s bombardment of the village the day before. Israeli strikes killed more than 560 people across Lebanon in two days. Some of the bodies were draped in Hezbollah flags, others wrapped in black clothes. A wreath of flowers had been placed on top of the smallest one. Mohammad Halal, the father of 7-year-old Joury Halal, said his daughter was an 'innocent child martyr.' 'She is a martyr for the sake of the south and Palestine,' Halal said and defiantly stated his allegiance to Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. US officials in talks with allies to de-escalate tensions between Israel and Hezbollah NEW YORK — White House principal deputy national security adviser Jon Finer said Tuesday that Biden administration officials were in talks with allies to help find an off-ramp to the escalating tensions between Israel and Hezbollah. 'We’re working on that in real time right here in New York and in capitals around the world,' Finer said in an appearance at an event hosted by the news site Axios on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York. 'We’re not going to reveal all the details of those sensitive conversations, but we very much want that conflict to de-escalate.' Finer sidestepped questions about whether the fighting has already become the all-out war that the U.S. had been pressing Israel to avoid with Lebanon as it continues its nearly yearlong conflict in Gaza. But he underscored that a 'big war, a wider war' is in neither Israel’s nor Lebanon’s interest. A new airstrike in central Gaza kills 10 people, hospital says DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Another Israeli airstrike in a central Gaza refugee camp on Tuesday killed 10 Palestinians, including four people from the same family, and injured 11 others, according to Al-Awda Hospital. The strike hit a house in the Nuseirat refugee camp, where six people including three women were killed in an earlier airstrike. The dead and wounded were taken to Al-Awda Hospital. Israeli military says it killed a top commander in Hezbollah missile unit JERUSALEM — The Israeli military says it has killed a commander with Hezbollah’s missile and rocket unit in a strike in Beirut. It said Ibrahim Kobeisi, who it said was responsible for launches toward Israel, was killed Tuesday. The military said 'other key commanders' were with Kobeisi at the time of the strike, but it did not say whether any of them had been killed or injured. Lebanese woman working for the UNHCR, her son and a cleaner killed in Israeli airstrikes, the UN agency says BEIRUT — The U.N. refugee agency in Lebanon says a Lebanese woman who had been working for the agency for 12 years, one of her sons and a cleaner employed by the agency have been killed in Israeli airstrikes. The building where Dina Darwiche lived with her family was hit in a strike on Lebanon's Bekaa region on Monday, UNHCR said. Her husband and another child were seriously injured. Her body and that of her younger son were recovered from the rubble on Tuesday. Ali Basma, who worked as a cleaner for the agency for seven years, was killed in a separate strike in the south. He worked at UNHCR’s office in the city of Tyre. The U.N. refugee agency said it was 'outraged and deeply saddened by the killing of two beloved members of the UNHCR family in Lebanon.' It said the protection of civilians is a must under international humanitarian law. An Israeli airstrike hits a building in southern Beirut, Hezbollah's TV station says BEIRUT — An Israeli airstrike hit a building in a southern Beirut suburb on Tuesday afternoon, a Hezbollah TV station reported. There was no immediate word on casualties. Later, Israel’s military said it had carried out a 'targeted strike' in Beirut, without elaborating. Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency said 'a number of people' were injured in the strike , which destroyed three floors of a six-story apartment building. Al-Manar TV, which belongs to Lebanon’s militant Hezbollah group, said the strike occurred in the suburb of Ghobeiri, without giving any details. The attack came after a Monday evening airstrike missed Ali Karaki, Hezbollah's top military commander in south Lebanon, the group said. An Israeli airstrike on a nearby area on Friday killed 55 people, including top Hezbollah military commander Ibrahim Akil and 15 other Hezbollah members. Israeli military reports 10 more rockets fired from Lebanon JERUSALEM — Israel’s military said on Tuesday afternoon that 10 more rockets from Lebanon were fired into Israeli territory, injuring a reservist and raining shrapnel onto a road in northern Israel. The rockets came in two volleys, the first targeting the Upper Galilee area and the second an area south of Haifa known as Eliakim. Rocket fragments from a rocket that was intercepted injured the Israeli soldier, the military said. Hezbollah said it had fired middle-range rockets at an Israeli army position in Eliakim. Israel’s military has now said that there have been at least 110 rockets fired into Israeli territory from Lebanon since Tuesday morning. Israeli strikes on the other side of the border have killed over 550 people since Monday. Another Israeli strike in central Gaza kills at least 6 people, including 3 women, Gaza medics say DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip— Palestinian medical officials say an Israeli airstrike hit a family house in central Gaza on Tuesday afternoon, killing at least six people, including three women . The strike occurred in the Nuseirat refugee camp and also wounded 21 others, according to the Awda hospital in the camp, where the casualties were taken. Footage circulated online showing a woman screaming and rushing to a building that was hit. A man was seen lying on the ground, without moving and bleeding from his head. There were several other people lying on the ground nearby. Lebanon's health ministry raises two-day death toll from Israeli strikes to 558 BEIRUT — Lebanon’s Health Ministry said on Tuesday that the death toll from Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon over the past two days of escalation has reached 558, including 50 children and 94 women. Health Minister Firass Abiad told reporters that 1,835 people have also been wounded since early Monday. They were taken to 54 hospitals around Lebanon, he said. Abiad added that four paramedics were among those killed, and 16 paramedics and firefighters were among the wounded. A journalist working for a pan-Arab television is killed in an Israeli airstrike in southern Lebanon, the station says BEIRUT — A journalist working for the pan-Arab network Al-Mayadeen was killed in Israeli airstrikes while he was at his home in southern Lebanon, the network said Tuesday. Hadi Al-Sayyed, 22, is the third journalist from the network killed in the ongoing conflict between the Israeli military and Lebanon's militant Hezbollah group. The network said he was wounded on Monday and died of his wounds on Tuesday. According to the TV station, Al-Sayyed worked for the Al-Mayadeen’s online section and was at his house in the town of Burj Rahhal near the southern city of Tyre when it was hit in the airstrike. Last November, Al-Mayadeen's correspondent Farah Omar and cameraman Rabih Al-Maamari were killed in an Israeli strike while covering southern Lebanon. Reuters video journalist Issam Abdallah was killed in Israeli shelling last October while covering the clashes alongside colleagues from the news agency as well as reporters from Qatar’s Al-Jazeera TV and France’s international news agency, Agence France-Presse. His colleagues were all wounded but survived the attack. Bombardment from Lebanon hits supermarket in Arab town in northern Israel JERUSALEM — Bombardment from Lebanon on Tuesday damaged a supermarket in Israel’s Arab city of Tamra, where the majority of residents are Palestinian citizens of Israel. The attack spread fear through the community, which has no shelters. It was not immediately clear whether the supermarket was hit by a rocket that permeated Israel’s missile defense system or by shrapnel falling from an interception. 'I came here immediately to see what exactly happened,' said Jamal Diab, a friend of the market’s owner. 'I saw here lots of damage.' Tamra has no shelters, according to its mayor, Mousa Abu Rumi. An Israeli state comptroller’s report found in 2018 that only 11 out of 71 Arab local communities have public shelters. He told The Associated press that Tamra's residents have been instructed to find 'the most protected place' nearby to seek shelter when they hear rocket sirens go off. A hospital in central Gaza says it received bodies of two Palestinian children killed in Israeli airstrikes on Tuesday DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — A hospital in central Gaza said the bodies of two children killed in an Israeli airstrike on Tuesday were brought there. The Awda hospital in the Nuseirat refugee camp said the strike hit a group of people in the nearby Bureij camp, and also wounded six other Palestinians. The Health Ministry in the coastal territory, meanwhile, said Gaza’s hospitals received 12 dead and 43 wounded Palestinians over the last 24 hours. The latest fatalities brought the overall death toll in Gaza since the war began on Oct. 7 to 41,467, and 95,921 wounded, said the ministry, which doesn’t differentiate between combatants and civilians in its count. Israel's military says 100 rockets fired from Lebanon since early morning in second day of intense escalation JERUSALEM — Israel’s military said that 100 rockets had been fired from Lebanon into northern Israel since the early hours of Tuesday morning, setting several fires and damaging buildings in the country’s north in the second day of much-intensified hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah. The rockets came in five volleys throughout the morning, the largest of them containing 50 rockets toward the Upper Galilee area. The military said it had struck the launchers where the rockets were fired. Another heavily-targeted area was southeast of the Israeli city of Haifa. Rocket sirens blared throughout the morning in the country’s north. A video circulating on Israeli media showed explosions on a highway, with drivers pulling over and lying on the ground next to their vehicles. Galilee Medical Center, a northern Israel hospital, said that two patients arrived to the hospital with minor head injuries from a rocket falling near their car. Several others were being treated for light wounds from running to shelters and traffic accidents when alarms sounded. Hezbollah has been sending heavy volleys of rockets into Israel as Israel intensifies its operation in Lebanon. In Monday, Israeli strikes killed nearly 500 people, Lebanese health officials say, and Israel’s military ordered the south of the country evacuated. Southern Lebanese families find shelters farther north as they flee violence near the border BEIRUT — Lebanese families displaced from villages farther south slept in shelters hastily set up in schools in Beirut and the coastal city of Sidon. Some who did not find shelter elsewhere slept in cars and parks and on the seaside corniche. Monday’s heavy bombardment sent thousands fleeing from south Lebanon. Hotels in Beirut were quickly booked to capacity and apartments in the mountains surrounding the capital were snapped up by families seeking safe accommodations. Some offered up empty apartments or rooms in their houses in social media posts, while volunteers set up a kitchen at an empty gas station in Beirut to cook meals for the displaced. In the eastern city of Baalbek, the state-run National News Agency reported that lines formed at bakeries and gas stations as residents rushed to stock up on essential supplies in anticipation of another round of strikes on Tuesday. Satellite data shows a wide range of Israeli airstrikes targeted southern Lebanon DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Data from fire-tracking satellites used by the United States showed the wide range of Israeli airstrikes that target southern Lebanon, an Associated Press analysis Tuesday showed. NASA’s Fire Information for Resource Management System typically is used by experts to track wildfires across rural areas of the U.S. However, they also can be used to track the flashes and burning that follow airstrikes. That’s particularly true when an airstrike ignites flammable material on the ground, like munitions or fuel. On Monday, Israel launched hundreds of airstrikes in southern and eastern Lebanon, killing nearly 500 people and wounding more than 1,600 others. Thousands of people fled southern Lebanon, jamming the main highway to Beirut in the biggest exodus since the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war. Data from Monday show significant fires breaking out across southern Lebanon, stretching from the border with Israel as far north as Mashghara in the Bekaa Valley, some 20 kilometers (more than 10 miles) from the border. The area of the strikes is over 1,700 square kilometers (650 square miles). There were several areas that showed multiple, intense fires. One was near the southern coastal town of Naqoura, which hosts a base for the United Nations peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon known as UNIFIL. Others were in rural areas or villages. Since its creation at the start of Israel’s occupation of Lebanon from 1982 to 2000, the Shiite militia Hezbollah is believed to have stockpiled weapons and missiles throughout southern Lebanon as a deterrent to Israel. United States Embassy in Jerusalem restricts employees from traveling to Israel's north JERUSALEM — The United States Embassy in Jerusalem has restricted American government employees from traveling to Israel’s north after a heavy exchange of fire between Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah militant group. The embassy said Tuesday that employees require an armored vehicle and prior approval to travel to a large region of the north that includes the bustling coastal city of Haifa. The U.S. State Department meanwhile urged American citizens to leave the country, where Israeli strikes killed nearly 500 people on Monday. Israeli strikes kill at least 7 in Khan Younis DEIR-Al-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Palestinian officials say Israel’s strikes early Tuesday killed at least seven people in Gaza’s southern city of Khan Younis. At least 15 others, including women and children, were injured in the strikes, they said. The civil defense said the dead include five people who were killed in a strike on the Abu Harb family house in the Qizan al-Najjar area. The strike also wounded at least 10 others, it said. Another strike hit a house in the Tahlia area in Khan Younis, killing at least two people and wounding five others, according to the rescue service. The casualties from both strikes were confirmed in hospital records in Khan Younis. Israel says it tries to avoid harming civilians but rarely comments on individual strikes. Gaza’s Health Ministry says over 41,000 Palestinians have been killed since the start of the war. It does not say how many were fighters, but says a little over half were women and children. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Around 100 of the captives are still being held in Gaza, and a third of them are believed to be dead. Airlines in the United Arab Emirates and Egypt cancel flights to Lebanon Airlines in the United Arab Emirates, a key East-West travel hub, canceled flight Tuesday to Lebanon over the ongoing cross-border fire between Israel and Hezbollah. Long-haul carriers Emirates and Etihad canceled flights, as did FlyDubai, the low-cost carrier. The United Arab Emirates, which reached a diplomatic recognition deal with Israel in 2020, is home to a large Lebanese population. Egypt’s flagship airliner also canceled its flights to Lebanon on Tuesday. EgyptAir operates two flights daily between Cairo and Beirut. It said the cancellation will stay in place until 'the signal stabilizes.' Also Tuesday, Israeli media reported that Wizz Air, British Airways, Iberia and Azerbaijan Airlines were among several airlines to cancel flights to Israel’s major airport, Ben-Gurion airport in Tel Aviv.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-hamas-latest-mideast-24-september-2024-a3377b1ade42c9a314bd48561395596b	2024-09-23T20:38:14-07:00	
Japan asks China to ensure the safety of Japanese citizens after a schoolboy was fatally stabbed	TOKYO (AP) — Japan’s top diplomat asked China to ensure the safety of Japanese citizens there after the fatal stabbing of a Japanese schoolboy, and demanded a crackdown on what she called 'groundless, malicious and anti-Japanese' social media posts that threaten children's safety. Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa requested her Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, conduct a full investigation into the stabbing and provide a clear explanation to Japan about what happened, and to punish the suspect and implement preventive measures for the future. Kamikawa said Beijing should take concrete steps to ensure safety of Japanese residents, especially children, in China, according to Japan’s Foreign Ministry. The two ministers met in New York on Monday on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly meeting. The 10-year-old boy was stabbed on Sept. 18 near the gate of the Shenzhen Japanese School. The attacker, identified as a 44-year-old man, was arrested on the spot and is being investigated, according to Chinese officials. No motive for the attack was immediately clear. Kamikawa has said the attack occurred despite Tokyo’s request to Beijing for increased security for Japanese citizens and around Japanese schools ahead of the Sept. 18 anniversary of the Mukden Incident in 1931, which China marks as the beginning of the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, now northeast China. Kamikawa also told Wang that 'groundless, malicious and anti-Japanese social media postings and others, including those targeting Japanese schools, directly affect the safety of children and are absolutely unacceptable,' demanding China a thorough crackdown as soon as possible, according to a ministry statement. Wang said the stabbing was an 'accidental, individual case' and that China would handle the case under the law, the ministry said. It said Kamikawa and Wang agreed to further cooperate to achieve progress on the issues as soon as possible. Safety concerns are rising among the Japanese business community in China. Vice Foreign Minister Yoshifumi Tsuge was in Beijing on Monday for talks with his counterpart, Sun Weidong, and conveyed a similar message of concern. Tsuge then met with representatives of the Japanese business community to hear their thoughts on safely operating in China. Tsuge said Japan is spending 43 million yen ($300,000) to urgently beef up security around Japanese schools and their bus stops during commuting hours, and plans to seek additional budget to staff security guards on Japanese school buses. Tetsuro Honma, head of Panasonic Holdings Corp.’s Chinese subsidiary and head of the Japanese Chamber Commerce and Industry in China, told Tsuge that the latest stabbing, in addition to an earlier case in June, were extremely regrettable, according to the ministry. Honma said ensuring the safety of employees and their families is crucial for Japanese companies operating in China. On June 24th, a knife attack at a school bus stop for a Japanese school in the southeastern city of Suzhou killed a Chinese national who was trying to stop the attacker and injured a Japanese mother and her child. Earlier in June, a Chinese man stabbed four U.S. university instructors at a public park in Jilin in the northeast and a Chinese person who tried to intervene. The four instructors from Cornell College were teaching at Beihua University. Their injuries were not critical. About 100,000 Japanese students, employees and others live in China.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-china-boy-stabbing-united-nations-a3a621690fe9337f6ca0ae11afa6e806	2024-09-23T20:10:48-07:00	
World leaders meet under shadow of global divisions, 3 wars and possible Mideast conflict	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — World leaders will open their annual meeting at the U.N. General Assembly Tuesday under the shadow of increasing global divisions, major wars in Gaza, Ukraine and, Sudan and the threat of an even larger conflict in the wider Middle East. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres previewed his opening 'State of the World' speech to presidents, prime ministers, monarchs and ministers at Sunday’s 'Summit of the Future,' saying 'our world is heading off the rails — and we need tough decisions to get back on track.' He pointed to conflicts 'raging and multiplying, from the Middle East to Ukraine and Sudan, with no end in sight' and to the global security system, which he said is 'threatened by geopolitical divides, nuclear posturing, and the development of new weapons and theaters of war.' He also cited huge inequalities, the lack of an effective global system to respond to emerging and even existential threats, and the devastating impact of climate change. One notable moment at Tuesday’s opening assembly meeting: U.S. President Joe Biden’s likely final major appearance on the world stage, a platform he has tred upon for decades. U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield told reporters last week that the U.S. focus in the assembly will be on ending 'the scourge of war,' lamenting that roughly 2 billion people live in conflict-affected areas. But she also said: 'The most vulnerable around the world are counting on us to make progress, to make change, to bring about a sense of hope for them.' Among other speakers on opening day are Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, King Abdullah II of Jordan, and Iran’s new President Masoud Pezeshkian. The Iranian leader accused Israel on Monday of seeking a wider war in the Middle East and laying 'traps' to lead his country into a broader conflict. He pointed to the deadly explosions of pagers, walkie-talkies and other electronic devices in Lebanon last week, which he blamed on Israel, and the assassination of Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on July 31, hours after Pezeshkian’s inauguration. 'We don’t want to fight,' the Iranian president said. 'It’s Israel that wants to drag everyone into war and destabilize the region. … They are dragging us to a point where we do not wish to go.' Iran supports both Hamas in Gaza and Lebanon’s Hezbollah militants. International Rescue Committee President David Miliband recalled that at the San Francisco conference in 1945 where the U.N. was established, then-U.S. President Harry Truman pleaded with delegates to reject the premise that 'might makes right' and reverse it to 'right makes might,' which was enshrined in the U.N. Charter. 'Almost 80 years later, we have seen the terrible consequences of the failure to flip this equation,' Miliband said. 'In contexts like Gaza, Sudan and Ukraine, might is making right.' Facing mounting global humanitarian needs, unchecked conflict, unmitigated climate change and growing extreme poverty, Miliband challenged world leaders asking: 'How will you strengthen, not weaken, the principles of the U.N. Charter for the next 80 years?' The assembly’s annual meeting, which ends on Sept. 30, followed the two-day Summit of the Future, which adopted a blueprint aimed at bringing the world’s increasing divided nations together to tackle the challenges of the 21st century from conflicts and climate change to artificial intelligence and women's rights. The 42-page 'Pact for the Future' challenges leaders of the 193 U.N. member nations to turn promises into real actions that make a difference to the lives of the world’s more than 8 billion people. 'We are here to bring multilateralism back from the brink,' Guterres said. By adopting the pact, leaders unlocked the door, he said. 'Now it is our common destiny to walk through it. That demands not just agreement, but action.' At last year’s U.N. global gathering, Ukraine and its president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, took center stage. But as the first anniversary of Hamas’ deadly attack in southern Israel approaches on Oct. 7, the spotlight is certain to be on the war in Gaza and escalating violence across the Israeli-Lebanon border, which is now threatening to spread to the wider Middle East. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is scheduled to speak Thursday morning and Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday afternoon. Zelenskyy will get the spotlight twice. He will speak Tuesday afternoon at a high-level meeting of the U.N. Security Council called by the United States, France, Japan, Malta, South Korea and Britain, whose foreign ministers are expected to attend. He will also address the General Assembly on Wednesday morning.	https://apnews.com/article/un-world-leaders-gaza-ukraine-sudan-e9b8bd0ee132f6a7f56555975f67b0de	2024-09-23T20:07:12-07:00	
Brick by brick, Morocco rebuilds 12th-century mosque destroyed by 2023 earthquake	TINMEL, Morocco (AP) — The hand-carved domes and brick-laid arches had almost all been put back together when an earthquake shook Morocco so violently that they caved in on themselves and crashed to the earth. After nearly 900 years, the Great Mosque of Tinmel lay in pieces — its minaret toppled, its prayer hall full of rubble, its outer walls knocked over. But even in ruins, it remained holy ground for the residents of Tinmel. Villagers carried the sheet-laden bodies of the 15 community members killed in the quake down the hillside and placed them in front of the decimated mosque. Among the mourners was Mohamed Hartatouch, who helped carry the remains of his son Abdelkrim. A 33-year-old substitute teacher, he died under bricks and collapsed walls while the village waited a day and a half for rescue crews to arrive. 'It looked like a storm. I wasn’t able to feel anything,' the grieving father said, remembering the day after the quake. One year later, the rubble near Hartatouch’s half-standing home has been swept aside and Tinmel residents are eager to rebuild their homes and the mosque. They say the sacred site is a point of pride and source of income in a region where infrastructure and jobs were lacking long before the earthquake hit. 'It’s our past,' Redwan Aitsalah, a 32-year-old construction worker, said the week before the earthquake’s anniversary as he reconstructed his home overlooking the mosque. The September 2023 quake left a path of destruction that will take Morocco years to recover from. It killed nearly 3,000 people, knocked down almost 60,000 homes and leveled at least 585 schools. The damage will cost about $12.3 billion to rebuild, according to government estimates. Stretches of road were left unnavigable, including Tizi N’Test, the steep mountain pass that weaves from Marrakech to Tinmel and some of the hardest-hit villages near the earthquake’s epicenter. Workers are now sifting through the rubble searching for the mosque's puzzle pieces. They are stacking useable bricks and sorting the fragments of remaining decorative elements arch by arch and dome by dome, preparing to rebuild the mosque using as much of the remains as possible. Though incomparable to the human loss and suffering, the restoration effort is among Morocco’s priorities as it attempts to rebuild. The country’s Ministry of Islamic Affairs and Ministry of Culture have recruited Moroccan architects, archaeologists and engineers to oversee the project. To assist, the Italian government has sent Moroccan-born architect Aldo Giorgio Pezzi, who had also consulted on Casablanca’s Hassan II Mosque, one of Africa's largest. 'We will rebuild it based on the evidence and remains that we have so it returns to how it was,' Morocco’s Minister of Islamic Affairs Ahmed Toufiq told The Associated Press. The Great Mosque was a marvel of North African architecture with lobed arches, hand-carved moldings and the adobe-style bricks made of rammed earth used to construct most the area’s structures. It was undergoing an 18-month-long restoration project when the quake struck, causing its ornate domes and pillars to cave in. Its clay-colored remnants lay in pieces beneath scaffolding erected by restoration workers from villages throughout the region, five of whom also died. 'The mosque withstood centuries. It’s the will of God,' Nadia El Bourakkadi, the site’s conservationist, told local media. The temblor leveled it months before repairs and renovations were to be completed. Like in many of the area’s villages, residents of Tinmel today live in plastic tents brought in as temporary shelter post-earthquake. Some are there because it feels safer than their half-ruined homes, others because they have nowhere else to go. Officials have issued more than 55,000 reconstruction permits for villagers to build new homes, including for most of the homes in Tinmel. The government has distributed financial aid in phases. Most households with destroyed homes have received an initial $2,000 installment of rebuilding aid, but not more. Many have complained that isn’t enough to underwrite the initial costs of rebuilding. Less than 1,000 have completed rebuilding, according to the government’s own figures. Despite the extent of their personal losses, Moroccans are also mourning the loss of revered cultural heritage. Centuries-old mosques, shrines, fortresses and lodges are scattered throughout the mountains. Unlike Tinmel, many have long been neglected as Morocco focuses its development efforts elsewhere. The country sees Tinmel as the cradle of one of its most storied civilizations. The mosque served as a source of inspiration for widely visited sacred sites in Marrakech and Seville. Pilgrims once trekked through the High Atlas to pay their respects and visit. Yet centuries ago it fell into disrepair as political power shifted to Morocco’s larger cities and coastline. 'It was abandoned by the state, but materials were never taken from it,' said Mouhcine El Idrissi, an archaeologist working with Morocco’s Ministry of Culture. 'People here have long respected it as a witness to their glorious and spiritual past.' Some of the historic sites of the High Atlas have long been a lure to tourists. But the earthquake shone a spotlight on the vast disparities plaguing the primarily agricultural region. Long marginalized, poverty and illiteracy rates are higher than the nationwide average, according to census data and an October 2023 government report on the five earthquake-hit provinces. 'The mountainous areas most affected were those already suffering from geographical isolation,' Civil Coalition for the Mountain, a group of Moroccan NGOs, said in a statement on the earthquake’s anniversary. 'The tragedy revealed structural differences, and a situation caused by development policies that have always kept the mountains outside the scope of their objectives.' 'There’s a Morocco that exists in Rabat and Marrakech, but we’re talking about another Morocco that’s in the mountains,' added Najia Ait Mohannad, the group’s regional coordinator. 'Right now, the most urgent need is rebuilding houses.' The government has promised 'a well-thought-out, integrated and ambitious program' for the reconstruction and general upgrading of the affected regions, both in terms of infrastructure reinforcement and improving public services. It has also pledged to rebuild 'in harmony with the region’s heritage and respecting its unique architectural features' and 'to respect the dignity and customs' of the population. For the village’s residents, the landmark could stand as a symbol of reinvestment in one of Morocco’s poorest regions, as well as a tribute to a glorious past. For now, it stands in disrepair, its enchanting ruins upheld by wooden scaffolding, while down the hill, villagers hang laundry and grow vegetables amid the remnants of their former homes and the plastic tents where they now live. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Unversed in UNGA? Stumped by SDGs? Here's a handy glossary of UN General Assembly meeting lingo	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The U.N. General Assembly's yearly meeting of world leaders is here — and with it, an array of acronyms, abbreviations, titles and terms that can be confounding to observers. Here is some key vocabulary, decoded. For starters ... UNGA: Acronym (yes, people do pronounce it 'UN'-gah') for the U.N. General Assembly's 'High-level Week.' It's the international organization's biggest annual event, inviting presidents, prime ministers, monarchs and other top leaders of all 193 U.N. member countries to speak to the world and each other. Although New Yorkers sometimes just use 'General Assembly' to describe what many experience mainly as a week of street closures and whizzing motorcades, the assembly actually isn't just this meeting. It's a body that convenes countries' ambassadors throughout the year to discuss a wide range of global issues and vote on resolutions. GENERAL DEBATE: The centerpiece of the week, it gives each country's leader (or a designee) the mic for a state-of-the-world speech from its viewpoint. There is a theme, chosen by the assembly's president — this year's is about 'leaving no one behind' and 'acting together' to advance peace, sustainable development and human dignity. But speakers use the opportunity to opine on the planet's biggest issues and hotspots, spotlight domestic accomplishments and needs, air grievances, and project statesmanship. Dignitaries are asked to wrap up within 15 minutes, but there's no buzzer or Oscars-style music. While the 'debate' is less an interactive back-and-forth than a series of speeches, rebuttals are allowed at the end of each long day, and some embittered neighbor nations routinely go multiple rounds. BILATERAL (or 'bilat,' for short): Private meetings between leaders of one country and another. Some argue the real value of UNGA lies in these tête-à-têtes and other personal, off-camera encounters among decision-makers. MINISTERIAL: Applies to meetings of cabinet-level officials, such as foreign ministers, from different countries. SECURITY COUNCIL: The U.N.'s most powerful component, charged with maintaining international peace and security. The 15-member council can enact binding (though sometimes ignored) resolutions, impose sanctions and deploy peacekeeping troops. While this week is the Assembly's show, the council generally holds at least one meeting of its own with high-wattage attendees in town for the events next door. This week, there are set to be two council sessions, one on Ukraine and one on the topic of 'leadership for peace.' Who's on the council? Read on. Fun with numbers! P5: The Security Council's five permanent members with veto power. Under a structure set up in 1945, they are China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States. E10: The Security Council's 10 elected, non-permanent members. The General Assembly elects them for two-year terms in seats allocated by region. Calls for council reform are an UNGA staple. One major complaint is the lack of permanent members from Africa and the Latin America-Caribbean region, though some other nations also have angled for years for a permanent presence. G77: Stands for the 'Group of 77,' a developing-countries interest group that formed within the U.N. in 1964. Despite its name, it actually now has 134 members. COP29: A major U.N. global climate conference coming up in November in Baku, Azerbaijan. 1.5 DEGREES: A crucial climate threshold. Under the 2015 Paris climate accord, countries agreed to work to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) over pre-industrial times. The earth already has warmed at least 1.1 degrees (2 degrees Fahrenheit) since the mid-1800s. Initial here SDGs: The U.N.'s ' sustainable development goals, ' which range from combating climate change to eliminating hunger and poverty to achieving gender equality. The U.N.'s member countries adopted the goals in 2015 as a 15-year action plan, but the pace is seriously lagging. UNGA week this year began with a 'Summit of the Future,' on Sunday and Monday, that's meant to 'turbocharge the SDGs,' as U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres has put it. If that sounds a lot like the 'SDG summit' during last year's high-level week, well... consider it a sign of both the emphasis on and elusiveness of these grand goals. SIDS: At the U.N., this stands for some 39 ' small island developing states. ' UNGA is an important platform for them to elevate concerns such as climate change and the existential threat they face from projections of rising seas and intensifying storms — often a painfully timely subject at a meeting that falls in the thick of the Atlantic hurricane season. BRICS: A developing-economies coalition that initially included Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates joined this year. Azerbaijan and Malaysia have formally applied, and Saudi Arabia has said it’s considering doing so. There are many international groups centered around regional, economic, defense or other ties, but BRICS has gotten attention lately as a growing venue for Chinese-Russian influence when those powers are increasingly at odds with the West. LDCs: Very poor nations that are known at the U.N. as ' least-developed countries.' Forty-five nations currently meet the criteria, which include a gross national income of $1,088 or less per person per year. NGO: 'Non-governmental organization,' such as an advocacy group, charitable foundation, nonprofit relief organization or other entity under the umbrella of what the U.N. likes to call civil society organizations. IFIs: International financial institutions, including the so-called Bretton Woods institutions — the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, which were established at a 1944 U.N. conference in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire. Critics — including Guterres — see the Bretton Woods duo as sclerotic entities that have badly failed poor and developing countries. The institutions have defended their work while saying they are trying to evolve. Phrasebook MULTILATERALISM: Global or near-global partnership that is united and collectively develops enduring rules and shared norms — the idea that undergirds the U.N. itself and which many warn is under threat. MULTIPOLAR: A scenario in which there are several different and sometimes competing centers of power, not a single superpower or two. MULTISTAKEHOLDER: An approach to big projects and problem-solving that incorporates not only governments but businesses, NGOs and possibly others. Guterres is a fan, seeing this concept as key to the future of world cooperation. But some progressive groups view it as a sell-out to big corporations and other powers in the status quo. TWO-STATE SOLUTION: A concept for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by establishing an independent Palestinian nation living in peace alongside Israel. The framework was set down in the 1993 Oslo Accords and embraced by the U.N., but progress toward implementing it stalled long before Israel's nearly year-old war with Hamas in Gaza. SOUTH-SOUTH COOPERATION: Collaboration among Southern Hemisphere countries, organizations and people, with aims that include amplifying their voice in their own development and in international affairs. UNILATERAL COERCIVE MEASURES: A usually critical way of describing sanctions imposed by one country in hopes of spurring some action in another. ___ See more of AP’s coverage of the U.N.

Reconstruction set to begin on Copenhagen’s fire-damaged Old Stock Exchange landmark	COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — Five months after a devastating fire destroyed more than half of Copenhagen’s Old Stock Exchange, workers are set to begin the reconstruction of the 400-year-old building to return it to its former glory. On Thursday, King Frederik X of Denmark will lay a 'foundation stone' within part of a red brick wall that survived the mid-April blaze, commencing a yearslong reconstruction plan. 'We will do this as fast as possible to have Boersen ready for the Copenhageners, for the Danes, for the world again,' said Lars Daugaard Jepsen, head of reconstruction at Denmark’s Chamber of Commerce, which owns the building. He used the Danish name for the stock exchange building. On Friday, there will be an open day event where visitors can come and see what is left of the downtown exchange. Construction started in 1615 and first opened in 1624. It is considered a leading example of Dutch Renaissance style in Denmark. In the early morning of April 16, a violent fire tore through the building, a major tourist attraction. The blaze toppled its green copper roof and iconic dragon-tail spire. Two days later, a large section of the building’s outer wall collapsed inwards. As the fire raged, many, including ordinary people, ventured in to rescue artworks and around 90% of the cultural objects were rescued from the fire. Authorities have yet to reveal the cause of the fire, but it's believed to have started on the building’s roof, which had been wrapped in scaffolding because of ongoing renovation work to be completed for its anniversary in 2024. Instead of a renovated building, it's now a ruin. But there are detailed records of its design. 'We have a lot of pictures, we have a lot of papers, we have a lot of knowledge about this building,' Daugaard Jepsen told The Associated Press, during a recent site tour. 'That’s also why we are very optimistic of rebuilding this place.' He said they want to use the same materials that were available in the construction 400 years ago. Before the fire, the chamber of commerce had ordered 80,000 bricks — handmade in Germany and burnt in coal-fired ovens — for renovation work. That order has now increased to 800,000. The wood used in the 17th century came from a Swedish Baltic Sea island and was already 160 years old when brought to Denmark, Daugaard Jepsen said. 'We are looking for about 800 to 1,000 trees on Gotland, because we will use the same materials,' he said. Since April, workers have cleared more than 1,000 tons of debris after the fire, which was reminiscent of the April 2019 blaze at the 800-year-old old Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. But the new construction won’t be exactly as before, Daugaard Jepsen said, adding the interior has changed eight times during its history and will take on a new appearance again. 'Our task is to look forward,' he said. The aim is 'to make a building that will stand for at least 400 years.' The reconstruction cost and a date for when it is expected to be completed have yet to be revealed. But Daugaard Jepsen said the five years it took to rebuild Notre Dame is a 'very good guess.' 'We will do it as fast as we can,' he said with a smile. ___ AP journalist Jan M.

As Israel's fight with Hezbollah heats up, people of Gaza fear being forgotten	MUWASI, Gaza Strip (AP) — As the escalating conflict between Israel and Hezbollah grabs global attention, Palestinians in Gaza wonder: What will become of their plight after nearly a year of devastating war? They are petrified that international concern has been diverted, and that a dark possibility looms: abandonment. The families of Israeli hostages held in Gaza have the same worry. Nezar Zaqout, one of some 1.9 million Palestinians forced to flee their homes since the Israel-Hamas war broke out, said he fears the fighting across the Israel-Lebanon border will overtake interest in the abysmal living conditions in Gaza and efforts to negotiate a cease-fire. 'We have become completely forgotten,' said Zaqout, who is living in Khan Younis after fleeing from Gaza City months ago. 'There is no news about us in the media.' Palestinians fret the miserable conditions in Gaza will become permanent. Ninety percent of the population is homeless, with hundreds of thousands in unsanitary tent camps struggling to find food and clean water. 'A year on, and no one cares about us. Every day there is bombing, every day there are martyrs, and every day there are injuries,' said Saadi Abu Mustafa, who fled Khan Younis to Muwasi, a sprawling tent camp along Gaza's southern coast. Since Hamas launched the war on Oct. 7, Israel's retaliatory invasion of Gaza has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians and wounded more than 95,000, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between civilians and militants, but says over half of the dead were women and children. Months of intense air and ground assaults have razed entire housing blocks to the ground; researchers who study satellite imagery estimate nearly 60% of buildings in the Gaza Strip have likely been damaged since the start of the war. Israel vowed to destroy Hamas after Oct. 7, when its militants killed some 1,200 people and abducted 250 others. While it has been badly hobbled, the militant group backed by Iran remains in power. Israel’s government says about 70 of the 100 hostages are still presumed alive. Their families dread the government's focus on ending the war is fading. 'My biggest concern is that all the public’s attention and the world’s attention would be gone to the north,' said Udi Goren, a relative of Tal Haimi, an Israeli killed on Oct. 7 and whose body was taken to Gaza. 'Eventually the hostages will just be completely left alone without anyone to bring them out.' As the threat of all-out-war between Israel and Hezbollah has risen, Israel has drawn down its troop presence in Gaza to move key units to its northern border with Lebanon. Still, thousands of soldiers remain in Gaza, carrying out sporadic raids and preventing displaced Palestinians from returning home. Daily strikes have continued in Gaza, too. An Israeli strike on a school-turned-shelter in northern Gaza Saturday killed at least 22 people and wounded 30 others, mostly women and children, according to the Gaza health ministry. Recent rains have made already difficult living conditions in the Israeli-designated 'safe zone' of Muwasi unbearable. On Sunday, children living there walked barefoot through mud that reached above their ankles, while men dug through the muck to salvage precious canned goods and furniture. 'The entire kitchen in which we prepare food was filled with water. We did not know what to do. This is the beginning of winter. What will happen in the coming days?' said Rana Goza’t, a mother displaced from Gaza City. Others lamented water-logged mattresses and pleaded for international groups to help keep attention on the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. 'We hope that all peoples care about us and see where we have reached,' said Enas Kollab, who relocated to Muwasi from northern Gaza. A flurry of diplomatic activity to broker an agreement between Israel and Hamas appears to have subsided, with each side accusing the other of negotiating in bad faith and making untenable demands. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel must keep troops in two areas of Gaza to prevent Hamas from rearming. But Hamas has said it will not agree to any deal that allows Israeli troops to remain. Hopes for a deal have further dimmed as the United States, a key mediator in the talks, appears to be losing the ability to influence its closest ally. In a trip to the region last week, Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited only Egypt because U.S. officials believed having him travel to Israel in support of a deal might cause Netanyahu to say something that would undermine mediation efforts. No clear vision has emerged for postwar Gaza — or who will guide and govern that process — but one thing is clear: Rebuilding the territory will take decades. The U.N. estimated this summer that just removing some 40 million tons of rubble would take 15 years.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-gaza-war-lebanonrefugees-displaced-9d4d53e808ce5f67e234789f65d1ad71	2024-09-23T19:10:39-07:00	
OceanGate employee pushes back against idea of 'desperation' to complete missions	A key employee with the company that owned the experimental submersible that imploded en route to the wreckage of the Titanic pushed back at a question from a Coast Guard investigator about whether OceanGate felt a sense of 'desperation' to complete the dives because of the high price tag. 'Not a desperation, there definitely was an urgency to delivery on what we had offered and a dedication and perseverance towards that goal,' said Amber Bay, director of administration for the company that owned the doomed Titan submersible. She insisted the company would not 'conduct dives that would be risky just to meet a need.' Other witnesses have characterized those who paid $250,000 to participate in OceanGate voyages to the Titanic as passengers, but Bay described them more as explorers who were invited to take an active role in the missions. 'These were the people we were looking for. Explorers. Adventurers,' Bay testified Tuesday. OceanGate co-founder Stockton Rush was among the five people who died when the submersible imploded in June 2023. The Coast Guard opened a public hearing earlier this month that is part of a high level investigation into the cause of the implosion. Some of the testimony has focused on the troubled nature of the company. The co-founder of the company told the Coast Guard panel Monday that he hoped a silver lining of the disaster is that it will inspire a renewed interest in exploration, including the deepest waters of the world’s oceans. Businessman Guillermo Sohnlein, who helped found OceanGate with Rush, ultimately left the company before the Titan disaster. 'This can’t be the end of deep ocean exploration. This can’t be the end of deep-diving submersibles and I don’t believe that it will be,' Sohnlein said. Earlier in the hearing, former OceanGate operations director David Lochridge said he frequently clashed with Rush and felt the company was committed only to making money. 'The whole idea behind the company was to make money,' Lochridge testified. 'There was very little in the way of science.' Sohnlein said Monday he had the opportunity to dive in Titan 'many times' and he declined. He said his reasons included not wanting to take space away from potential customers. He also said when Rush reached a point when it was 'time to put a human in there,' he wanted to do it himself. Rush felt it was his design and said 'if anything happens, I want it to impact me,' Sohnlein said. But Lochridge and other previous witnesses painted a picture of a troubled company that was impatient to get its unconventionally designed craft into the water. The accident set off a worldwide debate about the future of private undersea exploration. The hearing is expected to run through Friday and include several more witnesses, some of whom were closely connected to the company. Coast Guard officials noted at the start of the hearing that the submersible had not been independently reviewed, as is standard practice. That and Titan’s unusual design subjected it to scrutiny in the undersea exploration community. OceanGate, based in Washington state, suspended its operations after the implosion. The company has no full-time employees currently, but has been represented by an attorney during the hearing. During the submersible’s final dive on June 18, 2023, the crew lost contact after an exchange of texts about Titan’s depth and weight as it descended. The support ship Polar Prince then sent repeated messages asking if Titan could still see the ship on its onboard display. When the submersible was reported overdue, rescuers rushed ships, planes and other equipment to an area about 435 miles (700 kilometers) south of St. John’s, Newfoundland. Wreckage of the Titan was subsequently found on the ocean floor about 330 yards (300 meters) off the bow of the Titanic, Coast Guard officials said. No one on board survived. OceanGate said it has been fully cooperating with the Coast Guard and NTSB investigations since they began. Titan had been making voyages to the Titanic wreckage site going back to 2021.	https://apnews.com/article/titan-titanic-oceangate-coast-guard-hearing-implosion-6651fe48136b0b15121e87e5a90bbf87	2024-09-23T19:06:40-07:00	
Climate solutions: 2 kinds of ocean energy inch forward off the Oregon coast	NEWPORT, Ore. (AP) — On a cloudy late August morning, Burke Hales was on a boat a mile off the central Oregon coast, pointing to a sandy beach along the forested shoreline. It was there, the Oregon State University oceanography professor said, that the subsea cables from the first large wave energy test site in the continental U.S. will connect to land — and ultimately the local power grid. 'This is the highest power — probably the most energetic — wave condition of any of the test sites out there,' he said, as the high swells known to pound the Oregon coast rocked the boat. The coastal waters of Oregon are shaping up to be key for advances in two forms of renewable energy: wave power and wind turbines that float. The way electricity is traditionally made is a major cause of climate change, so clean alternatives are key to addressing it. Wave energy is at an earlier stage than floating wind, but the potential could be big. According to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, marine energy, a term researchers use to refer to power generated from tides, currents or waves, is the world’s largest untapped energy resource. The Biden administration announced Monday it will invest over $112 million to boost the design, fabrication and testing of wave energy devices. The work on floating wind turbines is further along, but still early, and encountering resistance. The only way to build offshore wind power on the West Coast is to use floating turbines. The ocean is too deep to affix traditional turbines to the seafloor, said Mark Severy, a research engineer at the Pacific Northwest National Lab who works on addressing challenges to offshore wind development in the U.S. So far there are only a handful of floating offshore arrays across the globe, mostly small pilots in Europe and China, testing the technology to pave the way for larger projects. The largest is Hywind Tampen, 11 turbines that supply electricity to oil and gas fields in the Norwegian North Sea. Floating wind has not yet been constructed in the United States. California awarded the first-ever leases in the U.S. to develop commercial-scale floating wind farms in 2022. The federal government issued the nation’s first floating offshore wind research lease to the state of Maine in August, and Oregon’s commercial lease sale is next month. These are areas where the wind blows fast and hard, meaning a single turbine can generate more electricity than in areas where the wind isn’t as strong. In Oregon, opposition from tribes, fishermen and coastal residents highlights some of the challenges with renewable energy offshore. The opposition is largely directed at the U.S. government’s plans for floating wind in two areas covering 305 square miles (790 square kilometers) off Oregon’s southern coast. The two areas identified by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, or BOEM, are 32 miles (52 kilometers) off the coast of Coos Bay and 18 miles (29 kilometers) from the small city of Brookings, near the California state line. Some in those communities are concerned that the construction will harm sea life, marine habitat, culturally important areas and views of the ocean. While the wind areas are miles from land, the lights used to illuminate the turbines at night would be visible from the shore, according to a BOEM visual simulation. Two coastal counties will ask voters in November whether they oppose the development of floating offshore wind. And the Confederated Tribes of Coos, Lower Umpqua and Siuslaw Indians — whose culture is tied to the ocean — sued the federal government ahead of its upcoming lease sale. BOEM says it has engaged with tribes. But tribes in Oregon and California have expressed frustration with what they say is a lack of consultation. John Ogan, executive director of natural resources for the Coquille Indian Tribe on the southern Oregon coast, said that tribal members during meetings with the federal government were 'talked at without having our issues or our concerns or requests for information responded to in a substantive way.' 'We have sacred sites,' he said. 'Tribal people will never see a sunset the same way, as they have for 10,000-plus years, ever again.' Oregon's wave energy test site hasn’t sparked similar resistance. Hales, the Oregon State professor serving as chief scientist for the site, attributed this to researchers working together with fishermen to identify the location for the site early in the permitting process. Wave energy test sites allow companies to deploy devices they’ve designed in a real-world environment to see how they fare. While the PacWave South site in Oregon isn’t the first grid-connected wave energy test site in the nation — the U.S. Navy has one in Hawaii — it will be the first to be connected to the continental U.S. grid. Globally there are roughly 40 operational, grid-connected marine energy projects, according to the PRIMRE data portal developed by three national laboratories on behalf of the U.S. Energy Department, or DOE. Some bob like buoys or sit on the sea floor. Some look like submerged wind turbines. With waves up to 20 feet (6 meters) possible at the Oregon test site in winter, Hales estimates its peak capacity will be 20 megawatts — enough to power some 2,000 homes. One reason wave energy is still in its infancy and not yet competitive with wind, solar and geothermal power is because it’s challenging for companies to develop projects that can withstand the harshest ocean conditions where the waves or currents are the strongest, then convert that movement to electricity efficiently and affordably. 'A huge part of this operation is survivability at sea,' Hales said. 'We’re putting devices made of metal into salt water. They’re generating electricity. Being able to do that without suffering extensive corrosion is high risk.' Companies also have to consider how devices would affect sea life, he said. Gray whales, sea lions, seals and sea birds abound on the Oregon coast. Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek has been working to ease tensions over wind development in her state and acknowledged that the federal government's process for developing it 'hasn't started off on the right foot.' But she said the state must explore renewable energy options — including floating offshore wind — in order to meet its climate goals. 'In Oregon, we are working towards clean electricity, 100% clean electricity, by 2040. That means what we’re doing now, we have to do more of, and we need to put new options on the table. And that means offshore floating wind as a possibility,' she said. 'This is an opportunity. It’s also a challenge,' she added. 'But we have to try.' ___ McDermott reported from Providence, Rhode Island. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Conflicts in the Mideast and Ukraine will loom over Biden's farewell address at the United Nations	NEW YORK (AP) — President Joe Biden is set to deliver his final address to the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday as Israel and Hezbollah militants in Lebanon are edging toward all-out war and Israel's bloodyoperation against Hamas in Gaza nears the one-year mark. Biden is expected to use his wide-ranging address to speak to the need to end the Middle East conflict and the 17-month-old civil war in Sudan and to highlight U.S. and Western allies' support for Kyiv since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. His appearance before the international body also offers Biden one of his last high-profile opportunities as president to make the case to keep up robust support for Ukraine, which could be in doubt if former President Donald Trump, who has scoffed at the cost of the war, defeats Vice President Kamala Harris in November. Biden came to office promising to rejuvenate U.S. relations around the world and to extract the U.S. from 'forever wars' in Afghanistan and Iraq that consumed American foreign policy over the last 20 years. He achieved both goals. But his foreign policy legacy may ultimately be shaped by his administration's response to two of the biggest conflicts in Europe and the Middle East since World War II. The Pentagon announced Monday that it was sending a small number of additional U.S. troops to the Middle East to supplement the roughly 40,000 already in the region, because of the rising tensions. All the while, the White House insists Israel and Hezbollah still have time to step back and de-escalate. 'It’s in everyone’s interest to resolve it quickly and diplomatically,' White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters as Biden made his way to New York on Monday ahead of his address at the U.N. Biden administration officials will be speaking to their counterparts on the sidelines of the U.N. about ideas that they believe could prevent the fighting between Israel and Lebanon from escalating, according to two senior administration officials. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations, declined to offer any further details on the potential off-ramps. One of the officials said that other countries were also keen to present ideas to reduce tensions. Biden had a hopeful outlook for the Middle East when he addressed the U.N. just a year ago. In that speech, Biden spoke of a 'sustainable, integrated Middle East' coming into view. At the time, economic relations between Israel and some of its Arab neighbors were improving with implementation of the Abraham Accords that Israel signed with Bahrain, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates during the Trump administration. Biden's team helped resolve a long-running Israel-Lebanon maritime dispute that had held back gas exploration in the region. And Israel-Saudi normalization talks were progressing, a game-changing alignment for the region if a deal could be landed. 'I suffer from an oxymoron: Irish optimism,' Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when they met on the sidelines of last year's U.N. gathering. He added, 'If you and I, 10 years ago, were talking about normalization with Saudi Arabia ... I think we’d look at each other like, ‘Who’s been drinking what?’' Eighteen days later, Biden's Middle East hopes came crashing down. Hamas militants stormed into Israel killing 1,200, taking some 250 hostage, and spurring a bloody war that has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians in Gaza and led the region into a complicated downward spiral. Now, the conflict is threatening to metastasize into a multi-front war and leave a lasting scar on Biden's presidential legacy. Israeli strikes on Lebanon on Monday killed more than 490 people, including more than 90 women and children, Lebanese authorities said, in the deadliest barrage since the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war. Israel has urged residents of southern Lebanon to evacuate from homes and other buildings where it claimed Hezbollah has stored weapons, saying the military would conduct 'extensive strikes' against the militant group. Hezbollah, meanwhile, has launched dozens of rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel in retaliation for strikes last week that killed a top commander and dozens of fighters. Dozens were also killed last week and hundreds more wounded after hundreds of pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah militants exploded, a sophisticated attack that was widely believed to have been carried out by Israel. Israel's leadership launched its counterattacks at a time of growing impatience with the Iranian-backed Hezbollah's persistent launching of missiles and drones across the Israel-Lebanon border after Hamas started the war with its brazen attack on Oct. 7. The stepped-up Israeli operations were launched shortly after a White House senior adviser, Amos Hochstein, visited Israel last week and urged the Israelis to avoid an escalation that could risk spurring a regional conflict. 'Reality is intervening,' said Bradley Bowman, a defense strategy and policy analyst at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies in Washington. 'There are contrasting interests that transcend the politics and the politicians of the U.S.-Israel relationship. For Israel, Oct. 7 did happen, and the reality is they are facing a multifront threat and the current status quo is unacceptable. Sometimes to get to a better status quo, you have to escalate.' Biden has seemed more subdued in recent days about the prospects of Israel and Hamas agreeing to a temporary cease-fire and hostage deal. But he insists that he hasn't given up. 'If I ever say it’s not realistic then I might as well leave,' Biden said last week when asked if the chances for a deal were quickly fading under his watch. 'A lot of things don’t look realistic until we get them done.' Biden, in his address, also is expected to address ongoing Western support for Ukraine in its war with Russia. Biden helped galvanize an international coalition to back Ukraine with weapons and economic aid in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin's February 2022 assault on Ukraine. Biden has managed to keep up American support in the face of rising skepticism from some Republican lawmakers — and Trump — about the cost of the conflict. At the same time, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is pressing Biden to loosen restrictions on the use of Western-supplied long-range missiles so that Ukrainian forces can hit deeper in Russia. So far Zelenskyy has not persuaded the Pentagon or White House to loosen those restrictions. The Defense Department has emphasized that Ukraine can already hit Moscow with Ukrainian-produced drones, and there is hesitation on the strategic implications of a U.S.-made missile potentially striking the Russian capital. Putin has warned that Russia would be 'at war' with the United States and its NATO allies if they allow Ukraine to use the long-range weapons. Over the course of the war, Biden has previously resisted Ukrainian requests for certain weaponry, including MI Abrams tanks and F-16 fighter jets, before agreeing to allow their use because of worries about escalating tensions with Russia. Max Bergmann, a Russia analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the administration has slowly come around to giving Ukraine weapons that it initially deemed 'unimaginably escalatory' at the start of the war. 'Allowing Ukraine to strike further into Russian territory with U.S. weapons would be another big step and the Biden administration is right to be deliberate,' Bergmann said. Biden and Harris are scheduled to hold separate meetings with Zelenskyy in Washington on Thursday. The Ukrainian leader also is expected to meet with Trump this week. ___ Miller reported from Washington.	https://apnews.com/article/biden-un-general-assembly-ukraine-israel-gaza-4e4e839c3cdd4edd7543aea84af2346f	2024-09-23T19:03:29-07:00	
Stock market today: Asian shares gain as China eases rates to aid property industry	Asian shares advanced Tuesday, with Chinese markets logging the biggest gains after the central bank announced a slew of measures to support the economy. Shares in Hong Kong jumped 2%. U.S. futures edged lower while oil prices gained. Among various policies aimed at countering a prolonged downturn in the property sector, People’s Bank of China Gov. Pan Gongsheng said the reserve requirement for banks would be cut by 0.5 percentage points and that the central bank would follow up with further cuts. That would free up more money for lending. Regulators also plan new policies to support stable development of the stock market, Pan and other senior official told reporters in Beijing. The coordinated measures, instead of 'drip-feeding piecemeal support,' are 'a step in the right direction,' Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a commentary. 'But it will probably be insufficient to drive a turnaround in growth unless followed up with greater fiscal support,' he said. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong surged more than 400 points to 18,604.26, while the Shanghai Composite index was up 0.9% at 2,772.58. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 index climbed 0.7% to 37,974.98, while the Kospi in Seoul was nearly unchanged at 2,602.30. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 fell 0.3% to 8,126.30. On Monday, the S&amp;P 500 rose 0.3% to 5,718.57, edging past its record set on Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.1% to its own all-time high set on Friday and closed at 42,124.65. The Nasdaq composite gained 0.1% to 17,974.27. Tesla led the way with a gain of 4.9% and clawed back all its sharp losses from earlier in the year. It had shed as 42% at one point in April, when it was cutting prices on its cars to boost tepid sales. That helped offset a 10.3% tumble for Trump Media &amp; Technology Group, which fell to its lowest price since taking its place on the Nasdaq stock market in March. The company behind former President Donald Trump’s Truth Social network has dropped six straight days amid speculation about when Trump and other company insiders may sell their shares now that they’re no longer bound by a 'lock-up' agreement. Trump has said he doesn’t plan to sell. A report on Monday morning suggested U.S. business activity is not growing as quickly as economists expected, mostly because of a continued downturn in manufacturing. The preliminary report from S&amp;P Global said U.S. manufacturing shrank more severely in September than in August and hit a 15-month low. It’s been one of the parts of the economy hurt most by high interest rates. Several economic reports coming later in the week could offer more context about where the U.S. economy stands. One on Thursday will offer the final revision for the U.S. economy’s growth in the spring, and another on Friday will give a look at how much U.S. consumers are spending. Such reports, particularly on employment, are taking top priority on Wall Street because the main fear is now a slowdown in the job market. It’s a notable shift from prior years, when Wall Street’s attention was fixed on anything related to inflation. But now that inflation has come down substantially from its peak two summers ago, the Fed has shifted gears. It feels less need to keep rates high in order to slow the economy enough to stifle inflation, hence last week’s cut of half a percentage point to its main interest rate. And it feels more pressure to prop up the job market and overall economy, hence its plans to keep cutting interest rates this year and next. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury held steady at 3.74%, where it was late Friday. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which moves more with expectations for Fed action, edged down to 3.58% from 3.60% late Friday. In other dealings early Tuesday, U.S. benchmark crude oil added 44 cents to $70.81 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, was up 41 cents at $73.62 per barrel. The U.S. dollar rose to 143.65 Japanese yen from 143.61 yen. The euro slipped to $1.1106 from $1.1113. ___ AP Business Writer Stan Choe contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/stock-markets-rates-china-pboc-69a21bf495926c2e2d2d2c07e360f161	2024-09-23T18:22:36-07:00	
A court in Argentina orders the arrest of Venezuela's president and his right-hand man	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — A federal court in Argentina on Monday ordered the 'immediate' arrest of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello for alleged crimes against humanity committed against dissidents. The court order came in response to an appeal by Argentine prosecutor Carlos Stornelli after a previous ruling dismissed the complaint against both Venezuelan leaders. Federal court members Pablo Bertuzzi, Leopoldo Bruglia and Mariano Llorens ordered that 'the arrest warrants for Nicolás Maduro and Diosdado Cabello be executed immediately, and that their international arrest should be ordered via Interpol for the purposes of extradition to the Argentine Republic,' according to the resolution. The order comes hours after Venezuela’s Supreme Court issued an arrest warrant for Argentina's President Javier Milei amid a controversy between the two countries over the detention in Argentine territory — and delivery to the United States — of a cargo plane that Washington says was sold by a sanctioned Iranian airline to a Venezuelan state-owned company. The tit-for-tat heightens the tensions between Venezuela and Argentina that have been brewing since far-right Milei assumed power in December and that has led to a breakdown in diplomatic relations. The case against Maduro and his right-hand man was brought before the Argentine courts by the Argentine Forum for Democracy in the Region, FADER, in early 2023, taking into account Argentina’s jurisprudence on human rights and the principle of universal jurisdiction that allows action to be taken against crimes against humanity, even if they have been committed outside its borders. According to the plaintiffs, a systematic plan of repression, forced disappearance of persons, torture, homicides and persecution against dissidents has been in place in Venezuela since 2014. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/argentina-court-maduro-arrest-c9eb994d71c4f58744e7c74137ac5768	2024-09-23T17:31:48-07:00

What to know from the UN: Leaders speak of emerging threats, hints of war as big meeting nears	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The security cordons are up. The streets are ready to be sealed off. Aircraft from myriad nations are landing in New York. It all means one thing for the eastern part of Manhattan: The yearly gathering of world leaders at the United Nations is at hand. The U.N. General Assembly’s high-level leaders’ meeting convenes Tuesday in a troubled world — arguably even more troubled than last year, when the chief of the United Nations warned that the problems were overwhelming. Secretary-General ANTONIO GUTERRES will likely issue a similar warning on Tuesday as he opens the meeting, and world leaders take the stage amid war and rumors of war. The day before the big meeting starts was full of hints as to the agenda in the days to come: — World leaders spoke at an event called 'Summit of the Future,' with many focusing on emerging threats, to the earth's climate, on the battlefield and in cyberspace. — Iran's president pointed to the deadly explosions of pager and other devices in Lebanon, and the assassination of Hamas’ political leader ISMAIL HANIYEH, as proof Israel is trying to coax Iran into war. — Most of Earth's systems are out of whack when it comes to climate change, and nations vary on who should pay to help poor nations deal with the impacts and switch to cleaner energy. Here’s your daily guide to what’s going on at the United Nations this week, day by day: From the podium A WARNING ON CYBERSPACE: At the 'Summit of the Future,' Indian Prime Minister NARENDRA MODI voiced concerns about 'emerging theaters of conflict,' including in cyberspace. 'There is a need for balanced regulation at a global level for the safe and responsible use of technology,' Modi said, cautioning that 'we need global digital governance which ensures that national sovereignty and integrity are upheld.' CHINA'S INITIATIVES: Chinese Foreign Minister WANG YI talked up key Beijing initiatives such as the Belt and Road program, which brings Chinese companies to build Chinese-funded transportation, energy, and infrastructure projects overseas. He also hit some oft-repeated Chinese complaints, such as criticizing 'bloc confrontation' and sanctions imposed by a single country. PUBLICLY SILENCED: Representing a country where the median age is 28, Ecuador's president urged the international community to have 'a clear vision' for education and youth employment. Then suddenly, no one could hear him. The microphone of DANIEL NOBOA AZIN was cut off. Speech time limits often aren’t enforced at top-level U.N. meetings, but at the Summit of the Future, the mic was shut off after five minutes. Among the leaders who’ve run up against the limit: Brazilian President LUIZ INACIO LULA DA SILVA, Kuwait’s Crown Prince Sheikh SABAH KHALID AL SABAH and Irish President MICHAEL HIGGINS. On the sidelines U.S. Secretary of State ANTONY BLINKEN says upcoming leadership changes in Japan and the United States won’t have any impact on their commitments to security in Northeast Asia. Speaking at a meeting with the Japanese and South Korean foreign ministers on the sidelines of the general assembly, Blinken said the U.S. presidential race pitting Vice President Kamala Harris against former President Donald Trump, as well as Japanese Prime Minister FUMIO KISHIDA’s impending retirement, will not change the three countries’ joint resolve to combat threats posed by China and North Korea. He said the three-way collaboration among the allies after last year’s historic Camp David summit between the leaders 'is stronger than it’s ever been, more effective than it’s ever been, and more important than it’s ever been, given the shared challenges that we face as well as the many opportunities before us to seize.' Climate moment A group of scientists produced the first of what they hope is an annual planetary health check. The prognosis is grim. Earth is in the danger zone on six of the nine special systems that scientists looked into, with a seventh flirting with that risky area and maybe already breaching the boundary, according to the 'planetary health check' by the Potsdam Institute for Climate Research and the group called Planetary Guardians. The six areas definitely out of whack are the freshwater system, the climate, the phosphorous cycle, biodiversity, general land health and 'novel' chemicals (such as microplastics). Ocean acidification is about to cross the danger line or may have done so already, the report said. Only the ozone layer and health of the air are in decent shape, said Potsdam Institute Director JOHAN ROCKSTROM, who has done a similar planetary health check every several years and there is not much change from last year’s. 'For 30, 40 years, the world has been conscious that Earth is going in the wrong direction but we did not feel the earth was on fire. Right now the planet is on fire and that’s why we need to act,' former Colombia President JUAN MANUEL SANTOS said in a press briefing. Voices you might have missed Leaders of countries around the world spoke at the U.N.’s 'Summit of the Future' one by one. Or, San Marino’s case, two by two. For centuries, the tiny European republic has had two heads of state at any given time. They’re called capitani reggenti — in English, captains regent — and they’re selected every six months by the nation’s 60-person legislature. The current captains regent, ALESSANDRO ROSSI and MILENA GASPERONI, took turns delivering their country’s speech. It touched on issues including refugees, food waste, violent extremism and the value of multilateralism — the type of broad-based international system that the U.N. represents. 'In the case of small states, international law is seen as the one and only safeguard in the event of a threat to their existence, and multilateral fora represent a valuable megaphone to make their voices heard, which would otherwise remain unheard,' Gasperoni said. One notable number Number of women scheduled to address the assembly during the general debate, out of 194 total speakers: 19. Quotable 'They are dragging us to a point where we do not wish to go. There is no winner in warfare.' —Iranian President MASOUD PEZESHKIAN, speaking about Israel 'Today in Kabul, a female cat has more freedoms than a woman. A cat may go sit on her front stoop and feel the sun on her face. She may chase a squirrel into the park. A squirrel has more rights than a girl in Afghanistan today because the public parks have been closed to women and girls by the Taliban. A bird may sing in Kabul, but a girl may not, and a woman may not, in public. This is extraordinary.' —Actor MERYL STREEP, at a discussion focused on Afghan women 'Leaders must ask themselves whether this will be yet another meeting where they simply talk about greater cooperation and consensus, or whether they will show the imagination and conviction to actually forge it. With multiple crises around the world … if they miss this opportunity, I shudder to think of the consequences. Our collective future is at stake.' —Amnesty International Secretary General AGNÈS CALLAMARD What else? Caribbean leaders want big polluters — especially fossil fuel companies — to pay more of the trillions of dollars the world needs to help poor nations deal with climate change’s impacts and switch to cleaner energy. In a brief video appearance, Barbados Prime Minister MIA MOTTLEY, a leader in the call for global financial reform and seen as a possible future U.N. secretary-general, said poorer and middle income nations realize that private money is going to have to be part of a financial deal. But she said many multinational companies, which are richer than dozens of small nations, should pony up more dollars. Bahamas Prime Minister PHILIP DAVIS said fossil fuel companies need to be held accountable, but it will probably have to be in the courts through international lawsuits. JOHN PODESTA, Biden's top climate official, says the United States is doing its part to fight climate change and it’s paying off around the world. Podesta said the $300 billion Inflation Reduction Act spurred private businesses to spend $270 billion in clean energy. But the payoff wasn’t just in the United States because for every ton of heat-trapping carbon that the country reduced because of the new law, the world cut 2.9 tons, he said. Up next On tap for Tuesday, among other remarks, is the last U.N. address from JOE BIDEN as president of the United States after five decades on various parts of the world stage. Conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon, Ukraine and Sudan are expected to take center stage all week. Guterres opens the debate Tuesday morning. ___ AP writers Seth Borenstein and Matthew Lee contributed.

American man handed a 6-year prison sentence in Russia for trying to take his son abroad	MOSCOW (AP) — A Russian court on Monday handed a six-year prison sentence to an American man convicted on charges linked to his attempt to illegally take his 4-year-old son out of Russia, a verdict that comes amid soaring U.S.-Russian tensions. The court in Russia's westernmost Kaliningrad region said in a statement that the convict, whose name wasn't given, visited Kaliningrad in July 2023 to meet with his Russian-born son and attempted to drive him out of the country. The boy's mother didn't give her consent for that, it said. The man was detained by Russian border guards near the village of Lipovka close to the border with Poland while trying to covertly leave Russia and charged with abduction of a minor and attempted illegal crossing of the border. There was no immediate comment from the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. The case comes as Russia-U.S. ties are at their lowest level since the Cold War era over Moscow's action in Ukraine. Several Americans are serving sentences in Russia on drug, theft or assault convictions. Last month, U.S.-Russian dual national Ksenia Khavana was convicted of treason in a Russian court and sentenced to 12 years in prison on charges stemming from a donation of about $52 to a charity aiding Ukraine. In the largest Russia-West prisoner exchange since the end of the Cold War on Aug. 1, Moscow released Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and American corporate security executive Paul Whelan, both of whom were imprisoned on espionage convictions. In exchange for Russian spies held in the West, Moscow also released U.S.-Russian dual national Alsu Kurmasheva, a Radio Liberty/Radio Free Europe journalist sentenced to 6½ years for spreading 'false information' about the Russian military. Several prominent opposition figures who were imprisoned for criticizing the military operation in Ukraine were also released.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-american-sentence-7e34593611167b9f24eaaf1bddf5de36	2024-09-23T12:11:09-07:00	
Thousands flee southern Lebanon in search of safety and shelter	BEIRUT (AP) — Thousands of families from southern Lebanon packed cars and minivans with suitcases, mattresses, blankets and carpets and jammed the highway heading north toward Beirut on Monday to flee the deadliest Israeli bombardment since 2006. Some 100,000 people living near the border had already been displaced since October, when the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and Israeli forces began exchanging near-daily fire against the backdrop of the war in Gaza. As the fighting intensifies, the number of evacuees is expected to rise. In Beirut and beyond, schools were quickly repurposed to receive the newly displaced as volunteers scrambled to gather water, medicine and mattresses. In the coastal city of Sidon, people seeking shelter streamed into schools that had no mattresses to sleep on yet. Many waited on sidewalks outside. Ramzieh Dawi had arrived with her husband and daughter after hastily evacuating the village of Yarine, carrying just a few essential items as airstrikes boomed nearby. 'These are the only things I brought,' she said, gesturing at the three tote bags she carried. Fatima Chehab, who came with her three daughters from the area of Nabatieh, said her family had been displaced twice in quick succession. 'We first fled to stay with my brother in a nearby area, and then they bombed three places next to his house,' she said. Some people waited for hours in gridlocked traffic to get to what they hoped would be safety. The Israeli military warned residents in eastern and southern Lebanon to evacuate ahead of a widening air campaign against what it said were Hezbollah weapons sites. More than 490 people were killed in Lebanon on Monday, officials said, and more than 1,240 people were wounded — a staggering toll for a country still reeling from a deadly attack on communication devices last week. That attack was widely blamed on Israel, which has not confirmed or denied responsibility. Israeli officials have said they are ramping up pressure against Hezbollah in an attempt to force it to stop firing rockets into northern Israel so that tens of thousands of displaced Israelis can return home. Hezbollah has said it will only stop when there is a cease-fire in Gaza. At a public high school in the capital’s Ras al-Nabaa neighborhood, a few dozen men, women and children were milling around as volunteers registered them. Yahya Abu Ali, who fled with his family from the village of Doueir in Lebanon’s Nabatieh district, struck a defiant tone. 'Don’t think that an airplane or a missile will defeat us, or that a wounded person or a martyr on the ground will weaken us,' he said. 'On the contrary, it gives us strength, determination, and resilience.' But Abu Ali also admitted that he was worried about his four siblings and their families who remained behind in southern Lebanon. 'God willing, I hope they will make it out,' he said. Minar al-Natour, a volunteer at the school, said the team on the ground was still in 'early stages' of preparations to host the larger numbers expected to arrive. 'We’re securing medicine, water, and of course all the essential supplies,' she said. In Beirut’s Aisha Bakkar neighborhood — where some residents had received messages instructing them to evacuate — shop owner Mazen al-Hakeem said most had not heeded the call. 'There is no fear but there is anticipation,' he said. 'People are filling their tanks with fuel, storing food and groceries. They are taking their precautions.' Imran Riza, the U.N.'s humanitarian coordinator for Lebanon, said in a statement the international body had allocated $24 million in emergency funding for people affected by the fighting. With its economy in shambles and Beirut still recovering from a massive port explosion in 2020, Lebanon is 'grappling with multiple crises, which have overwhelmed the country’s capacity to cope,' Riza said. 'As the escalation of hostilities in south Lebanon drags on longer than we had hoped, it has led to further displacement and deepened the already critical needs,' Riza said. ——- Associated Press journalists Abby Sewell, Ali Sharafeddine and Sarah El Deeb in Beirut and Ahmad Mantash in Sidon, Lebanon, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-hezbollah-displaced-3fa69d5575ed7167d65e9a58ef770e24	2024-09-23T09:57:57-07:00	
Soccer pitch collapses as parts of the UK are hit by flash floods	LONDON (AP) — A soccer pitch in London collapsed and other parts of the United Kingdom were submerged by flash floods Monday after some areas saw a month's worth of rainfall in 24 hours. Roads were closed, some train lines in London were suspended and dozens of people reported their houses being submerged as parts of central and southern England saw about 60 to 80 millimeters (2 to 3 inches of rainfall. A few locations were expected to be hit by more than 120 mm (4.7 inches) of rain, weather forecasters said. In the capital, the London Fire Brigade said emergency responders received some 350 flood-related calls. The service said these included rescuing people trapped in cars, assisting people from their homes and responding to flooding in underground train stations, roadways, homes and businesses. At the Cherry Red Records Stadium, AFC Wimbledon's soccer pitch, heavy rains appeared to have left a sinkhole in the pitch, resulting in the cancellation of a match scheduled on Tuesday.	https://apnews.com/article/britain-uk-rain-floods-354e360d80facefd431864e4b041e7e4	2024-09-23T08:05:14-07:00	
Italy holds a trial into the killing of a woman that sparked debate over femicide	ROME (AP) — The trial into the brutal killing of a 22-year-old woman started in Italy on Monday, in a case that shocked the country and fueled debate over the cultural roots of surging gender-based violence. Authorities say Giulia Cecchettin’s ex-boyfriend, Filippo Turetta, also 22, has confessed to fatally stabbing her in Fosso, near Venice, on Nov. 11, 2023, just days before she was due to graduate with a biomedical engineering degree. He now faces charges including voluntary manslaughter, aggravated by premeditation and kidnapping, and risks life imprisonment. A verdict is expected in early December, local media reported. Prosecutors say Turetta couldn't handle it when Cecchettin broke up with him, and that he lured Cecchettin to take one last shopping trip with him and eat together before killing her. The woman’s body, with more than 20 stab wounds, was found at the bottom of a ditch. Turetta fled to Germany, was caught and is now in prison awaiting for the Venice court’s verdict. Cecchettin’s case has grabbed headlines in Italy and worldwide, shedding a new light over the problem of femicide, which has become worryingly common across the Italian peninsula. In 2023 alone, 120 women were killed in Italy and more than half of them died at the hands of their partners or former partners. Cecchettin’s murder sparked outrage across the nation because of the brutality of the killing and the age of both the alleged killer and the victim. Turetta wasn’t present at Monday’s hearing, but his lawyer Giovanni Caruso told reporters that he would likely make court appearances in the future. Several of Cecchettin’s relatives have requested to be admitted as civil plaintiffs in the trial and her family has claimed about 1 million euros ($1.1 million) in damages. Cecchettin’s father, Gino, said on Monday that he wasn't seeking 'any revenge' and was fully confident in the court's decision. At his daughter's funeral last December, he had called for men to be 'agents of change' in a culture that 'undervalues the lives of women,’’ urging them 'not to turn away in front of signs of violence, even the slightest.' Giulia’s sister, Elena, has repeatedly pointed at a cultural factor in her killing and other femicide cases in Italy, blaming a patriarchal society in which male violence and control has long been accepted.	https://apnews.com/article/italy-woman-killed-femicide-trial-868aea144441ca5eadc127b74faaa4c5	2024-09-23T07:19:06-07:00	
US is sending more troops to the Middle East as violence rises between Israel and Hezbollah	WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. is sending additional troops to the Middle East in response to a sharp spike in violence between Israel and Hezbollah forces in Lebanon that has raised the risk of a greater regional war, the Pentagon said Monday. Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder would provide no details on how many additional forces or what they would be tasked to do. The U.S. currently has about 40,000 troops in the region. On Monday, the aircraft carrier USS Truman, two destroyers and a cruiser set sail from Norfolk, Virginia, headed to the Mediterranean on a regularly scheduled deployment, opening the possibility that the U.S. could keep both the Truman and the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, which is in the Gulf of Oman, nearby in case further violence breaks out. 'In light of increased tension in the Middle East and out of an abundance of caution, we are sending a small number of additional U.S. military personnel forward to augment our forces that are already in the region. But for operational security reasons, I’m not going to comment on or provide specifics.' The new deployments come after significant strikes by Israeli forces against targets inside Lebanon that have killed hundreds and as Israel is preparing to conduct further operations. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday warned Lebanese civilians in a videotaped message to evacuate their homes ahead of a widening air campaign. He spoke as Israeli warplanes continued to strike alleged Hezbollah targets in southern and eastern Lebanon. The State Department is warning Americans to leave Lebanon as the risk of a regional war increases. 'Due to the unpredictable nature of ongoing conflict between Hezbollah and Israel and recent explosions throughout Lebanon, including Beirut, the U.S. Embassy urges U.S. citizens to depart Lebanon while commercial options still remain available,' the State Department cautioned Saturday. Ryder would not say if those additional forces might support the evacuation of those citizens if needed. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin held back-to-back calls with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant over the weekend as he pressed for a cease-fire and a reduction of tensions in the region, Ryder said. 'Given the tensions, given the escalation, as I highlighted, there is the potential for a wider regional conflict. I don’t think we’re there yet, but it’s a dangerous situation,' Ryder said. The U.S. presence in the Middle East is designed both to help defend Israel and protect U.S. and allied personnel and assets. Navy warships are scattered across the region, from the eastern Mediterranean Sea to the Gulf of Oman, and both Air Force and Navy fighter jets are strategically based at several locations to be better prepared to respond to any attacks.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-violence-war-hezbollah-63a15fa390a94acf46ef886cc5fb88db	2024-09-23T06:56:08-07:00	
Southeast US under major storm warning as hurricane watch issued for parts of Cuba and Mexico	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Hurricane watches were issued for parts of Cuba and Mexico on Monday as a cluster of storms located south of the Cayman Islands was expected to strengthen into a major hurricane in upcoming days while moving north toward the U.S., forecasters said. The disturbance is forecast to become Hurricane Helene on Wednesday as it approaches the Gulf Coast, according to the National Hurricane Center. 'It could certainly become a major hurricane, which is Category 3,' Brad Reinhart, a senior hurricane specialist at the center, said in a phone interview. 'People in the Florida Panhandle and the west coast of Florida certainly need to pay close attention.' Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency in 41 counties on Monday as a result of the expected storm. Reinhart said that it's too early to forecast where it might make landfall. He warned 'there's always some potential' for it to strengthen into a Category 4 storm, but said it might not be the most likely outcome. He said the disturbance could become a tropical storm by Tuesday, and that tropical storm conditions could affect parts of Florida on Wednesday as it approaches. It could turn into a major hurricane by the time it reaches the northeast Gulf Coast on Thursday. 'It’s a pretty aggressive forecast for intensification over the next few days,' he said. 'People need to remain on high alert.' Very warm sea temperatures are forecast to fuel formation of a tropical storm, which is forecast to quickly strengthen into a hurricane thanks to favorable conditions that include a moist atmosphere, which supports thunderstorm developments, and light upper-level winds at more than 10,000 feet (around 3,000 meters), Reinhart said. The cluster of storms was about 100 miles (160 kilometers) southwest of Grand Cayman on Monday. It had maximum sustained winds of 35 mph (55 kph) and was moving north-northwest at 7 mph (11 kph). A hurricane watch was in effect for the Cuban province of Pinar del Rio and eastern Mexico from Cabo Catoche to Tulum. A tropical storm warning was in effect for Grand Cayman; eastern Mexico from Rio Lagartos to Tulum; and for the Cuban provinces of Artemisa, Pinar del Rio and the Isle of Youth. A tropical storm watch was in effect for Florida's Dry Tortugas and the Lower Keys south of Seven Mile Bridge. 'While it is too soon to pinpoint the exact location and magnitude of impacts, the potential for life-threatening storm surge and damaging hurricane-force winds along the coast of the Florida Panhandle and the Florida west coast is increasing,' the center said in a statement. Up to 8 inches of rain is forecast for western Cuba and the Cayman Islands with isolated total of some 12 inches (30 centimeters). Up to 4 inches (10 centimeters) of rain is expected for the eastern Yucatán Peninsula, with isolated total of more than 6 inches (15 centimeters) inches. Heavy rainfall also is forecast for the Southeast U.S. starting on Wednesday, threatening flash and river flooding, according to the National Hurricane Center. Up to 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain was forecast for the region, with isolated totals of 10 inches (25 centimeters). Meanwhile, up to 4 feet (1.2 meters) of storm surge is forecast for parts of Cuba and Mexico. On Monday, authorities in the Cayman Islands closed schools as forecasters warned of heavy flooding associated with the disturbance, which is due to cut a path between Cuba and Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula late Tuesday night. The Cayman Islands was already experiencing elevated tides unrelated to the cluster of storms, and waves of up to 10 feet (3 meters) are expected, said Shamal Clarke with the Cayman Islands Weather Service. 'Flooding will become an issue for a lot of residents,' he said. Helene would be the eighth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has predicted an above-average Atlantic hurricane season this year because of record-warm ocean temperatures. It forecast 17 to 25 named storms, with four to seven major hurricanes of Category 3 or higher.	https://apnews.com/article/caribbean-us-tropical-storm-hurricane-helene-a1582935d0b9002bc8993b483c203206	2024-09-23T06:45:58-07:00	
Iran's president accuses Israel of seeking wider Mideast war and laying 'traps' to lead Iran into it	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Iran’s president accused Israel on Monday of seeking a wider war in the Middle East and laying 'traps' to lead his country into a wider conflict. Masoud Pezeshkian told about two dozen media representatives that Iran doesn’t want to see the current war in Gaza and airstrikes across the Israeli-Lebanon border expanded. He said while Israel insists it doesn’t want a wider war, it is taking actions that show otherwise. Pezeshkian pointed to the deadly explosions of pagers, walkie-talkies and other electronic devices in Lebanon last week, which he blamed on Israel, and the assassination of Hamas' political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on the eve of his inauguration. 'They are dragging us to a point where we do not wish to go,' the Iranian leader said of Israel. 'There is no winner in warfare. We are only fooling ourselves' if we believe that. Asked when Iran will respond to the killing of Haniyeh, he replied: 'We will give our answer in an appropriate time and place.' Pezeshkian said the Iranian drone and missile attacks on Israel, which came in April in response to attack on an Iranian consular building in Syria’s capital that Tehran blamed on Israel, proved its defensive capabilities. He insisted that Iran would not supply Russia with ballistic missiles to attack Ukraine. 'We have never approved Russia’s aggression on Ukraine,' he said. He said the two countries should establish a dialogue. Pezeshkian was asked about Iran's nuclear program following the Trump administration's withdrawal from its 2015 nuclear deal with the U.S., Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany which has seen Tehran expand its uranium enrichment from 3.67% purity to 60% purity, making many countries in the West nervous that it is seeking to make a nuclear weapon. Would Iran go back to low-enriched uranium and give up its stockpile of high enriched uranium if the nuclear deal is restored? The Iranian president reiterated that weapons of mass destruction have no place in Iran and its military structures.	https://apnews.com/article/united-nations-iran-529d09bced2d3c579df5ab025b467a55	2024-09-23T06:40:48-07:00	
Election 2024 Latest: Trump and Harris work to expand their coalitions in final weeks of election	The lines that have long defined each party’s policy priorities are blurring as Kamala Harris and Donald Trump seek to expand their coalitions in the final weeks of a fiercely competitive presidential election. The contest may well hinge on how many disaffected suburban Republicans vote for Harris and how much of Democrats’ traditional base — African Americans, Latinos, young people and labor union members — migrates to Trump. That’s prompting both candidates to take stances that would have once been anathema to their bases, scrambling longtime assumptions about what each party stands for. Trump traveled to the swing state of Pennsylvania on Monday to speak about his plans to counter U.S. reliance on China with a group led by a loyalist who served as his top intelligence official. The event on Monday focuses on proposals to increase America’s food supply and to protect U.S. farmers. Harris will visit Pennsylvania on Wednesday. Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: Trump listens to farmers before raucous Pennsylvania rally Donald Trump spoke Monday to a small group of farmers in Smithton in rural Pennsylvania, breaking with his usual campaign form by listening more than he talked. The former president asked questions and offered a few jokes. But he mostly listened quietly as farmers from the area explained their economic difficulties. Trump also stopped at a market and gave a woman checking out a $100 bill to help pay for groceries — further showing off a softer side. He reverted back to form during a raucous evening event in Indiana, Pennsylvania, sharply criticizing Vice President Kamala Harris and suggesting without evidence that this year’s contest would be the last election should he lose. 'I don’t like anybody that doesn’t like me, I’ll be honest,' he said before adding, 'sounds childish' but 'that’s the way it is ... call it a personality defect.' Walz slams Trump's ‘drill baby, drill’ catchphrase, warns about climate change Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz told a group of about 30 donors focused on climate change that Trump’s energy catchphrase to 'drill baby, drill' is 'not a solution to things, and the public knows that it’s a cheap, easy thing.' The Democratic vice presidential nominee, speaking at a midtown Manhattan hotel to an audience that included former presidential candidate Tom Steyer and Hollywood producer Jeffrey Katzenberg, called climate change an 'existential threat' but also 'an incredible opportunity to grow our economy.' Walz cited farmers who use their land to generate wind energy in addition to growing crops. He also praised Harris for casting the tie-breaking vote in the U.S. Senate on the Inflation Reduction Act, Biden’s 2022 law to flight climate change. Walz is scheduled to speak at a series of fundraisers in New York on Monday. Vance and Walz pick stand-ins to prepare for vice presidential debate Doppelgangers have been selected to help prepare for the vice presidential debate next week. Walz’s mock debates will feature Pete Buttigieg, the U.S. transportation secretary, playing JD Vance. Meanwhile, Vance’s preparations include Minnesota Rep. Tom Emmer in the role of Walz. The choices were disclosed by people with knowledge of the candidates’ preparations Walz and Vance are scheduled to face off on Oct. 1. Harris reaches agreement on transition planning with Biden administration Vice President Kamala Harris’ transition team has reached an agreement with the General Services Administration to accept pre-election support from the federal government to prepare for her potential presidency. The agency, which is required by law to offer office space, technology support and other resources to major party nominees, posted the agreement to its website on Monday. The signed memorandum, which governs IT, record-keeping and ethics policies, is dated Sept. 19. There was no word on whether former President Donald Trump’s team would reach an agreement before Election Day. But the agency said it was prepared to provide services to the Trump transition team once an agreement is executed and services are accepted. Transition planning is well under way across the federal government in advance of the Jan. 20, 2025 handoff by President Joe Biden to Trump or Harris. Last week, Chief of Staff Jeffrey Zientshosted a meeting of the White House Transition Coordinating Committee — the government’s senior-most transition planning group — and for the first time this year included Harris and Trump representatives. And agencies are preparing detailed briefing memos on their activities to share with the eventual winner’s team. Trump is set to travel to Pennsylvania stops focused on countering China Donald Trump is back on the campaign trail Monday and expected to travel to the swing state of Pennsylvania to speak about his plans to counter the U.S. reliance on China with a group led by a loyalist who served as his top intelligence official. The former president and Republican presidential nominee is attending the 3 p.m. Eastern event in a rural area outside of Pittsburgh hosted by the Protecting America Initiative, which is led by Richard Grenell, Trump’s former acting director of national intelligence, and former New York congressman Lee Zeldin. Trump has embraced tariffs as he tries to appeal to working-class voters who oppose free-trade deals and the outsourcing of factories and jobs. The event on Monday focuses on proposals to increase America’s food supply and to protect U.S. farmers. The National Agricultural Law Center estimates 24 states ban or limit foreigners without residency and foreign businesses or governments from owning private farmland. The issue emerged after a Chinese billionaire bought more than 130,000 acres near a U.S. Air Force base in Texas and another Chinese company sought to build a corn plant near an Air Force base in North Dakota. Later on Monday, Trump is expected to rally voters at 7 p.m. Eastern in Indiana, Pennsylvania, a town east of Pittsburgh, where he is hoping conservative, white working-class voters help him pull ahead of Vice President Kamala Harris, his opponent. Harris is also visiting Pennsylvania on Wednesday. Man accused in apparent assassination attempt left note indicating he intended to kill Trump The man accused in the apparent assassination attempt of Donald Trump at a golf course in Florida left behind a note saying that he intended to kill the former president and maintained in his car a handwritten list of dates and venues where Trump was to appear, the Justice Department said Monday. The new allegations were included in a detention memo filed by the Justice Department. During a hearing Monday, U.S. Magistrate Ryon McCabe agreed with the Justice Department that 58-year-old Ryan Wesley Routh should remain locked up as the case moves forward, saying the 'weight of the evidence against the defendant is strong.' The note, addressed 'Dear World,' was dropped off at the home of an unidentified person who contacted federal authorities following the arrest last Sunday of Ryan Wesley Routh. The box, which also contained ammunition, a metal pipe and other items, was not opened by the person until after Routh was taken into custody.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-harris-pennsylvania-campaigns-election-china-99af5a930a206b62f88cc62b38970047	2024-09-23T06:11:19-07:00	
Is this war? The Israeli-Hezbollah conflict is hard to define — or predict	Israel is bombing targets across many parts of Lebanon, striking senior militants in Beirut and apparently hiding bombs in pagers and walkie-talkies. Hezbollah is firing rockets and drones deep into northern Israel, setting buildings and cars alight. But no one is calling it a war — not yet. Israeli officials say they are not seeking war with Hezbollah and that it can be avoided if the militant group halts its attacks and backs away from the border. Hezbollah also says it doesn't want a war but is prepared for one — and that it will keep up the strikes on Israel that it began in the wake of ally Hamas' Oct. 7 attack until there is a cease-fire in Gaza. Israel and Hezbollah have repeatedly traded fire since then — but the intensity rose to another level Monday, when Israeli airstrikes killed more than 270 people, according to Lebanese officials. That would make it the deadliest day in Lebanon since Israel and Hezbollah last went to war in 2006. 'If someone had told me or most analysts in summer 2023 that Hezbollah is striking Israeli bases in Israel, and Israel is striking southern Lebanon and parts of southern Beirut, I would have said, okay, that’s an all-out war,' said Andreas Krieg, a military analyst at King’s College London. The term hasn't yet been applied to the current conflict because 'there haven’t been any boots on the ground,' but that might be 'the wrong metric,' he added. Is there any agreed definition of war? Merriam-Webster defines war as 'a state of usually open and declared armed hostile conflict between states or nations.' Scholars generally expand that definition to cover large-scale violence involving insurgents, militias and extremist groups. But any attempt at greater precision is difficult since armed conflicts run the gamut from states clashing with tanks and fighter jets to lower-level fighting. Sometimes states officially declare war, as Israel did after Hamas' attack last year. It has not made a similar declaration with regard to Hezbollah, but it has linked its strikes against the group to the war in Gaza, saying last week that allowing tens of thousands of residents to safely return to the north is an objective in that conflict. Israel’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, also frequently talks about an ongoing war with Iran and its allies along 'seven fronts,' including Lebanon. States often refrain from declaring war even when they are plainly engaged in one. Russia officially refers to its invasion of Ukraine as a 'special military operation' and has banned public references to it as a war. The United States has not formally declared war since World War II, even as it took part in major conflicts in Korea, Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan. Why does neither side want to call it a war? Part of the reason neither Israel nor Hezbollah is using the word 'war' is because they both hope to achieve their aims without setting off a more severe conflict — or being blamed for one. 'Though tensions are flaring, the situation in southern Lebanon is not that of a full-scale war as both Hezbollah and Israel hope to use limited means to pressure one another,' said Lina Khatib, a Middle East expert at Chatham House. With its rocket and drone attacks, Hezbollah hopes to pressure Israel to agree to a cease-fire with Hamas — a fellow Iran-backed militant group — and to avoid being seen as bowing to Israeli pressure. Hezbollah has said it would cease the attacks if there were a truce in Gaza, but the prospects for such a deal appear remote. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to do whatever is necessary to halt the attacks so that displaced Israelis can return to their homes. 'I think the Israelis are trying to either tell Hezbollah, you come to the negotiation table and we’ll settle this through diplomacy, or we’ll push you into a corner until you overreact,' Krieg said. 'And that will be the all-out war.' What might a full-scale war look like? Until recently, experts generally agreed that any future war between Israel and Hezbollah would look like the war they fought in 2006 — but much, much worse. For years, Israeli officials warned that in any future war with Hezbollah, the army would exact a punishing toll on Lebanon itself, destroying critical infrastructure and flattening Hezbollah strongholds. It came to be known as the Dahiyeh Doctrine, named for the crowded southern Beirut district where the militant group is headquartered, and that suffered heavy destruction in 2006. Hezbollah, meanwhile, spent years expanding and improving its arsenal, and is believed to have some 150,000 rockets and missiles capable of hitting all parts of Israel. The military build-up and threats created a situation of mutual deterrence that kept the border largely quiet from 2006 until October of last year. For most of the past year, the region has been braced for the worst, but both sides have showed restraint, and the talk of 'all-out war' has been hypothetical. That could change at any time. 'We’ve gone up a step, but we haven’t yet made it to the penthouse floor,' said Uzi Rabi, the director of the Moshe Dayan Center for Middle Eastern and African Studies at Tel Aviv University. 'At the end, I don’t see there’s going to be any alternative to a ground operation.' Is it definitely a war if there's a ground invasion? Any Israeli decision to send tanks and troops into southern Lebanon would mark a major escalation and lead many to categorize the conflict as a war. But the two don't necessarily always go hand in hand. Israel officially declared war in Gaza nearly three weeks before it sent any ground troops in. Israeli ground forces have been operating in the occupied West Bank for decades, and in recent months have routinely launched airstrikes against militants, without anyone suggesting it's a war. A limited Israeli ground incursion might still leave room for both sides to back down. Of course, Lebanon would likely see a ground invasion as a blatant violation of its sovereignty and an act of war. But Beirut already accuses Israel of routinely violating its airspace and of occupying disputed territory along the border. In fact, the two countries are already officially in a state of war, and have been since 1948. ___ Associated Press writers Abby Sewell and Kareem Chehayeb in Beirut, and Melanie Lidman in Jerusalem contributed. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-conflict-war-57eb5ef4a77f3bcc0d2b920bc4536706	2024-09-23T05:30:28-07:00	
Tugboat powered by ammonia sails for the first time, showing how to cut emissions from shipping	KINGSTON, N.Y. (AP) — On a tributary of the Hudson River, a tugboat powered by ammonia eased away from the shipyard dock and sailed for the first time to show how the maritime industry can slash planet-warming carbon dioxide emissions. The tugboat used to run on diesel fuel. The New York-based startup company Amogy bought the 67-year-old ship to switch it to cleanly-made ammonia, a new, carbon-free fuel. The tugboat’s first sail on Sunday night is a milestone in a race to develop zero-emissions propulsion using renewable fuel. Emissions from shipping have increased over the last decade — to about 3% of the global total according to the United Nations — as vessels have gotten much bigger, delivering more cargo per trip and using immense amounts of fuel oil. CEO Seonghoon Woo said he launched Amogy with three friends to help the world solve a huge, pressing concern: This backbone of the global economy has not started to transition to clean energy yet. 'Without solving the problem, it’s not going to be possible to make the planet sustainable,' he said. 'I don’t think this is the problem of the next generation. This is a really big problem for our generation.' The friends met while studying at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In their free time during the COVID-19 pandemic, they brainstormed how to power heavy industries cleanly. They launched their startup in November 2020 in a small space at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. The name Amogy comes from combining the words ammonia and energy. They looked for a boat and found the tug in the Feeney Shipyard in Kingston, New York, languishing without a mission. It could break ice, but little to no ice has formed on that part of the Hudson River in recent years, so it was available for sale. 'It represents how serious the problem is when it comes to climate change,' Woo said. The project, he said, is 'not just demonstrating our technology, it’s really going to be telling the story to the world that we have to fix this problem sooner than later.' They named the tugboat NH3 Kraken, after the chemical formula for ammonia and their method of 'cracking' it into hydrogen and nitrogen. Amogy's system uses ammonia to make hydrogen for a fuel cell, making the tug an electric-powered ship. The International Maritime Organization set a target for international shipping to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by, or close to, 2050. Shipping needs to cut emissions rapidly and there are no solutions widely available today to fully decarbonize deep-sea shipping, according to the Global Maritime Forum, a nonprofit that works closely with the industry. There is a lot of interest in ammonia as an alternative fuel because the molecule doesn’t contain carbon, said Jesse Fahnestock, who leads the forum’s decarbonization work. Ammonia is widely used for fertilizer, so there is already infrastructure in place for handling and transporting it. Ton for ton, it can hold more energy than hydrogen, and it can be stored and distributed more easily. 'It certainly has the potential to be a main or even the main fuel,' Fahnestock said. 'It has a potentially very friendly greenhouse gas footprint.' Ammonia does have drawbacks. It's toxic. Nearly all of it currently is made from natural gas in a process that is harmful for the climate. And burning it has to be engineered carefully or it, too, yields traces of a powerful greenhouse gas. Amogy’s technology is different. The tugboat ran on green ammonia produced by renewable electricity. A 2,000-gallon tank fits in the old fuel tank space, for a 10-to 12-hour day at sea. It splits liquid ammonia into its constituents, hydrogen and nitrogen, then funnels the hydrogen into a fuel cell that generates electricity for the vessel without carbon emissions. The process does not burn ammonia like a combustion engine would, so it primarily produces nitrogen in its elemental form and water as emissions. The company says there are trace amounts of nitrogen oxides that it's working to completely eliminate. Amogy first used ammonia to power a drone in 2021, then a tractor in 2022, a semi-truck in 2023, and now the tugboat to prove the technology. Woo said their system is designed to be used on vessels as small as the tugboat and as large as container ships, and could also make electricity on shore to replace diesel generators for data centers, mining and construction, or other heavy industries. The company has raised about $220 million. Amazon, an enterprise with immense needs for shipping, is among the investors. Nick Ellis, principal of Amazon’s $2 billion Climate Pledge Fund, said the company is excited and impressed by what Amogy is doing. By investing, Amazon can show ship owners and builders it wants its goods delivered with zero emissions, he added. 'Many folks will now get a chance to see and understand how real and promising this technology is, and that it could actually be in container ships or tugboats in a matter of a few years,' he said. 'If you would've asked five years ago, I think a lot of people would have thrown up their hands ... And suddenly we have not only a compelling example, but a commercially-viable example. These types of things don’t come by every day.' Other companies are developing ammonia-powered ships that still use some diesel. In Singapore in March, Fortescue's Green Pioneer vessel showed how ammonia could be used in combination with diesel as a marine fuel. An ammonia-powered container ship, the Yara Eyde, will be on water in 2026 with an engine running on green ammonia, according to Yara Clean Ammonia. In Japan, the NYK Group converted the tugboat Sakigake to run on ammonia rather than liquified natural gas. As a next step, Amogy is working with major shipbuilders to bring ammonia power to the maritime sector. South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean is purchasing its technology. HD Hyundai and Samsung Heavy Industries are working with Amogy on ship designs. Sangmin Park said that because Amogy has made significant progress in proving ammonia's potential as a clean fuel, 'we expect the industry to move towards adoption more quickly.' Park is senior vice president at HD Hyundai subsidiary HD Korea Shipbuilding &amp; Offshore Engineering. 'For the past few years, the industry has recognized the potential of ammonia as a zero-carbon fuel,' Park wrote in an email, 'but actually building and sailing the first vessel is a true landmark event.' ___ McDermott reported from Providence, R.I. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Jill Biden reveals $500 million plan that focuses on women's health at Clinton Global Initiative	NEW YORK (AP) — First lady Jill Biden on Monday unveiled a new set of actions to address health inequities faced by women in the United States, plans that include spending at least $500 million annually on women's health research. Jill Biden made the announcement at this year’s Clinton Global Initiative annual meeting in New York, moments before the organization honored President Joe Biden with the 2024 Clinton Global Citizen Award. 'He's provided a playbook for getting things done,' former President Bill Clinton, said as he presented the award. 'We honor him today, not just for what he's accomplished, but for the way he has done it.' President Biden, standing next to his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Clinton Foundation Vice Chair Chelsea Clinton, joked, 'This is what you call being trapped.' In his short remarks, he then called Jill Biden's announcement one of the most substantial of his administration. The additional government spending will mainly come from the Department of Defense, which provides medical care to more than 230,000 active duty military women and nearly 2 million military retirees, as well as their family members. The research will focus on why these women experience endocrine, hematological and other immunity-related disorders twice as often as men. 'Women are really hungry for this kind of information,' Jill Biden said. 'We don't have the answers.' Another change will take effect next week, with a new policy that includes women's health at every step of the research funded by Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs, which funded 751 grants last year to study Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis, lupus, orthopedic and musculoskeletal injuries, and various cancers. The commitment was among the largest of the more than 100 expected at the two-day meeting of political, business and philanthropic leaders gathering to address some of the world’s most pressing issues. The Clintons have set this year’s theme as 'What’s Working,' a way to look for potential solutions and effective programs in tumultuous times. 'You don’t look at a problem and say, ‘That’s impossible,' Bill Clinton said in his opening remarks. 'You don’t just throw up your hands. You roll up your sleeves.' An example of that strategy came from the announcement that a wide-ranging group of 15 nonprofits, humanitarian aid organizations and other funders will join forces to address the humanitarian crisis in Sudan following more than a year of conflict. The Coalition for Mutual Aid in Sudan – which includes The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, Global Giving, Global Fund for Women, and The Unitarian Universalist Service Committee — will donate at least $2 million to mutual aid groups in the country by the end of the year. It also pledged to raise another $4.5 million for those groups within the next two years. Patricia McIlreavy, president of the Center for Disaster Philanthropy, which has been representing the coalition, said that, while much more aid is needed, the collaboration and problem-solving of the group is an important step forward. 'It gets us started,' McIlreavy told The Associated Press. 'And it models the behavior you want to see from others. If you wait until it’s the perfect opportunity, you’ve missed many of the opportunities that were good enough.' World Food Program director Cindy McCain said earlier this month that ' Sudan’s nearly a forgotten crisis ' and that 25 million people there already face acute hunger. Last week, the top United Nations humanitarian official said fighting is escalating in the conflict that began in April 2023 when long-simmering tensions between Sudan’s military and paramilitary leaders broke out in the capital Khartoum and spread to other regions. The U.N. says more than 14,000 people have been killed and 33,000 injured. 'With ongoing impediments to a large-scale international aid response, Sudanese community groups have become the primary frontline responders and are currently the most effective means of reaching millions on the brink of starvation,' Patricia McIlreavy, president of the Center for Disaster Philanthropy, said in a prepared statement on behalf of the coalition. 'With so many lives on the line, the imperative to support local aid efforts in Sudan has never been more urgent.' The Center for Disaster Philanthropy says more than 12 million people have been forced from their homes in Sudan, creating what is now the world’s largest displacement and hunger crisis. The danger from the conflict has prevented most international aid agencies from delivering supplies to those in need. Greg Milne, the Clinton Global Initiative CEO who convened a panel in April to raise awareness and support for the Sudanese people, said the new coalition is an example of what bringing organizations from varied sectors can do. 'We know strong, diverse partnerships can help address often overlooked and even dire challenges, and develop unexpected and innovative solutions,' he said. Philanthropic leaders, including Bill Gates, World Central Kitchen founder Jose Andres, Open Society Foundations President Binaifer Nowrojee, and Rockefeller Foundation President Raj Shah will share information about their work during CGI, as will Prince Harry, who will discuss the launch of The Archewell Foundation Parents’ Network, which supports parents of children harmed online. In his Tuesday appearance, the Duke of Sussex will also address his work with the World Health Organization and others to reduce violence against children, an issue he and his wife Meghan outlined on a recent trip to Colombia. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley, Kosovo President Vjosa Osmani Sadriu, and Latvian President Edgars Rinkevics are set to address the conference, as are CEOs from Pfizer, Mastercard, IKEA, Pinterest, Sanofi and Chobani. _____ Associated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Iran pardons Grammy Award winner whose song became an anthem to the 2022 protests	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — An Iranian Grammy Award winner said on Monday he was pardoned from serving a three-year sentence over his song that became an anthem to the 2022 protests that rocked the country following the death of Mahsa Amini in police custody. Shervin Hajipour, who was presented his Grammy in 2023 by U.S. first lady Jill Biden, uploaded a video story on Instagram, looking overcome with emotion and saying: 'A new order had been issued regarding amnesty, and it included my case which has been completely dismissed, adding he learned about the case dismissal on Sunday. His song, 'Baraye,' or 'For' in English, begins with: 'For dancing in the streets,' 'for the fear we feel when we kiss.' The lyrics list reasons that young Iranians posted online for why they had protested against Iran’s ruling theocracy after Amini died for not wearing her mandated headscarf to the liking of security forces. The protests quickly escalated into calls to overthrow Iran’s clerical rulers. A subsequent security crackdown killed more than 500 people, with more than 22,000 detained. On Friday, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei pardoned and commuted the sentences of 2,887 prisoners. It is unclear whether Hajipour's case was part of the amnesty order. Two months ago, Hajipour announced that he was ordered to head to prison to serve a sentence of three years and eight months which a court handed him in March. He had already served some prison time but was out on bail in 2023 pending the court’s decision	https://apnews.com/article/iran-shervin-hajipour-grammy-mahsa-amini-amnesty-ebcd60fa8d8b0e94534c05be103494ba	2024-09-23T03:51:54-07:00	
Ban sought for Chinese, Russian software and hardware used in autonomous vehicles on US roads	NEW YORK (AP) — A ban on the sale of connected and autonomous vehicles in the U.S. that are equipped with Chinese and Russian software and hardware is being sought by the U.S. Commerce Department, with the stated goal of protecting national security and U.S. drivers. The measure announced Monday is proactive but critical, the agency said, given that all the bells and whistles in cars like microphones, cameras, GPS tracking and Bluetooth technology could make Americans more vulnerable to bad actors and potentially expose personal information, from the home address of drivers, to where their children go to school. In extreme situations, a foreign adversary could shut down or take simultaneous control of multiple vehicles operating in the United States, causing crashes and blocking roads, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo told reporters on a call Sunday. 'This is not about trade or economic advantage,' Raimondo said. 'This is a strictly national security action. The good news is right now, we don’t have many Chinese or Russian cars on our road.' But Raimondo said Europe and other regions in the world where Chinese vehicles have become commonplace very quickly should serve as 'a cautionary tale' for the U.S. Security concerns around the extensive software-driven functions in Chinese vehicles have arisen in Europe, where Chinese electric cars have rapidly gained market share. 'Who controls these data flows and software updates is a far from trivial question, the answers to which encroach on matters of national security, cybersecurity, and individual privacy,' Janka Oertel, director of the Asia program at the European Council on Foreign Relations, wrote on the council’s website. Vehicles are now 'mobility platforms' that monitor driver and passenger behavior and track their surroundings. A senior administration official said that it is clear from terms of service contracts included with the technology that data from vehicles ends up in China. Raimondo said that the U.S. won't wait until its roads are populated with Chinese or Russian cars. 'We're issuing a proposed rule to address these new national security threats before suppliers, automakers and car components linked to China or Russia become commonplace and widespread in the U.S. automotive sector,' Raimondo said. It is difficult to know when China could reach that level of saturation, a senior adminstration official said, but the Commerce Department says China hopes to enter the U.S. market and several Chinese companies have already announced plans to enter the automotive software space. The Commerce Department added Russia to the regulations since the country is trying to 'breathe new life into its auto industry,' senior administration officials said on the call. The proposed rule would prohibit the import and sale of vehicles with Russia and China-manufactured software and hardware that would allow the vehicle to communicate externally through Bluetooth, cellular, satellite or Wi-Fi modules. It would also prohibit the sale or import of software components made in Russia or the People's Republic of China that collectively allow a highly autonomous vehicle to operate without a driver behind the wheel. The ban would include vehicles made in the U.S. using Chinese and Russian technology. The proposed rule would apply to all vehicles, but would exclude those not used on public roads, such as agricultural or mining vehicles. Commerce officials met with all the major auto companies around the world while it drafted the proposed rule to better understand supply chain networks, according to senior administration officials, and also met with a variety of industry associations. While there is minimal Chinese and Russian software deployed in the U.S, the issue is more complicated for hardware. That's why Commerce officials said the prohibitions on the software would take effect for the 2027 model year and the prohibitions on hardware would take effect for the model year of 2030, or Jan. 1, 2029, for units without a model year. The Commerce Department is inviting public comments, which are due 30 days after publication of a rule before it's finalized. That should happen by the end of the Biden Administration. The new rule follows steps taken earlier this month by the Biden administration to crack down on cheap products sold out of China, including electric vehicles, expanding a push to reduce U.S. dependence on Beijing and bolster homegrown industry. _____ AP Business Writer David McHugh contributed to this story from Frankfurt, Germany.	https://apnews.com/article/commerce-autonomous-vehicles-national-security-china-russia-a895bbbbe59ae915aad2f0980b7acf08	2024-09-23T03:45:25-07:00	
A Soyuz capsule with 2 Russians and 1 American from the International Space Station returns to Earth	MOSCOW (AP) — A Soyuz capsule carrying two Russians and one American from the International Space Station landed Monday in Kazakhstan, ending a record-breaking stay for the Russian pair. The capsule landed on the Kazakh steppe about 3 1/2 hours after undocking from the ISS in an apparently trouble-free descent. In the last stage of the landing, it descended under a red-and-white parachute at about 7.2 meters per second (16 mph), with small rockets fired in the final seconds to cushion the touchdown. The astronauts were to be extracted from the capsule and placed in nearby chairs to help them adjust to gravity, then given medical examinations in a nearby tent. Oleg Kononenko and Nikolai Chub returned after 374 days aboard the space station; on Friday they broke the record for the longest continuous stay there. Also in the capsule was American Tracy Dyson, who was in the space station for six months. Eight astronauts remain in the space station, including Americans Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who have remained long past their scheduled return to Earth. They arrived in June as the first crew of Boeing’s new Starliner capsule. But their trip was marred by thruster troubles and helium leaks, and the U.S. space agency NASA decided it was too risky to return them on Starliner. The two astronauts are to ride home with SpaceX next year.	https://apnews.com/article/soyuz-capsule-international-space-station-a069a2a905122d03bd653d8157e05f5b	2024-09-23T03:36:22-07:00	
9 European Union nations pledge to turn the Mediterranean into a green energy hub	LARNACA, Cyprus (AP) — Officials from nine southern European Union member countries said Monday they're focused on harnessing offshore wind and solar energy to try to turn the Mediterranean region into a renewable energy hub and stave off the risks of climate change. The energy ministers of Cyprus, Slovenia and Malta, Croatia’s economy minister as well as officials from Greece, Italy, France, Portugal and Spain said in a joint statement that they’re working on setting up joint renewable energy projects across borders without the red tape that could potentially repel investors. They called on the European Commission to head a new study on the region’s renewable energy potential on which 'informed decision-making and concrete action' will be taken on moving ahead green energy projects. The statement came at the MED9 Energy Ministerial Meeting in Larnaca. George Papanastasiou, energy minister of host Cyprus, told reporters that so-called MED9 countries are looking at ways of generating green energy from offshore platforms because of the growing scarcity of land in Mediterranean countries on which to build such projects. Papanastasiou said that some countries have already undertaken offshore wind energy pilot projects in shallow waters, whose results will be studied by fellow MED9 nations to tailor their own facilities. There are also plans for wave-generated energy and floating photovoltaic units since there’s greater capacity in southern Europe for such technologies owing to abundant sunlight. Spain’s Energy Agency Director-General Joan Groizard said that Mediterranean countries 'can and must be at the forefront of the energy transition,' because they are the most vulnerable to climate change. A key challenge to tapping offshore wind and solar energy generation facilities is plugging them into existing onshore power grids and interconnections to transmit to other countries. Greece’s ambassador to Cyprus, Ioannis Papameletiou, said that the Aegean has among the highest wind power capacities in the EU, noting that there is 'great room for cooperation and exchange of best practices.' He said that Greece has set a target of introducing 2 gigawatts of wind power to its energy mix by 2030, expanding that to 10 GW by 2040 and 17 GW by 2050. Italy’s ambassador to Cyprus, Federica Ferrari Bravo, said: 'Affordable green energy is also a powerful tool for peace.'	https://apnews.com/article/europe-renewable-energy-hub-meeting-larnaca-mediterranean-9deb40e67ddb8839d37a8b5a7c4dfd49	2024-09-23T03:30:57-07:00	
Malaysian police rescue 187 more children as sex abuse probe of Islamic group deepens	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — Malaysian police said Monday they have rescued 187 more children and raided locations nationwide linked to an Islamic business group that is being investigated for alleged sexual assault of children. National police chief Razarudin Husain said the children and young people, including 59 under age 5, were rescued from welfare homes linked to Global Ikhwan Services and Business, or GISB Holdings. They included a boy who was seen being caned and another child who was seen being stepped on in online videos, he said. That brought the number of children under age 18 who have been rescued to 572 since the case against GISB erupted earlier this month, he said, Police also arrested 156 more suspects for investigation, he said. Police say some children are believed to have been sodomized and taught to sexually abuse each other, denied medical treatment and burned with hot metal spoons as punishment. Medical screening so far has determined that at least 13 teens were sodomized and 172 children suffered long-term physical and emotional injuries. The victims are mostly children of GISB employees, placed in the homes since they were infants and believed to be indoctrinated from a young age to be loyal to the group, police say. The increased police action against GISB came after the country's king called for a swift police investigation and action in the case, which has shocked and enraged the nation. GISB, which aims to promote an Islamic way of life, owns mini-markets, bakeries, restaurants, pharmacies and other businesses in Malaysia and abroad. It has its roots in the Al Arqam Islamic sect, which was deemed heretical and banned by the government in 1994. Last week, police detained members of GISB's top management, including CEO Nasiruddin Mohamad Ali, two of his wives and two of his children. Some family members of the late Ashaari Mohamad, who headed Al Arqam before his death in 2010, were also arrested. Nasiruddin earlier admitted there may have been some sodomy cases in the homes but denied any widespread abuse. Razarudin said there were an estimated 10,000 employees and followers of GISB who were believed to be practicing the Al Arqam teachings. Islamic authorities are investigating, he said. He said police have raided 280 locations nationwide linked to GISB, but most have been vacated. In 59 of the locations, police seized Islamic books and materials with deviant teachings, he said. Authorities have frozen 138 bank accounts linked to GISB with a total value of about 1.9 million ringgit ($452,000), and 14 properties as part of a probe into money laundering, he said. Several people have been charged with sexual assault of children.	https://apnews.com/article/malaysia-islam-child-sexual-abuse-f881f8fe7bba6afe17b20c7b5524e7f0	2024-09-23T03:03:01-07:00	
Who is Anura Kumara Dissanayake, Sri Lanka's new Marxist president?	COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) — Marxist politician Anura Dissanayake won Sri Lanka’s presidential election over the weekend, dealing a blow to a political old guard that has been widely blamed for the unprecedented economic crisis that hit the South Asian island nation two years ago. Dissanayake, whose pro-working class populist campaign won him youth support, secured victory over opposition leader Sajith Premadasa, the runner up; and incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who took over the country two years ago after its economy hit bottom. Dissanayake is the leader of National People’s Power alliance, and of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, or People’s Liberation Front, a Marxist political party that waged two unsuccessful armed insurrections in 1970s and 1980s to capture power through socialist revolution. Early interest in politics Born on Nov. 24, 1968 into an ordinary family in a paddy-growing central part of Sri Lanka, Dissanayake was politically active from his school days, taking part in student demonstrations against an agreement with India to grant a degree of self rule to Sri Lanka's Tamil minority in an effort to resolve the demands for autonomy that later erupted into a decades-long civil war. Dissanayake political involvement was further sharpened when he entered university to read for his science degree and joined the Socialist Students’ Union, the student wing of the JVP, which had already staged one armed insurrection in 1971 before giving up arms and entering politics. In 1987, the JVP started its second armed insurrection after the government banned the movement, aiming at overturning the deal with India and overthrowing the government. Dissanayake went underground as the government stepped in to violently crush the insurrection, killing the group's leader Rohana Wijeweera and nearly all of its top members. Several thousands were killed by the JVP and government forces and their agents in the course of the insurgency and its suppression. Parliamentary politics Dissanayake entered public politics in 1993, working to rebuild the party under a new leader-in-exile, Somawansa Amarasinghe. The party won its first seat in Parliament in 1994, signalling its re-entry into democratic politics. Dissanayake became national organiser of the Socialist Students’ Union in 1997 and the same year, he was added to to the Central Committee of the JVP. One year later, he joined the party's politburo. Dissanayake was elected to Parliament in 2000, and when the JVP entered an alliance with President Chandrika Kumaratunga, he briefly served as agriculture and irrigation minister. That alliance was formed to oppose a cease-fire agreement signed between then-Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the now-defeated Tamil Tiger rebels to resolve the separatist conflict that had blown into a full scale civil war. Later, Dissanayake and the JVP backed former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to militarily defeat the rebels in 2009. He was elected JVP leader in 2014, after a party schism in which a radical left wing broke off to form a new party. A new coalition Having realised that it was not possible to come to power through his party alone, Dissanayake formed the NPP in 2019, bringing together 21 groups including political parties, youth groups, women’s groups, trade unions and other civil society groups. Since the formation of the coalition, Dissanayake has moved away from his far leftist stance. Although he remains head of a Marxist party, he now says that he supports a free market economy. He ran for president as the head of the NPP for the first time in 2019, losing to Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who was forced to flee two years later because of protests driven by the country's economic crisis. Vows to end austerity and corruption Dissanayake enters office with a raft of promises to improve standards of living and clean up government. His main campaign theme was accountability, promising that politicians and officials will be held responsible for their actions. He's also promised to end corruption and privileges for politicians and retired presidents. But supporters are also counting on him to ease up on the punishing austerity imposed by the country's deal with the IMF. He's promised to keep the deal alive with changes, given its importance to the ongoing economic recovery. He's also pledged to encourage local businesses instead of relying solely on foreign investments. For the country's Tamil minority, Dissanayake's election offers little hope. During the campaign, he rejected devolving more power to the north and east, where most Tamils live, and investigating incidents during the civil war that U.N. investigators said could amount to war crimes. Tens of thousands of Tamil civilians were killed during the final months before the Tamil Tiger rebels' defeat.	https://apnews.com/article/sri-lanka-dissnayake-marxist-president-b451271b4bd9bf4318a76b599fe9d0b0	2024-09-23T02:23:57-07:00

Ukraine accuses Russia of seeking to illegally control strategic sea as arbitration hearings open	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — Ukraine on Monday accused Russia of seeking to illegally seize control of the strategically important Sea of Azov and Kerch Strait, as hearings opened in a high-stakes arbitration case between Kyiv and Moscow. The hearings at the Permanent Court of Arbitration are the latest in a string of international legal cases involving Russia and Ukraine linked to Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Crimea and its 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, even as fighting continues to rage on battlefields in Ukraine. 'Russia wants to take the Sea of Azov and Kerch Strait for itself, and so it has built a great gate at the entrance to keep international shipping out while allowing small Russian river vessels in,' Ukrainian representative Anton Korynevych told a panel of arbitrators. The gate he referred to is a bridge built by Russia across the Kerch Strait after the annexation of Crimea. The $3.5-billion, 19-kilometer (12-mile) bridge linking the Black and Azov seas carries road and rail traffic on separate sections and is vital to sustaining Russia’s military operations in southern Ukraine. 'The bridge is unlawful and it must come down,' Korynevych told the arbitration panel. Ukraine filed the case in 2016, two years after Russia annexed Crimea. It accuses Moscow of subsequently breaching a United Nations maritime treaty by building the bridge, barring Ukrainian fishermen from waters they traditionally fished, damaging the environment and plundering underwater archeological sites. Kyiv is seeking unspecified compensation. Russia insists the arbitration court does not have jurisdiction. It says that if its five judges decide they do have jurisdiction, the court should dismiss Ukraine's claims. 'Ukraine’s accusations in this case are, of course, completely groundless and hopeless,' Russian Agent Gennady Kuzmin told the panel. He argued that the Sea of Azov and Kerch Strait constitute 'internal waters' that are not covered by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the treaty Ukraine alleges Russia is breaching. After Monday's two opening statements, the panel hearings will continue for days behind closed doors. A final ruling could take years. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-russia-crimea-black-sea-arbitration-ebff5d19717be783e6703e2ca0e492e1	2024-09-23T00:51:37-07:00	
4 migrants die trying to reach eastern Greek island in small boat	ATHENS, Greece (AP) — At least four migrants died in the eastern Aegean Sea on Monday when a small boat bringing them from nearby Turkey sank in wind-tossed waters just off the island of Samos, Greek authorities said. The coast guard said five other people were rescued after the accident, but it was unclear how many had originally been on the boat and whether any more were missing. Greek state-run ERT television and an international medical charity said the boat was thought to have been carrying at least 30 passengers. The coast guard said a number of migrants were later located on Samos, but it could not be immediately established whether they were survivors from the shipwreck or had arrived separately in another boat. The bodies of four women were found during a large search and rescue operation involving three coast guard patrol boats, a private vessel, an air force helicopter and crews on land. The alarm was raised by a local resident who heard screams and cries for help from the sea, local officials said. It was not known how the boat, believed to have been a small dinghy, sank, and there was no immediate information on the identities or nationalities of the survivors and the dead. Sonia Balleron, the head of the Greece mission for the international medical charity Doctors Without Borders, said the group was 'shocked and outraged' by the sinking and was providing emergency support to the survivors. 'These deaths are the tragic consequence of inhumane migration policies,' Balleron said in a statement. Human rights groups accuse European authorities of failing to provide legal migration paths for people seeking a better life in the continent. Greece lies along one of the most popular routes into the European Union for people fleeing conflict and poverty in the Middle East, Africa and Asia. Despite a crackdown by Greek authorities along the land and sea border with Turkey, thousands of people make it across, often from the Turkish coast to Greek islands using flimsy inflatable dinghies. In recent months, smugglers have also increasingly turned to ferrying migrants in powerful speedboats. ___ Follow AP’s global migration coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/migration	https://apnews.com/article/greece-migrants-boat-251fe1871079a1283a138094c04f3be0	2024-09-23T00:43:02-07:00	
Cholera is spreading in Sudan as fighting between rival generals shows no sign of abating	CAIRO (AP) — Cholera is spreading in war-torn Sudan, killing at least 388 people and sickening about 13,000 others over the past two months on Monday, health authorities said, as more than 17 months of fighting between the military and a notorious paramilitary group shows no sign of abating. Artillery shelling hit an open market Monday in Omdurman, the sister city of the capital, Khartoum, killing at least 13 people and wounded more than 30 others, the health ministry said. The disease is spreading in areas devastated by recent heavy rainfall and floods especially in eastern Sudan where millions of war displaced people sheltered. The casualties from cholera included six dead and about 400 sickened over the weekend, according to Sunday’s report by the Health Ministry. The disease was detected in 10 of the country’s 18 provinces with the eastern Kassala and al-Qadarif provinces the most hit, the ministry said. Cholera is a fast-developing, highly contagious infection that causes diarrhea, leading to severe dehydration and possible death within hours when not treated, according to the World Health Organization. It's transmitted through the ingestion of contaminated food or water. The disease isn't uncommon in Sudan. A previous major outbreak left at least 700 dead and sickened about 22,000 in less than two months in 2017. Sudan was plunged into chaos in April last year when simmering tensions between the military and a powerful paramilitary group, the Rapid Support Forces, exploded into open warfare across the country. The fighting, which wrecked the capital, Khartoum, and other urban areas has been marked by atrocities including mass rape and ethnically motivated killings that amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, especially in the western region of Darfur, according to the United Nations and international rights groups. Monday's shelling hit the Sabrian market in Karari district in Omdurman, said Mohamed Ibrahim, the health ministry’s spokesman. He blamed the RSF on the attack. It has killed at least 20,000 people and wounded tens of thousands others, according to the U.N. However, rights groups and activists say the toll was much higher. The war also has created the world’s largest displacement crisis. More than 13 million people have been forced to flee their homes since the fighting began, according to the International Organization for Migration. They include over 2.3 million who fled to neighboring countries. Devastating seasonal floods and cholera have compounded the Sudanese misery. At least 225 people have been killed and about 900 others were injured in the floods, the Health Ministry said. Critical infrastructure has been washed away, and more than 76,000 houses have been destroyed or damaged, it said. Famine was also confirmed in July in the Zamzam camp for displaced people, which is located about 15 kilometers (10 miles) from North Darfur’s embattled capital of al-Fasher, according to global experts from the Famine Review Committee. About 25.6 million people — more than half of Sudan’s population — will face acute hunger this year, they warned. Fighting, meanwhile, rages in al-Fasher, the last major city in Darfur that is still held by the military. The RSF has been attempting to retake it since the start of the year. Last week, the paramilitary force and its allied Arab militias launched a new attack on the city. The military said its forces, aided by rebel groups, managed to repel the attack and kill hundreds of RSF fighters, including two senior commanders.	https://apnews.com/article/sudan-war-military-rsf-cholera-floods-58a79359f12ae879dddf69721167528b	2024-09-22T23:43:41-07:00	
Britain's Treasury chief tries to turn on the economic optimism after months of gloomy talk	LIVERPOOL, England (AP) — British Treasury chief Rachel Reeves promised on Monday not to return to an era of public spending cuts despite the dire state of the U.K.’s national finances, as she tried to inject a dose of optimism after weeks of negative headlines for the country’s new Labour Party government. Reeves used a speech to Labour’s annual conference to try and reassure party members, jittery despite a recent landslide election victory, that her first budget next month won’t be all doom and gloom. Reeves promised 'there will be no return to austerity' and said the government will invest in industry, infrastructure and green energy to reverse declines in 'growth, productivity and family incomes.' 'My optimism for Britain burns brighter than ever,' said Reeves, the first woman to hold the 800-year-old post of Chancellor of the Exchequer. The center-left party is gathering in the northwest England port city of Liverpool three months after winning power in Britain’s July 4 election. While Labour’s return to office after 14 years in opposition has many delegates buzzing, some are anxious about the government’s faltering start and downbeat economic messaging. Prime Minister Keir Starmer won the election on a promise to banish years of turmoil and scandal under the Conservatives, get Britain’s sluggish economy growing and restore frayed public services such as the state-funded National Health Service. Since then, he has struck a gloomy note, saying there is a 22 billion pound ($29 billion) 'black hole' in the public finances left by the Conservative government, and warning that 'things will get worse' before they get better. That has many party members worried that tax increases and spending cuts loom in the Oct. 30 budget. 'Conservative austerity was a destructive choice for our public services -– and for investment and growth too,' Reeves said about spending cuts imposed by previous governments after the 2008 global financial crisis. 'We must deal with the Tory legacy and that means tough decisions. But we won’t let that dim our ambition for Britain.' Reeves sketched out how the government hopes to fill some of the fiscal black hole without raising income tax, sales tax or corporation tax, all of which she has ruled out. Measures include a crackdown on tax avoiders and a drive to claw back money defrauded from contracts issued during the COVID-19 pandemic. Contentiously, the government has also announced that it will save money by stripping millions of retirees of a payment intended to help heat their homes in winter. Trade unions that are among Labour’s funders and allies hope to secure a vote among conference delegates opposing the decision to remove the winter fuel allowance, worth between 200 and 300 pounds ($262 and $393), from all but the poorest pensioners. The result would not be binding but would add to pressure on the government over the unpopular new policy. Reeves said she knew 'that not everyone in this hall or in the country' agreed with the decision on winter fuel payments. But, she said, 'I judged it the right decision in the circumstances that we inherited.' That drew one of several round of applause from hundreds of delegates in a packed hall. The crowd booed when a heckler shouting about British arms sales to Israel stood and briefly interrupted the speech. But the government faces a tougher crowd outside the Labour conference bubble. Research released Monday by pollster Ipsos found 62% of respondents dissatisfied with the way that the government is running the country, up 14 percentage points since July, and 25% satisfied. Ipsos interviewed 1,009 adults by telephone and the margin of error is plus or minus three percentage points. 'The honeymoon is over,' said Gideon Skinner, the pollster’s head of politics research. 'We shouldn’t underestimate how much concern and pessimism there is.' The party’s mood has also been dampened by a tempest over Starmer’s acceptance of freebies at a time when millions of people are struggling with the cost of living. Starmer insists he followed the rules when he took thousands of pounds worth of clothes and designer eyeglasses from Waheed Alli, a media entrepreneur and Labour donor. But after days of negative headlines, the party says Starmer won’t accept any more free outfits. Neither will Reeves or Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner, both of whom also received donations for clothing. Starmer will try to change the subject and rally the Labour troops in his speech Tuesday at the autumn conference, a blend of pep rally, policy forum and boozy bash that plays a key role in maintaining morale among party activists. He’ll point to the government’s early actions, including ending a wave of public-sector strikes, and plans to take public ownership of the railways, set up a state-owned green energy firm, impose tougher rules on water companies that dump sewage and strengthen rights for workers and renters. Last year’s Labour conference fizzed with optimism, as a party that had lost four straight elections sensed power was within its grasp. If the mood this year is more muted, it will likely be more upbeat than next week’s gathering by the Conservatives, which suffered their worst-ever election defeat in July. The Tory convention in the central England city of Birmingham will be dominated by the contest to replace former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak as party leader and internal arguments about how to chart a way back to power.	https://apnews.com/article/uk-labour-conference-economy-rachel-reeves-294d85eaff3e01b3fabcb1c183246a95	2024-09-22T22:29:18-07:00	
Vatican confirms plans for Belgium, Luxembourg trip after pope cancels audiences due to illness	VATICAN CITY (AP) — The Vatican confirmed that plans remain in place for Pope Francis to go to Belgium and Luxembourg later this week, despite having canceled all his audiences Monday because of a 'slight flu-like state.' Vatican spokesperson Matteo Bruni said the cancellation only concerned Monday's audiences. He spoke to reporters before the official start of his Vatican briefing to illustrate details of the trip. Earlier in the morning, the Vatican announced that Francis had canceled his audiences Monday as a 'precaution.' Francis is due to visit Luxembourg on Thursday and then spend the rest of the week in Belgium, ending with a Mass in Brussels on Sunday. The 87-year-old pope, who has been using a wheelchair for two years, has battled a series of health problems in recent years and had part of one lung removed as a young man because of a respiratory infection. He has had a packed schedule of audiences since returning from a four-nation, 11-day journey through Asia on Sept. 13, which was the longest and farthest trip of his pontificate. The audiences have included multiple meetings with visiting bishops, individual audiences with his Vatican aides as well as a big encounter on Friday with members of popular movements. The statement from the Holy See press office described Francis as having a 'flu-like state.' Through much of last autumn and winter, Francis battled acute bronchitis and recurring bouts of influenza, which forced him to cancel a quick trip to Dubai in November to participate in the U.N. climate conference. He did so, the Vatican said at the time, at the recommendation of his doctors. In Belgium, Francis is due to celebrate the 600th anniversary of the country’s main Catholic universities, and minister to Belgians who have been rocked by years of unrelenting revelations of clergy sexual abuse and cover-up. The challenging Asia trip, followed so closely by the Belgium and Luxembourg visit, was already going to test Francis' health, especially as he heads into a busy autumn. As soon as he returns from Belgium, he is due to preside over a three-week synod, or meeting of bishops, which involves long days of closed-door debate about the future of the church. Francis' scheduled audiences on Monday included with the members of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, who are meeting at the Vatican this week for their plenary assembly, and participants in a Christmas contest. The Vatican published the texts Francis was supposed to have delivered to both. Francis has had several health problems in recent years. In 2023, he spent three days in the hospital receiving intravenous antibiotics to treat a respiratory infection. In 2021, he had 13 inches (33 centimeters) of his colon removed, and then had a follow-up surgery two years later to repair an abdominal hernia and to remove scar tissue.	https://apnews.com/article/pope-francis-ill-belgium-luxembourg-843dfa87718f376da2033a80b05ba396	2024-09-22T22:08:57-07:00

John rapidly strengthens into a hurricane off southern Mexico's Pacific coast	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Hurricane John ripped toward Mexico's southern coast on Monday after rapidly intensifying over the eastern Pacific Ocean, surprising authorities who called for residents of some coastal areas to head for cover. The U.S. National Hurricane Center said John had 'rapidly strengthened' into a hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 105 mph (165 kph). The storm was close to the coast — about 30 miles (45 kilometers) south of Punta Maldonado and it was moving north at 8 mph (15 kph). John was barreling forward as a Category 2 hurricane Monday afternoon, but was forecast to continue strengthening into a major hurricane late Monday or early Tuesday. John’s forecast path continued shifting so the point of landfall remained uncertain. The center said dangerous winds and storm surges, as well as 'life-threatening' flash floods in the Pacific coast near Oaxaca, a hub of resort towns, were 'imminent'. The unexpected surge in strength caught scientists, authorities and residents of the area by surprise, something AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Matt Benz attributed to warmer oceans, which add fuel to the hurricanes. As a result, surprise surges in hurricanes' strength have become increasingly common, Benz said. 'These are storms that we haven’t really experienced before,' he said. 'Rapid intensification has occurred more frequently in modern times as opposed to back in the historical record. So that’s telling us there’s something going on there.' Things were tense in Oaxaca’s coastal cities on Monday shortly after the announcement as residents and businesses were bracing themselves. Authorities appeared to be responding quickly to the shift in forecast. Laura Velázquez, the federal coordinator of civil protection, told residents of Pacific coastal cities they should evacuate their homes and head to shelters in order to 'protect theirs and their family's lives.' 'It's very important that all citizens in the coastal zone ... take preventive measures,' Velázquez said. Ana Aldai, a 33-year-old employee of a restaurant located on the shores of the tourist hub Puerto Escondido, said that businesses in the area began closing after authorities ordered the suspension of all work on the area's main beaches. After authorities met Monday afternoon to plan their response, the governments of Guerrero and Oaxaca states announced they would suspend classes in a number of coastal zones on Tuesday. Oaxaca's governor said the state government had evacuated 3,000 people and set up 80 shelters. It also said it sent out 1,000 military and state personnel to address the emergency. Videos on social media from Puerto Escondido showed flip-flop-clad tourists walking through heavy rain and fishermen pulling their boats out of the water. Strong rains in previous days have already left some roads in the region in a precarious position. Aldai said she was 'a little bit distressed' because notice from authorities came quickly. 'There was no opportunity to make the necessary purchases. That also distresses us,' she said. Benz, the meteorologist, expressed concern that the storm could slow once it hits land, leaving the storm hovering over the coastal zone, which could cause even greater damage. The hurricane is bleak news for the region, which last year was walloped by Otis, a similar rapidly intensifying hurricane. Otis devastated the resort city of Acapulco, where residents had little warning of the strength of what was about to hit them. One of the most rapidly intensifying hurricanes ever seen, scientists at the time said it was a product of changing climate conditions. Otis blew out power in the city for days, left bodies scattered on the coast and desperate family members searching for lost loved ones. Much of the city was left in a state of lawlessness and thousands scavenged in stores, scrambled for food and water. The government of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador received harsh criticism for its slow response to Otis, but authorities have since pledged to pick up their speed. President-elect Claudia Sheinbaum said her government planned to work on improving an early alert system, similar to what the country has with earthquakes. Through Thursday, John is expected to produce 15 to 30 centimeters (6 to 12 inches) of rain across coastal areas of Chiapas state with more in isolated areas. In areas along and near the Oaxaca coast to southeast Guerrero, between 25 and 50 centimeters (10 and 20 inches) of rain with isolated higher totals can be expected through Thursday. 'You’re going to feel the impacts of the storm probably for the next couple of weeks to a couple of months,' meteorologist Benz added. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/tropical-storm-mexico-pacific-coast-953e70f4b7bba39ab2f705742f63b803	2024-09-22T21:29:28-07:00	
Israeli army says it has struck 300 targets in Lebanon in stepped-up pressure on Hezbollah	JERUSALEM (AP) — The Israeli military says it has struck 300 targets in Lebanon as it steps up pressure against the Hezbollah militant group. The army announced the strikes on the social media platform X, posting a photo of what is said was the military chief, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, approving additional attacks from military headquarters in Tel Aviv. It is one of the most intense barrages of airstrikes in nearly one year of fighting against Hezbollah. Halevi and other Israeli leaders have promised tougher action against Hezbollah in the coming days. As Israel was carrying out the attacks, Israeli authorities reported a series of air-raid sirens in northern Israel warning of incoming rocket fire from Lebanon. Israel earlier Monday urged residents of southern Lebanon to leave their homes in areas where it claims Hezbollah has stored weapons, warning of 'extensive strikes' there. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below. JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel on Monday urged residents of southern Lebanon to evacuate from homes and other buildings where it claimed Hezbollah has stored weapons, saying the military would conduct 'extensive strikes' against the militant group. It was the first warning of its kind in nearly a year of steadily escalating conflict and came after a particularly heavy exchange of fire on Sunday. Hezbollah launched around 150 rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel in retaliation for strikes that killed a top commander and dozens of fighters. There was no sign of an immediate exodus from the villages of southern Lebanon, and the warning left open the possibility that some residents could live in or near targeted structures without knowing that they are risk. The increasing strikes and counterstrikes have raised fears of an all-out war, even as Israel is still battling Hamas in Gaza and trying to return scores of hostages taken in Hamas' Oct. 7 attack. Hezbollah has vowed to continue its strikes in solidarity with the Palestinians and Hamas, a fellow Iran-backed militant group. Israel says it is committed to returning calm to its northern border. Associated Press journalists in southern Lebanon reported heavy airstrikes targeting many areas Monday morning, including some far from the border. Lebanon's state-run National News Agency said the strikes hit a forested area in the central province of Byblos, about 130 kilometers (81 miles) north of the Israeli-Lebanese border, for the first time since the exchanges began in October. No injuries were reported there. Israel also bombed targets in the northeastern Baalbek and Hermel regions, where a shepherd was killed and two family members were wounded, according to the news agency. It said a total of 30 people were wounded in strikes. The Lebanese Health Ministry asked hospitals in southern Lebanon and the eastern Bekaa valley to postpone surgeries that could be done later. The ministry said in a statement that its request aimed to keep hospitals ready to deal with people wounded by 'Israel’s expanding aggression on Lebanon.' An Israeli military official said Israel is focused on aerial operations and has no immediate plans for a ground operation. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity in keeping with regulations, said the strikes are aimed at curbing Hezbollah's ability to launch more strikes into Israel. Lebanese media reported that residents received text messages urging them to move away from any building where Hezbollah stores arms until further notice. 'If you are in a building housing weapons for Hezbollah, move away from the village until further notice,' the Arabic message reads, according to Lebanese media. Lebanon's information minister, Ziad Makary, said in a statement that his office in Beirut had received a recorded message telling people to leave the building. 'This comes in the framework of the psychological war implemented by the enemy,' Makary said, and urged people 'not to give the matter more attention than it deserves.' It was not immediately clear how many people would be affected by the Israeli orders. Communities on both sides of the border have largely emptied out because of the near-daily exchanges of fire. Israel has accused Hezbollah of transforming entire communities in the south into militant bases, with hidden rocket launchers and other infrastructure. That could lead the Israeli military to wage an especially heavy bombing campaign, even if no ground forces move in. The military said it had targeted more than 150 militant sites early Monday. Residents of different villages in southern Lebanon posted photos on social media of airstrikes and large plumes of smoke. The state-run National News Agency also reported airstrikes on different areas. An Israeli airstrike on a Beirut suburb on Friday killed a top Hezbollah military commander and more than a dozen fighters, as well as dozens of civilians, including women and children. Last week, thousands of communications devices, used mainly by Hezbollah members, exploded in different parts of Lebanon, killing 39 people and wounding nearly 3,000. Lebanon blamed Israel for the attacks, but Israel did not confirm or deny any responsibility. Hezbollah began firing into Israel a day after the Oct. 7 attack in what it said was an attempt to pin down Israeli forces to help Palestinian fighters in Gaza. Israel has retaliated with airstrikes, and the conflict has steadily intensified over the past year. The fighting has killed hundreds of people in Lebanon, dozens in Israel and displaced tens of thousands on both sides of the border. It has also sparked brush fires that have destroyed agriculture and scarred the landscape. Israel has vowed to push Hezbollah back from the border so its citizens can return to their homes, saying it prefers to do so diplomatically but is willing to use force. Hezbollah has said it will keep up its attacks until there is a cease-fire in Gaza, but that appears increasingly elusive as the war nears its anniversary. Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Some 100 captives are still held in Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead, after most of the rest were released during a weeklong cease-fire in November. Israel's offensive has killed over 41,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between civilians and fighters in its count. It says women and children make up a little over half of those killed. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. ___ Mroue reported from Beirut.

Marxist Anura Kumara Dissanayake sworn in as Sri Lanka's president	COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) — Marxist politician Anura Kumara Dissanayake was sworn in as Sri Lanka's president on Monday after an election that saw voters reject an old guard accused of leading the country into economic crisis. Dissanayake, 55, who ran as head of the Marxist-leaning National People's Power coalition, defeated President Ranil Wickremesinghe, opposition leader Sajith Premadasa and 35 other candidates in Saturday's election. The election came as the country seeks to recover from a severe economic crisis that led to shortages of essentials such as foods, medicines, cooking gas and fuel in 2022, triggering massive protests that forced then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to flee the country and resign. In a brief speech after the swearing-in, Dissanayake pledged to work with others to take on the country's challenges. 'We have deeply understood that we are going to get a challenging country,' Dissanayake said. 'We don’t believe that a government, a single party or an individual would be able to resolve this deep crisis. He’s the ninth person to hold Sri Lanka’s powerful executive presidency, created in 1978 when a new constitution expanded the office’s powers. Dissanayake's coalition is led by the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, or People’s Liberation Front, a Marxist party that waged two unsuccessful armed insurrections in the 1970s and 1980s to capture power through socialist revolution. After its defeat, the JVP entered democratic politics in 1994 and has been mostly in opposition since then. However, they have supported several previous presidents and been part of governments briefly. The NPP also includes groups representing academics, civil society movements, artists, lawyers and students. Just before the swearing in, Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena resigned, clearing the way for the new president to appoint a prime minister and a cabinet. Chinese president Xi Jinping congratulated Dissanayake on his victory, saying on Monday that China looks forward to working together 'to jointly carry forward our traditional friendship.' The U.S. and India previously congratulated Dissanayake. Dissanayake was first elected to Parliament in 2000 and briefly held the portfolio of agriculture and irrigation minister under President Chandrika Kumaratunga. He ran for president for the first time in 2019 and lost to Rajapaksa. Dissanayake's first major challenge will be to act on his campaign promise to ease the crushing austerity measures imposed by his predecessor Wickremesinghe under a relief agreement with the International Monetary Fund. Wickremesinghe has warned that any move to alter the basics of the agreement could delay the release of a fourth tranche of nearly $3 billion. That economic crisis resulted from excessive borrowing to fund projects that did not generate revenue, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the government’s insistence on using scarce foreign reserves to prop up its currency, the rupee.	https://apnews.com/article/sri-lanka-president-dissanayake-6fdd1908da55520a494d68967a70fc82	2024-09-22T20:22:06-07:00	
In Iran, the old-time US radio detective 'Johnny Dollar' returns to the airwaves	TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — While tensions remain high between the U.S. and Iran, there's at least one American that state radio in Tehran invites on the air each week for its millions of listeners. It's just that he's a fictional insurance fraud detective who's been on the case since 1949. 'Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar,' a radio program created by CBS that later found a devoted listenership in Iran for a Farsi-language version under Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in the 1960s, has returned to Iranian radio. It's not clear why exactly the network controlled by hard-liners have decided to bring back 'the man with the action-packed expense account,' but his reappearance harkens back to an era when Iran and the U.S. enjoyed incredibly close relations. And the newly produced episodes introduce younger generations to a character that many older Iranians still have a decades-old fondness for, their ears perking up with show’s signature start with three gunshots and Johnny Dollar answering a ringing phone with its title. 'It is amazing, it reminds me of the ‘60s and ’70s, when I listened to the episodes with my parents through a vacuum tube radio,' said Masoud Kouchaki, 73. 'We did not have any worries except for guessing how Johnny Dollar would find the murderer.' The original CBS radio show ran from 1949 until 1962 and focused on the cases of Johnny Dollar, an investigator from Hartford, Connecticut. The serial relied on the investigator's expenses account entries — like '$10 deposit on the car I rented' or 'one dollar, one drink for me' — to propel the story forward as Dollar interviewed witnesses and suspects in the transatlantic accent common to detective stories of the era. 'CBS steadfastly resisted moving it to television when television was peeling off lots of radio programing, lots of radio content, lots of radio actors,' said John F. Barber, a professor in the digital technology and culture program at Washington State University Vancouver and expert on 'Johnny Dollar' and other radio dramas of the era. 'They took a gamble that radio drama would continue to attract audiences. ... It does come at the end of the golden age of radio, before television became the primary entertainment source in America.' For Iranians, state radio first went on the air in 1940, part of the efforts by then-ruler Reza Shah to rapidly modernize the country. His son, Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, took over in 1941, and for several decades radio remained the key media consumed in his growing country, with the number of stations few and all state-controlled. Iran's version of 'Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar' dropped the expense account format but kept the noir-light vibe, dramatic music and U.S. location. Instead, the shows would end with Iranian state radio inviting the public to write in to explain what clue gave away the guilty party, with those getting it right having a chance to win a prize. Mostafa Nasiri, a 76-year-old retired engineer, remembered winning a watch as a teenager in 1966 for answering correctly. 'It was a precious gift,' he wistfully recounted. 'I got it from the office of the radio broadcaster, and I was publicly honored in the school for that. Some years later I sold it for some $70.' After Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution, the country's state radio and television broadcaster soon found itself controlled by hard-line adherents to the country's Shiite theocracy. Any program celebrating America found itself removed after the U.S. Embassy hostage crisis saw relations collapse. Tehran will celebrate the 45th anniversary of the takeover this November. In recent years, pirated Hollywood blockbusters have found their way on air in Iran's state-controlled channels. However, hard-liners remain suspicious of Western shows, dismissing them as a 'cultural invasion' targeting Iran's people. But many homes have illegal satellite dishes allowing them to watch channels abroad, while the internet and virtual private networks help Iranians circumvent censorship. That interest in the outside world likely would extend to a hard-boiled American investigator as well. 'You’ve got some guy he’s out there, you know, buying drinks, taking cabs, doing all this wonderful stuff,' said John C. Abbott, who wrote a three-volume history of the U.S. 'Johnny Dollar' series. 'Maybe it was an escape.' Despite that, Johnny Dollar seems to have passed the test, though the state-run Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcast hasn't explained its reasoning for allowing it on air on its Radio Namayesh channel. Ayoub Aghakhani, the director of the newly produced episodes, told state TV that he decided to make the episodes based on available Farsi translations to 'attract more audiences' to radio broadcasts. People have 'heard about (Johnny Dollar) from either their father or grandfather,' Aghakhani reportedly said. 'I learned that 20-, 30-year-old students are familiar with the opening phrase.' So far, state radio has broadcast nine episodes and plans to air 17 more. State radio officials did not respond to The Associated Press' questions about the show, nor did CBS in New York. Among the young, there's a collective shrug at Johnny Dollar's rebirth as many remain focused on their mobile phones. 'It is a shame that a radio station of the Islamic Republic is broadcasting an American show,' said Hamid Mohseni, a 29-year-old taxi driver. 'I will call the radio station to ask them to stop the unpleasant program.' But for those old enough to remember him, they're glad he's back on the case. 'It is beautiful to listen to the stories that revive many memories,' said Mehri Bagheri, a 68-year-old homemaker. 'Then I went to one of my friends’ homes to listen to the show and have a good time.' ___ Gambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-johnny-dollar-us-detective-radio-show-b17b5b1b01fb34874fbbe0f0417f5b46	2024-09-22T20:10:56-07:00	
Families from Tennessee to California seek humanitarian parole for adopted children in Haiti	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — At only 6 years old, Esai Reed has endured three emergency evacuations from orphanages across Haiti as gangs pillage and plunder their way through once peaceful communities. He is now in northern Haiti under the care of a U.S. organization after the director of Esai’s last orphanage fled the troubled Caribbean country where gangs control 80% of the capital. Nearly five months have passed since the last evacuation, and in that time, Esai, who loves soccer and is mischievous, hasn’t been able to talk to his adoptive mother in the U.S. or his two older brothers who live with her as internet connections and other logistics falter. 'Clearly, this is an emergency,' said Michelle Reed, a 51-year-old teacher and single mother who lives in Florida. Reed's is one of 55 families from Tennessee to California asking the U.S. government for humanitarian parole for some 70 children they’re adopting. It was an opportunity the U.S. granted to more than a dozen other children earlier this year when gangs attacked key government infrastructure and forced Haiti’s main international airport to close for nearly three months, prompting evacuations of dozens of U.S. citizens and 39 children from March to May who had final adoption decrees. Reed and other families said they were initially told they would be part of the evacuation group, but the U.S. government later said that 'despite intensive efforts,' it had not found a solution to allow children without adoption decrees to leave Haiti and enter the U.S., according to a letter from the office of children’s issues at the State Department. 'We understand that this update will be disappointing for both you and your child(ren),' the office wrote. Reed and other families warned that completing the adoption process in Haiti instead of in the U.S. as requested forces the children to travel to Port-au-Prince, which is largely under siege by gangs, to obtain a visa, passport and medical exam. 'Why aren’t they doing that for our kids?' asked Emmerson, who lives in the U.S. and requested that his last name be withheld for safety since he and his wife, who are adopting his niece and nephew, have family in Haiti. Reed noted that the Haitian Central Adoption Authority has given the families permission for the children to leave the country and complete the adoption in the U.S. But a State Department spokesperson told The Associated Press that other Haitian authorities overseeing the adoption process do not agree. It added that it’s working with the Haitian government 'to move adoptions forward as quickly as possible' while ensuring that laws, regulations and obligations are met. 'The Department is working to expedite final processing steps for additional children,' it said, adding that all Haitian government offices that process adoptions are open, 'although some offices could be intermittently closed or operating at limited capacity due to localized violence.' The department said it 'understands and empathizes with the concerns and frustration of U.S. families adopting from Haiti.' Stéphane Vincent, director of Haiti’s Directorate of Immigration and Emigration, did not return messages for comment. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security told the AP that consideration for parole applies 'to a very limited number of Haitians adoptees' who have reached a specific stage in their process. It said that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services 'is working tirelessly' with U.S. government partners 'to navigate the current circumstances.' Aside from the dangers of being in Port-au-Prince, families note their cases could be further delayed because Haitian judges have been on strike while others have left the country because of the violence. The U.N. noted in a recent report that ever since Haiti’s judicial year started in October 2023, 'courts have been operational for barely ten days.' Backing the families in their push to obtain humanitarian parole are lawmakers including U.S. Sens. Sherrod Brown, Marco Rubio and Rick Scott, who have written the U.S. State Department and the Department of Homeland Security on their behalf. Haiti has been under a state of emergency for several months, and the State Department has long upheld a 'do not travel' advisory, warning of kidnappings, killings, sexual assault and other crimes, adding that 'the U.S. government is very limited in its ability to help U.S. citizens in Haiti.' From April to June, at least 1,379 people were reported killed or injured, and another 428 kidnapped, according to the U.N., which noted that 88% of those crimes were in Port-au-Prince. Meanwhile, gang violence has left at least 700,000 people homeless in recent years, half of them children, William O’Neill, the U.N. independent human rights expert on Haiti, said Friday. 'All indicators remain extremely worrying,' he said during his visit to Haiti. 'The first and most concerning of them, insecurity.' Meanwhile, Kenyan police who arrived in late June as part of a U.N.-backed mission to help quell gang violence only recently launched joint operations with Haiti’s police and military as the U.S. ponders a U.N. peacekeeping operation after warning that the current mission lacks resources. 'The children are at great risk,' said Diane Kunz, executive director for the New York-based nonprofit Center for Adoption Policy. 'You have the State Department saying they can’t guarantee the protection of their own people.' In Florida, Reed worries about Esai as she tries to comfort his brothers, ages 8 and 10, who were physically and sexually abused at the orphanage and were sick and malnourished when she adopted them nearly two years ago. 'The boys are afraid for him, and they don’t want to talk about it,' she said, adding that no one told her they had a brother when she adopted them. Reed recalled how, after arriving in the U.S., her two older sons slept in a single twin bed despite having two available and held each other through the night. 'Nighttime was scary for them,' Reed said. 'They had nightmares for a long time.' Fighting alongside Reed is Emmerson and his wife, Michelle, who also asked that her name be withheld for safety. Emmerson’s mother was in Haiti looking after his niece and nephew when she had a heart attack after gangs raided their neighborhood, located near where a young U.S. missionary couple was killed earlier this year. 'They were shooting, and she passed away,' he said. 'The kids were traumatized.' After speaking with his brother, who has health issues and struggles to care for his five other children, they agreed adoption was best. But Emmerson and Michelle have not been able to visit Haiti in nearly a year given the ongoing violence. Gangs forced the children to relocate to southwest Haiti, where their family is running low on food and other basic supplies. Gunmen control the main roads leading in and out of Port-au-Prince, on occasion firing on those passing through. The boy is 6 years old and extroverted, and his sister is 'like a little old lady in a 3-year-old’s body,' Michelle said. They worry what will happen to them if they’re forced to travel to Port-au-Prince to finalize the adoption, with Emmerson recalling how his brother’s twins were kidnapped in the capital and later released, with the boy’s face slashed by gangs. 'We just don’t want that for our kids,' he said. Angela, who lives in California and asked that her last name be withheld for safety, said she and her husband are trying to adopt a 5-year-old girl who — like Reed’s youngest son — has been evacuated from orphanages three times. Angela recalled how she was on the phone with an orphanage worker and her daughter when gunfire erupted. 'Quite honestly, I didn’t know if she was going to be killed right then and there,' she said. 'Gunfire was penetrating the walls.' She said it’s terrifying to think that her daughter, who is shy and loves to read books, will have to travel to Port-au-Prince to complete the required paperwork after violence forced her to flee the city. 'It’s just not right for these children to be thrown into the war zone to meet requirements that could easily be waived,' Reed said. 'We are not looking to bypass any part of the adoption process. We want our children evacuated to safety so we have children to adopt. We don’t want them to die in Haiti.'	https://apnews.com/article/haiti-adoptions-us-gangs-violence-ddfac1a89699b90c6027ea9cc8275236	2024-09-22T20:04:12-07:00	
Israel-Hamas war latest: Israel launches intense airstrikes in Lebanon, killing over 270	Israel launched hundreds of airstrikes in southern and eastern Lebanon on Monday, killing more than 270 people, as the Israeli military called on residents to immediately evacuate places where it claimed the Hezbollah militant group stores weapons. Thousands of people fled southern Lebanon, jamming the main highway to Beirut in the biggest exodus since the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war. More than 1,000 other people were injured in the strikes, the Health Ministry said, a staggering one-day toll for the country. The Israeli military said it hit more than 800 targets Monday linked to Hezbollah weapons sites. It said it was expanding the operation to include areas of the Bekaa Valley, along Lebanon’s eastern border. Residents of different villages in southern Lebanon posted photos on social media that they said showed their towns that were being struck. The wave of airstrikes came after a day after Hezbollah fired over 100 rockets into northern Israel, with some landing near the city of Haifa. Hezbollah’s rockets were in response to an Israeli airstrike on a Beirut suburb on Friday that killed a top Hezbollah military commander and more than a dozen members, along with civilians including women and children. Last week, thousands of communications devices, used mainly by Hezbollah members, exploded in different parts of Lebanon, killing 39 people and wounding nearly 3,000. Lebanon blamed the attacks on Israel, but Israel did not confirm or deny its responsibility. ___ Here’s the latest: Israel prepares for ‘next phases’ of operations against Hezbollah JERUSALEM — Israel’s military chief says Israel is preparing its 'next phases' of operations against Hezbollah. Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi told soldiers Monday that Israel’s airstrikes were 'proactive' and targeting Hezbollah infrastructure built over the past 20 years. 'We are striking targets and preparing for the next phases,' he said, promising to release details in the near future. He says the goal of the offensive is to allow tens of thousands of displaced Israelis to return to their homes in northern Israel. Israeli military carries out targeted strike in Beirut BEIRUT — Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency is reporting an Israeli strike on a southern Beirut suburb with three missiles. Al-Manar TV of Lebanon’s Hezbollah group said six people were wounded in the strike on the Beir al-Abed neighborhood adding that they were rushed to hospital. A Hezbollah official confirmed the airstrike without giving further details. The area was cordoned and journalists were not allowed to get close to the building that was hit. Netanyahu urges Lebanese to evacuate their homes JERUSALEM — Israel’s prime minister urged Lebanese civilians to heed Israeli calls to evacuate their homes, saying 'take this warning seriously.' Benjamin Netanyahu issued the warning Monday in a videotaped message his office said was aimed at Lebanese civilians. He spoke as Israeli warplanes continued to strike alleged Hezbollah targets in southern and eastern Lebanon. Earlier Monday, Israel ordered residents in the targeted areas to leave ahead of the airstrikes. Israeli officials say Hezbollah uses civilian areas to hide weapons. 'Please get out of harm’s way now,' Netanyahu said. 'Once our operation is finished, you can come back safely to your homes.' Death toll climbs in Israeli airstrikes to 274 with 1,000 injured BEIRUT — Lebanese Health Minister Firass Abiad says 274 people have been killed in ongoing Israeli strikes Monday, and more than 1,000 injured. At a press conference in Beirut, Abiad said thousands of families have been displaced by the attacks. He also said Israeli strikes have hit hospitals, medical centers and ambulances. The Israeli military announced that it hit some 800 targets Monday, claiming it was going after Hezbollah weapons. Hezbollah launches over 100 missiles toward Israel JERUSALEM — Hezbollah launched more than 100 projectiles toward Israel on Monday, the military said, reaching deep into Israel including around the northern city of Haifa and parts of the occupied West Bank. Most of the missiles were intercepted but two people were lightly injured from falling shrapnel in northern Israel. A number of homes suffered direct hits. School was canceled in northern Israel on Sunday and Monday and Israelis were instructed to stay close to protected areas. The Israeli military said they had struck more than 800 Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon and were enlarging the operation to include eastern Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley as well. According to Lebanon’s Health Ministry, more than 180 people were killed and 700 injured, the deadliest barrage since the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war. UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon expresses ‘grave concern’ for civilians BEIRUT — The U.N. peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon expressed 'grave concern' for the safety of civilians in the south following the most intense Israeli bombing campaign since hostilities erupted in October. 'Any further escalation of this dangerous situation could have far-reaching and devastating consequences, not only for those living on both sides of the Blue Line (the border between Lebanon and Israel) but also for the broader region,' it said in a statement. It added that 'attacks on civilians are not only violations of international law but may amount to war crimes.' Lebanese health officials said more than 180 people have been killed in Israeli airstrikes Monday. It was not immediately clear how many of them were civilians. The U.N. force, known as UNIFIL, said its commander Lt. Gen. Aroldo Lázaro had contacted Lebanese and Israeli officials to urge de-escalation. Lebanese Health Ministry says 182 killed and 727 wounded in Israeli airstrikes BEIRUT — The death toll in Israeli airstrikes in southern Lebanon has risen to 182 with 727 others wounded, the Lebanese Health Ministry said. The Lebanese Red Cross told The Associated Press that all ambulance stations across the country have been mobilized, supporting paramedics in southern Lebanon. Hospitals in the south are struggling with capacity and other units from the Red Cross are helping relocate wounded people to hospitals farther north, officials said. Gaza hospitals report 24 dead and 60 wounded in last 24 hours GAZA CITY — Israeli strikes in Gaza left 24 dead and 60 wounded in the last 24 hours, the Health Ministry in the Palestinian territory said Monday. The fresh fatalities brought the overall death toll in Gaza since the war began on Oct. 7 to 41,455, and 95,878 wounded, said the ministry, which doesn’t differentiate between combatants and civilians. Israel launched its campaign vowing to destroy Hamas after the militants launched an attack on southern Israel in which they killed some 1,200 people and abducted 250 others. Israel widens aerial offensive in Lebanon JERUSALEM — The Israeli military says it is widening an aerial offensive against what it says are Hezbollah weapons sites in southern and eastern Lebanon. The military said Monday that it was expanding its airstrikes to include areas of the Bekaa Valley, along Lebanon’s eastern border, after targeting more than 300 sites in southern Lebanon. Israeli military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said residents of the Bekaa Valley must immediately evacuate areas where Hezbollah is storing weapons. Thousands flee southern Lebanon BEIRUT — Thousands of people are leaving south Lebanon and heading north after Israel intensified airstrikes on Monday, leaving 100 people dead and hundreds wounded. In the southern port city of Sidon, the main north-south highway was packed with cars heading north in the direction of the capital Beirut. Following a Cabinet meeting in Beirut Monday, Minister of Environment Nasser Yassin told reporters that some schools are being prepared in Mount Lebanon to receive those fleeing. It was the biggest wave of displacement since the summer 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war, when hundreds of thousands fled their homes in the south. Death toll in Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon rises to 100 BEIRUT — Lebanese authorities say 100 people have been killed in Israeli airstrikes in what would be the deadliest day in Lebanon in nearly a year of fighting against the Hezbollah militant group. The Lebanese Health Ministry said more than 400 others were wounded in the strikes in southern Lebanon on Monday. It said among them were women, children, and paramedics. At least 50 killed and over 300 wounded in Israeli airstrikes, Lebanon says BEIRUT — Lebanon’s Health Ministry says a wave of Israeli airstrikes on Monday has killed at least 50 and wounded more than 300 people. The ministry said that the toll was preliminary as airstrikes intensified around noon and women and children were among the dead. The airstrikes hit wide areas in southern and northeastern Lebanon. Israel’s military said it struck 300 targets across Lebanon linked to the militant group Hezbollah. Lebanon's prime minister calls on UN to ‘deter the aggression’ BEIRUT — Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister on Monday called Israel’s wave of airstrikes 'a genocide in every sense of the word.' Najib Mikati made the comments at the start of a Cabinet meeting in Beirut in which he said that Israel’s airstrikes aim to destroy Lebanon’s towns and villages. Mikati said that the Lebanese government is calling on the United Nations, the U.N. Security Council and world nations to 'deter the aggression.' Israeli strikes kill 1 and wound others in Lebanon, report says BEIRUT — Lebanon's state-run National News Agency says Israeli airstrikes on different parts of Lebanon on Monday killed at least one person and wounded others. The airstrikes hit the heights of the central province of Byblos for the first time since exchanges along the Lebanon-Israel border began in early October, NNA said. A security official confirmed the airstrike in the village of Almat. Also targeted by the early morning airstrikes were the northeastern Baalbek and Hermel regions where a shepherd was killed and two members of his family were wounded in the fields of the village of Bodai, NNA said. It added that four other people were also wounded in Bodai and were all taken to hospitals in the area. NNA also said that 11 people were wounded in the southern village of Aitaroun, including 1 in serious condition. China urges its citizens in Lebanon and Israel to leave as soon as possible or move to safe areas BEIJING — China is urging its citizens in Lebanon and Israel to evacuate or move to safe areas as the conflict between Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah is escalating. Chinese citizens in Lebanon should take commercial flights to return to China or otherwise leave Lebanon as soon as possible for their own safety, the Consular Department of China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement posted on social media platform WeChat on Monday. 'Those who need to continue to stay in Lebanon should remain highly vigilant, effectively strengthen their security precautions and emergency preparedness and avoid going to high-risk areas and sensitive areas in the south,' the statement read. On Sunday, the Chinese Embassy in Israel cautioned its citizens in the country to be prepared for any potential attacks including by missiles, rockets and drones. It added that Chinese people were advised against traveling to Israel and entering high-risk areas in the country’s north. Israel calls on Lebanese to leave homes where Hezbollah stores arms JERUSALEM — The Israeli military has called on people in southern Lebanon to immediately evacuate homes and other buildings where Hezbollah stores weapons and says it is carrying out 'extensive strikes' against the militant group. Monday's announcement was the first warning of its kind in nearly a year of low-level conflict along the border. Lebanese media reported that residents received text messages urging them to move away from any building where Hezbollah stores arms until further notice. 'If you are in a building housing weapons for Hezbollah, move away from the village until further notice,' the Arabic message reads, according to Lebanese media. It was not immediately clear how many people would be affected by the Israeli orders. Communities on both sides of the border have largely emptied out because of the near-daily exchanges of fire. Israel has accused Hezbollah of transforming entire communities in the south into militant bases, with hidden rocket launchers and other infrastructure. That could lead it to wage an especially heavy bombing campaign, even if no ground forces move in. Israel carried out dozens of airstrikes on southern Lebanon early Monday. Israeli airstrikes on Gaza Strip kill 8 Palestinians, including 5 children DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Palestinian medical officials say Israeli airstrikes on the Gaza Strip have killed eight Palestinians, including five children. A girl and her parents were killed in a strike on a school sheltering displaced people in central Gaza early Monday. The girl’s two siblings were wounded. Israel has struck several such schools-turned-shelters, saying militants hide out in them. Another strike hit a home near the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the central town of Deir al-Balah, killing a mother and her four children, aged 4 to 8. The casualties from both strikes were described in hospital records, and an Associated Press reporter saw the bodies. Israel says it tries to avoid harming civilians but rarely comments on individual strikes. Gaza’s Health Ministry says over 41,000 Palestinians have been killed since the start of the war. It does not say how many were fighters. It says a little over half were women and children. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Around 100 of the captives are still being held in Gaza, and a third of them are believed to be dead. Australia announces more aid for Gaza CANBERRA, Australia — Australia has announced it will provide an additional 10 million Australian dollars ($6.8 million) in aid to Gaza, bringing the total since the Israel-Hamas war began on Oct. 7 last year to AU$82.5 million ($56.2 million). A government statement said on Monday the new money would focus on women and children. It would be provided through the United Nations Population Fund, a sexual and reproductive health agency, and the U.N. agency responsible for aiding children, UNICEF. 'Australia continues to push for safe, rapid and unimpeded humanitarian assistance to people in desperate need, and for all aid workers to be protected,' the statement said. A new crisis for displaced Palestinians: flooding MUWASI, Gaza Strip — As the first rain of the cool season starts to fall in the Gaza Strip, displaced Palestinians living in the sprawling Muwasi tent camp are struggling to cope with flooding that is exacerbating the humanitarian crisis. Some children are entertained by the novelty of walking barefoot in the ankle-deep water, but their parents are less amused. The adults try to save what they can from their family's tents. One mother tries to dry her temporary home with a mop. 'We woke up in the morning to find the tents with rainwater pouring on us, and water from the streets entering on us,' said Rana Goza’t, a displaced person from Gaza City. 'This is the beginning of winter. What will happen in the coming days?' Suhail Al-Barawi, a displaced person from Beit Lahiya, was helping to build sand barriers to prevent more flooding in the camp. 'People wish for rain,' he said, 'and we say, ‘Oh God, do not give us rain.’' The nearly yearlong war between Israel and Hamas has displaced 90% of Palestinians in Gaza, according to the United Nations. Israel defense minister praises air strikes in Beirut Israel’s defense minister says recent attacks on Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon are a step toward facilitating the return of displaced Israelis to their homes in the north of the country. Speaking Sunday evening after visiting the military’s Northern Command headquarters, Yoav Gallant described the recent air strikes on the southern suburbs of Beirut as 'significant, important and powerful.' He says Israel will take all necessary measures to ensure 'the safe return of Israel’s northern communities to their homes.' Israeli attacks since Friday have killed dozens in Lebanon, including a veteran Hezbollah commander. Hezbollah responded with more than 100 missile attacks in northern Israel early Sunday, sending hundreds of thousands of Israelis into air raid shelters. Gallant says: 'The past week has been the most difficult in the history of Hezbollah’s existence —especially over the past day.'	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-hamas-latest-mideast-f98720a8ba13ea1239c0b8a24522aeb5	2024-09-22T20:00:08-07:00	
Alcohol-free beer is gaining popularity, even at Oktoberfest	MUNICH (AP) — The head brewmaster for Weihenstephan, the world's oldest brewery, has a secret: He really likes alcohol-free beer. Even though he's quick to say he obviously enjoys real beer more, Tobias Zollo says he savors alcohol-free beer when he's working or eating lunch. It has the same taste but fewer calories than a soft drink, he said, thanks to the brewery's process of evaporating the alcohol. 'You can't drink beer every day — unfortunately,' he joked last week at the Bavarian state brewery in the German town of Freising, about 31 kilometers (19.26 miles) north of Munich. Zollo isn't alone in his appreciation for the sober beverage. Alcohol-free beer has been gaining popularity in recent years as beer consumption shrinks. At Weihenstephan, which was founded as a brewery in 1040 by Benedictine monks, non-alcoholic wheat beer and lager now make up 10% of the volume. The increase over the last few years, since they started making alcohol-free drinks in the 1990s, mirrors the statistics for the rest of Germany's beer industry. 'The people are unfortunately — I have to say that as a brewer — unfortunately drinking less beer,' Zollo said Friday, the day before Oktoberfest officially started. 'If there’s an alternative to have the crisp and fresh taste from a typical Weihenstephan beer, but just as a non-alcoholic version, we want to do that.' Even at Oktoberfest — arguably the world's most famous ode to alcohol — alcohol-free beer is on the menu. All but two of the 18 large tents at the festival offer the drink through the celebration's 16 days. The sober beverage will cost drinkers the same as an alcoholic beer — between 13.60 and 15.30 euros ($15.12 and $17.01) for a 1-liter mug (33 fluid ounces) — but save them from a hangover. 'For people who don't like to drink alcohol and want to enjoy the Oktoberfest as well, I think it's a good option,' Mikael Caselitz, 24, of Munich said Saturday inside one of the tents. 'Sometimes people feel like they have more fun with alcohol, which is not a good thing because you can also have fun without alcohol.' He added: 'If you want to come and drink alcohol-free beer, nobody will judge you.' This year marked the first time an alcohol-free beer garden opened in Munich. 'Die Null,' which means 'the zero' in German, served non-alcoholic beer, mocktails and other alcohol-free drinks near the city's main train station this summer but was scheduled to close a few day before Oktoberfest opened. Walter König, managing director of the Society of Hop Research north of Munich, said researchers have had to breed special hops varieties for alcohol-free beer. If brewers use the typical hops for alcohol-free beer, the distinct aroma gets lost when the alcohol is reduced during the brewing process. But customers don't care about that, König said Friday as he prepared for Oktoberfest. 'They only want to know that what they are tasting is as good as traditional beers with alcohol,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/oktoberfest-alcoholfree-beer-munich-e1279f6e24f406fa04ead4b09f4bbcbe	2024-09-22T19:13:59-07:00	
Stock market today: Wall Street drifts higher to set more records	NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes reached new heights Monday after drifting higher in a quiet day of trading. The S&amp;P 500 rose 16.02 points, or 0.3%, to 5,718.57 and edged past its record set on Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 61.29 points, or 0.1%, to its own all-time high set on Friday and closed at 42,124.65. The Nasdaq composite gained 25.95, or 0.1%, to 17,974.27. Tesla led the way with a gain of 4.9% and clawed back all its sharp losses from earlier in the year. It was down as much as 42% at one point in April, when it was cutting prices on its cars to boost flaccid sales. That helped offset a 10.3% tumble for Trump Media &amp; Technology Group, which fell to its lowest price since taking its place on the Nasdaq stock market in March. The company behind former President Donald Trump’s Truth Social network has dropped six straight days amid speculation about when Trump and other company insiders may sell their shares now that they’re no longer bound by a 'lock-up' agreement. Trump has said he doesn’t plan to sell. Financial markets have broadly been romping higher after the Federal Reserve last week cut its main interest rate for the first time in more than four years by an unusually large amount. The hope is that as it continues to cut interest rates, the boost given to the U.S. economy through lower rates for car loans, mortgages and other borrowing will help it avoid a recession. But some critics say the Federal Reserve may be moving too late, with the job market already slowing, and call stock prices too high. A report on Monday morning suggested U.S. business activity is not growing as quickly as economists expected, mostly because of a continued downturn in manufacturing. The preliminary report from S&amp;P Global said U.S. manufacturing shrank more severely in September than in August and hit a 15-month low. It’s been one of the parts of the economy hurt most by high interest rates. The overall figures suggest a U.S. economy that’s still growing at a healthy rate, according to Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. 'But there are some warning lights flashing, notably in terms of the dependence on the service sector for growth, as manufacturing remained in decline, and the worrying drop in business confidence.' He also pointed to subdued business expectations given uncertainty heading into the U.S. elections in November. Several economic reports coming later in the week could offer more context about where the U.S. economy stands. One on Thursday will offer the final revision for the U.S. economy’s growth in the spring, and another on Friday will give a look at how much U.S. consumers are spending. Such reports, particularly on employment, are taking top priority on Wall Street because the main fear is now a slowdown in the job market. It’s a notable shift from prior years, when Wall Street’s attention was fixed on anything related to inflation. But now that inflation has come down substantially from its peak two summers ago, the Fed has shifted gears. It feels less need to keep rates high in order to slow the economy enough to stifle inflation, hence last week’s cut of half a percentage point to its main interest rate. And it feels more pressure to prop up the job market and overall economy, hence its plans to keep cutting interest rates this year and next. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury held steady at 3.74%, where it was late Friday. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which moves more with expectations for Fed action, edged down to 3.58% from 3.60% late Friday. In stock markets abroad, indexes rose modestly in Europe after preliminary data suggested business activity in the euro zone is weaker than economists expected. Germany’s DAX rose 0.7%, while the French CAC 40 rose 0.1%. In Asia, movements for indexes were also muted. Indexes rose 0.4% in Shanghai but slipped 0.1% in Hong Kong after China’s central bank lowered its 14-day reverse repurchase rate on Monday. That followed its decision last week to keep key lending rates unchange, when investors had been expecting a cut. ___ AP Writer Zimo Zhong contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/stock-markets-fed-china-rates-efe102c3b9007cb9abff468aa006f995	2024-09-22T19:13:50-07:00	
Case of Mexico's 43 missing students persists among tens of thousands of disappearances	MEXICO CITY (AP) — All countries have crimes that resonate. In Mexico, one of the modern day ones is the disappearance of 43 students from a rural teacher’s college in 2014. Ten years later, it’s still not clear where the students from the Rural Normal School at Ayotzinapa are. Authorities believe they were killed, but have only turned up small bone fragments from three of them. The families, with the support of the school known for its radical activism, continue to demand justice. They maintain a lack of political will is responsible for not finding the truth. If it was a 'state crime' as the current administration says, the government must know what happened and who is hiding information. Why is the case still alive? In a country with more than 115,000 registered disappearances, this case continues to hold the public’s attention because it combined cartel violence and corrupt authorities and remains stubbornly unresolved. It’s considered an emblematic case and another example of abuses that occurred decades ago in Mexico’s dirty war and were never corrected. What happened on Sept. 26? The students were attacked by security forces linked to a local drug gang, Guerreros Unidos, in Iguala, when the students were stealing buses to transport themselves to a protest. During the administration of Enrique Peña Nieto (2012-2018), authorities said the students had gone to Iguala, Guerrero to protest at an event — the mayor, now jailed, was linked to local gang Guerreros Unidos. They were allegedly mistaken for members of a rival gang. The Peña Nieto administration said that Guerreros Unidos had abducted and killed the students, burned their bodies in a huge fire and tossed their ashes into a river. But investigations by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, the successor Attorney General’s Office and a Truth Commission created in 2019, found that the fire at a dump was a lie built on false statements extracted under torture and manipulated evidence. Those subsequent investigations found that an enormous operation was put in motion that night involving members of Guerreros Unidos, but also local, state and federal police. And the army was aware of everything that was happening because it had a base in Iguala, soldiers in the streets and spies among the students. Investigators said members of the army were involved with the gang in smuggling heroin from the mountains of Guerrero on buses to the United States. Prosecutors said the decision to hide the truth was taken at the highest levels of government. Has anyone been held accountable? There are more than 100 people in custody and dozens have been charged, but no one has been convicted. At the end of the previous administration, Mexican courts determined that the investigation was plagued by errors and manipulation. There were dozens of cases of torture. Those abuses and missteps led to many of those involved being released. Some have been arrested again under the current administration. The highest-ranking person charged is former Attorney General Jesús Murillo Karam, who is accused of torture, forced disappearance and obstruction of justice. There are also 16 soldiers, most of whom are awaiting trial on house arrest, which infuriates the students’ families. When did attitudes shift on the current administration? López Obrador had promised to find the students and hold those responsible accountable. But in 2022, when more and more evidence pointed toward the military’s involvement in the attack and cover-up the administration’s tone changed. The president had ordered the military to open its archives to investigators. That didn’t happen. Instead, López Obrador shifted more power and responsibility to the military than any president in recent history. The prosecutor leading the investigation, Omar García Trejo, was suddenly demoted after he sought arrest orders for two dozen soldiers. He was replaced by someone unfamiliar with the case. There was also growing political pressure to show results, said Santiago Aguirre, one of the families’ lawyers. The administration presented some evidence that did not appear to come from reliable sources and the government’s searches turned slipshod. Where do the families want the investigation to go? Their lawyers point out key arrests are still lacking, among them the man who led the investigation during the Peña Nieto administration, Tomás Zerón. In videos, Zerón is seen interrogating and threatening prisoners. He sought refuge in Israel, which has not agreed to extradite him despite Mexico’s request. They also say they want to see military intelligence records from that night that they still haven’t had access to. They want too more cooperation from the United States government, which has prosecuted members of Guerreros Unidos in drug trafficking cases that also revealed their ties to the military. ___ Follow AP's Latin America coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-missing-students-ayotzinapa-fc8bd404a2c8966e8ee75333e0101753	2024-09-22T19:10:52-07:00	
Lebanese doctor races to save the eyes of those hurt by exploding tech devices	BEIRUT (AP) — For almost a week, ophthalmologist Elias Jaradeh has worked around the clock, trying to keep up with the flood of patients whose eyes were injured when pagers and walkie-talkies exploded en masse across Lebanon. He has lost track of how many eye operations he has performed in multiple hospitals, surviving on two hours of sleep before starting on the next operation. He has managed to save some patients’ sight, but many will never see again. 'There is no doubt that what happened was extremely tragic, when you see this overwhelming number of people with eye injures arriving at the same time to the hospital, most of them young men, but also children and young women,' he told The Associated Press at a Beirut hospital this past week, struggling to hold back tears. Lebanese hospitals and medics were inundated after thousands of hand-held devices belonging to the Hezbollah militant group detonated simultaneously on Tuesday and Wednesday last week, killing at least 39 people. Around 3,000 more were wounded, some with life-altering disabilities. Israel is widely believed to have been behind the attack, although it has neither confirmed nor denied its involvement. Although the explosions appear to have targeted Hezbollah fighters, many of the victims were civilians. And many of those hurt in the attack suffered injuries to their hands, face and eyes because the devices received messages just before they detonated, so they were looking at the devices as they exploded. Authorities have not said how many people lost their eyes. Veteran and hardened Lebanese eye doctors who have dealt with the aftermath of multiple wars, civil unrest and explosions, said they have never seen anything like it. Jaradeh, who is also a lawmaker representing south Lebanon as a reformist, said most of the patients sent to his hospital, which specializes in ophthalmology, were young people who had significant damage to one or both eyes. He said he found plastic and metal shrapnel inside some of their eyes. Four years ago, a powerful blast tore through Beirut’s port, killing more than 200 people and wounding more than 6,000. That explosion, caused by the detonation of hundreds of tons of ammonium nitrates that had been stored unsafely at a port warehouse, blew out windows and doors for miles around and sent cascades of glass shards pouring onto the streets, leading to horrific injuries. Jaradeh also treated people hurt in the port explosion, but his experience with those wounded by the exploding pagers and walkie-talkies has been so much more intense because of the sheer volume of people with eye injuries. 'Containing the shock after the Beirut port blast was, I believe, 48 hours while we haven’t reached the period of containing the shock now,' Jaradeh said. Jaradeh said he found it hard to dissociate his job as a doctor from his emotions in the operating theater. 'No matter what they taught you (in medical school) about distancing yourself, I think in a situation like this, it is very hard when you see the sheer numbers of wounded. This is linked to a war on Lebanon and war on humanity,' Jaradeh said.	https://apnews.com/article/elias-jaradeh-eye-injuries-lebanon-exploding-devices-1ef861481aa43c86bfede3781734a85a	2024-09-22T19:05:59-07:00	
Co-founder of Titan to testify before Coast Guard about submersible that imploded	The co-founder of the company that owned the experimental submersible that imploded en route to the wreckage of the Titanic is scheduled to testify before the U.S. Coast Guard on Monday as part of its investigation of the maritime disaster. Businessman Guillermo Sohnlein founded Titan owner OceanGate with Stockton Rush, who was among the five people who died when the submersible imploded in June 2023. The Coast Guard opened a public hearing earlier this month that is part of a high level investigation into the cause of the implosion. Sohnlein left the Washington company years ago, but in the aftermath of the submersible's implosion, he spoke in defense of its efforts. In his testimony, he is expected to provide perspective into the company's inner workings. The public hearing began Sept. 16 and some of the testimony has focused on the troubled nature of the company. Earlier in the hearing, former OceanGate operations director David Lochridge said he frequently clashed with Rush and felt the company was committed only to making money. 'The whole idea behind the company was to make money,' Lochridge testified. 'There was very little in the way of science.' Other witnesses expected to testify Monday include former OceanGate engineering director Phil Brooks and Roy Thomas of the American Bureau of Shipping. The hearing is expected to run through Friday and include more witnesses. Lochridge and other witnesses have painted a picture of a troubled company that was impatient to get its unconventionally designed craft into the water. The accident set off a worldwide debate about the future of private undersea exploration. Coast Guard officials noted at the start of the hearing that the submersible had not been independently reviewed, as is standard practice. That and Titan’s unusual design subjected it to scrutiny in the undersea exploration community. OceanGate, based in Washington state, suspended its operations after the implosion. The company has no full-time employees currently, but has been represented by an attorney during the hearing. During the submersible’s final dive on June 18, 2023, the crew lost contact after an exchange of texts about Titan’s depth and weight as it descended. The support ship Polar Prince then sent repeated messages asking if Titan could still see the ship on its onboard display. One of the last messages from Titan’s crew to Polar Prince before the submersible imploded stated, 'all good here,' according to a visual re-creation presented earlier in the hearing. When the submersible was reported overdue, rescuers rushed ships, planes and other equipment to an area about 435 miles (700 kilometers) south of St. John’s, Newfoundland. Wreckage of the Titan was subsequently found on the ocean floor about 330 yards (300 meters) off the bow of the Titanic, Coast Guard officials said. No one on board survived. OceanGate said it has been fully cooperating with the Coast Guard and NTSB investigations since they began. Titan had been making voyages to the Titanic wreckage site going back to 2021.	https://apnews.com/article/titan-submersible-implosion-hearing-e8b5ef4b797b86b43e8b65e721216b26	2024-09-22T19:03:14-07:00	
At the UN, world leaders try to lay out a vision for the future — and actually make it happen	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The U.N. General Assembly adopted a 'Pact for the Future' to meet the challenges of the 21st century. Now comes the hard part: uniting the world’s divided nations to move quickly to implement its 56 actions. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres thanked the 193-member world body for approving the pact and unlocking the door for nations to join forces to tackle challenges ranging from climate change and artificial intelligence to escalating conflicts and increasing inequality and poverty — and improve the lives of the world's more than 8 billion people. 'We are here to bring multilateralism back from the brink,' he said. 'Now it is our common destiny to walk through it. That demands not just agreement, but action.' The 42-page pact was adopted at Sunday’s opening of a two-day 'Summit of the Future,' which continues Monday. Among leaders slated to address the summit are Iran's Masoud Pezeshkian, Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Vershinin. Russia tried to change the pact Whether the pact would be adopted was still a question when the assembly meeting began on Sunday. In fact, there was so much suspense that Guterres had three prepared speeches, one for approval, one for rejection, and one if things weren’t clear, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. Russia’s Vershinin launched the opening salvo. He proposed an amendment that would have significantly watered down the pact. 'No one is happy with this pact,' he said. It turned out he was wrong. Africa’s 54 nations opposed Russia’s amendments and speaking on their behalf, the Republic of Congo countered with a motion not to vote on the amendments. Mexico supported the Africans, and in a vote on their motion, the Africans got support from 143 countries,, with only six countries supporting Russia -- Iran, Belarus, North Korea, Nicaragua, Sudan and Syria. 15 countries abstained. Assembly President Philémon Yang then put the pact to a vote and banged his gavel, signifying the consensus of all U.N. member nations that was required for approval — to vigorous applause. Russia has made significant inroads in Africa -- in countries like Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger and Central African Republic -- and the continent’s rejection of its amendments along with Mexico, a major Latin American power, was seen as a blow to Moscow by some diplomats and observers. The secretary-general issues a challenge Guterres, clearly relieved at the outcome, then issued a challenge to the leaders: Implement the pact. Prioritize dialogue and negotiations. End 'wars tearing our world apart' from the Middle East to Ukraine and Sudan. Reform the powerful U.N. Security Council. Accelerate reforms of the international financial system. Ramp up a transition from fossil fuels. Listen to young people and include them in decision-making. The U.N.’s main bloc of developing countries — the Group of 77, which now has 134 members, including China — echoed Guterres in a speech by Ugandan Prime Minister Robinah Nabbanja. 'This pact should not become another futile exercise, but must garner political will and commitment across all levels of global leadership to pragmatically address current issues and lay a foundation for solutions for our future global progress and challenges,' he said. Nabbanja stressed that the future should be 'free from any oppression' and close widening gaps between developed and developing countries The G77 regrets that the pact doesn’t recognize actions that developed countries should take to close the gap, he said. In a rare move at a high-level U.N. meeting where leaders often exceed the announced time limit, Yang announced at the start of their speeches that they would be muted after five minutes. Among those who kept talking after their mics were silenced: Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Kuwait’s Crown Prince Sheikh Sabah Khalid Al Sabah and Irish President Michael Higgins. There's a long list of things to tackle The Pact for the Future says world leaders are gathering 'at a time of profound global transformation,' and it warns of 'rising catastrophic and existential risks' that could tip people everywhere 'into a future of persistent crisis and breakdown.' Guterres singled out a number of key provisions in the pact and its two accompanying annexes, a Global Digital Compact and Declaration on Future Generations. The pact commits world leaders to reform the 15-member Security Council, to make it more reflective of today’s world and 'redress the historical injustice against Africa,' which has no permanent seat, and to address the under-representation of the Asia-Pacific region and Latin America. It also 'represents the first agreed multilateral support for nuclear disarmament in more than a decade,' Guterres said, and it commits 'to steps to prevent an arms race in outer space and to govern the use of lethal autonomous weapons.' The Global Digital Compact 'includes the first truly universal agreement on the international governance of artificial intelligence,' the U.N. chief said. As for human rights, Guterres said, 'In the face of a surge in misogyny and a rollback of women’s reproductive rights, governments have explicitly committed to removing the legal, social and economic barriers that prevent women and girls from fulfilling their potential in every sphere.' ___ Edith M.

Rival protesters clash in Bolivia as ex-President Evo Morales leads a march to the capital	EL ALTO, Bolivia (AP) — Bolivia's pro-government supporters and security forces confronted protesters loyal to former president Evo Morales in a street melee Sunday, the second such violent escalation this week as fears grew of further unrest in the Andean nation. The protesters and counterprotesters hurled firecrackers, homemade explosives and stones at each other across a dusty sprawl in the city of El Alto, while riot police unleashed tear gas into the crowds. At least eight people were injured, Bolivia's health ministry reported. The standoff — erupting while thousands of Bolivians supporting Morales continued a weeklong 190-kilometer (118-mile) march to the capital of La Paz — spoke to the depth of the schism in Bolivian politics ahead of next year's presidential election. Morales and his former economy minister-turned-bitter-rival, current President Luis Arce, are vying to lead Bolivia's long-dominant socialist party, known by its Spanish acronym MAS, into the 2025 vote. In recent months their power struggle has paralyzed the government, exacerbated the depletion of Bolivia's foreign-exchange reserves and fueled street protests. The rolling political crisis began in 2019, when Morales — who came to power in 2006 — was forced to resign after being reelected to a third term in a vote marred by accusations of fraud and mass protests. He left the country but made a dramatic political comeback a year later, returning to find he had retained widespread support among poor and Indigenous Bolivians. Mobilized by Morales, bound together by misery over Bolivia’s economic meltdown and outraged by President Arce's efforts to block the candidacy of their polarizing former leader, the marchers stopped Sunday on their sixth day of walking to sleep at an encampment 11 kilometers (7 miles) from El Alto, a sprawling city on a plateau above Bolivia’s capital. Seeking to portray the march as a reflection of Bolivia’s Indigenous highland culture as much as a political exercise, Morales — surrounded by supporters waving the multicolored flag dear to Indigenous Andeans that the leftist leader turned into a patriotic symbol when he served as the country’s first Indigenous president — praised his supporters’ 'peace and enthusiasm.' Other Morales supporters broke off from the march and pressed into the scrappy outskirts of El Alto, where security forces and supporters of Arce had massed in anticipation of their arrival. The protesters and counterprotesters clashed in the neighborhood of Ventilla as acrid smoke from burning tires and thick clouds of tear gas coursed through the streets. Each side blamed the other for the violence. Morales accused Arce's government of deploying 'paramilitary groups to incite violence,' busing officers into El Alto to stir up trouble — a claim echoed by Bolivia's ombudsman. 'It’s very sad that this government doesn't pay attention to its conscience,' said Benita Cruz, a Morales supporter at the scene of Sunday’s clashes. 'They are repressing the poor and most humble people.' A senior minister in Arce's government, Eduardo Del Castillo, lambasted Morales' march as 'coup-mongering.' In increasingly dramatic terms, Arce — who earlier this year faced what he described as a miltiary coup attempt — has accused Morales of seeking to sabotage his government. The unrest offered a possible preview for the coming days, as Morales and his thousands of supporters have promised to continue their so-called 'March to Save Bolivia' into La Paz despite vows by Arce's supporters to prevent them. 'We are holding on until we reach La Paz, we want to tell the government that it has seven days to solve the massive problems we have in the country,' said Marta Mamani, one of the marchers. ___ Valdez reported from La Paz, Bolivia.

As UN meets, Haitians express hopelessness at finding an international solution to gang crisis	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — As world leaders meeting in the United Nations this week discuss the future of efforts to rein in the gangs strangling Haiti, Haitians are expressing hopelessness that an international response can turn the tide of violence. Thus far, a UN-backed force of 400 police from Kenya and about two dozen Jamaican officers have done little to quell the country's gangs, which have terrorized the country since the 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse. World leaders have been discussing the next steps in a convoluted efforts to restore order to the Caribbean nation, and Kenya this weekend pledged 600 more officers. The United States has floated the idea of a U.N. peacekeeping force, but the idea was considered too controversial given the introduction of cholera and sexual abuse cases that occurred the last time U.N. troops were in Haiti. The deployment of Kenyan forces was, in part, to avoid tensions that may be sparked by sending another U.N. peacekeeping mission. But in a visit to Haiti by Kenya's President William Ruto over the weekend – on his way to the United Nations General Assembly session, which began on Sunday – Ruto said he would be open to expanding Kenya's operations into a larger U.N. peacekeeping mission. 'On the suggestion to transit this into a fully U.N. Peacekeeping mission, we have absolutely no problem with it, if that is the direction the U.N. security council wants to take,' Ruto said. While Ruto hailed the successes of the Kenyan forces on Sunday, a recent report by a UN human rights expert said gang violence is spreading across Haiti and that Haitian police still lack the 'logistical and technical capacity' to fight gangs. The ongoing violence has left Haitians like 39-year-old Mario Canteve disillusioned with further international efforts to quell the gangs, saying he no longer believes promises by world leaders that they'll be able to change anything in the crisis-stricken nation. 'No one is coming to save Haiti. Nothing is changing,' he said. 'A new mission cannot save Haiti.' Canteve sells cellphone chips and repairs electronics in the capital of Port-au-Prince, 80% of which is estimated to be controlled by gangs. Facing brutal gang violence, some Haitians have organized vigilante groups to battle the gangs themselves. Such groups underscore to the lack of hope many Haitians have that an international solution can mark a shift in Haiti. Moise Jean-Pierre, a 50-year-old school teacher, recalled past U.N. missions in Haiti and said such efforts were a 'waste of time.' 'It would not be the first time we've had U.N. missions in Haiti,' he said. 'What difference will it make?' Sentiments on the ground speak to the bind world leaders are in as they've spent years looking for a larger solution to Haiti's woes. The current security mission is expected to reach a total of 2,500 personnel, with the Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados, Benin and Chad also pledging to send police and soldiers. Though it still is not clear when that would happen. Few at the U.N. have an appetite for a larger peacekeeping mission in part due to the abuses in past missions, but also because many Haitians have an aversion to foreign interventions. Experts say three previous interventions by US and the UN have not improved crises in Haiti. Some harbor hope that elections planned next year will pave the path to a Haitian-born solution. The country has not held general elections since 2016 as the crisis has dragged on. Last week, Haiti took its first steps in creating a provisional election council to prepare the nation for elections. Haiti still has many hurdles ahead of it to get there. Chief among them is violence. While Canteve, the cellphone chip salesman, called for unity and said 'a new mission cannot save Haiti, the children of Haiti need to save themselves,' he also expressed doubts the country was safe enough to facilitate elections. 'How can you hold an election when everything is so violent. Everyone is shooting,' he said. 'When police cannot even go into certain areas, what kind of election are going to get?' —— Find more AP coverage of the United Nations at https://apnews.com/hub/united-nations ___ Associated Press reporter Megan Janetsky contributed to this report from Mexico City.	https://apnews.com/article/haiti-united-nations-kenya-force-gangs-violence-peacekeeping-mission-a4f5e12483887b84637ac5e0f62cd8b9	2024-09-22T13:18:29-07:00	
Ukrainian President Zelenskyy visits Pennsylvania ammunition factory to thank workers	SCRANTON, Pa. (AP) — Under extraordinarily tight security, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday visited the Pennsylvania ammunition factory that is producing one of the most critically needed munitions for his country's fight to fend off Russian ground forces. His visit to the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant kicked off a busy week in the United States to shore up support for Ukraine in the war. He will speak at the U.N. General Assembly annual gathering in New York on Tuesday and Wednesday and then travel to Washington for talks on Thursday with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. As Zelenskyy’s large motorcade made its way to the ammunition plant on Sunday afternoon, a small contingent of supporters waving Ukrainian flags assembled nearby to show their appreciation for his visit to thank the workers. The area around the ammunition plant had been sealed off since the morning, with municipal garbage trucks positioned across several roadblocks and a very heavy presence of city, regional and state police, including troopers on horseback. The Scranton plant is one of the few facilities in the country to manufacture 155 mm artillery shells and has increased production over the past year. The 155 mm shells are used in howitzer systems, which are towed large guns with long barrels that can fire at various angles. Howitzers can strike targets up to 15 miles to 20 miles (24 kilometers to 32 kilometers) away and are highly valued by ground forces to take out enemy targets from a protected distance. Ukraine has already received more than 3 million of the 155 mm shells from the U.S. 'It’s unfortunate that we need a plant like this, but it’s here, and it’s here to protect the world,' said Vera Kowal Krewson, a first-generation Ukrainian American who was among those who greeted Zelenskyy's motorcade. 'And I strongly feel that way.' She said many of her friends’ parents have worked in the ammunition plant, and she called Zelenskyy’s visit 'a wonderful thing.' Laryssa Salak, 60, whose parents also immigrated from Ukraine, also said she was pleased Zelenskyy came to thank the workers. She said it upsets her that funding for Ukraine’s defense has divided Americans and that even some of her friends oppose the support, saying the money should go to help Americans instead. 'But they don’t understand that that money does not directly go to Ukraine, Salak said. 'It goes to American factories that manufacture, like here, like the ammunition. So that money goes to American workers as well. And a lot of people don’t understand that.' With the war now well into its third year, Zelenskyy has been pushing the U.S. for permission to use longer range missile systems to fire deeper inside of Russia. So far he has not persuaded the Pentagon or White House to loosen those restrictions. The Defense Department has emphasized that Ukraine can already hit Moscow with Ukrainian-produced drones, and there is hesitation on the strategic implications of a U.S.-made missile potentially striking the Russian capital. Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned that Russia would be 'at war' with the United States and its NATO allies if they allow Ukraine to use the long-range weapons. At one point in the war, Ukraine was firing between 6,000 and 8,000 of the 155 mm shells per day. That rate started to deplete U.S. stockpiles and drew concern that the level on hand was not enough to sustain U.S. military needs if another major conventional war broke out, such as in a potential conflict over Taiwan. In response the U.S. has invested in restarting production lines and is now manufacturing more than 40,000 155 mm rounds a month, with plans to hit 100,000 rounds a month. Two of the Pentagon leaders who have pushed that increased production through — Doug Bush, assistant secretary of the Army for acquisition, logistics and technology and Bill LaPlante, the Pentagon's top weapons buyer — were expected to join Zelenskyy at the plant, as was Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro. The 155 mm rounds are just one of the scores of ammunition, missile, air defense and advanced weapons systems the U.S. has provided Ukraine — everything from small arms bullets to advanced F-16 fighter jets. The U.S. has been the largest donor to Ukraine, providing more than $56 billion of the more than $106 billion NATO and partner countries have collected to aid in its defense. Even though Ukraine is not a member of NATO, commitment to its defense is seen by many of the European nations as a must to keep Putin from further military aggression that could threaten bordering NATO-member countries and result in a much larger conflict. —- Copp reported from Washington.	https://apnews.com/article/zelenskyy-ukraine-pennsylvania-ammunition-plant-c0e1fe5ebfa11ecfe92e842860e6440c	2024-09-22T11:24:26-07:00	
India Prime Minister's U.S. visit brings him to New York and celebration of cultural ties	UNIONDALE, N.Y. (AP) — Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, continuing a multiday U.S. visit, addressed a cultural celebration on Long Island Sunday, where he praised the United States' return of nearly 300 antiquities to India and relayed news of his country's dual win at the Chess Olympiad in Budapest, Hungary, to an enthusiastic crowd. 'I just got some very good news,' Modi told an estimated 13,000 people inside Nassau Veterans Coliseum for an event billed as a celebration of cultural ties between India and the United States. 'In the Chess Olympiad, in both the men’s and women’s tournament, India has won gold medals,' he said to applause in a speech that was translated into English for an online audience. Modi was reelected in June following a marathon election in which more than 640 million votes were cast over a span of six weeks in the world’s largest democratic exercise. 'This year, 2024, is a very important one for the entire world,' he said. 'On the one hand, there are conflicts raging between several countries in the world, there is tension. And on the other, democracy is being celebrated in several countries of the world. India and America are also together in this celebration of democracy.' Modi's appearance in New York came a day after he attended a summit hosted by President Joe Biden in Wilmington, Delaware, for leaders of the so-called Quad that also included Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia and Prime Minister Kishida Fumio of Japan. Also Saturday, Modi accepted the return of 297 antiquities spanning thousands of years that had been stolen or trafficked from India. The U.S. has returned nearly 600 such cultural artifacts to India since 2016, according to India's Ministry of External Affairs. On Monday, the prime minister is expected to attend a United Nations summit in advance of this week's General Assembly. Sunday's event was sponsored by the not-for-profit Indo American Community of USA.	https://apnews.com/article/india-modi-nassau-coliseum-antiquities-1e3a2fd0d1a812d96351e6db7e5320e5	2024-09-22T10:30:35-07:00	
US not responsible for surge of violence in Sinaloa, American ambassador tells Mexico	MEXICO CITY (AP) — U.S. Ambassador Ken Salazar rejected accusations by Mexico's president that the U.S. was partly responsible for a surge in cartel warfare in northern Sinaloa over the weekend. Sinaloa has been eclipsed by violence as two warring factions of the Sinaloa cartel have clashed in the state capital of Culiacan in what appears to be a fight for power since two of its leaders were arrested in the U.S. in late July. 'It is incomprehensible how the United States can be responsible for the massacres we see in different places,' Salazar said in a news conference in Chihuahua on Saturday. 'What is being seen in Sinaloa is not the fault of the United States.' The arrests startled many because it appeared that the son of notorious drug kingpin Joaquín 'El Chapo' Guzmán abducted an elder cartel figure, Ismael 'El Mayo' Zambada, and flew them both to the U.S. to be detained. Such a violent outburst was expected in the wake of the arrests. As the warring cartel factions and authorities have clashed in firefights, helicopters regularly circle overhead and military rove the streets of the capital. Families have said they are scared to send their children to school. Meanwhile, bodies have appeared across the city, often left slung out on the streets or in cars with either sombreros on their heads or pizza slices or boxes pegged onto them with knives. The pizzas and sombreros have become informal symbols for the warring cartel factions, underscoring the brutality of their warfare. Local authorities said that as of Friday at least 53 people had been killed and 51 others have gone missing in Sinaloa state since the fighting started. On Thursday, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador blamed American authorities in part for the bloodshed. Asked at his morning briefing if the U.S. government was 'jointly responsible' for this violence in Sinaloa, the president said, 'Yes, of course ... for having carried out this operation.' 'If we are now facing instability and clashes in Sinaloa, it is because (the American government) made that decision,' López Obrador said. López Obrador claimed American authorities 'carried out that operation' to capture Zambada and that 'it was totally illegal, and agents from the Department of Justice were waiting for Mr. Mayo.' Salazar had previously denied that American officials were involved in the alleged kidnapping. It was the latest blow to bilateral relations between the two regional allies. Last month, López Obrador — a populist prone to lashing out at critics — said he was putting relations with the U.S. and Canadian embassies 'on pause' after ambassadors criticized his controversial plan to overhaul Mexico’s judiciary by requiring all judges to stand for election. Still, the Zambada capture has fueled criticisms of López Obrador, who has throughout his administration refused to confront the cartels and has falsely stated that cartels respect Mexican citizens and largely fight amongst themselves. Under López Obrador, who leaves office at the end of this month, cartels have employed an increasing array of weapons and tactics, including roadside bombs, trenches, home-made armored vehicles and bomb-dropping drones. The criminal organizations have also seeped into new industries such as migrant smuggling and the lucrative avocado business. While Mexican authorities said Saturday they had sent an additional 600 soldiers to Sinaloa as reinforcements, Salazar cast blame for the surge of violence in the state on Mexico's wider security crisis. 'The reality is that there is a problem of insecurity and violence' in Mexico, Salazar said.	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-us-ambassador-sinaloa-cartel-violence-4204aa419978e90b1a6f08fc8265dffa	2024-09-22T09:58:23-07:00	
An estimated 180,000 motorcyclists converge at Portuguese shrine to have their helmets blessed.	FATIMA, Portugal (AP) — An estimated 180,000 motorcyclists gathered Sunday at the Our Lady of Fatima shrine in central Portugal for the ninth annual Pilgrimage of the Blessing of Helmets. Carlos Cabecinhas, the rector of the Sanctuary of Fatima, said the event has steadily increased in prominence — renowned for its conviviality as well as its shows of devotion. This year's turnout was the largest ever, Under the motto 'We are shaped and guided by what we love!', the pilgrimage started with the parade of a group of motorcyclists carrying Our Lady of Fatima’s statue next to the Basilica of the Holy Trinity, followed by a Mass during which the bikers’ helmets were blessed. The pilgrimage is organized by Blessing of Helmets Association and by numerous national and international motorcycle clubs. Various police forces join and support the event. 'Many of these motorcyclists come to ask for God’s protection through Our Lady for their trips,' said Cabecinhas. 'But they also come to remember those who have already left. who have already died, many of them in accidents, and those who are hurt, those who need help.' According to national data, there were 8,936 motorcycle accidents in Portugal in 2023, resulting in 124 deaths and 766 serious injuries. The most important pilgrimage to the Fatima shrine takes place on May 13 of each year, celebrating the date on which — according to Catholic believers — Mary, the mother of Jesus, appeared before three shepherd children in 1917. Pope Francis canonized the two of children on May 13, 2017, during the centennial of that apparition. The third child, who became a nun known as Sister Lucia, is the focus of a long-running, Vatican-led procedure that could lead to her canonization as well. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

UN nations endorse a 'Pact of the Future,' and the body's leader says it must be more than talk	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The U.N. General Assembly approved a blueprint Sunday to bring the world’s increasingly divided nations together to tackle 21st-century challenges from climate change and artificial intelligence to escalating conflicts and increasing inequality and poverty. The 42-page 'Pact of the Future' challenges leaders of the 193 U.N. member nations to turn promises into real actions that make a difference to the lives of the world’s more than 8 billion people. The pact was adopted at the opening of the two-day 'Summit of the Future' called by U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who thanked leaders and diplomats for taking the first steps and unlocking 'the door' to a better future. 'We are here to bring multilateralism back from the brink,' he said. 'Now it is our common destiny to walk through it. That demands not just agreement, but action.' The top UN official demands action The U.N. chief challenged the leaders: Implement the pact. Prioritize dialogue and negotiations. End 'wars tearing our world apart' from the Middle East to Ukraine and Sudan. Reform the powerful U.N. Security Council. Accelerate reforms of the international financial system. Ramp up a transition from fossil fuels. Listen to young people and include them in decision-making. The pact’s fate was in question until the last moment. There was so much suspense that Guterres had three prepared speeches, one for approval, one for rejection, and one if things weren’t clear, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. 'No one is happy with this pact,' said Russia's deputy foreign minister, Sergey Vershinin., The summit opened with him proposing amendments that would have significantly watered down the pact. Speaking on behalf of Africa’s 54 nations — which opposed Russia’s amendments — the Republic of Congo countered with a motion not to vote on the amendments. That motion was approved to applause. Russia only got support from Iran, Belarus, North Korea, Nicaragua, Sudan and Syria. Assembly President Philémon Yang then put the pact to a vote and banged his gavel, signifying the consensus of all 193 U.N. member nations that was required for approval. Russia has made significant inroads in Africa -- in countries like Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger and Central African Republic -- and the continent’s rejection of its amendments along with Mexico, a major Latin American power, was seen as a blow to Moscow by some diplomats and observers. Yang announced ahead of speeches by world leaders that they would be muted after five minutes — a rare occurrence at the United Nations, where words are the backbone. Among those who kept talking after their mics were silenced: Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Kuwait's Crown Prince Sheikh Sabah Khalid Al Sabah and Irish President Michael Higgins. Talk of the future is dark The Pact of the Future says world leaders are gathering 'at a time of profound global transformation,' and it warns of 'rising catastrophic and existential risks' that could tip people everywhere 'into a future of persistent crisis and breakdown.' Yet, it says, leaders are coming to the U.N. at a time of hope and opportunity 'to protect the needs and interests of present and future generations through actions in the Pact for the Future.' The pact includes 56 actions on issues including eradicating poverty, mitigating climate change, achieving gender equality, promoting peace and protecting civilians, and reinvigorating the multilateral system to 'seize the opportunities of today and tomorrow.' Secretary-General Guterres singled out a number of key provisions in the Pact of the Future and two accompanying annexes, a Global Digital Compact and Declaration on Future Generations. The pact commits world leaders to reform the 15-member Security Council, to make it more reflective of today’s world and 'redress the historical injustice against Africa,' which has no permanent seat, and to address the under-representation of the Asia-Pacific region and Latin America. It also 'represents the first agreed multilateral support for nuclear disarmament in more than a decade,' Guterres said, and it commits 'to steps to prevent an arms race in outer space and to govern the use of lethal autonomous weapons.' The Global Digital Compact 'includes the first truly universal agreement on the international governance of artificial intelligence,' the U.N. chief said. The compact commits leaders to establish an Independent International Scientific Panel in the United Nations to promote scientific understanding of AI, and its risks and opportunities. It also commits the U.N. to initiate a global dialogue on AI governance with all key players. The pact’s actions also include measures 'to mount an immediate and coordinated response to complex shocks' including pandemics, Guterres said. And it includes 'a groundbreaking commitment by governments to listen to young people and include them in decision-making.' As for human rights, Guterres said, 'In the face of a surge in misogyny and a rollback of women’s reproductive rights, governments have explicitly committed to removing the legal, social and economic barriers that prevent women and girls from fulfilling their potential in every sphere.' Eighteen months of negotiations on the pact were led by Germany and Namibia. Namibian President Nangolo Mbumba said leaders must leave the summit committed to a path toward peace -- not one that leads to 'an environmental catastrophe, widening inequality, global conflict and destruction and the rise of dangerous technologies that threaten our security.' German Chancellor Olaf Scholz warned that If countries don’t unite and implement the pact’s more than 50 actions, 'not only would history judge us … but also young people around the world.' 'The road is rocky,' he said. 'But was that ever any different?'	https://apnews.com/article/un-pact-future-russia-challenges-climate-ai-accf4523e01c6604707189333de289ce	2024-09-22T08:43:59-07:00	
Long-forbidden French anti-riot force sent to Martinique as thousands defy bans on protests	MEXICO CITY (AP) — France has sent a group of special anti-riot police that's been banned for 65 years to the French Caribbean island of Martinique, where protesters have gathered despite the government barring demonstrations in parts of the island. The force arrived this weekend after the local representative of France’s central government in its overseas territory said in a statement that protests were forbidden in the municipalities of Fort-de-France, Le Lamentin, Ducos and Le Robert until Monday. The government also issued a curfew. The restrictions came after violent protests broke out on the island last week over the high cost of living, with gunfire injuring at least six police officers and one civilian. Police launched tear gas and government officials said several stores were also looted. Officials said the bans were meant 'to put an end to the violence and damage committed at gatherings, as well as to the numerous obstacles to daily life and freedom of movement that penalize the entire population, particularly at weekends.' But the measure was met by defiance by many on the island, with massive peaceful protests breaking out Saturday night. Videos from local media show crowds of thousands peacefully walking along highways overnight banging on drums and waiving flags. As protests wound on without violence, the force of French anti-riot police arrived on the island, and were staying at a hotel in Fort-de-France on Sunday. It wasn't immediately clear how many were sent. The elite riot police, known as the Companies for Republican Security, were banned in the French territory following bloody riots in December 1959. The unit had been accused of using disproportionate force against protesters, ending in the deaths of a number of young demonstrators. The force is rarely deployed in French territories in the Caribbean, but was called on during riots and strikes in Guadeloupe in 2009. Martinique's leaders requested the forces amid the recent protests in an historic shift for the island, and one met with a sharp rejection by some in the territory. Béatrice Bellay, a representative of the socialist party on the island, blasted the move, saying: 'Martinique is not in a civil war, it is a social war.' She called for an 'open and transparent dialogue' between protesters and the government. 'This measure ... only serves to aggravate tensions and distract attention from the legitimate demands of the people of Martinique,' she wrote in a statement Sunday.	https://apnews.com/article/martinique-france-protests-special-police-46fbdb23a02ebeb3e76cc1d632c53929	2024-09-22T07:59:50-07:00	
Profiles in clean energy: Dad concerned about climate change shifts company away from oil and gas	ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, Netherlands (AP) — At first, working in the oil and gas industry was great, Jordi Zonneveld recalls. Near his home in the Netherlands, there was an oil and gas company that, back in 2005, was growing and hiring. Zonneveld knew nothing about its business, which was designing and building equipment used to separate oil and gas from the salty water they're mixed with deep underground. That was a far cry from what he had studied in college, aviation. But he was happy to get a job. At just 21, Zonneveld found himself working as a project engineer with customers and managing engineering teams. It was heady and challenging. The company, Frames Group, in the city of Alphen aan den Rijn, did very well. Zonneveld was promoted every few years. But in the oil and gas industry the year 2015 was a turning point for many people, and Zonneveld was one. The price of oil crashed. Major companies around the world halted or postponed large projects. Sales at the Frames Group plummeted. The same year, the Paris climate agreement was signed, committing countries to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the same emissions produced by his industry. 'The whole world is declaring to phase out fossil fuels,' Zonneveld said. It wasn't going to be immediate, 'but we were relying on those fossil fuels 100%.' ______ EDITOR'S NOTE: This is part of an occasional series of personal stories from the energy transition — the change away from a fossil-fuel based world that largely causes climate change. ______ Zonneveld and his coworkers discussed all of this and decided the oil and gas industry was not where they wanted to make their careers. They were still young. 'I still needed to work about 30 years until my retirement, I imagine. So you know, just wait and see what happens — this was not an option,' he said. He had become a father, with two daughters, and didn't want them to live in a world reliant on burning oil, gas and coal, warming the planet. 'I don’t have the illusion I can change everything myself, but I can be a part of the whole transition,' he said. By this time he was in top management. He considered his company's specialty in separating oil from gas, and removing unwanted water and vapors. He began to see a path: green hydrogen. Hydrogen is a gas that can be burned like a fossil fuel and generate high heat. But it does not create emissions that warm the Earth. In a way, a tank of hydrogen is like a battery — it can store clean energy over days, weeks or even months. It can power trucks, planes and boats, and also be used to make steel, ammonia and fertilizer. But most of the hydrogen used today is made from a fossil fuel, natural gas. Zonneveld wanted to pull Frames Group toward the future by making green hydrogen, that is, hydrogen obtained by splitting water into its elements, using only clean electricity. His employees’ skills would be transferrable. 'The interesting thing with hydrogen is that if you have a lot of knowledge about gases like natural gas ... then designing a system for hydrogen is just another gas,' Zonneveld said. 'It’s a bit more complex than that, especially if you ask our engineers. But I mean, on a high level, it is just another gas.' Some of his longtime oil and gas colleagues didn't like the new direction, after all, the world was not moving away from fossil fuels anytime soon. Zonneveld conceded it might take decades, but the Frames Group could lead the way. He and a small team pressed forward and were able to increase clean hydrogen to 10% of the company's business over the next five years. Around this same time, in New York, the clean energy company Plug Power, focused on hydrogen and fuel cells, was building out its hydrogen business. The two companies shared a desire to help customers decarbonize their operations, and the belief that hydrogen will play a big role in the clean energy transition. Plug Power decided to acquire Frames Group, a merger that happened in 2021. 'There were very few oil and gas companies where you had leadership that had such a vision,' Plug Power CEO Andy Marsh said in an interview. So it was a perfect match between Plug’s vision and Jordi’s personal vision of what Frames Group could become.' Now Plug Power has a goal of producing over 1,000 tons per day of green hydrogen globally this decade. There have been challenges. Plug Power's stock has been volatile. It has yet to turn a profit. That is not unusual in a new industry. On the positive side, Plug Power has found some big customers, including Amazon. Plug Power technology now runs forklifts in 80 Amazon warehouses. Amazon is also now making its own clean hydrogen on-site in Aurora, Colorado using a machine called an electrolyzer, made by Plug Power. The Biden administration is doling out billions of dollars in tax credits to companies that make this kind of clean hydrogen. Plug Power is in line for some of that money. The Department of Energy is helping finance the construction of up to six of the company's hydrogen production plants. Plug Power opened its first clean hydrogen plant in January in Georgia, and also owns factories for making electrolyzers and fuel cells in Rochester and Slingerlands, New York. Frames Netherlands office is finishing out its last oil and gas projects. Marsh said he put Zonneveld in charge there because he’s a 'dreamer.' Zonneveld, 39, now has three daughters. He has talked about climate change and his work with his eldest. He began driving a hydrogen car in 2020. When the two are in the car together, he explains how this kind of car is different from others on the road and better for the environment. The topic is a bit difficult for her at age 11, he said, and she's not always happy when they have to drive farther to reach a hydrogen refueling station. But she understands that the world needs to move away from fossil fuels. His other two daughters are 9 and 1. He doesn't talk as much with them about it yet, but says he’s proud of becoming part of the solution. 'We made a change,' he said, 'and I'm sure when they get a bit older, they will also be proud of me.' ___ McDermott reported from Providence, Rhode Island. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Britain's Labour Party gathers after a rocky start in government and a scandal over clothes	LONDON (AP) — This should be a time of celebration for Britain’s Labour Party, which opens its annual conference Sunday less than three months after winning power in a landslide after 14 years in opposition. But it’s no victory lap for Prime Minister Keir Starmer. His government is facing a reckoning with a battered economy and an electorate impatient for change. The mood among Labour members gathering in the northwest England city of Liverpool has been further dampened by a tempest over Starmer’s acceptance of freebies at a time when the millions of people are struggling with the cost of living. Starmer insists he followed the rules when he took clothes and designer eyeglasses from Waheed Alli, a media entrepreneur and longtime Labour donor. But after days of negative headlines, the party now says Starmer won’t accept any more free outfits. 'I get that people are angry,' said Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner, who also accepted donations to pay for clothing. 'But donations for gifts and hospitality and monetary donations have been a feature of our politics for a very long time,' she told the BBC. 'People can look it up and see what people have had donations for, and the transparency is really important.' Starmer won the July 4 election on a promise to 'restore politics as a force for good' after scandal-tarnished years under the Conservatives. He vowed to get the country’s sluggish economy growing and restore frayed public services such as the state-funded National Health Service. Since then, he has struck a gloomy note, saying there is a 22 billion pound ($29 billion) 'black hole' in the public finances left by the Conservative government, and warning that 'things will get worse' before they get better. One of the government’s first major acts was to strip millions of retirees of a payment intended to help heat their homes in winter. Starmer also had to deal with anti-immigrant unrest that erupted after three children were stabbed to death in Southport, near Liverpool in July. Starmer responded firmly, pledging swift justice and tough sentences for rioters. But prison overcrowding, a legacy of the last government, meant hundreds of inmates had to be freed early to make way for the newly convicted rioters. Then came the clothing scandal, dubbed 'frockgate' after dresses gifted to the prime minister’s wife, Victoria Starmer. Keir Starmer is also facing grumbling among his own employees over the salary of his chief of staff, Sue Gray. The BBC disclosed that she is paid 170,000 pounds ($225,000) a year — about 3,000 pounds more than the prime minister’s salary. The government says it wasn't involved in setting the pay scale for political advisers. Labour says that the criticism is being whipped up by the Conservatives and their media supporters. But polls suggest it has hurt. An Ipsos poll released Friday found 25% of respondents thought Starmer was doing a good job – down from 36% in July -- while 42% thought he was doing a bad job, up from 14%. The firm interviewed 1,082 adults by telephone and the margin of error is plus or minus three percentage points. 'He promised to be different, but he hasn’t been,' Conservative lawmaker Chris Philp told the BBC. 'He is not running a government of service, he is running a government of self-service.' The diet of bad news has alarmed many Labour members, who worry worse is to come in the form of tax increases and spending cuts when the government announces its first budget on Oct. 30. Labour leaders will try to convey a more positive message when Treasury chief Rachel Reeves makes a televised conference speech on Monday, followed by Starmer on Tuesday. They’re hoping to inject some cheer into the four-day conference, a blend of pep rally, policy forum and boozy bash that plays a key role in maintaining morale among party activists. The government argues that it has already made a string of positive changes, including ending a wave of public-sector strikes. In the coming weeks, it plans legislation to take public ownership of the railways, set up a state-owned green energy firm, impose tougher rules on water firms that dump sewage and strengthen rights for workers and renters. Victoria Honeyman, professor of British politics at the University of Leeds, said Labour’s first months in office were destined to be difficult because voters’ expectations were so high. 'But they have made mistakes,' she said. 'The business with the clothing, it’s not a terminal blow, but it’s the kind of thing that will stick in people’s minds for a certain amount of time and could so easily have been avoided. 'It smacks of a lack of attention or a lack of caution, neither of which are good looks.'	https://apnews.com/article/uk-labour-party-conference-starmer-freebies-4dc4c8ca5d1fc085ef6bb8947efbe71b	2024-09-22T01:55:03-07:00	
Building collapse in Italy kills 2 young siblings and their mother	ROME (AP) — A two-story building collapsed in the southern Italian province of Naples early Sunday, killing two young siblings and their mother, while burying the children's grandmother under the rubble, firefighters and local authorities said. The firefighters said on their official Telegram channel that a gas explosion likely caused the collapse. Rescuers in the town of Saviano recovered first the bodies of a 6-year-old boy and a 4-year-old girl, and a few hours later recovered the body of another victim, identified as their mother, local authorities said. Searches are still underway to find the older woman, identified as the grandmother of the children, who was believed to be trapped under the rubble. Earlier on Sunday, the siblings' 2-year-old brother had been found alive with the father, who was hospitalized in Naples in serious condition. Firefighters’ spokesman Luca Cari said earlier that rescuers had to be 'very careful and move slowly, to avoid new collapses' as they searched for the two women. Mayor Vincenzo Simonelli was at the scene and told reporters that the building appeared 'crumpled up on itself,' adding it was 'a very serious situation.' Media reports said a gas leak could have caused the explosion that rocked the second floor of the building, which crumbled down, covering the lower floor with rubble.	https://apnews.com/article/italy-naples-building-collapse-children-victims-accc204034d303279229bf46bc5e2719	2024-09-22T00:58:18-07:00	
21 wounded after Russia strikes apartment buildings in Ukrainian city of Kharkiv	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russian launched new strikes in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv that hit high-rise apartment buildings, leaving at least 21 wounded in a second consecutive nighttime attack. The bombs fell Saturday night on the district of Shevchenkivsky, north of the center of Kharkiv, which is the second-largest Ukrainian city, local Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said. Nine residential buildings sustained varying degrees of damage, including 16- and nine-story buildings, he added. The wounded included an 8-year-old child, according to Syniehubov and Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov. Terekhov said that 60 residents were evacuated from one of the buildings. Kharkiv has been a frequent target of Russian attacks since Moscow launched its all-out invasion of neighboring Ukraine in February 2022. The attack came after another late Friday that wounded 15 people, including children ages 10 and 12, as Russian airstrikes hit three Kharkiv neighborhoods, Terekhov said. Ukrainian officials said that KAB-type aerial glide bombs — a retrofitted Soviet weapon that has for months laid waste to eastern Ukraine — were used in both attacks. Russia also launched 80 Shahed drones and two missiles at Ukraine overnight into Sunday, the Ukrainian air force said. Ukrainian air defense shot down 71 drones, and another six were lost on location due to electronic warfare countermeasures, the statement said. Farther south, a 12-year-old girl and a woman died after a Russian drone struck a passenger car in the city of Nikopol, local Gov. Serhii Lysak reported. Two others, including a 4-year-old child, suffered wounds. A Russian artillery strike also killed one person in the eastern town of Kurakhove, regional prosecutors said late Saturday, as Russian forces continue their grinding advance westwards through Ukraine's industrial Donetsk province. A Russian drone strike on Sunday morning wounded two civilians in Ukraine’s southern city of Kherson, regional authorities said. Hours later, local police reported that Russian attacks wounded at least four more people elsewhere in the Kherson province. Other Russian drone attacks Sunday damaged energy infrastructure in Ukraine’s central Poltava region and the northern city of Shostka, local officials reported. Shostka lies in the Sumy region, across the border from Russia's Kursk province — the target of a startling Ukrainian military incursion launched last month. Weeks into the incursion, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelneskyy said that the aim is to create a buffer zone to prevent further Russian cross-border strikes that have for months wreaked havoc in Sumy. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-kharkiv-bomb-airstrike-attack-948212c68bd29bb1b860851f2efa2163	2024-09-21T23:41:11-07:00	
Israel-Hamas war latest: Fears of all-out war rise as Israel and Hezbollah step up attacks	BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) — Lebanon’s Hezbollah launched over 100 rockets into northern Israel early Sunday in response to ramped-up Israeli attacks that killed dozens of people in Beirut, including a veteran leader of the militant group. During the funeral Sunday of that Hezbollah commander, Ibrahim Akil, Hezbollah's deputy leader Naim Kassem declared that the group is now in an 'open-ended battle of reckoning' with Israel, and he vowed to prolong the misery of those displaced from the country's north. The Hezbollah rocket barrage overnight sent thousands of people scrambling into shelters. The Israeli military said rockets had been fired 'toward civilian areas,' pointing to a possible escalation. Hezbollah says its attacks have been aimed at military targets. The barrage came after an Israeli airstrike in Beirut on Friday killed at least 45 people, including one of Hezbollah’s top leaders as well as women and children. The militant group was already reeling from a sophisticated attack that caused thousands of personal devices to explode just days earlier. Here’s the latest: A new crisis for displaced Palestinians: flooding MUWASI, Gaza Strip — As the first rain of the cool season starts to fall in the Gaza Strip, displaced Palestinians living in the sprawling Muwasi tent camp are struggling to cope with flooding that is exacerbating the humanitarian crisis. Some children are entertained by the novelty of walking barefoot in the ankle-deep water, but their parents are less amused. The adults try to save what they can from their family's tents. One mother tries to dry her temporary home with a mop. 'We woke up in the morning to find the tents with rainwater pouring on us, and water from the streets entering on us,' said Rana Goza’t, a displaced person from Gaza City. 'This is the beginning of winter. What will happen in the coming days?' Suhail Al-Barawi, a displaced person from Beit Lahiya, was helping to build sand barriers to prevent more flooding in the camp. 'People wish for rain,' he said, 'and we say, ‘Oh God, do not give us rain.’' The nearly yearlong war between Israel and Hamas has displaced 90% of Palestinians in Gaza, according to the United Nations. Israel defense minister praises air strikes in Beirut Israel’s defense minister says recent attacks on Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon are a step toward facilitating the return of displaced Israelis to their homes in the north of the country. Speaking Sunday evening after visiting the military’s Northern Command headquarters, Yoav Gallant described the recent air strikes on the southern suburbs of Beirut as 'significant, important and powerful.' He says Israel will take all necessary measures to ensure 'the safe return of Israel’s northern communities to their homes.' Israeli attacks since Friday have killed dozens in Lebanon, including a veteran Hezbollah commander. Hezbollah responded with more than 100 missile attacks in northern Israel early Sunday, sending hundreds of thousands of Israelis into air raid shelters. Gallant says: 'The past week has been the most difficult in the history of Hezbollah’s existence —especially over the past day.' Two Israeli strikes in central Gaza kill at least seven people DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Two Israeli strikes in the central Gaza city of Deir al-Balah have killed at least seven people, according to hospital officials. The first strike hit an apartment building early Sunday killing four people, including two women, followed by a second one in the afternoon that killed at least three more people. The bodies were rushed to the Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the city. Not long after funeral prayers were held for them outside the hospital, three more bloodied bodies arrived at the hospital, including one that appeared to be missing a leg. Israel is ready to take new steps against Hezbollah, military chief says JERUSALEM — Israel’s military chief says the army is prepared to step up pressure on Hezbollah in the coming days. Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi told reporters Sunday that Israel is committed to returning tens of thousands of Israelis displaced by nearly a year of fighting to their homes. He said Israel has inflicted heavy damage against Hezbollah in recent weeks, and if the Lebanese militant group hasn’t learned its lesson, 'it will receive another blow and another blow.' Halevi says the army is on a high level of readiness and prepared to take additional steps in the coming days. 'We have many capabilities that we have not yet activated,' he said. Funeral takes place for seven killed in Israeli strikes on Beirut MAYS AL-JABAL, Lebanon — A funeral has taken place in the southern Lebanese border town of Mays al-Jabal for seven people killed in an Israeli strike in Beirut, among them three women and two girls. Men in black wearing yellow scarves with the Hezbollah logo stood quietly Sunday, as women wept and threw rice and rose petals over the coffins — five draped in Lebanese flags, and two in flags of Hezbollah’s Imam Mahdi Scouts. Mourners waved flags representing Hezbollah and the Amal Movement, a Lebanese Shia political party, and expressed their rage over Israel’s conflict with Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. 'Tell our brothers in this country, you must realize that this enemy and America and all these countries behind it are traitors to us, and have betrayed us and sold us out and do not believe our words,' said Sheikh Bassam Karout, a local imam who officiated the funeral. The Israeli strike Friday in a crowded suburb south of the Lebanese capital killed several members of the militant Hezbollah group, including the head of its elite Radwan Force Ibrahim Akil. Civilians were among the dozens killed. Batoul Nasrallah, mourning the loss of several relatives at the funeral, called the Israelis 'cowards.' '(Israel) relies on the laws of the jungle instead of international conventions, especially with protecting civilians,' Melhem Khalaf, a Christian Lebanese parliamentarian from Beirut, told The Associated Press. U.K. foreign secretary calls for ‘immediate ceasefire’ between Israel and Hezbollah LONDON — The U.K.’s top diplomat is calling for an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. Foreign Secretary David Lammy said Sunday that the fighting is in nobody’s interest. 'In recent days, we have seen worrying escalation between Israel and Lebanese Hezbollah,' Lammy said. 'Our message to all parties is clear: We need an immediate ceasefire from both sides so that we can get to a political settlement.' He also advised British nationals to 'leave now' for their safety, repeating a message the Foreign Office has delivered several times recently. U.S. says is pushing for a diplomatic solution to end Israel-Hezbollah attacks WASHINGTON — The Biden administration is pushing for a diplomatic solution to end the attacks between Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah, which have killed dozens of people in Beirut and pushed hundreds of thousands into underground shelters in Israel's north. Speaking Sunday on ABC's 'This Week,' national security spokesman John Kirby said the U.S. has been 'involved in extensive and quite assertive diplomacy' in the region. He says: 'We still believe that there can be time and space for a diplomatic solution here' According to a statement from the Pentagon, U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin spoke with Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant on Saturday about the Hezbollah rocket attacks and stressed the need for a diplomatic solution. As concerns bringing an end to the conflict in Gaza, Kirby says they have not achieved 'any progress here in the last week to two weeks. Not for lack of trying.' He says the leader of Hamas, Yahya Sinwar, doesn't appear to be 'negotiating in good faith,' citing the recent killing of six Israeli hostages in tunnels under Gaza. 'But it doesn’t mean that we’re not trying.' Palestinians worry about heightened tensions between Israel and Hezbollah MUWASI, Gaza Strip — Palestinians in the Gaza Strip fear the war and worsening humanitarian crisis in the territory might be forgotten as tensions boil between Hezbollah and Israel. The militant group launched more than 100 rockets into northern Israel early Sunday in response to an Israeli attack last week that killed dozens in Beirut, including a top Hezbollah commander. 'All focus of the news and media is on Lebanon. Gaza is forgotten,' Nezar Zaqout, who is living in a tent camp in Muwasi in southern Gaza, told The Associated Press. 'Every day we heard that there was hope for negotiations, or new news that they were trying to solve the issue of the displaced … but we have become completely forgotten.' In the sprawl of camps along Gaza's coast that Israel has designated a humanitarian zone and where Zaqout and other displaced Palestinians are sheltering, children walk on dirt roads muddied by overnight rainstorms to wait in line for bread. Saadi Abu Mustafa says he was hopeful for a ceasefire deal through Qatari, Egyptian, and American mediation, but he fears that the escalation in fighting and the focus on Lebanon will 'affect us negatively.' Hezbollah has said it is confronting Israel in support of its ally Hamas in Gaza. He says: 'They leave Gaza without negotiations, without a prisoner, and without a ceasefire.' Hezbollah is in an ‘open-ended battle of reckoning’ with Israel, deputy leader says BEIRUT — Hezbollah’s deputy leader says his group is now in an open-ended battle of reckoning with Israel, and he is threatening to displace more people in the country's north. Speaking Sunday during the funeral of top Hezbollah commander Ibrahim Akil, Naim Kassem warned: 'We admit that we are pained. We are humans. But as we are pained, you will also be pained.' His comments follow days of surprise Israeli attacks that have wounded thousands of people in Lebanon and killed members of Hezbollah, and hours after the militant group responded by launching rockets deep into northern Israel, including near the city of Haifa. He vows the ongoing conflict will destroy Israel's economy and that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 'will not achieve your goals.' Hezbollah has said it is confronting Israel in support of its ally Hamas in Gaza. Kassem says Hezbollah, which has lost several senior military leaders in recent months, has 'returned stronger, and the frontline will witness this.' He has said Hezbollah will stop attacking northern Israel only if the country can reach a ceasefire in Gaza with Hamas, and that a military solution will not allow the tens of thousands of people displaced from northern Israel to return. Hundreds attend the funeral of Hezbollah commander Ibrahim Akil BEIRUT — Hundreds of people gathered in southern Beirut Sunday for the funeral of top Hezbollah commander Ibrahim Akil, killed in an Israeli airstrike on Friday alongside other members of the powerful militant group. Akil’s coffin was draped in a yellow Hezbollah flag with his portrait. Senior Hezbollah members attended the funeral, including deputy leader Sheikh Naim Kassem and senior parliamentarian Mohammad Raad. Killed Hezbollah militant Mahmoud Hamad was also honored at the funeral. Hezbollah legislator says the group is ready ‘for any scenario’ BEIRUT, Lebanon — Hezbollah legislator Hassan Fadlallah says the war with Israel has entered a 'new phase', saying the group 'is ready for any scenario, war, or confrontation.' Attending the funeral of a member of the Lebanese militant group who was killed among dozens of others in an Israeli strike on a Beirut neighborhood Friday, Fadlallah said 'the southern front' has played a crucial role in pressuring Israel 'to stop its war on Gaza.' He also said that Israel won't be able to achieve its 'main goal ... to return settlers in the north,' as he praised the abilities of Hezbollah. 'We have a strong and capable resistance that possesses the capabilities, competencies, and numerous fighters and equipment that enable it to absorb any loss or blow, and to adapt to any new situation,' he said. Netanyahu says Hezbollah has been dealt unimaginable blows JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel has dealt Hezbollah 'blows that it did not imagine' after days of intense strikes on Lebanon. In a video statement released by his office, Netanyahu said that if the militant group 'did not get the message, I promise you, it will get the message.' Netanyahu reiterated that Israel was determined to return its displaced citizens in the north, adding: 'No country can tolerate fire on its residents, fire on its cities. And the state of Israel will not tolerate it either. We will do everything necessary to restore security.'	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-hamas-latest-22-september-2024-a593f6b84bb83a70480169bc94965e9a	2024-09-21T22:55:39-07:00	
Birds, bees and ballots: Swiss voters to decide on plan to bolster country's fragile biodiversity	GENEVA (AP) — Switzerland, known for natural beauty like pristine lakes and majestic Alpine peaks, ranks among the world's richest countries whose plant and animal life is under the greatest threat. Environmentalists were seeking better protections for the country's biodiversity in a nationwide vote that culminated Sunday. The Swiss public broadcaster SSR, citing exit polls after the end of voting at noon, reported that the plan was rejected. Final official results were expected later Sunday. The latest polls had suggested that initial enthusiasm had waned for the proposal to boost public funding to encourage farmers and others to set aside lands and waterways to let the wild develop more, and increase the total area allocated for green spaces that must remain untouched by human development. The contest was decided by mail-in ballots followed by a morning of in-person voting Sunday. A poll by the respected agency gfs.bern for the Swiss public broadcaster published Sept. 11 showed support falling to 46% in early September from 51% in mid-August. Factors behind the weakening biodiversity in the country of rivers, lakes, valleys and mountains include intensified agriculture, soil alteration, a fragmentation of the landscape — such as the building of roads and housing that cut through wildlife habitats — and pollution and climate change, proponents of the measure said. The federal government — parliament and the executive branch — opposed the plan, as did many rural voters and the country's main right-wing party, according to polls. They called it too costly, saying 600 million Swiss francs (over $700 million) is already spent on biodiversity protection each year, and fear economic development will suffer. Passage was estimated to cost at least another 400 million francs for national and local governments, the Federal Council estimates. The initiative would also, for example, prohibit construction of new railway lines through a protected dry meadows — even if such meadow is set aside and developed elsewhere, it says. 'Passage of the biodiversity initiative would severely limit (sustainable) energy and food production, restrict the use of forests and rural areas for tourism, and make construction more expensive,' argued the campaign for a 'no' vote on its web site. 'YES to biodiversity, but NO to the extreme biodiversity initiative.' Proponents, meanwhile, pointed to dwindling natural resources in Switzerland and threats to bees, frogs, birds, mosses and other wildlife. They argued that protected green spaces are 'the main capital for tourism' and more of them would support local economies. 'Diversified nature guarantees air purity, drinkable water, pollination, fertility of the soil, and our food supply,' said a committee that backed the idea. 'But in Switzerland, biodiversity is suffering. One-third of all our plant and animal species are threatened or have already disappeared.' The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a think tank that counts 38 mostly rich countries as members, has produced a comparative look at threats to plan and animal life. Switzerland ranks among the top four countries with the highest rates of threatened species in all eight categories of wildlife. The voting is part of the latest Swiss referendums, which take place four times a year to give voters a direct say in policymaking in the country of around 9 million people. The only other nationwide issue up for consideration this time was a pension reform plan backed by the government. The exit polls for SSR also showed that voters had rejected the pension reform plan.	https://apnews.com/article/biodiversity-switzerland-referendum-ba1053ddf906c191bef116f3dc379097	2024-09-21T21:53:08-07:00	
Attacks by Islamic extremists are rampant in Africa's Sahel. Here's what we know about them	DAKAR, Senegal (AP) — Extremist attacks in Sahel, an arid swath of land south of the Sahara in Africa, have proliferated in recent months: Last week, Islamic militants attacked Bamako, the capital of Mali, for the first time in almost a decade, demonstrating their capacity to carry out large scale assaults. And last month, at least 100 villagers and soldiers were killed in central Burkina Faso during a weekend attack on a village by al-Qaida-linked jihadis, as they were forcibly helping security forces dig trenches to protect security outposts and villages. Here’s what we know about the security situation in Sahel: A REGION CHARACTERIZED BY UPRISINGS AND COUPS Over the last decade, the region has been shaken by extremist uprisings and military coups. Three Sahelian nations, Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso, are now ruled by military leaders who have taken power by force, on the pledge of providing more security to citizens. But the security situation in Sahel has worsened since the juntas took power, analysts say, with a record number of attacks and a record number of civilians killed both by Islamic fighters and government forces. Over the first six months of this year, 3,064 civilians were killed by the violence, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project, a 25% increase compared to the previous 6 months. Extremist groups operating in Sahel, and what they want The main two groups operating in the region are the al-Qaida-linked militant group Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), and the Islamic State in the Sahel. Over the last year, the JNIM has strengthened its presence in Mali and Burkina Faso, by becoming a more coherent political grouping. 'The local populations support (JNIM) more than IS-affiliated groups,' said analyst Shaantanu Shankar of the Economist Intelligence Unit. 'They have integrated local rebel groups, which have close community ties.' Unlike JNIM, Islamic State in the Sahel is a loose coalition of anti-government forces that is much less entrenched politically, he said. They are much more dominant in the Lake Chad region. These groups attack, terrorize and kill local populations and their actions likely amount to war crimes, according to rights organizations. In addition, there is also a number of local militia on the ground, which are not affiliated with IS or al-Qaida, as violence has exploded between rival ethnicities and local self-defense groups resulting in a self-perpetuating spiral of violence. Why the extremists in Sahel are getting stronger The military juntas in three countries have capitalized on popular discontent with the former democratically elected governments, which they saw as corrupt and propped up by France. After coming into power, all three juntas left the Economic Community of West African States, the nearly 50-year-old regional bloc known as ECOWAS, and created their own security partnership, the Alliance of Sahel States, in September. They have cut ties with the traditional Western allies, ousting French and American military forces, and instead sought new security ties with Russia. 'There is a huge security vacuum after the withdrawal of the French and American military' from the region, said Shankar, which cannot be filled by Russia. Troops from the Wagner Group, the Russian private military company, present in the region are being financed by the junta governments, Shankar added, with fewer financial resources. But experts say the other factor fueling instability is the worsening economic situation, as well as the lack of job opportunities, which contribute to the rising popularity of extremist groups. In all three countries, Islamic extremists have been recruiting among groups marginalized and neglected by the central governments. 'There are very few opportunities for people in rural Sahel, especially the youth,' said Heni Nsabia, the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project analysis coordinator for West Africa. 'But the other aspect is that people whose families and communities were targeted by state forces seek security, status and vengeance.' How the groups finance themselves Despite being affiliated with al-Qaida and the Islamic State group, extremist groups in the Sahel mostly get financial resources within their own strongholds, analysts said. They impose taxes on the local population, take control of the management of natural resources, especially of gold, and steal cattle. They also impose sieges on towns and use kidnappings, improvised explosive devices and landmines as they seek to control supply routs and resources. The extremists are also involved in trafficking, especially of drugs, said Aaryaman Shah, a security analyst who specializes in the financing of extremist groups. And they profit from people smuggling — which might bring them even more money in the future. 'We are concerned about the recent turmoil in Libya, and how that could actually affect the migrant flow,' said Shah. 'We are also looking at Niger, where the junta disbanded the law stopping people from crossing into Libya.' The business model that these groups developed is very diversified, analysts said. 'This is why it is difficult to destroy them economically,' said Nsabia from ACLED. 'If you target one aspect, they have other sources of revenues.' The outlook for the future Analysts predict that the situation in the Sahel is going to worsen in the coming months, with the military governments becoming increasingly desperate as they focus on preserving their political existence, and no way of holding them accountable. 'It’s a very volatile phase, security is projected to get worse in the next 2 years,' said Shankar of the Economist Intelligence Unit. And the violence has been spilling outside the Sahel borders: Extremists believed to be linked to al-Qaida have crossed into Benin and the north of Nigeria, the latest trend in the militants’ movements to wealthier West African coastal nations. 'It’s undeniable that things are getting worse, and the scope of the threat has been expanding,' said Nsabia. 'Today, we should not be talking only about Sahel, but also about Benin and Togo, where the JNIM have done excursions as far as 200 kilometers inland.' Europe and United States are seeking to support the governments of these coastal nations in their counter-terrorism efforts. Michael Langley, the top U.S. commander for Africa, told reporters last week the U.S. was in talks with Ivory Coast, Ghana and Benin as the country starts 'to reset and recalibrate some of our assets.' A major challenge has been, and will continue to be, access to information, experts said. All juntas significantly restricted journalism, so now they are in complete control of the narrative, including of who is defined as a jihadi. In Mali, the government branded all Touaregs an ethnic group which staged a rebellion against the government, as jihadis, although only some of them allied with JNIM.	https://apnews.com/article/sahel-islamic-state-alqaida-niger-mali-burkina-cb640f8f2a59db08c9ba3dce86ede5a9	2024-09-21T21:42:39-07:00	
German chancellor's Social Democrats seek to hold off far right in Brandenburg state election	BERLIN (AP) — A state election is taking place in Brandenburg on Sunday, three weeks after a far-right party made gains in two other states in eastern Germany. Around 2.1 million people are registered to vote for a new state parliament in Brandenburg, the state that surrounds the German capital, Berlin. Sunday's election is being watched closely for signs about the country's political direction. The latest polls showed that the far-right Alternative for Germany is neck-and-neck with the Social Democrats, the party that has governed Brandenburg continuously since German reunification in 1990. The Social Democrats, the largest party in Chancellor Olaf Scholz's three-way coalition government, are hoping to maintain control of their stronghold in the face of rising support for parties on the extreme right and left. If the Social Democrats lose in Brandenburg, it would be seen as a bad omen for Scholz a year before a federal election that is due to be held on Sept. 28, 2025. Scholz lives in Potsdam, the capital of Brandenburg, and German political observers believe the chancellor's political future will be shaped by the results of Sunday's vote in Brandenburg. The fate of the Brandenburg governor, Dietmar Woidke, is also hanging in the balance. He made it his goal for his Social Democrats to beat Alternative for Germany, or AfD, and vowed to resign should the AfD win. 'If I lose against the AfD, I am gone,' Woidke said. The Alternative for Germany won the most votes in the state of Thuringia and also did well in an election in Saxony on Sept. 1. A new party founded by a prominent leftist also made a strong impact, while the parties in Scholz’s unpopular national government obtained extremely weak results. That was the first time the far right won an election in Germany since World War II, and it dealt a heavy blow to Scholz's centrist coalition. It also generated concerns in Germany and abroad about the growing support for the extreme right in the largest European Union country, and a member of NATO. The far-right party has gained support amid a growing backlash to large-scale migration to Germany over the past decade and several recent extremist attacks. Germany's economy, once a powerhouse, has been weakening, adding to a general feeling of malaise. Sunday's vote follows a heated election campaign centered on the issues of migration, internal security and peace. Both the far right and the new leftist movement, the Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance, or BSW, want to end weapons deliveries to Kyiv as Ukraine tried to defend itself against Russia's full-scale invasion. Even if the Alternative for Germany wins in Brandenburg, it is unlikely to govern because other parties have refused to work with it.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-state-election-brandenburg-810a84f9c74c6f86aa6b52c2aff57f9b	2024-09-21T21:12:33-07:00	
Hezbollah fires over 100 rockets across a wider and deeper area of Israel as fears of war mount	NAHARIYA, Israel (AP) — Lebanon's Hezbollah launched over 100 rockets early Sunday across a wider and deeper area of northern Israel, with some landing near the city of Haifa, as the sides appeared to be spiraling toward all-out war following months of escalating tensions. The rocket barrage overnight set off air raid sirens across northern Israel, sending thousands of people scrambling into shelters. The Israeli military said rockets had been fired 'toward civilian areas,' pointing to a possible escalation after previous barrages had mainly been aimed at military targets. Israel's Magen David Adom rescue service said it treated four people for shrapnel wounds, including a 76-year-old man who was moderately wounded in Kiryat Bialik, a community near Haifa where buildings were damaged and cars set on fire. It was not immediately clear if the damage was caused by a rocket or an Israeli interceptor. The barrage came after an Israeli airstrike in Beirut on Friday killed at least 37 people, including one of Hezbollah's top leaders as well as women and children. Hezbollah was already reeling from a sophisticated attack that caused thousands of personal devices to explode just days earlier. The Israeli military said it carried out a wave of strikes across southern Lebanon over the past 24 hours, hitting some 400 militant sites, including rocket launchers. Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, an Israeli military spokesman, said those strikes had thwarted an even larger attack. 'Hundreds of thousands of civilians have come under fire across a lot of northern Isreal. They spent the night and now the morning in bomb shelters,' he said. 'Today we saw fire that was deeper into Israel than before.' In a separate development, Israeli forces raided the West Bank bureau of Al-Jazeera, which it had banned earlier this year, accusing it of serving as a mouthpiece for militant groups, allegations denied by the pan-Arab broadcaster. Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire since the outbreak of the war in Gaza nearly a year ago, when the militant group began firing rockets in solidarity with the Palestinians and its fellow Iran-backed ally Hamas. The low-level fighting has killed dozens of people in Israel, hundreds in Lebanon, and displaced tens of thousands on both sides of the frontier. Neither side is believed to be seeking a war. But in recent weeks, Israel has shifted its focus from Gaza to Lebanon and vowed to bring back calm to the border so that its citizens can return to their homes. Hezbollah has said it will only halt its attacks if there is a cease-fire in Gaza, which appears increasingly elusive as long-running talks led by the United States, Egypt and Qatar have repeatedly bogged down. The war in Gaza began with Hamas' Oct. 7 attack into Israel, in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people and took around 250 hostage. They are still holding around 100 captives, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Gaza's Health Ministry says over 41,000 Palestinians have been killed. It does not say how many were fighters but says women and children make up over half of the dead. Israeli media reported that rockets fired from Lebanon early Sunday were intercepted in the areas of Haifa and Nazareth, which are further south than most of the rocket fire to date. Israel canceled school across the north, deepening the sense of crisis. Hezbollah said it had launched dozens of Fadi 1 and Fadi 2 missiles — a new type of weapon the group had not used before — at the Ramat David airbase, southeast of Haifa, 'in response to the repeated Israeli attacks that targeted various Lebanese regions and led to the fall of many civilian martyrs.' In July, the group released a video with what it said was footage it had filmed of the base with surveillance drones. Hezbollah has vowed to retaliate against Israel for a wave of explosions that hit pagers and walkie-talkies belonging to Hezbollah members on Tuesday and Wednesday, killing at least 37 people — including two children — and wounding around 3,000. The attacks were widely blamed on Israel, which has not confirmed or denied responsibility. On Friday, an Israeli airstrike took down an eight-story building in a densely populated neighborhood in Beirut’s southern suburbs as Hezbollah members were meeting in the basement, according to Israel. Among those killed was Ibrahim Akil, a top Hezbollah official who commanded the group’s special forces unit, known as the Radwan Force. Lebanon’s health minister, Firass Abiad, told reporters Saturday that at least seven women and three children were killed in Friday’s airstrike on the building. He said another 68 people were injured, including 15 who were hospitalized. It was the deadliest strike on Beirut since the bruising monthlong war in 2006 between Israel and Hezbollah, and the casualty count could grow, with 23 people still missing, a government official said. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said the attack broke up the group’s chain of command while taking out Akil, who he said was responsible for Israeli deaths. Akil had been on the U.S. most wanted list for years, with a $7 million reward, over his alleged role in the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut and the taking of American and German hostages in Lebanon during the civil war in the 1980s. ___ Sewell and Mroue reported from Beirut. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-news-09-22-2024-fb1aa8ae061885ba86855f7fe9ec5be7	2024-09-21T19:52:27-07:00	
Death toll rises to 30 after methane leak causes explosion at eastern Iran coal mine, state TV says	TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — A methane leak sparked an explosion at a coal mine in eastern Iran, killing at least 30 people and injuring 17 others, Iranian state media reported Sunday. Another 24 miners are believed to be trapped inside. The report said the deaths happened at a coal mine in Tabas, some 540 kilometers (335 miles) southeast of the capital, Tehran. Authorities were sending emergency personnel to the area after the blast late Saturday, it said. Around 70 people had been working there at the time of the blast. State TV later said 24 were believed to be trapped inside. Provincial Governor Mohammad Javad Qenaat told state TV that 30 miners had been killed and 17 injured. Iran's new reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian, preparing to travel to New York for the United Nations General Assembly, said he ordered all efforts be made to rescue those trapped and aid their families. He also said an investigation into the incident had begun. Oil-producing Iran is also rich in a variety of minerals. Iran annually consumes some 3.5 million tons of coal but only extracts about 1.8 million tons from its mines per year. The rest is imported, often consumed in the country’s steel mills. This is not the first disaster to strike Iran’s mining industry. In 2013, 11 workers were killed in two separate mining incidents. In 2009, 20 workers were killed in several incidents. In 2017, a coal mine explosion killed at least 42 people. Lax safety standards and inadequate emergency services in mining areas are often blamed for the fatalities.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-coal-mine-deaths-tabas-f118b458f3350d7d655116c36ec261b4	2024-09-21T19:50:26-07:00	
Marxist-leaning Dissanayake leads early official vote count in Sri Lanka's presidential election	COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) — Marxist-leaning lawmaker Anura Kumara Dissanayake leads early official results in Sri Lanka's presidential election, according to tallies released on Sunday by the Election Commission, but he is still short of the 50% needed for victory. The election held Saturday is crucial as the country seeks to recover from the worst economic crisis in its history and the resulting political upheaval. The election, contested by 38 candidates, was largely a three-way race among Dissanayake, incumbent liberal President Ranil Wickremesinghe and opposition leader Sajith Premadasa. Dissanayake was leading with 47% of total votes counted, followed by Premadasa with nearly 28% and Wickremesinghe with 15%. The election was a virtual referendum on Wickremesinghe’s leadership of a fragile recovery, including restructuring Sri Lanka’s debt under an International Monetary Fund bailout program after it defaulted in 2022. No major incidents were reported during the vote but authorities declared a countrywide curfew until midday Sunday as a precaution, police said. There were 17 million eligible voters and final results are expected Sunday evening. The government announced Thursday that it passed the final hurdle in debt restructuring by reaching an agreement in principle with private bond holders. At the time of its default, Sri Lanka’s local and foreign debt totaled $83 billion. The government says it has now restructured more than $17 billion. Despite a significant improvement in key economic figures, Sri Lankans are struggling with high taxes and living costs. Both Premadasa and Dissanayake say they will renegotiate the IMF deal to make austerity measures more bearable. Wickremesinghe has warned that any move to alter the basics of the agreement could delay the release of a fourth tranche of nearly $3 billion that is crucial to maintaining stability.	https://apnews.com/article/sri-lanka-presidential-election-dissanayake-wickremesinghe-results-50a8990acae90fabaddd8d01c0ef5bcd	2024-09-21T19:11:33-07:00	
World leaders are gathering in New York for the U.N. General Assembly. The outlook is gloomy	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Facing a swirl of conflicts and crises across a fragmented world, leaders attending this week’s annual U.N. gathering are being challenged: Work together — not only on front-burner issues but on modernizing the international institutions born after World War II so they can tackle the threats and problems of the future. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres issued the challenge a year ago after sounding a global alarm about the survival of humanity and the planet: Come to a 'Summit of the Future' and make a new commitment to multilateralism – the foundation of the United Nations and many other global bodies – and start fixing the aging global architecture to meet the rapidly changing world. The U.N. chief told reporters last week that the summit 'was born out of a cold, hard fact: international challenges are moving faster than our ability to solve them.' He pointed to 'out-of-control geopolitical divisions' and 'runaway' conflicts, climate change, inequalities, debt and new technologies like artificial intelligence which have no guardrails. The two-day summit starts Sunday, two days before the high-level meeting of world leaders begins at the sprawling U.N. compound in New York City. Whether it takes even a first step toward the future remains to be seen. There was no final agreement Saturday on its main outcome document – a lengthy pact that requires support from all 193 U.N. member nations to be adopted. Diplomats said Russia and a few others still had objections to the final text. 'Leaders must ask themselves whether this will be yet another meeting where they simply talk about greater cooperation and consensus, or whether they will show the imagination and conviction to actually forge it,' said Agnès Callamard, the secretary-general of Amnesty International. 'If they miss this opportunity, I shudder to think of the consequences. Our collective future is at stake.' This is the UN's biggest week of the year The summit is the prelude to this year’s high-level meeting, held every September. More than 130 presidents, prime ministers and monarchs are slated to speak along with dozens of ministers, and the issues at the summit are expected to dominate their speeches and private meetings, especially the wars in Gaza, Ukraine and Sudan and the growing possibility of a wider Mideast war. 'There is going to be a rather obvious gap between the Summit of the Future, with its focus on expanding international cooperation, and the reality that the U.N. is failing in Gaza, Ukraine and Sudan,' said Richard Gowan, U.N. director for the International Crisis Group. 'Those three wars will be top topics of attention for most of the week.' One notable moment at Tuesday’s opening assembly meeting: U.S. President Joe Biden’s likely final major appearance on the world stage, a platform he has tread upon and reveled in for decades. At the upcoming meetings, U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield told reporters this week: 'The most vulnerable around the world are counting on us to make progress, to make change, to bring about a sense of hope for them.' To meet the many global challenges, she said, the U.S. focus at the U.N. meetings will be on ending 'the scourge of war.' Roughly 2 billion people live in conflict-affected areas, she said. Last September, the war in Ukraine and its president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, took center stage at the U.N. global gathering. But as the first anniversary of Hamas’ deadly attack in southern Israel approaches on Oct. 7, the spotlight is certain to be on the war in Gaza and escalating violence across the Israeli-Lebanon border, which is now threatening to spread to the wider Middle East. Iran supports both Hamas in Gaza and Lebanon’s Hezbollah militants. Its new president, Masoud Pezeshkian, will address world leaders on Tuesday afternoon. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is scheduled to speak Thursday morning and Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday afternoon. Zelenskyy will get the spotlight twice. He will speak Tuesday at a high-level meeting of the U.N. Security Council — called by the United States, France, Japan, Malta, South Korea and Britain — and will address the General Assembly on Wednesday morning. They're trying to counter ‘a world of grim statistics’ Slovenia, which holds the council’s rotating presidency this month, chose the topic 'Leadership for Peace' for its high-level meeting Wednesday, challenging its 15 member nations to address why the U.N. body charged with maintaining international peace and security is failing — and how it can do better. 'The event follows our observation that we live in a world of grim statistics, with the highest number of ongoing conflicts, with record high casualties among civilians, among humanitarians, among medical workers, among journalist,' Slovenian U.N. Ambassador Samuel Zbogar told reporters. He cited a record-high 100 million people driven from their homes by conflict. 'The world is becoming less stable, less peaceful, and with erosion of the respect for the rules, it is sliding into the state of disorder,' Zbogar said. 'We have not seen this high need to rebuild trust to secure the future ever before.' A key reason for the Security Council’s dysfunction is the deep division among its five veto-wielding permanent members. The United States, Israel’s closest ally, is a supporter of Ukraine alongside Britain and France. Russia invaded Ukraine and has a military and economic partnership with China, though Beijing reasserted its longstanding support for every country’s sovereignty without criticizing Russia in a recent briefing paper for the U.N. meetings. French President Emmanuel Macron and Britain’s new prime minister, Keir Starmer, will be at the United Nations this week along with Biden. But Russian President Vladimir Putin and China’s President Xi Jinping are sending their foreign ministers instead. Neither Putin nor Xi attended last year, either. Guterres, who will preside over the whole affair this week, warned that the world is seeing 'a multiplication of conflicts and the sense of impunity' — a landscape where, he said, 'any country or any military entity, militias, whatever, feel that they can do whatever they want because nothing will happen to them.' 'And the fact that nobody takes even seriously the capacity of the powers to solve problems on the ground,' he said, 'makes the level of impunity (on) an enormous level.' ___ Edith M.

Israel raids and shuts down Al Jazeera's bureau in Ramallah in the West Bank	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Israeli troops raided the offices of the satellite news network Al Jazeera in the Israeli-occupied West Bank early Sunday, ordering the bureau to shut down amid a widening campaign by Israel targeting the Qatar-funded broadcaster as it covers the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. Al Jazeera aired footage of Israeli troops live on its Arabic-language channel ordering the office to be shut for 45 days. It follows an extraordinary order issued in May that saw Israeli police raid Al Jazeera's broadcast position in East Jerusalem, seizing equipment there, preventing its broadcasts in Israel and blocking its websites. The move marked the first time Israel has ever shuttered a foreign news outlet operating in the country. However, Al Jazeera has continued operating in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and in the Gaza Strip, territories that the Palestinians hope to have for their future state. There was no immediate acknowledgement of the shutdown by Israeli forces. The Israeli military did not respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press. Al Jazeera denounced the move as it continued broadcasting live from Amman in neighboring Jordan. Armed Israeli troops entered the office and told a reporter live on air it would be shut for 45 days, saying that staff needed to leave immediately. The network later aired what appeared to be Israel troops tearing down a banner on a balcony used by the Al Jazeera office. Al Jazeera said it bore an image of Shireen Abu Akleh, a Palestinian-American journalist shot dead by Israeli forces in May 2022. 'There is a court ruling for closing down Al Jazeera for 45 days,' an Israeli soldier told Al Jazeera’s local bureau chief, Walid al-Omari, in the live footage. 'I ask you to take all the cameras and leave the office at this moment.' Al-Omari later said that Israeli troops began confiscating documents and equipment in the bureau, as tear gas and gunshots could be seen and heard in the area. The Palestinians secured limited self-rule in Gaza and parts of the occupied West Bank through the 1993 Oslo agreements. While Israel occupies and controls vast areas of the West Bank, Ramallah is under full Palestinian political and security control, making the Israeli raid on the Al Jazeera office that much more surprising. The Palestinian Journalists Syndicate denounced the Israeli raid and order. 'This arbitrary military decision is a new aggression against journalistic work and media outlets,' it said. The Palestinian Authority administers parts of the West Bank. Its forces were driven from Gaza when Hamas seized power in 2007, and it has no power there. The network has reported on the Israeli-Hamas war nonstop since the militants’ initial cross-border attack on Oct. 7 and has maintained 24-hour coverage in the Gaza Strip amid Israel’s grinding ground offensive that has killed and wounded members of its staff. It remains unclear whether the Israeli military would target Al Jazeera's operation in Gaza as well. While including on-the-ground reporting of the war’s casualties, Al Jazeera's Arabic arm often publishes verbatim video statements from Hamas and other regional militant groups. That has led to Israeli claims by officials up to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the network has 'harmed Israel’s security and incited against soldiers.' Those claims have been vehemently denied by Al Jazeera, whose main funder, Qatar, has been key in negotiations between Israel and Hamas to reach a cease-fire to end the war. An order closing Al Jazeera in Israel has been repeatedly renewed in the time since, but it hadn't as of yet ordered the Ramallah offices closed. The war began when Hamas-led fighters killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in an Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel. They abducted another 250 people and are still holding around 100 hostages. Israel’s campaign in Gaza has killed at least 41,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which doesn’t differentiate between fighters and civilians. The closure of Al Jazeera's Ramallah office also comes as tensions continue to rise over a possible expansion of the war to Lebanon, where electronic devices exploded last week in a likely sabotage campaign by Israel targeting the Shiite militia Hezbollah. The explosions Tuesday and Wednesday killed at least 37 people — including two children — and wounded around 3,000 others.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-al-jazeera-gaza-war-hamas-4abdb2969e39e7ad99dfbf9caa7bb32c	2024-09-21T16:58:42-07:00	
Kenya's president visits Haiti as it grapples with future of international efforts to fight gangs	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — Kenyan President William Ruto arrived in Haiti on Saturday as the United Nations grapples with how to best support resource-strapped Kenyan and Jamaican forces, which have struggled to contain the gangs terrorizing the Caribbean nation. Ruto stepped off the plane, walking passed armed officers on a small patch of red carpet flanked by other officials. He headed to a Kenyan base at the airport where he met with police battling the gangs and a number of Haitian officials. Kenya was the first nation to send forces as part of a larger effort by the U.N. to offer international support to Haiti, which has spiraled into conflict and political turmoil following the 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse. About 400 Kenyan police are in Haiti. Earlier this month, about two dozen police and soldiers from Jamaica arrived in the country. But the United States and other countries have said that the forces aren't enough and lack resources to take on gangs, which control about 80% of the capital, Port-au-Prince. The mission is expected to have a total of 2,500 personnel, with the Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados, Benin and Chad also pledging to send police and soldiers, although it wasn’t clear when that would happen. While the U.S. has bounced the idea of a U.N. peacekeeping force, the idea would be far-fetched and controversial given the introduction of cholera and sexual abuse cases that occurred when U.N. troops were last in Haiti. Meanwhile, a U.N. human rights expert warned on Friday that gang violence is only spreading across Haiti and that Haiti’s National Police still lack the 'logistical and technical capacity' to fight gangs, which continue to encroach on new territory. Ruto's visit also comes days after Haiti created a provisional electoral council long sought by the international community to facilitate the first general election held in the country since 2016. In the power vacuum left by Moïse’s assassination, gangs have only seized more power. Many hope a general election will also help restore order to Haiti alongside the peacekeeping mission.	https://apnews.com/article/haiti-kenya-president-ruto-visit-dab81b20b27b87003d908c6dd89afa6e	2024-09-21T10:19:01-07:00

Congo frees 600 inmates at main prison in a bid to ease overcrowding	KINSHASA, Congo (AP) — Authorities in Congo said they released 600 prisoners in the country's main prison on Saturday as part of a process aimed at decongesting overcrowded prisons. Justice Minister Constant Mutamba announced the move during a ceremony at Makala Central Prison in Congo's capital, Kinshasha. There are plans for construction of a new prison in Kinshasa, he said, without giving more details. Makala prison, Congo’s largest penitentiary with a capacity for 1,500 people, holds more than 12,000 inmates, most of whom are awaiting trial, Amnesty International said in its latest country report. Earlier this month, an attempted jailbreak in the prison left 129 people dead, including some who were shot by guards and soldiers and others who died in a stampede at the overcrowded facility, according to authorities. Emmanuel Adu Cole, a prominent prison rights activist in Congo and president of the local Bill Clinton Peace Foundation, put the death toll at more than 200. There were also several cases of women raped during the attempted jailbreak, Congolese Interior Minister Jacquemin Shabani posted on X earlier this month, without elaborating. 'We have had a difficult time in recent days with everything that was happening here, there were rapes, we were victims, many of us died,' said Prisca Mbombo, one of the freed prisoners. The 22-year-old Mbombo spent two months in the prison after being arrested following a fight in a bar. 'We really thank this gesture from the minister and I will never return to this place,' she said. Inmates had increasingly grown frustrated with the poor conditions in the facility, including inadequate beds, poor feeding and poor sanitation. However, authorities failed to act despite warnings, said Cole, whose foundation has visited the prison in the past. Stanis Bujakera Tshiamala, a prominent Congolese journalist who was recently detained in the prison for months, spoke of its 'deplorable and inhumane' conditions and how inmates constantly lack food, water and medical care. Nearly 700 women, and hundreds of minors who are 'treated in the same way as adults,' are among the inmates, he said. Mutamba, the justice minister, said that around 10 minors were freed on Saturday, while he ordered prison authorities to examine the cases of all minors to organize more releases. There are around 300 minors at Makala prison, according to the prison's deputy director. 'I am happy to regain my freedom. I am still young and I can return to my studies,' Munganga Mungendo, a 16-year-old who spent more than a year at the prison after having been sentenced to four years for theft, told The Associated Press. All severely ill inmates at Makala prison will be released starting Sunday, Mutamba said.	https://apnews.com/article/congo-prisoners-freed-makala-prison-overcrowding-8accea18f4f8a94ee329b95ed943a902	2024-09-21T09:50:36-07:00	
New center-right government in France announced 2 months after divisive elections	PARIS (AP) — The French presidential palace unveiled a long-awaited new government Saturday dominated by conservatives and centrists. It came more than two months after elections that produced a hung parliament and deepened political divisions as France grapples with growing financial and diplomatic challenges. A left-wing coalition secured the most seats in June-July parliamentary elections but failed to win a majority. Student groups and activists from the hard-left France Unbowed party held protests around the country Saturday against a government they say rejects the voters' will. President Emmanuel Macron named conservative Michel Barnier as prime minister earlier this month even though Barnier's Republicans party had a poor showing in the elections, and Barnier put together the government after difficult negotiations. Macron approved, and it was announced at the presidential palace. Marine Le Pen 's far-right anti-immigration party National Rally has no seats in Barnier's government, but has enough votes in parliament to bring it down. The party won an indirect victory with the appointment of staunch conservative Bruno Retailleau as new interior minister, whose remit includes critical domestic issues like national security, immigration, and law enforcement. The makeup and direction of France's government is important because the country is a leading voice in EU policy, among the biggest world's economies and a nuclear-armed, veto-wielding member of the U.N. Security Council. The 39-member Cabinet includes primarily ministers from Macron's centrist alliance and the conservative Republicans. Jean-Noël Barrot is the new foreign minister, a centrist politician known for his work in digital transformation and European affairs. He brings extensive experience in navigating complex international issues notably within the EU. The new finance minister is Antoine Armand, an emerging figure in French politics now tasked with steering France’s fiscal policies and managing the upcoming 2025 budget, amid pressure from Brussels to address France’s mounting debt. Sébastien Lecornu retains his post as defense minister. He has been instrumental in bolstering France’s military capabilities, including modernizing defense systems and managing military aid to Ukraine. His leadership in defense will be crucial as France navigates its role within NATO and handles rising geopolitical tensions over the wars in Ukraine and the Mideast. Barnier’s ability to govern effectively is already under scrutiny, with his political opponents on the left vowing to challenge him at every turn and the far right saying it will monitor the government closely. The left-wing New Popular Front alliance surprised many by winning the most seats in the risky snap elections that Macron called in the wake of a far-right victory in European Parliament elections. But the New Popular Front was not given a chance to form a minority government, and refused to make concessions and join a more left-leaning government alliance. Barnier, a 73-year-old political veteran known for his role as the European Union’s Brexit negotiator, is no stranger to complex political tasks. However, forming a government that can survive in such a divided parliament will test his extensive experience and political acumen. Barnier’s first major political test will come on October 1, when he is set to deliver his general policy speech to the National Assembly. ___ Associated Press writer Angela Charlton in Paris contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/france-new-government-7711ba405d2858433dd9f27de9b1f07b	2024-09-21T09:06:12-07:00	
Secret Service’s next challenge: Keeping scores of world leaders safe at the UN General Assembly	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Below United Nations headquarters, a state-of-the-art security post dubbed the 'Brain Center' hums with activity on the eve of next week’s high-level meeting of the U.N. General Assembly. The annual diplomatic pilgrimage is bringing more than 140 world leaders to New York City, including the leaders of Israel, the Palestinians and Ukraine. Keeping them safe is the U.S. Secret Service’s next big challenge. The agency, under a cloud after a July assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, is confident in its multi-layer, multi-agency plan to protect the U.N. General Assembly, which is deemed a Super Bowl-level National Special Security Event. The plan — developed with New York City police and the U.N. Security and Safety Service, among other agencies — includes not just motorcades and protective details, but NYPD helicopters and patrol boats, a dozen U.N. security K-9 teams sweeping for explosives, road closures and traffic diversions. The Secret Service is bringing in agents from posts around the world for the event. The Coast Guard is restricting East River access near the U.N. and the Federal Aviation Administration is closing airspace. With so many presidents, prime ministers, monarchs and others dignitaries in one city and under one roof at the same time, the U.N. General Assembly is actually bigger than the Super Bowl. It's the most complex event the Secret Service is involved in each year. This year, it's coming during a especially busy stretch highlighted by the Republican and Democratic conventions and the final weeks of the presidential campaign. Speaking Monday after the Secret Service thwarted another apparent assassination attempt on Trump in Florida, Acting Director Ronald L. Rowe Jr. said employees were 'redlining' like an engine pushed to its limit. But, he said, 'they are rising to this moment' and meeting the challenges. 'The operational tempo is incredibly high,' said Patrick Freaney, the special agent in charge of the Secret Service’s New York field office. The Associated Press got a rare look inside security preparations for the U.N. General Assembly, known as UNGA, including the 'Brain Center' and a joint operations center that lets the Secret Service, NYPD and other agencies communicate instantly to root out threats and logistical snags. They're also coordinating with the foreign security services that protect each of the dignitaries. Freaney said the National Special Security Event designation — for special events of national significance — smooths the way for interagency planning, communication and cooperation. The Secret Service is in charge, but the NYPD’s robust counterterrorism and other operations, and the U.N.’s 300-person Security and Safety Service, play pivotal roles. 'We have over 140 heads of state, heads of government that we’re moving around the city,' Freaney said during a tour of the joint operations center, which has space for 10 local and federal agencies, including the FBI and Federal Emergency Management Agency and the State and Defense departments. 'One of the most important things is bringing all of them in here and then departing safely,' Freaney said. 'Think about that logistically — bringing 140 motorcades into one area all at the same time. This plays an integral part of bringing those details in safely.' The Secret Service, NYPD and State Department will also be operating their own command centers — in Brooklyn, at One Police Plaza in Manhattan and at a nearby hotel ballroom. The NYPD, the nation’s largest police force, has its Joint Operations Center equipped to give officers real-time feeds from security, drone and helicopter-mounted cameras, along with other critical information. The U.N. Security and Safety Service, which is in charge of keeping the U.N. headquarters campus secure, has its command post in the 'Brain Center.' Down a basement hall from the main hub of U.N. activity, wall-to-wall monitors show live feeds from dozens of the 1,400 security cameras on the 18-acre (7.2-hectare) headquarters campus. All are recorded and can be reviewed instantly. Automated voices alert potential breaches and emergencies. Computers generate real-time data and photos for each of upwards of 22,000 people who pass through security checkpoints per day. Fire alarms tie directly into the city’s central dispatch system for immediate response. The command post is staffed around the clock by U.N. security officers who work in 12-hour shifts while world leaders are in town. The goal, Inspector Malinda McCormack said, is to receive, analyze and quickly disseminate information. Security plans for UNGA started to take shape a few months ago. The Secret Service and its partner agencies use past gatherings — this is the 79th edition — as a blueprint, while making adjustments for changing world events such as the wars in Gaza and Ukraine. 'There’s an incredible trust,' said Michael Browne, chief of the U.N. Security and Safety Service. 'There’s incredible sense of collegiality and collaboration, which I think is a key ingredient for success in a very complex and challenging operation such as UNGA.' As of Friday, authorities said, there were no specific or credible threats to the event. But, Rebecca Weiner, the NYPD’s deputy commissioner for intelligence and counterterrorism, acknowledged 'the chaoticness, the diversity and the unpredictable nature of the threat environment' requires law enforcement to be nimble and anticipate all the many ways someone could seek to cause harm. 'These are very different times,' Weiner said. World leaders are meeting at the UNGA for the first time since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, triggered an Israeli offensive in Gaza that has killed tens of thousands of people. NYPD Chief of Patrol John Chell said Friday that the department has tallied more than 4,000 protests over the war, with more anticipated next week. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas are both expected at UNGA. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is also expected to return. Russian President Vladimir Putin will not be attending but is sending Russia's foreign minister Sergey Lavrov. While the fighting is an ocean away, authorities are 'thinking about what’s happening overseas in these home countries and what we can anticipate here,' Weiner said. 'The whole purpose of this assembly is bringing countries together,' she added. 'The whole purpose of our security posture is making sure we’re doing the same.'	https://apnews.com/article/united-nations-security-unga-secret-service-new-york-0fdc166c4718f856ad74214e56138e78	2024-09-21T08:48:16-07:00	
Madonna makes veiled entrance to Dolce&Gabbana for show celebrating her 1990s heyday	MILAN (AP) — Celebrities swarmed Milan Fashion Week on the last big day of runway shows on Saturday, sending crowds of adoring fans from venue to venue. Madonna sat in a front-row seat at Dolce &amp; Gabbana, along with Naomi Campbell and Victoria De Angelis of Maneskin. Her bandmate, Maneskin frontman Damiano David, showed up at Diesel, one of the season's hottest tickets, across town. Jacob Elordi took a seat on a bunny-shaped bean bag chair to take in the Bottega Veneta show. Highlights from Milan Fashion Week's mostly womenswear previews for next spring and summer on Saturday. Dolce &amp; Gabbana Celebrate Madonna Madonna attempted a semi-stealth entrance to the Dolce &amp; Gabbana runway show draped in a black veil for a runway show referencing her 1990s heyday and celebrating the cone bra. Models in bleach-blonde wigs strutted in Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana’s signature corsets and fitted jackets, each featuring the aggressively feminine cone bra, in a collection that notes said 'pays homage to an ironic and powerful female figure.' Madonna wasn't cited specifically, but the stars of the Milan designers and pop star have been aligned ever since they made costumes for her 1993 Girlie Show tour. The tour promoted Madonna's 'Erotica' album launched alongside her taboo-breaking coffee table book, 'Sex.' 'Madonna has always been our icon. It’s thanks to her that a lot of things in our lives changed,'' the desigers said in a note. The collection, dubbed 'Italian Beauty,' perfectly captured that moment in time. Cone bras peeked out of cropped jackets with a pencil skirt, garters swung from corsets and coats sculpted the body. Floral prints returned, accenting a color scheme of black, nude, red and white. Oversized cross earrings finished the looks. Heels were unapologetically high. After taking their bows, the designers walked down the runway to greet their guest of honor. Madonna, still covered by the Chantilly long lace veil fastened by a gold and crystal crown, stood to embrace them both. Bottega Veneta taps wonder Bottega Veneta's sometimes misproptioned, sometimes crinkled, always provocative collection explores the intersection between the real world and fantasy, adulthood and childhood. Creative director Matthieu Blazy's meaning is simple: To delight. 'We need beauty. We need joy,'' Blazy said backstage. 'We need that experimental act. It is also an act of freedom.' In this universe, a dental clinic receptionist wears a skirt with a trouser on just one leg, which Blazy asserts as a playful act. In a familiar scene, a well-dressed father carries his daughter's pink and purple school bag. 'Do we like the bag? I don’t know. Does it tell a story? Yes,'' Blazy said. Each detail is deliberate, from a flat collar on a dress shaped like bunny ears to big colorful raffia wigs, even if their ultimate purpose is just for fun. Crinkled clothes signify a childn's attempt to dress up, only to be ruined by the end of the day. Blazy's characters carried what appeared to be ordinary plastic grocery bags, but which were made out of nylon and leather — part of the brand's ongoing technological innovations. The faux plastic bags signified everyday life, and were accompanied by brand’s trademark woven bags, one for a violin, another a wine bottle. Ferragamo’s freedom of movement Ferragamo creative director Maximilian Davis celebrated the freedom of movement inherent in ballet in his new collection, inspired by archival photos of brand founder Salvatore Ferragamo fitting African American ballet dancer Katherine Dunham for shoes. Dunham often trained and worked in the Caribbean, which allowed the British designer’s with Jamaican roots 'to find a link between Ferragamo’s Italian-ness and my heritage.' The collection recalls a 1980s way of dressing, with strong shoulders and oversized tailoring, also an homage to Russian ballet star Rudolf Nuryev, another historic Ferragamo customer. To emphasize movement, Davis created long parachute dresses in silk nylon, suede and organza with a billowing bubble shape. The ballet dancer is honored in cashmere dancer wraps color-blocked with layered leotards. More subversively, shorts with frayed denim suggested a tutu. Diesel elevates denim Deisel models tramped a field of 14,800 kilograms (nearly 33,000 pounds) of denim scraps 'to highlight the beauty of waste,″ creating a dystopian backdrop for the brand’s latest collection of elevated denim. The Veneto-based brand under creative director Glenn Martens has become a laboratory for textile experimentation. Short-shorts are embrodered with a cascade of extra-long fringe, for a skirt-like effect. Jeans are lasered to look destroyed; necklines on cotton sweatshirts look distressed but the effect is actually a jaquard with the cotton burned away to the tulle. Marten's said the brand's 'disruption' goes beyond its design. 'We are pushing for circularity in our production,'' he said. In that vein: A coat was made from leftover spools of denim thread, while oversized jeans were from recycled cotton, some from Diesel's own production. And the scraps piled on the floor were to be repurposed after the show.	https://apnews.com/article/madonna-dolce-gabbana-milan-fashion-week-0bdaa338eacd9e0cbbe26918e34d50c9	2024-09-21T08:23:57-07:00	
Climate activists cleared in UK of charges in rooftop protest at Sunak's estate	LONDON (AP) — Four Greenpeace activists arrested for scaling the country estate of former U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and draping it in black fabric to protest his plan to expand oil and gas drilling in the North Sea have been cleared of criminal charges. Judge Adrian Lower in York Magistrates’ Court threw out the charges Friday after finding the evidence was too 'tenuous' to convict them of criminal damage for allegedly cracking tiles on Sunak's slate roof in North Yorkshire. 'Justice and common sense prevailed in court today, but that hasn’t been the case for many activists recently,' one of the defendants, Michael Grant, said outside court. 'We have become a country that regularly sends peaceful protesters to jail, with some facing years behind bars for trying to preserve a habitable planet for us all. This has to stop.' While other environmental protesters, including climate activist Greta Thunberg, have also prevailed in U.K. courts, many others have been convicted and some have received stiff prison sentences. Five activists who planned a protest to block traffic on a major highway circling London that caused major gridlock over several days in November 2022 were sentenced in July to as much as five years in prison. The trial against Grant, 64, Amy Rugg-Easey, 33, Alexandra Wilson, 32, Mathieu Soete, 38, was halted in July after defense lawyer Owen Greenhall argued that prosecutors failed to prove that 15 slate tiles were damaged by the protesters during a five-hour protest in August 2023. The four cloaked the house in long black sheets while two fellow protesters stood on the lawn below holding a banner with the words 'Rishi Sunak — Oil Profits or Our Future?' Sunak and his family were on vacation in California at the time. Earlier that week, Sunak — a Conservative who was ousted in July this year by Labour Party leader Keir Starmer — had announced that Britain would grant hundreds of new oil and gas licenses in the North Sea, a move widely criticized for reversing the government’s pledge to eliminate net carbon emissions by 2050. U.N. scientists and environmental groups have called on global leaders to accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels blamed on rising temperatures, drought and floods linked to human-made climate change. Burning oil and gas to power vehicles, factories and electricity generating stations releases huge amounts of carbon dioxide, the main driver of global warming. Damage to Sunak's roof was estimated at about 3,000 pounds ($4,000). A roofer who had a contract with Sunak testified at the trial that the 15 broken tiles he examined from an area where the protesters had been showed they were recently damaged. But Greenhall said the testimony was unreliable because of the roofer’s business relationship with Sunak and because there was damage to tiles on other areas of the roof untouched by the protesters. 'It’s clear this is a roof where there is preexisting damage in areas where the protesters did not go,' Greenhall said. 'This is not a pristine roof by any means.' The judge said that he would issue a full ruling on Nov. 11.	https://apnews.com/article/greenpeace-protesters-cleared-sunak-house-roof-uk-ce967ead5b674054e613efac4beac70c	2024-09-21T08:10:09-07:00	
The Czech opposition wins big in the regional election and leads in the Senate vote	PRAGUE (AP) — The main opposition party dominated Czech regional elections and was ahead in the first round of voting for Parliament’s upper house, according to results released Saturday. With almost all the votes counted, the ANO (YES) movement led by former populist Prime Minister Andrej Babis won 10 of the 13 regions contested in the election on Friday and Saturday, the Czech Statistics Office said. The result reflected a stable support for ANO, which also won 10 regions in 2020 and nine in 2016, and a boost for Babis ahead of next year's general election. ANO also has the most candidates advancing to the runoffs for 27 seats in the 81-seat Senate. The top two finishers in each district will face each other in a head-to-head vote next weekend. With ballots from 99% of stations counted, ANO had 19 candidates advancing to the runoffs. The Czech Statistics Office said five candidates reached the 50% threshold to win seats outright, leaving 22 seats to be decided in runoffs next week between the top two finishers in each race. The outright winners included two candidates from ANO, one from the Christian Democrats, a member of the governing five-party coalition, an independent representing the coalition and an opposition Social Democrat. Government lawmakers currently have a clear majority in the Senate. Parliament’s lower house is more powerful, but the Senate plays an important role in passing constitutional amendments and approving Constitutional Court judges. The elections took place in the wake of massive floods that hit Central Europe in recent days, claiming at least 24 lives, five of them in the Czech Republic.	https://apnews.com/article/czech-regional-senate-elections-fb9952dae8e60d29d713f8641c4a66d5	2024-09-21T07:59:59-07:00	
Suspect in 1977 Melbourne cold case arrested in Italy	ROME (AP) — A man suspected of the brutal killing of two women in Australia nearly a half-century ago has been arrested in Rome on an international arrest warrant, Italian news agency ANSA reported on Saturday. The 65-year-old suspect, who has dual Greek and Australian citizenship, was detained at Rome’s Fiumicino airport on Thursday after landing on a flight that had departed from Greece, ANSA said. The man reportedly lived in Greece, where he was protected by the country’s statute of limitations, according to Australian media. Australian police said on Saturday they would start the process of extraditing the suspect, and Italian courts would set the timeline. The suspect is accused of killing two friends — Suzanne Armstrong, 27, and Susan Bartlett, 28 — in a knife attack that shocked Australia in January 1977. The young women were found dead in their rented house on Easey Street in Melbourne, while Armstrong’s 16-month-old son was left unharmed in his cot in another room. Both Armstrong and Bartlett had been stabbed multiple times. The crime, known as the 'Easey Street murders,' became Melbourne’s longest and most serious cold case, but no one had been arrested until now. Victoria Police offered a $1 million reward in 2017 to catch those responsible. That same year, new technology led to a breakthrough in the case, as the suspect became a fugitive following a request for a sample of his DNA.	https://apnews.com/article/italy-australia-melbourne-cold-case-arrest-a22609db092c922744303064039a79c7	2024-09-21T07:04:19-07:00	
Ukrainian President Zelenskyy will visit a Pennsylvania ammunition factory to thank workers	WASHINGTON (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday will visit the Pennsylvania ammunition factory that is producing one of the most critically needed munitions for his country's fight to fend off Russian ground forces. He is expected to go to the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant to kick off a busy week in the United States shoring up support for Ukraine in the war, according to two U.S. officials and a third familiar with Zelenskyy's schedule who spoke on the condition of anonymity to provide details that were not yet public. He also will address the U.N. General Assembly annual gathering in New York and travel to Washington for talks on Thursday with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. The Scranton plant is one of the few facilities in the country to manufacture 155 mm artillery shells. They are used in howitzer systems, which are towed large guns with long barrels that can fire at various angles. Howitzers can strike targets up to 15 miles to 20 miles (24 kilometers to 32 kilometers) away and are highly valued by ground forces to take out enemy targets from a protected distance. Ukraine has already received more than 3 million of the 155 mm shells from the U.S. With the war now well into its third year, Zelenskyy has been pushing the U.S. for permission to use longer range missile systems to fire deeper inside of Russia. So far he has not persuaded the Pentagon or White House to loosen those restrictions. The Defense Department has emphasized that Ukraine can already hit Moscow with Ukrainian-produced drones, and there is hesitation on the strategic implications of a U.S.-made missile potentially striking the Russian capital. Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned that Russia would be 'at war' with the United States and its NATO allies if they allow Ukraine to use the long-range weapons. At one point in the war, Ukraine was firing between 6,000 and 8,000 of the 155 mm shells per day. That rate started to deplete U.S. stockpiles and drew concern that the level on hand was not enough to sustain U.S. military needs if another major conventional war broke out, such as in a potential conflict over Taiwan. In response the U.S. has invested in restarting production lines and is now manufacturing more than 40,000 155 mm rounds a month, with plans to hit 100,000 rounds a month. During his visit, Zelenskyy is expected meet and thank workers who have increased production of the 155 mm rounds over the past year. Two of the Pentagon leaders who have pushed that increased production through — Doug Bush, assistant secretary of the Army for acquisition, logistics and technology and Bill LaPlante, the Pentagon's top weapons buyer — are also expected to join Zelenskyy at the plant, as is Gov. Josh Shapiro, D-Pa. The 155 mm rounds are just one of the scores of ammunition, missile, air defense and advanced weapons systems the U.S. has provided Ukraine — everything from small arms bullets to advanced F-16 fighter jets. The U.S. has been the largest donor to Ukraine, providing more than $56 billion of the more than $106 billion NATO and partner countries have collected to aid in its defense. Even though Ukraine is not a member of NATO, commitment to its defense is seen by many of the European nations as a must to keep Putin from further military aggression that could threaten bordering NATO-member countries and result in a much larger conflict. —- Associated Press writer Aamer Madhani contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-zelenskyy-pennsylvania-ammunition-plan-russia-war-7443f69928054f671fcf510d7204e468	2024-09-21T06:15:35-07:00	
Hundreds of parachutists drop over Dutch heath to commemorate World War II operation	GINKEL HEATH, Netherlands (AP) — Hundreds of paratroopers dropped out of near-cloudless skies over a heath in the central Netherlands on Saturday to commemorate the 80th anniversary of one of World War II's most daring — but ultimately unsuccessful — missions, Operation Market Garden. Paratroopers from the Dutch Air Mobile Brigade and 12 other NATO nations took part in a series of jumps over Ginkel Heath, watched by a small group of World War II veterans and some 60,000 spectators. Local mayor Rene Verhulst called the heath near Arnhem a place 'where 80 years ago courage, sacrifice and hope came together in the shape of the airborne landings during Operation Market Garden. Today we commemorate the brave young soldiers who risked and sometimes gave their lives for our freedom.' One of the soldiers involved, 99-year-old Geoff Roberts, was among 12 World War II veterans present on a warm fall day. For Operation Market Garden, he arrived in the nearby village of Wolfheze a day before the mass drops at Ginkel Heath. 'Well, I landed at Wolfheze in a glider and our next job was to capture this area for the people to come in the following day.' He said that the arrivals were delayed by bad weather and by the time the paratroopers arrived 'it was getting a bit naughty' at the drop zone as German forces had begun fighting back. After days of heavy fighting, he was taken prisoner and sent to work in a coal mine in Czechoslovakia. He was 20 years old when he returned home at the end of the war. Operation Market Garden was an audacious plan that aimed to seize back key bridges and roads from Nazi occupiers of the Netherlands so that Allied forces in Belgium could advance into the industrial heartland of Germany and bring the war to a swift end. It involved dropping nearly 35,000 paratroopers behind enemy lines using an aerial armada of gliders and other military planes. But stiff German resistance and stretched supply lines scuppered the plan as the Allies failed to hold a key bridge across the Rhine at Arnhem in a battle immortalized in the book and star-studded 1977 movie 'A Bridge Too Far.' About 11,500 Allied troops died in the nine days of Operation Market Garden, more than than during the D-Day landings in France two months earlier. The British 1st Airborne Division led the airborne assault. Paratroopers from the U.S. Army’s 101st and 82nd Airborne Divisions and Poland’s 1st Independent Parachute Brigade also were dropped into the Netherlands. The top general for U.S. forces in Europe, Gen. Christopher Cavoli, told The Associated Press that the way those countries fought together laid down a bedrock for the NATO alliance. 'It’s the spirit that we build on, right? It’s the spirit of cohesion that infuses the alliance today,' Cavoli said. 'The terrible events of the past couple of years have brought the alliance together, which is exactly what an alliance is for. It comes together in times of trouble,' he added. 'It comes together and builds on the bonds of the past. And you can feel that at a commemoration like this today, you feel the spirit of that alive.' Saturday's drops came just over a week after a tiny Dutch village remembered becoming the first settlement in the Netherlands to be liberated from German occupation. While parts of the southern Netherlands were recaptured by Allies in 1944, the major cities and other areas had to wait months and endure a winter famine before their occupation ended.	https://apnews.com/article/netherlands-wwii-market-garden-parachute-bridge-arnhem-8d6a35729e64dd9af14ec47a349b8bca	2024-09-21T04:11:35-07:00	
An Israeli strike on a school kills at least 22 people, Gaza Health Ministry says	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — An Israeli strike on a school in northern Gaza on Saturday killed at least 22 people, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, while the Israeli army said that it targeted a Hamas command center in what used to be a school. Another 30 were wounded in the strike on the school in the Zeitoun area of Gaza City, the ministry said in a statement. Most of the casualties were women and children, it said. It remains unclear which hospital the dead and injured were taken to. The Israeli army said earlier Saturday that it struck Hamas' 'command and control center, which was embedded inside a compound that previously served' as a school. It said steps were taken to limit harming civilians, including the use of precise munitions and aerial surveillance. Since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war, the Israeli army has struck a number of schools, packed with tens of thousands of Palestinians driven from their homes by Israeli offensives and evacuation orders. The conflict has left 90% of Palestinians in Gaza displaced, according to figures from the United Nations. The military has continually accused Hamas of operating from within civilian infrastructure in Gaza, including schools, U.N. facilities and hospitals. The contesting narratives over the use of schools and hospitals go to the very heart of the nearly yearlong conflict. Earlier this month, an Israeli strike hit a school in the Nuseirat refugee camp, killing 14, according to Palestinian medical officials. The Israeli military said that it was targeting Hamas militants planning attacks from inside the school. In July, Israeli airstrikes hit a girls' school in Deir al-Balah, killing at least 30 people sheltering inside. Israel’s military said that it targeted a Hamas command center used to direct attacks against its troops and store 'large quantities of weapons.' The war began when Hamas-led fighters killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in an Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel. They abducted another 250 people and are still holding around 100 hostages. Israel’s campaign in Gaza has killed at least 41,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which doesn’t differentiate between fighters and civilians. Also Saturday, the Gaza Health Ministry said five of its workers were killed and five others wounded by Israeli fire that struck the ministry’s warehouses in the southern Musbah area. Tensions soared in the region on Friday after an Israeli airstrike on a Beirut suburb in Lebanon killed dozens of people, including civilians and Ibrahim Akil, who was in charge of Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force. Also killed was Ahmed Wahbi, another senior commander in the group’s military wing. The strike came hours after Hezbollah launched one of its most intense bombardments of northern Israel in nearly a year of fighting. Israel’s Iron Dome missile defense system intercepted most of the rockets. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-gaza-755733f50ad52c5af05a2ea7ef082e26	2024-09-21T03:24:53-07:00	
Terrifying' twister damages homes and trees in English town but causes no casualties	LONDON (AP) — A rare tornado touched down in England, toppling trees, tearing off roof tiles and terrifying residents. Nobody was injured by the twister that struck Aldershot, a town about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of London, at midday Friday as thunder and rain pounded down. 'The trees in the back garden were bent over and it was freaking us out,' local resident Louise Le Poidevin said. 'Everything was lifted off the ground, the leaves were in a big spiral going round. I thought the doors and windows would come in, the noise was terrifying, then a gazebo came flying over.' 'Then as soon as it started, 30, 40, 50 seconds later, it had gone,' she said. The Tornado and Storm Research Organization, a private research group, said the tornado traveled 2 kilometers (1.25 miles) and had a preliminary rating as light or mild. Authorities said the winds damaged several homes and trees.	https://apnews.com/article/tornado-england-aldershot-damage-homes-weather-3d6652b45a51732dd9b08565a74f3daf	2024-09-21T02:41:46-07:00	
Zelenskyy hopes for quick US action as more arms depots are hit in Russia	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A major Ukrainian drone attack set multiple Russian arms depots ablaze, destroying what Ukraine's General Staff said were thousands of tons of weaponry, including missiles from North Korea. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, meanwhile, appealed for quick action from the United States to send more weapons before his visit to the White House next week with a multi-point 'victory plan.' Ukraine launched more than 100 drones at Russia and the occupied Crimean Peninsula overnight, Russian news reports and the Defense Ministry said Saturday. The strikes set an arms depot on fire that appeared to be in the same town as one struck by Ukrainian drones early Wednesday, wounding 13 people and also causing a huge blaze. Arms and ammunition depots were also hit in Russia's southern Krasnodar region. The 'victory plan' that Zelenskyy will present to U.S. President Joe Biden will include long-range strike capabilities and other weapons long sought by Kyiv, and will serve as the basis for any future negotiation with Russia, Zelenskyy told reporters. Zelenskyy reveals scant details Zelenskyy has regularly alluded to the plan’s preparation, but hasn't publicly outlined its contents, saying only that it contains terms acceptable for Ukraine to negotiate with Russia. 'This will be the start and foundation for talking in any format with Russia. In any format, with any of its representatives, because there will be a plan and something to show,' Zelenskyy said in a briefing Friday. Zelenskyy said he will present the plan to Biden and Kamala Harris, the U.S. vice president and presidential candidate. Zelenskyy said that he also plans to meet with Harris' opponent in the November election, former President Donald Trump. He said U.S. reluctance so far to allow Ukraine to use Western weapons to strike deep inside Russia stems from fears of escalation from Moscow, a major global nuclear power. Ukraine has had to use its own capabilities to conduct strikes inside Russian territory. 'I think that Biden is really getting information from his entourage today that there may be an escalation. But, and this is important, not everyone around him thinks so. And this is already an achievement that not all of his entourage thinks so,' Zelenskyy said. But the longer Western partners wait to allow the use of long-range missiles, the more tactically obsolete their value will become, Zelenskyy said. Ukraine’s Western backers have routinely been criticized for only helping the country to survive the invasion, rather than win, out of concern for the chaos that it might cause in Russia should Putin fall. The plan could be an attempt to change that calculus. Beyond making demands of Biden, Ukraine is likely to seek detailed commitments from European allies as well. Zelenskky said Thursday without elaborating that its success will rely on quick decisions by 'a number of actors' between October and December. Trump has said he would end the war immediately if he wins, and many in Ukraine and Europe fear that it won't be on favorable terms for Kyiv. Russian depots set on fire Also on Saturday, Ukraine's General Staff said that 'at least 2,000 tons' of weaponry, including missiles supplied by North Korea, were destroyed in a nighttime drone strike that targeted depots in Russia's south and northwest. Russian authorities on Saturday temporarily closed a 100-kilometer (62-mile) stretch of a highway and evacuated passengers from a rail station after a blaze caused a series of explosions near the town of Toropets, in Russia’s Tver region, about 380 kilometers (240 miles) northwest of Moscow and 500 kilometers (300 miles) from the Ukrainian border. Posts on local Telegram channels said a missile depot was struck near Toropets, the site of the attack Wednesday that struck a large arms storehouse, causing a huge blaze and prompting evacuations. It wasn't immediately clear whether the same depot was struck again. Unverified images circulating on Telegram on Saturday showed a large ball of flame rising into the night sky and dozens of smoke trails from detonations. In its latest regular intelligence update, the U.K. defense ministry called the Toropets site 'one of Russia's largest strategic ammunition depots directly supporting its operation in Ukraine' and said Saturday's strike likely caused 'enormous losses of ordnance.' The update, posted on X, referenced reports of North Korean missiles being stored at Toropets, but didn't independently confirm it. An ammunition depot and missile arsenal in southwestern Russia also caught fire in a separate attack Saturday in the Krasnodar region, triggering evacuations after the blaze caused a series of blasts near the town of Tikhoretsk. Videos on social media showed bright orange clouds rising over the horizon, as dull thuds of detonations sounded almost continuously. Russian state media described clouds of smoke rising from two sites near Tikhoretsk. Regional officials in both regions attributed to Tver’s regional government attributed the blazes to falling shrapnel from drones downed by Russian air defense. Russia’s Defense Ministry said early Saturday that its forces overnight shot down 101 Ukrainian drones over Russian territory and occupied Crimea. There were no immediate reports of casualties in either Russian region. A separate Ukrainian drone strike on Saturday wounded a tractor driver in Russia’s southern Belgorod region, Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov reported. Boy killed in Ukraine In Ukraine, a 12-year-old boy and two older women were killed as Russian missiles overnight struck Kryvyi Rih, Zelenskyy’s hometown in central Ukraine, local Gov. Serhii Lysak reported Saturday. Lysak said the missiles hit 'in the middle of the night, when the city slept,' wounding three more people, destroying two buildings and damaging another 20. In Kharkiv, Ukraine's second city, 15 people including young teens were wounded by Russian airstrikes on Friday evening, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said, more than twice as many as initially reported. Shortly after the strike, Terekhov said that seven civilians, including three children, were hurt after Russian Su-34 fighters dropped guided precision bombs on three Kharkiv districts. Russian drone and artillery strikes Saturday also wounded two men in Ukraine’s southern Kherson region, the local governor’s office reported. ___ Joanna Kozlowska reported from London.

Israel-Hamas war latest: Israel claims death of Hezbollah commander as Beirut toll rises	Israel claimed the death of a senior Hezbollah military official after a rare Israeli airstrike on Beirut as the death toll rose Saturday to at least 37 people, with dozens more wounded, shortly after Hezbollah pounded northern Israel with 140 rockets. The strikes are part of a new cycle of escalation between the enemies that has raised fears of a full-out war erupting in the Middle East, particularly after two separate attacks in Lebanon in which communication devices exploded simultaneously around the country, reportedly killing 37 people and injuring more than 3,400 others. Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire regularly since Hamas’ Oct. 7 assault on southern Israel ignited the Israeli military’s devastating offensive in Gaza. Gaza’s Health Ministry says more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in the territory during the nearly 1-year-old Israel-Hamas war. The ministry does not differentiate between fighters and civilians in its count but says a little over half of those killed were women and children. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. Here's the latest: Israeli military announces new safety guidelines after striking over 400 rocket launchers in Lebanon JERUSALEM — The Israeli military said that about 90 rockets had been fired at northern Israel from Lebanon on Saturday and that it struck more than 400 rocket launchers in Lebanon. It wasn’t immediately clear if anyone was killed or wounded in the back-and-forth attacks between Israel and Hezbollah, which follow an Israeli strike on Beirut that killed a top Hezbollah commander on Friday. Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, an Israeli defense spokesperson, announced updated safety guidelines for areas north of Haifa, including caps on gatherings of 30 people in open spaces and 300 in enclosed spaces. Work and school can continue if people can reach protected areas promptly. In practice, the new guidelines likely mean school will be canceled in parts of the north, since students and teachers wouldn’t be able to reach shelters in the required time. Within an hour of the announcement, Sunday classes were canceled in at least one border region in western Galilee. The cancellations include locations well outside the ordinary five-kilometer (three-mile) evacuation zone in northern Israel. Iran forces unveil new ballistic missile TEHRAN, Iran — Iran’s armed forces unveiled a new ballistic missile during an annual military parade Saturday amid tensions in the region. State television reported that the missile, called Jahad, was a single-stage liquid-fuel ballistic missile with a high-explosive warhead, and it had a range of 1,000 kilometers (more than 600 miles), making it theoretically capable or reaching Israel. Iran routinely unveils the technological achievements of its armed forces. In April, it launched hundreds of missiles and drones at Israel in retaliation for a suspected Israeli strike that killed two Iranian generals in an Iranian consular building in Syria. Israel said most of the missiles were intercepted. Lebanon's prime minister says he will not attend the UN General Assembly BEIRUT, Lebanon — Lebanon’s Prime Minister Najib Mikati says he will not go to New York to attend the U.N. General Assembly because of the ongoing acts of violence with Israel. Mikati’s office said the prime minister was scheduled to give Lebanon’s speech later this month at the United Nations but now he will discuss Lebanon’s diplomatic moves with Foreign Minster Abdallah Bouhabib who is currently in New York. 'There is no priority at the present time than stopping the massacres committed by the Israeli enemy,' Mikati was quoted as saying, a day after an Israeli airstrike in Beirut killed 37 people and wounded 68. Mikati said he calls for drafting international laws that prevent the use of civilian technological devices for military purposes. Mikati’s comments came days after thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies exploded in different parts of Lebanon, killing 39 people and wounding nearly 3,000 members of Lebanon’s Hezbollah group. Israel was blamed for the attack. White House national security adviser calls reported death of Hezbollah commander ‘a good outcome’ WILMINGTON, Del. — White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan called the reported death of Ibrahim Akil 'a good outcome' and said that he planned to speak with Israeli officials later Saturday about the operation. Akil, the main target of the Friday strike, had been wanted by the U.S. for years for his alleged role in the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut and in taking American and German hostages in Lebanon in the 1980s. He was under U.S. sanctions and in 2023, the U.S. State Department announced a reward of up to $7 million for information leading to his 'identification, location, arrest, and/or conviction.' 'That individual has American blood on his hands and has a rewards for justice price on his head,' Sullivan told reporters on the sidelines of the Quad summit that U.S. President Joe Biden is hosting in Wilmington, Delaware. 'He is somebody who the United States promised long ago we would do everything we could to see brought to justice.' Sullivan added the moment was also meaningful for the American victims. 'You know 1983 seems like a long time ago,' Sullivan said. 'But for a lot of families and a lot of people, they’re still living with it every day.' — from AP White House correspondent Zeke Miller in Wilmington, Delaware. Israeli strike on a school kills 22 people, Gaza Health Ministry says DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Israeli fire killed 22 people in a strike on a school in the north of the enclave, the Gaza Health Ministry said on Saturday. The strike on the school in the Zeitoun area of Gaza City injured another 30, the statement said. Earlier Saturday, the Israeli army said it struck a Hamas 'command and control center, which was embedded inside a compound that previously served' as a school. Death toll from Israeli strike on Beirut suburb rises to 31 BEIRUT, Lebanon — The death toll from an Israeli airstrike on a Beirut suburb has risen to 31, including seven women and three children, Lebanon’s health minister said Saturday. Firass Abiad told reporters that 68 people were also wounded in Friday's airstrike, of whom 15 remain in hospital, in the deadliest Israeli strike on Beirut since the Israel-Hezbollah war in the summer of 2006. Among the dead was Ibrahim Akil, a Hezbollah commander who was in charge of the group’s elite Radwan Forces, and about a dozen members of the militant group who were meeting in the basement of the building that was destroyed. Israel launched the rare airstrike in the densely populated southern Beirut neighborhood on Friday afternoon during the rush hour when people were returning home from work and students were leaving schools. On Saturday morning, Hezbollah’s media office took journalists to the site of the airstrike where workers were still digging through the rubble. Lebanese troops cordoned off the area around the building that was destroyed as members of the Lebanese Red Cross stood nearby to take any recovered bodies from under the rubble. Weaponizing ordinary devices violates international law, United Nations rights chief says UNITED NATIONS — Weaponizing ordinary communication devices represents a new development in warfare, and targeting thousands of Lebanese people using pagers, two-way radios and electronic equipment without their knowledge is a violation of international human rights law, the United Nations human rights chief said Friday. Volker Türk told an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council there must be an independent and transparent investigation of the two attacks in Lebanon on Tuesday and Wednesday where these devices exploded, reportedly killing 37 people and injuring more than 3,400 others. 'Those who ordered and carried out these attacks must be held to account,' he said. Lebanon has blamed Israel for the attacks, which appeared to target Hezbollah militants but also saw many civilian casualties, including children. Hezbollah has fought many conflicts with Israel, including a war in 2006, and it has conducted near-daily strikes against Israel to support Hamas militants who attacked Israel on Oct. 7. When reporters asked Israel’s U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon about speculation Israel was behind the two explosions, he said: 'We are not commenting.'	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-latest-21-september-2024-b8068c5fafa191b5a094b62c77ac8e80	2024-09-21T00:12:39-07:00	
Hezbollah leaders among 37 killed in Israeli strike in Lebanon	BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) — Two Hezbollah leaders were among those killed in an Israeli airstrike on a Beirut suburb , Israel’s military said Saturday, as Lebanon raised the death toll from the attack to 37, including women and children. Israel and Hezbollah continued to trade fire Saturday, a day after the airstrike claimed the lives of Ibrahim Akil, who was in charge of Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force, and Ahmed Wahbi, another senior commander in the group’s military wing. Firas Abiad told reporters that the dead included seven women and three children. He said another 68 people were wounded of whom 15 remained in hospital, adding that search and rescue operations were still ongoing, with the number of casualties likely to rise. The rare strike hit an apartment block in a densely populated south Beirut neighborhood on Friday afternoon during rush hour. It was the deadliest strike targeting the Lebanese capital since the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war. Hezbollah confirms more than a dozen operatives were killed Akil, the main target, had been wanted by the U.S. for years for his alleged role in the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut and in taking American and German hostages in Lebanon in the 1980s. He was under U.S. sanctions and the U.S. State Department last year announced a reward of up to $7 million for information leading to his 'identification, location, arrest, and/or conviction.' Wahbi was described as a commander who played major roles within Hezbollah for decades and was imprisoned in an Israeli jail in south Lebanon in 1984. Hezbollah said he was one of the 'field commanders' of a 1997 ambush in southern Lebanon that left 12 Israeli troops dead. Hezbollah announced overnight Friday that 15 of its operatives were killed by Israeli forces, but did not elaborate on the location of these deaths. Meanwhile, the Israeli army spokesperson, Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, said on Saturday a total of 16 Hezbollah fighters were killed in the strike. Israel earlier said Akil had been meeting with other militants in the basement of the apartment block. Rescue workers digging through rubble Lebanese troops cordoned off the area around the destroyed building as members of the Lebanese Red Cross stood nearby to take any bodies recovered from the rubble. On Saturday morning, Hezbollah’s media office took journalists on a tour of the scene of the airstrike where workers were still digging through building's ruins. The Minister of Public Works and Transport Ali Hamieh told reporters at the scene that 23 people are still missing. The airstrike on the crowded Qaim street knocked out an eight-story building that had 16 apartments and damaged another one adjacent to it. The missiles destroyed the building and cut through the basement where the meeting of Hezbollah officials was being held, according to an Associated Press journalist at the scene. Shops in a nearby building were badly damaged. Hezbollah bombardments preceded Israeli airstrike Friday's deadly strike came hours after Hezbollah launched one of its most intense bombardments of northern Israel in nearly a year of fighting, largely targeting Israeli military sites. Israel’s Iron Dome missile defense system intercepted most of the Katyusha rockets. The militant group said its latest wave of rocket salvos was a response to Israeli strikes on southern Lebanon. However, it came days after mass explosions of Hezbollah pagers and walkie-talkies killed at least 37 people — including two children. Some 2,900 others were wounded in the assault which has been widely attributed to Israel. The Lebanese health minister said Saturday hospitals across the country were filled with the wounded. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied involvement in the attack, which marked a major escalation in the past 11 months of simmering conflict along the Israel-Lebanon border. Israel airstrikes, Hezbollah rocket attacks continue On Saturday, Israel launched an intense wave of airstrikes on southern Lebanon, according to an Associated Press journalist in the area. The Israeli military said its air force was attacking Hezbollah targets, without providing further details. The militant group responded by firing a large number of rockets, local media reported. It remains unclear if there were any casualties in the latest strikes. Earlier this week, Israel’s security cabinet said stopping Hezbollah’s attacks in the country’s north to allow residents to return to their homes is now an official war goal, as it considers a wider military operation in Lebanon that could spark an all-out conflict. Israel has since sent a powerful fighting force to the northern border. Hezbollah has maintained that it will halt its strikes only when a cease-fire is reached in Gaza. The tit-for-tat strikes have forced tens of thousands of people to evacuate their homes in both southern Lebanon and northern Israel. Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire regularly since Hamas’ Oct. 7 assault on southern Israel ignited the Israeli military’s devastating offensive in Gaza. But previous cross-border attacks have largely struck areas in northern Israel that had been evacuated and less-populated parts of southern Lebanon. — Associated Press writer Jack Jeffery in Jerusalem contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-rocket-attack-mideast-tensions-0584727974096d98d1b5b132dfd1d218	2024-09-20T23:52:07-07:00	
Seal pup once rescued on a British beach hits the big 5-0. Sheba may be the oldest seal in captivity	LONDON (AP) — As gray seals go, Sheba is grayer than most. The grand dame of the Cornish Seal Sanctuary was celebrated Saturday for her 50th birthday, far surpassing the lifespan of a seal in the wild and possibly being the oldest in captivity. 'Reaching 50 is a huge milestone, not just for Sheba but for everyone here who has been part of her journey,' said Tamara Cooper, curator at the facility in southwest England. Things weren't looking bright for the young pup when she was rescued from a Cornwall beach in September 1974. Ken Jones found Sheba with a head injury and nasty eye infection and took her home where he and his wife, Mary, rehabilitated seals in a pool. As Sheba grew up, so did the rescue operation, moving from Jones' backyard to the Helford River in the village of Gweek and expanding to rehabilitate over 70 seal pups a year. Sheba’s condition, including loss of vision, prevented her return to the sea and she’s now outlasted all of the other creatures who have come and gone, making her a favorite fixture at the facility. Sheba’s longevity is attributed to the care she’s received and advances in veterinary medicine. Seals typically survive 25 to 30 years in the wild, Cooper said. Females in captivity can live to 40 while males live to about 30. Based on its research, the sanctuary staff believes Sheba is the oldest seal in captivity, said Heather Green, an animal care specialist Spook, a male gray seal born at the New York Aquarium in 1965, was thought to be the oldest seal when he died weeks shy of his 45th birthday in 2010. While Sheba's well-known and well-liked by the public and her handlers, she's not the most cooperative creature. When she was raised by Jones, his focus was on rescue, rehabilitation and release, Green said. There was no training for the animals that stayed behind until more recent years. She has been reluctant to learn new tricks, such as being rolled over for inspections of her belly, flippers, tails and teeth. When it comes to receiving drops for her milky eyes, she does well some days while on others she waddles her mottled-fur frame away and splashes back into the pool. 'She's a bit stubborn,' Green said. 'She’d been so used to just being fed and not having to work for her fish that even now she still protests slightly. If we ask her to do any behavior or something, it’s all on her own sweet time and she’ll definitely let you know if she’s up for training or not.'

Sri Lanka has more women voters than men but no female presidential candidates	COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) — Women make up more than half of the voters in Sri Lanka, but not a single one will be on the ballot in Saturday’s presidential election. The island nation of more than 22 million people is voting for a president to take its economy forward after it went through an unprecedented financial crisis two years ago that led to the ouster of its head of government. The election will allow more than 17 million eligible voters to choose from a record 38 candidates. But women — who account for nearly 9 million voters — will have no gender representation. 'I feel a little disappointed,' said first-time voter Sandami Nimesha. Nimesha, a 20-year-old information technology student, said even though presidents have an obligation to offer solutions to the problems faced by the public regardless of their gender, a woman president 'would give more attention to serve the female voters' and focus on issues that affect them. 'I think it’s better if there is a female candidate,' she said. Saturday's election is seen as a three-way contest between current President Ranil Wickremesinghe, opposition leader Sajith Premadasa, and parliamentarian Anura Dissanayake, who is leader of a Marxist-led coalition that has gained popularity. Results of the election are expected Sunday. Sri Lanka’s politics have mostly been dominated by men since the island nation introduced universal suffrage in 1931. It's a trend seen in most countries globally — in 2023, a Pew Research Center analysis found only 13 of the 193 member states of the United Nations had women as the head of government. To be sure, women have held some important positions in the Sri Lankan government in the past. Sirimavo Bandaranaike served her first term as prime minister of Sri Lanka for nearly five years starting in 1960. Even though it was her prime minister husband's assassination that forced her political entry, she held the distinction of being the world’s first woman to be elected prime minister and would go one to hold that office twice more. Her younger daughter, Chandrika Kumaratunga, later became the country’s first and only female president, holding office from 1994 to 2005. Both these women came from families with a political legacy. But even Sri Lankan women with political backgrounds tend to enter into politics only after the death or assassination of their male relatives, in most cases their husbands — particularly during the brutal civil war that began in 1983 and ended in 2009. For a country that passed a law in 2016 mandating local councils must be at least 25% women, a move widely seen as progressive in promoting gender equality, many feel there should be more parity in politics by now. Women's rights activist Sepali Kottegoda said the lack of female candidates for president is emblematic of a patriarchal structure deeply embedded in Sri Lanka’s politics. 'The main political parties are so male-oriented, and so many men on the top hold power, that they don’t find it convenient to step aside and allow women party members to come up and contest,' she said. Kottegoda, who founded the Colombo-based Women and Media Collective, was among those who advocated and worked to get the 25% quota for women in local councils. 'We felt that opening doors for women to get into local councils was one way through which they can work their way up,' Kottegoda said. Now, her organization is seeking a similar quota for women in the 255-member Parliament, where their representation stands at a mere 5.3%. In 2019, academic and scientist Ajantha Perera was the first woman to run for president in 20 years. She lost to Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who was ousted in 2022 after angry protesters blamed his administration for the unprecedented economic crisis. Even though Perera rues the absence of women in Saturday's election, she hopes a strong female candidate runs for the president’s office in future. 'I firmly believe that might make a difference,' she said.	https://apnews.com/article/sri-lanka-election-women-politics-president-bdcd45a3eb33461bfe6332ed16a1e27c	2024-09-20T19:42:27-07:00	
Separatist rebels release New Zealand pilot after 19 months of captivity in Indonesia's Papua region	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — A New Zealand pilot held hostage for more than a year in the restive Papua region was freed by separatist rebels, Indonesian authorities said Saturday. Phillip Mark Mehrtens, a 38-year-old pilot from Christchurch, was working for Indonesian aviation company Susi Air when he was abducted by rebels from a remote airport on Feb. 7, 2023. He was handed over early Saturday to the Cartenz Peace Taskforce, the joint security force set up by the Indonesian government to deal with separatist groups in Papua, after he was allowed to walk free, said the taskforce spokesperson Bayu Suseno. 'We managed to pick him up in good health' in the Yuguru village of Nduga district, Suseno said, adding that Mehrtens was flown to the mining town Timika for further health checks, including psychological examination. Rebels have used violence to try to achieve independence as the security situation deteriorates in Indonesia’s easternmost region of Papua, a former Dutch colony in the western part of New Guinea that is ethnically and culturally distinct from much of Indonesia. Papua was incorporated into Indonesia in 1969 under a United Nations-sponsored ballot that was widely seen as a sham. Since then, a low-level insurgency has simmered in the region. Conflict spiked in the past year, with dozens of rebels, security forces and civilians killed. Egianus Kogoya, a regional commander in the Free Papua Movement, initially said the rebels would not release Mehrtens unless Indonesia’s government allows Papua to become a sovereign country. Then on Tuesday, leaders of the West Papua Liberation Army, the armed wing of the Free Papua Movement known as TPNPB, issued a proposal for freeing Mehrtens that outlined terms including news media involvement in his release. Suseno said that Mehrtens’ release was the result of hard work from a small task force team that had been communicating with the separatists led by Kogoya through the local church and community leaders, as well as youth figures. 'This is incredibly good news,' said Suseno in a video statement. 'Effort to free the pilot by soft approach resulted in a hostage release without any casualties both from security forces, civilians or the pilot himself.' Television news showed an emaciated, long-haired Mehrtens, wearing a dark-green shirt and black shorts, sitting in a room surrounded by police officers and local figures. He sobbed while talking to his family via video and an officer tried to calm him down by patting his back. New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters confirmed Mehrtens’ release after 592 days in captivity. 'We are pleased and relieved to confirm that Phillip Mehrtens is safe and well and has been able to talk with his family,' Peters said in a written statement Saturday. 'This news must be an enormous relief for his friends and loved ones.' Peters said a wide range of New Zealand government agencies had been working with Indonesian authorities and others to secure the release for the past 19 1/2 months. Officials were also supporting Mehrtens’ family, Peters said. Many news outlets showed 'cooperation and restraint' in reporting the story, he added. 'The case has taken a toll on the Mehrtens family, who have asked for privacy,' Peters said. 'We ask media outlets to respect their wishes and therefore we have no further comment at this stage.' New Zealand news outlets reported during Mehrtens’ captivity that he was one of a number of expatriate pilots employed by Susi Air and in recent years lived in Bali with his family. 'We’ve got him free,' Peters told reporters Saturday in Auckland, New Zealand. The development was an 'enormous relief,' he said. Mehrtens was in Timika, Papua, Peters said, but would travel to the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, 'very, very soon to be reunited with his family.' Peters had not spoken to Mehrtens since his release. The news was 'one of the better stories I’ve had' in his 45 years as a lawmaker, the three-time foreign minister added. He declined to give details about how the pilot was freed. It was a 'tricky' environment and building trust had been the most difficult aspect, Peters said. 'It was quite nerve-wracking, holding our nerve and not getting too carried away, not doing anything that might imperil the chances,' he said. 'Because there was always a concern of ours that we might not succeed.' Indonesia President Joko Widodo congratulated the military and police who helped free the pilot by prioritizing persuasion and safety. 'This was through a very long negotiation process and our patience not to do it repressively,' Widodo said. An Air Force plane will take Mehrtens to Jakarta on Saturday afternoon for a reunion with his family, said Suseno, the taskforce spokesperson. In April 2023, armed separatists attacked Indonesian troops who were deployed to rescue Mehrtens, killing at least six soldiers. In August, gunmen stormed a helicopter and killed its New Zealand pilot, Glen Malcolm Conning, after it landed in Alama, a remote village in the Mimika district of Central Papua province. No one has claimed responsibility for that attack, and the rebels and Indonesian authorities have blamed each other. In 1996, the Free Papua Movement abducted 26 members of a World Wildlife Fund research mission in Mapenduma. Two kidnapped Indonesians were killed by their abductors. The remaining hostages were freed within five months. ___ Graham-McLay reported from Wellington, New Zealand. ___ This story has been updated with the correct spelling of the pilot's first name.

Shocking rape trial highlights the systematic struggles French sexual abuse victims face	AVIGNON, France (AP) — The trial of dozens of men accused of raping an unconscious woman whose husband repeatedly drugged her over the course of nearly a decade has highlighted the difficulties that sexual violence victims can face in France. Dominique Pelicot, 71, and his 50 co-defendants face up to 20 years in prison if they're convicted at a trial that has shocked the world and riveted the French public. Pelicot tearfully acknowledged in court that he's guilty of the allegations against him, and he said all of his co-defendants understood exactly what they were doing when he invited them to his home in Provence between 2011 and 2020 to have sex with his unconscious and unwitting wife, who divorced him after learning what he had done to her. Despite evidence including meticulously archived photos and videos that Pelicot shot of the alleged rapes, some of the defendants’ lawyers have scrutinized Gisèle Pelicot’s private life and motives, even questioning whether she was truly unconscious during some of the encounters. Although they must defend their clients to the best of their abilities, the lawyers' tactics have outraged advocates for the sexually abused, who say the attorneys show that victim-blaming is alive and well in France. 'This trial is the trial of our society,' 27-year-old Nathan Paris, who works in a youth shelter, said this week outside the Avignon courthouse. Paris, a victim of sexual violence himself, has made the trip from Marseille on several occasions since the trial began. 'The French population has evolved … and I feel like justice has not evolved over that time,' he said, vowing to keep coming back until the trial ends. The co-defendants range in age from their 20s to their 70s and represent a cross-section of French men: There is a firefighter, a journalist, a nurse, a prison guard and a construction worker. Some are retired, some are unemployed and many have families of their own. One knew he had HIV when he raped Gisèle Pelicot on six occasions and chose not to wear a condom, according to police. She didn't contract HIV, though she was found to have other sexually transmitted diseases, a medical expert testified. Magali Lafourcade, a judge and general secretary of the National Consultative Commission of Human Rights who is not involved in the trial, said the fight against sexual violence in France has slightly improved since the start of the #MeToo movement, which has brought down some of France’s most well-known actors and film directors, among other notables. Women have always talked, but their voices are now being heard more, she said. 'For a very long time, we saw the rape and killing of women by men as something that pertained to the private sphere — we thought we should not interfere with people’s private lives,' Lafourcade said. 'There has been a clear change, or revolution even, with this perception since #MeToo,' she added. Civic groups have lobbied hard in recent years so that judges, politicians and the media understand that sexual violence is not just a private affair, but also a societal, political and financial one, Lafourcade said. French President Emmanuel Macron has promised to prioritize gender equality and combat violence against women. But France’s public policies are still lagging, and more resources and effort need to be put toward going after sexual offenders, experts told The Associated Press. Lawyers and analysts agree that in many ways, the Pelicot trial is a slam dunk thanks to its abundance of highly incriminating evidence and its lead defendant's admission of guilt. Gisèle Pelicot also defies the widespread stereotype among French society that women who are raped might have provoked their assailants by seeking to attract the male gaze or being imprudent. She is a grandmother in her 70s who was drugged and unconscious whenever she was assaulted, according to police. 'Most victims don’t have that,' said Celine Piques, a spokesperson of the feminist group Osez le Féminisme!, or Dare Feminism!, stressing that 90% of women who say they were raped don't pursue charges because they don't think they'll stand a chance. 'In most cases, the victims’ words are called into question and the shame falls on them rather than on the man who committed the rape.' Piques said she has been particularly shocked by the questions about Gisèle Pelicot’s sex life, including 'whether she was into swinging or threesomes, when this woman was drugged and unconscious.' Gisèle Pelicot has shown remarkable calm and stoicism during the trial, even throughout the most gruesome and explicit descriptions of the abuse she suffered. But she grew exasperated on Wednesday when defense lawyers questioned her about graphic images taken of her that were shown in court for the first time. She had agreed to their display because she said she hoped they would serve as 'undeniable evidence.' 'I understand why victims of rape don’t press charges,' Pelicot told the five judges after a lawyer asked if she wasn't hiding any unusual sexual 'tendencies.' 'I’m not even going to answer this question, which I find insulting,' she responded, her voice breaking. She told the court that the first two weeks of the trial had been harrowing, saying, 'Since I’ve arrived in this courtroom, I’ve felt humiliated. I am treated like an alcoholic, an accomplice. ... I have heard it all.' Pelicot has become a symbol of the fight against sexual violence in France, and she's seen as a hero to many victims for waiving her anonymity, letting the trial be public and appearing openly before the media. She has attended every day of the trial, where she has sat in a room full of men accused of raping her. But despite the nauseating details that have emerged during the trial, it hasn’t stopped some from minimizing the abuse, with the mayor of the small community where the Pelicots lived, Mazan, apologizing Thursday for suggesting in a BBC interview that things could have been worse because 'no children were involved' and 'nobody died.' Such dismissiveness is pervasive in France's justice system, Lafourcade said. 'We have a real problem with the judiciary's treatment of sexual infractions, which is very painful for the victims and has a chilling effect,' she said. 'It discourages people from pressing charges.' Given how few cases are reported and how seldom the ones that are end in convictions, only a tiny fraction of assailants actually go to prison, Lafourcade said. 'And to reduce a crime, it is not the severity of the sentence that counts,' she added. 'It is the fact of being certain of being caught.' Pelicot's supporters believe she is making a difference by courageously facing the men accused of raping her and that broader change is on the horizon. 'Before, we never would have questioned a lawyer and his line of defense,' said Paris, the youth shelter worker. 'But today society is changing, people monitor what is happening and take into consideration the suffering of others.'	https://apnews.com/article/france-rape-trial-unconscious-wife-3b82c8b9df2e402b301e3c93d07849a1	2024-09-20T19:07:53-07:00	
The US is more hands-off than usual in the Middle East. It fears making things worse	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration is taking a more hands-off approach than usual during a week of dramatic escalation between Israel and Hezbollah militants in Lebanon, with top U.S. officials holding back from full-on crisis diplomacy for fear of making matters worse. The public restraint follows explosions of the militant group's pagers and walkie-talkies and an Israeli airstrike targeting a senior Hezbollah operative in Beirut, which threaten to spur all-out war between Israel and its enemies in the Middle East and doom already faltering negotiations for a cease-fire in the Hamas conflict in Gaza. The escalation came even as two Biden administration officials stopped in the region this week to appeal for calm. It heightens the impression that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hard-right government is paying ever less attention to the mediation efforts of its key ally, despite depending on the U.S. for weapons and military support. 'The United States looks like a deer in the headlights right now,' said Brian Katulis, a senior fellow for U.S. foreign policy at the Middle East Institute think tank in Washington. 'In terms of words, deeds and action ... it's not driving events, it's reacting to events.' There has been no publicly acknowledged U.S. contact with Netanyahu since senior White House official Amos Hochstein visited Israel on Monday to warn against escalation. The first wave of device explosions — widely blamed on Israel, which didn’t acknowledge responsibility — struck the next day. And Gaza cease-fire negotiations were at such a delicate point that Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited only Egypt in a trip to the region this week because traveling to Israel in support of a deal might cause Netanyahu to say something that undermines the U.S.-led mediation, U.S. officials said. Asked if the U.S. still had hope for a deal in Gaza — which the administration calls crucial to calming regional conflict — President Joe Biden said Friday that he did and his team is pressing for it. 'If I ever said it wasn’t realistic, we might as well leave,' Biden told reporters. 'A lot of things don’t look realistic until we get them done. We have to keep at it.' In the meantime, the White House and State Department have declined to comment publicly on the Hezbollah devices exploding Tuesday and Wednesday, killing at least 37 people and injuring thousands more, including civilians, in what analysts believe was a highly sophisticated Israeli intelligence operation. Nor would they offer any assessment of an airstrike Friday in a densely populated part of Beirut — the deadliest such strike on Lebanon’s capital in years — which killed a Hezbollah commander. The Israeli military said 10 other operatives also were killed. Lebanon's health ministry said at least 14 people died. Netanyahu and Hamas have followed past rounds of direct U.S. diplomatic outreach with fiery rhetoric or surprise attacks that the U.S. sees as setting back the effort for a truce. Blinken appeared to loop in the pager explosions as the latest example of that. When mediators seem to make progress in a Gaza deal, often there's an 'incident, something that makes the process more difficult, that threatens to slow it, stop it, derail it,' Blinken said in Egypt, in response to reporters' questions about the pager attacks. There may yet be high-level contact with Netanyahu when he travels to New York for next week’s U.N. General Assembly gathering of world leaders, said U.S. officials with knowledge of the discussions who spoke anonymously to discuss the administration’s strategy. But the officials also acknowledge that the situation has become so precarious that taking a public stance either firmly in support or critical of Israel would probably do more harm than good. In Washington, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller batted away a question about whether months of Biden administration visits to the Middle East without a cease-fire deal to show for them was making Blinken and other officials look like 'furniture' in regional capitals. 'So far, we have been successful of keeping it from turning into an all-out regional war,' Miller said. He credited U.S. messaging — sometimes through intermediaries, to Iran, its militia allies in the region and to Israel. The Biden administration pointed out that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has been in contact this week with his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant. Gallant's job, however, is said to be in jeopardy. Critics accuse the administration of pushing a deal on Gaza that’s repeatedly failed to win buy-in from the warring sides and has been outpaced by the growth of the conflict. The administration could do more diplomatically, including by working harder to rally Middle Eastern countries to intensify pressure on Israel, Iran and the latter’s proxies to stop fighting, said Katulis, the Middle East Institute analyst. U.S. officials rejected assertions that they have given up on either a Gaza cease-fire or preventing the conflict from spreading to all-out war in Lebanon. 'We'd be the first ones to recognize ... that we are not closer to achieving that than we were even a week or so ago,' national security spokesman John Kirby said Friday. 'But ain't nobody giving up,' Kirby said, reiterating that the U.S. was working with fellow mediators Qatar and Egypt to put together a final Gaza proposal to present to Israel and Hamas. 'We're still going to keep the shoulder to the wheel. We're still going to keep trying on this.' ___ AP reporter Aamer Madhani contributed from Washington.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-gaza-united-states-middle-east-8d80f42131c5b5af88fffe9ca85fc725	2024-09-20T19:03:32-07:00	
Weaponizing ordinary devices violates international law, United Nations rights chief says	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Weaponizing ordinary communication devices represents a new development in warfare, and targeting thousands of Lebanese people using pagers, two-way radios and electronic equipment without their knowledge is a violation of international human rights law, the United Nations human rights chief said Friday. Volker Türk told an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council there must be an independent and transparent investigation of the two attacks in Lebanon on Tuesday and Wednesday where these devices exploded, reportedly killing 37 people and injuring more than 3,400 others. 'Those who ordered and carried out these attacks must be held to account,' he said. Lebanon has blamed Israel for the attacks, which appeared to target Hezbollah militants but also saw many civilian casualties, including children. Hezbollah has fought many conflicts with Israel, including a war in 2006, and it has conducted near-daily strikes against Israel to support Hamas militants who attacked Israel on Oct. 7. Before the council meeting, Israel’s U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon was asked by reporters about speculation Israel was behind the two explosions. 'We are not commenting on the specific attacks you mentioned, but I can tell you that we will do everything we can to target those terrorists to minimize casualties for civilians,' he replied. Lebanon’s Foreign Minister Abdallah Bouhabib accused Israel of terrorizing the entire Lebanese population on streets, in markets, shops and their homes where their communications devices exploded. He held up a photo of a mangled and bloodied hand, telling ambassadors from the 15 council nations: 'Look at the ugliness of what has happened in this picture.' Bouhabib insisted that Israel not only launched the attacks but told the council there were 'official declarations' and a tweet by an adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 'that was lately deleted, emphasizing the responsibility of Israel and praising the positive results of this assault.' He appeared to be referring to a deleted tweet by Netanyahu adviser Topaz Luke, who reportedly retweeted a post that included a reply indicating that Israel was behind the attacks in Lebanon and neighboring Syria. Israel’s Danon criticized the Lebanese minister for never mentioning Hezbollah and said the Lebanese people are 'trapped in the grip of this terrorist organization.' Lebanon’s Bouhabib warned the council that if it doesn’t condemn the week’s deadly explosions and name Israel as the perpetrator, a 'Pandora’s Box' will be opened, and governments and extremists will target, terrorize and kill civilians with similar communications devices on trains, planes and elsewhere. Türk, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, said the explosions not only violated international human rights law but also appear to violate international humanitarian law’s key principles in carrying out attacks: distinction between civilians and combatants, proportionality, and precautions. International law also prohibits the use of booby-trap devices that look harmless, he said, and 'it is a war crime to commit violence intended to spread terror among civilians.' 'Let me be clear — this method of warfare may be new and unfamiliar,' Türk said, 'but international humanitarian and human rights law apply regardless and must be upheld.' Israel’s Danon blamed Iran and its 'puppet' Hezbollah for the military action across the Lebanon-Israel border. 'While Israel is not seeking a wider conflict, let me be clear: We will not allow Hezbollah to continue its provocations,' he said. Israel will do 'whatever it takes' to return its 60,000 citizens who fled their homes in the north because of attacks, 'and we will not allow Hezbollah’s terror to dictate the future of our nation.' Iran’s U.N. Ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani countered that 'Israel bears full responsibility for the perpetration of such horrific crimes,' and said his government will pursue accountability for the attack on the country’s ambassador to Lebanon, whose eyes were injured in the explosions Tuesday. He said the gravity of the attacks against the Lebanese people must also be seen as 'a threat to peace and security across the region.' He added that 'the international community must not ignore the role the Western countries, in particular the United States and U.K., play in enabling Israel’s aggressions.' U.N. political chief Rosemary DiCarlo warned the council that the explosions along with more than 11 months of bloodshed in Gaza, and near-daily exchanges of fire across the Israel-Lebanon border, pose a grave risk to security and stability in the region. She urged all actors to exercise maximum restraint, and she strongly urged countries with influence on the parties 'to leverage it now.' Earlier, U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric urged Israel and Hezbollah to immediately return to the cessation of hostilities that existed before Hamas’ Oct. 7 attacks in southern Israel and Israel's responding military campaign in Gaza, warning that 'the region is on the brink of a catastrophe' and a diplomatic solution should be pursued urgently.	https://apnews.com/article/un-lebanon-explosions-pagers-international-law-rights-9059b1c1af5da062fa214a1d5a3d7454	2024-09-20T17:57:47-07:00	
AP PHOTOS: Cascading disasters push residents of a Nepalese valley to the brink	MELAMCHI, Nepal (AP) — In between the Himalayas' towering mountains, the town of Melamchi is no stranger to extreme weather, and its landscape bears the scars of years of floods and landslides. Located just 50 kilometers (31 miles) outside Kathmandu, lush green mountainsides are dotted with landslips and rubble. Amid the debris, people live and work, and children play. Saroj Lamichane, a 24-year-old resident of the region, says he still remembers 'the terrifying sound of the flood.' Lamichane fled that night, returning only to collect belongings wedged between boulders and broken walls. Many houses in Melamchi are on stilts to avoid the worst of the flooding. Still, floors are covered in a layer of loose rock. Windows have been ripped out of walls. And some buildings still slant after Nepal's devastating 2015 earthquake. Farms are also not spared. Sukuram Tamang, 50, lost his land and field to floods in 2021, and his home was damaged in a landslide this year. When The Associated Press visited, Tamang stood holding one of his goats — a literal handful of what survived Melamchi's incessant weather extremes. 'Even the little that remained has been swept away by floods earlier this year,' said Tamang's wife, Maya. 'The river used to be a 20-minute walk from our house but during the floods, we were shocked to see it overflow and wash away everything we had.' Another farmer, Sita Pandit, 50, took a loan to rebuild her home that was destroyed in the earthquake. But one year after construction finished, her new home was swept away by the 2021 floods. Rocks and debris now cover her farm. In a 2021 report, the Kathmandu headquartered International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development found that cascading hazards are becoming more common in Nepal and the Hindu Kush Himalaya. Rising temperatures are leading to heavy glacial melt and glacial lakes overflowing. They also lead to shifting rainfall patterns which bring heavy sediments downstream, said Sudan Bikash Maharjan, one of the authors of the 2021 report. Maharjan said local and federal governments need to be better prepared and give people time to evacuate. Until then, many work hard to rebuild their old lives. People reconstruct homes among the debris or build new ones entirely. They walk and live among pieces of homes and furniture. Layers of mud cover up the lives they once lived. ___ Follow Niranjan Shrestha on Instagram. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Sri Lankans vote in a presidential election that will decide how it recovers from economic crisis	COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) — Sri Lankans began voting Saturday in a presidential election that will determine the course of the country's recovery from its worst economic crisis and resulting political upheaval. The election, contested by 38 candidates, is largely a three-way race among incumbent liberal President Ranil Wickremesinghe, Marxist-leaning lawmaker Anura Kumara Dissanayake, and opposition leader Sajith Premadasa. There are 17 million eligible voters, and final results are expected Sunday. The results will show whether Sri Lankans approve of Wickremesinghe's leadership over the country's fragile recovery, including restructuring its debt under an International Monetary Fund program after it defaulted in 2022. The government announced Thursday that it passed the final hurdle in debt restructuring by reaching an agreement in principle with private bond holders. Sri Lanka’s local and foreign debt totaled $83 billion at the time it defaulted, and the government says it has now restructured more than $17 billion. Despite a significant improvement in key economic figures, Sri Lankans are struggling under high taxes and living costs. Both Premadasa and Dissanayake say they will renegotiate the IMF deal to make austerity measures more bearable. Wickremesinghe has warned that any move to alter the basics of the agreement could delay the release of a fourth tranche of nearly $3 billion in assistance pledged by the IMF that's crucial to maintaining stability. Sri Lanka’s economic crisis resulted largely from excessive borrowing on projects that did not generate revenue. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the government’s insistence on using scarce foreign reserves to prop up the currency, the rupee, contributed to the economy’s free fall. The economic collapse brought a severe shortage of essentials such as medicine, food, cooking gas and fuel, with people spending days waiting in line to obtain them. It led to rioting in which protesters took over key buildings including the president’s house, his office and the prime minister’s office, forcing then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to flee the country and resign. Wickremesinghe was elected by a parliamentary vote in July 2022 to cover the remainder of Rajapaksa’s five-year term. Now, Wickremesinghe is seeking another term to strengthen the gains. However, many people accuse him of protecting members of the Rajapaksa family, whom they blame for the economic crisis. Wickremesinghe, who was the only member of his party in Parliament, was elected mainly with the votes of Rajapaksa loyalists. They also supported him as members of his Cabinet and in voting for the reforms he proposed.	https://apnews.com/article/sri-lanka-presidential-election-economic-crisis-imf-600aca821db3f86e3eb37adbb89f74bc	2024-09-20T16:33:18-07:00	
Hezbollah commander killed in Israeli airstrike was top military official on US wanted list	BEIRUT (AP) — The Hezbollah commander killed in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut’s southern suburbs Friday was one of the Lebanese militant group’s top military officials, in charge of its elite forces, and had been on Washington’s wanted list for years. Ibrahim Akil, 61, was the second top commander of Hezbollah to be killed in an Israeli airstrike in the southern suburb of Beirut in as many months, dealing a severe blow to the group’s command structure. The strike Friday came as the group was still reeling from a widely suspected Israeli attack targeting Hezbollah communications earlier this week when thousands of pagers exploded simultaneously. The attack killed 12 people, mostly Hezbollah members, and injured thousands. Akil was a member of Hezbollah’s highest military body, the Jihad Council since 2008, and head of the elite Radwan Forces. The forces also fought in Syria gaining experience in urban warfare and counterinsurgency. Israel has been attempting to push the fighters back from the border. Israel said the Friday strike on Beirut’s southern Dahiya district killed Akil and 10 other Hezbollah operatives. Little is known about Akil, who rose through the ranks of the group’s military command over decades. Born in Baalbek in the east of Lebanon, he joined Hezbollah in its early days in the 1980s. Elijah Magnier, a Brussels-based military and counterterrorism analyst with knowledge of the group, said he was one of the group's old guard. 'He started at the beginning of Hezbollah's creation, and he moved to different responsibilities. To be a member of the Jihadi Council, this is the highest (post), and to be the leader of the Radwan Forces is also very privileged,' Magnier said. Akil was under U.S. sanctions and in 2023, the U.S. State Department announced a reward of up to $7 million for information leading to his 'identification, location, arrest, and/or conviction.' The State Department described him as a 'key leader' in Hezbollah. It said that Akil was part of the group that carried out the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut and that he had directed the taking of American and German hostages in Lebanon and held them there during the 1980s. The U.S. Treasury Department designated him a 'terrorist' in 2015, followed by another designation by the State Department as a 'global terrorist.' Before his death, he had risen to become one of three top commanders of the Hezbollah forces, along with Fouad Shukr, who was the top military commander in the group and was also killed in an Israeli strike in the southern suburb of Beirut in July. Ali Karaki leads the southern front. The Radwan Forces, estimated at between 7,000 to 10,000 strong, with fighters trained in special operations and urban warfare, have had little involvement in the current conflict between Hezbollah and Israel. The fighting has been dominated so far by exchanges of missiles and strikes along border areas. Hezbollah rocket and missile launches have marked the group's efforts to support Hamas. 'The Israelis were right and wrong. They are right by saying they killed the one who was planning to conduct an operation similar to Oct. 7,' said Magnier, the analyst. In case of an Israeli ground invasion of Lebanon or a Hezbollah cross-border operation, Akil would have been the one leading the Radwan Forces. But he didn't head the entire military operation against Israel, Magnier said. Mohannad Hage Ali, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center think tank who researches Hezbollah, said Akil is an 'old school' military commander who was close to the Iranians. He received three year years of officer training in Iran and took part in all the wars in Lebanon, as well as in Syria. Hanin Ghaddar, a Hezbollah researcher with the Washington Institute, said when Mustafa Badreddine, the Hezbollah commander who was supervising the group’s role in the war in Syria, was killed in 2016, Akil replaced him in that role. At the time, a three-tier command structure of Hezbollah military forces was created, with Akil as one of its main pillars. Ghaddar said there were reports that Akil was among those who were lightly injured in the mass explosion of pagers. There was no official confirmation of those reports. At least 37 people were killed and about 3,000 injured in two waves of simultaneous explosions of communications devices across Lebanon on Tuesday and Wednesday. The pager attacks dealt a major blow to Hezbollah’s communication structure, which may explain why the group’s top forces were meeting Friday in the southern suburb of Beirut face to face, Ghaddar said. 'It is a big blow to Hezbollah,' she said. Ghaddar said the attack on Akil disrupted the group's command structure on the heels of the attacks that undermined its communication system and reveals how much intelligence Israel has about the militant group. She said the group will likely take time to respond and recover. 'They will recover obviously. They recovered from 2006 and many things,' she said, referring to a bruising the monthlong war between Hezbollah and Israel. 'But it is going to take time.' Magnier and Hage Ali said the Friday strike signals a new phase of the war with Israel. 'What is significant is the location and the beginning of a new (phase of the) war,' involving an aerial campaign and the targeted assassination of military leaders, Magnier said. Israel seemed set on exerting pressure on Hezbollah's leadership, Magnier said, particularly in the southern suburb of Beirut, where the group has many of its offices and supporters, seeking to target commanders and drive civilians out of the area. Israel is saying: 'If our people (in the north) can’t return, your people (in the suburb) will be displaced.'	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-hezbollah-israel-mideast-tensions-attack-8ec89de2b117b52e2c09b19155e35d13	2024-09-20T14:59:49-07:00	
Mexican cartel leader's son convicted of violent role in drug trafficking plot	WASHINGTON (AP) — The son of a Mexican drug cartel leader was convicted Friday of charges that he used violence, including the deadly downing of a military helicopter, to help his father operate one of the country's largest and most dangerous narcotics trafficking organizations. Rubén Oseguera, known as 'El Menchito,' is the son of fugitive Jalisco New Generation cartel boss Nemesio Oseguera and served as the 'CJNG' cartel's second-in-command before his extradition to the U.S. in February 2020. A federal jury in Washington, D.C., deliberated for several hours over two days before finding the younger Oseguera guilty of both counts in his indictment: conspiring to distribute cocaine and methamphetamine for U.S. importation and using a firearm in a drug conspiracy. 'El Menchito now joins the growing list of high-ranking Cartel leaders that the Justice Department has convicted in an American courtroom,' Attorney General Merrick Garland said in an emailed statement. 'We are grateful to our Mexican law enforcement partners for their extensive cooperation and sacrifice in holding accountable leaders of the Jalisco Cartel.' The younger Oseguera, who was born in California and holds dual U.S.-Mexican citizenship, is scheduled to be sentenced Jan. 10 by U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell. He faces a maximum sentence of life in prison and a mandatory minimum of 40 years in prison. Oseguera didn't have an obvious reaction to the jury's verdict. One of his lawyers patted him on his shoulder before he was led out of the courtroom. The U.S. government has offered a reward of up $10 million for information leading to the arrest of the elder Oseguera, whose alias, 'El Mencho,' is a play on his first name. Prosecutors showed jurors a rifle bearing Oseguera’s nicknames, 'Menchito' and 'JR,' along with the cartel’s acronym. The gun was in his possession when he was arrested. 'JR' also was etched on a belt found at the site where a Mexican military helicopter crashed after cartel members shot the aircraft down with a rocket-propelled grenade in 2015. Prosecutors said the younger Oseguera, now 34, ordered subordinates to shoot down the helicopter in Jalisco, Mexico, so that he and his father could avoid capture. At least nine people on board the helicopter were killed in the attack, according to prosecutors. Oseguera ordered the killings of at least 100 people and frequently bragged about murders and kidnappings, according to prosecutors. They said he personally shot and killed at least two people, including a rival drug trafficker and a disobedient subordinate. During the trial’s closing arguments Thursday, Justice Department prosecutor Kaitlin Sahni described Oseguera as 'a prince, an heir to an empire.' 'But this wasn’t a fairytale,' she said. 'This was the story of the defendant’s drugs, guns and murder, told to you by the people who saw it firsthand.' Jurors heard testimony from six cooperating witnesses who tied Oseguera to drug trafficking. Defense attorney Anthony Colombo tried to attack the witnesses’ credibility and motives, calling them 'sociopaths' who told self-serving lies about his client. 'They’re all pathological liars,' he said. Jurors also saw coded BlackBerry messages that Oseguera exchanged with other cartel leaders and underlings. One exchange showed that Oseguera was offended when his uncle mocked his cocaine’s purity, Sahni said. 'The defendant was proud of the cocaine he was distributing,' she added. Columbo argued that prosecutors didn’t present sufficient evidence that the CJNG cartel trafficked drugs in the U.S. 'Ten years and not one seizure,' he said. 'There’s no proof that it was coming to the U.S.' But prosecutors said Oseguera used increasingly extreme acts of violence to maintain his family’s power over a global drug trafficking operation, including in the U.S. 'The defendant decided who he worked with and who worked for him,' another prosecutor, Kate Naseef, told jurors.	https://apnews.com/article/ruben-oseguera-cartel-menchito-jalisco-new-generation-5130657a0a8859497dc3bccfb73d16ef	2024-09-20T11:40:29-07:00	
What to know about the growing conflict between Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah	CAIRO (AP) — This week saw a dizzying escalation in the 11-month-old conflict between Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah. First came two days of exploding pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah — deadly attacks pinned on Israel that also maimed civilians around Lebanon. Hezbollah's leader vowed to retaliate, and on Friday the militant group launched dozens of rockets into northern Israel. Later in the day, Israel said it killed the commander of Hezbollah’s most elite unit with a strike in Beirut that left at least 14 dead. Many fear the events are the prelude to an all-out war between Israel and Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Shiite group that is Lebanon’s most powerful armed force. A war threatens to bring devastation in Lebanon, heavy missile fire into Israeli cities and further destabilization to a region already shaken by the Gaza war. During 11 months of exchanges of fire over the Lebanese-Israeli border, both sides have repeatedly pulled back when the spiral of reprisals appeared on the verge of going out of control, under heavy pressure from the U.S. and its allies. But in recent weeks, Israeli leaders have warned of a possible bigger military operation with the goal of stopping attacks from Lebanon to allow tens of thousands of Israelis displaced by the fighting to return to homes near the border. Here are some things to know about the situation: What were the latest strikes? An Israeli airstrike Friday brought down a high-rise building in Beirut’s southern suburbs, a Shiite-majority area known as Dahiyeh where Hezbollah has a strong presence. At least 12 people were killed and more than 60 wounded, the deadliest Israeli strike in the Lebanese capital since the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war. The Israeli military said the strike killed Ibrahim Akil, the commander of Hezbollah’s elite Radwan unit, as well as other top leaders of the unit. There was no immediate confirmation from Hezbollah. But if confirmed, it would be a heavy blow to Hezbollah’s most effective fighters. Israel said Akil led the group’s campaign of rocket, drone and other fire into northern Israel. The strike came after the shock of the electronic device bombings, in which hundreds of pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah detonated on Tuesday and Wednesday. At least 37 people were killed, including two children, and some 3,000 wounded. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied its involvement. The casualties included some fighters from the group, but many of the wounded were civilians connected to Hezbollah’s social branches. Analysts say the attack has little effect on Hezbollah’s manpower, but could disrupt its communications and force it to take tighter security measures. What is the situation on the border? Hezbollah fired 140 rockets into northern Israel on Friday, saying it was targeting military sites in retaliation for overnight Israeli strikes into southern Lebanon. There was no immediate report of casualties. It was a continuation of the near daily drumbeat of exchanges over the border since the Gaza war began in October. The exchanges have killed some 600 people in Lebanon – mostly fighters but including around 100 civilians — and some 50 soldiers and civilians in Israel. It has also forced tens of thousands of people to evacuate homes near the border in both Israel and Lebanon. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has promised retaliation for the electronic device bombings, raising fears of an escalation from the group. But Hezbollah has also proved wary of further stoking the crisis – it has not carried out its vows of revenge from Israel’s killing of a top commander, Fouad Shukur, in July. Hezbollah says its attacks against Israeli are in support of Hamas. This week, Nasrallah said the barrages won’t end – and Israelis won’t be able to return to homes in the north – until Israel’s campaign in Gaza ends. As fighting in Gaza has slowed, Israel has fortified forces along the border with Lebanon, including the arrival this week of a powerful army division that took part in some of the heaviest fighting in Gaza. It is believed to include thousands of troops, including paratrooper infantry units and artillery and elite commando forces specially trained for operations behind enemy lines. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant this week declared the start of a 'new phase' of the war as Israel turns its focus toward Hezbollah. 'The center of gravity is shifting to the north by diverting resources and forces,' he said. What is Israel planning? Israeli officials say they have not yet made an official decision to expand military operations against Hezbollah – and have not said publicly what those operations might be. This week, the head of Israel’s Northern Command was quoted in local media as advocating for a ground invasion of Lebanon. A U.N.-brokered truce to their 2006 war called on Hezbollah to pull back 29 kilometers (18 miles) from the border, but it has refused to, accusing Israel of also failing to carry out some provisions. Israel is now demanding Hezbollah withdraw eight to 10 kilometers (five to six miles) from the border – the range of Hezbollah’s anti-tank guided missiles. Israel and Hezbollah’s 2006 war was a devastating monthlong fight triggered when Hezbollah fighters kidnapped two Israeli soldiers in a cross-border raid. In that war, Israel heavily bombarded southern Lebanon and Beirut and sent a ground invasion into the south. The strategy, later explained by Israeli commanders, was to inflict the maximum damage possible in towns and neighborhoods where Hezbollah operated to deter them from launching attacks. It became known as the 'Dahiyeh Doctrine,' named after Beirut suburbs where large areas were levelled during the war. But Israel could have a more ambitious and controversial goal this time: to seize a buffer zone in south Lebanon to push back Hezbollah fighters from the border. A fight to hold territory threatens a longer, even more destructive and destabilizing war – recalling Israel’s 1982-2000 occupation of southern Lebanon. What would be the impact of a full-blown war? The fear is that it could turn out even worse than the 2006 war, which was traumatic enough for both sides to serve as a deterrent ever since. The 2006 fighting killed hundreds of Hezbollah fighters and an estimated 1,100 Lebanese civilians and left large swaths of the south and even parts of Beirut in ruins. More than 120 Israeli soldiers were killed and hundreds wounded. Hezbollah missile fire on Israeli cities brought the war to the public, killing dozens of civilians. Now, Israel estimates that Hezbollah possesses some 150,000 rockets and missiles, some of which are precision-guided, putting the entire country within range of Hezbollah fire. Israel has beefed up air defenses, but it is unclear whether it can defend against the intense barrages expected in a new war. Israel has vowed it could turn all of southern Lebanon into a battle zone, saying Hezbollah has embedded rockets, weapons and forces along the border. And in the heightened rhetoric of the past months, Israeli politicians have spoken of inflicting the same damage in Lebanon that the military has wreaked in Gaza.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-war-pagers-920ced5349562163eeb96d6a5a768e89	2024-09-20T10:59:58-07:00	
Guinea's most wanted fugitive extradited from Liberia	CONAKRY, Guinea (AP) — Guinea's most wanted fugitive, a former senior military officer convicted of crimes against humanity over a 2009 stadium massacre, has been extradited from neighboring Liberia, officials said Thursday. Former Col. Claude Pivi had been on the run following a high-profile prison escape in November, before he was arrested in Liberia on Tuesday, Yaya Kairaba Kaba, Guinea's minister of justice, told reporters. Pivi was a henchmen of former dictator Moussa Dadis Camara, who ruled the West African country from 2008 to 2010. He had been sentenced in absentia to life imprisonment for crimes against humanity over his involvement in the stadium massacre. At least 157 people were killed and dozens of women raped in that massacre in 2009. The then-military leader had staged a coup the previous year and on Sept. 28, 2009, demonstrators at the stadium were protesting Camara’s plans to run for president when soldiers opened fire on them. The junta at the time said 'uncontrolled' elements of the army had carried out the rapes and killings. But Camara’s top aides were at the stadium and did nothing to stop the massacre, a Human Rights Watch report said. Many of the victims in the stadium were shot, crushed or knifed to death while some of the women were dragged out from hiding and gang-raped by uniformed men over several days, witnesses have said.	https://apnews.com/article/guinea-fugitive-extradited-liberia-ffe1590e7acc0d358fde4e6d4dcfddbe	2024-09-20T10:27:42-07:00

Did Middle East device attack violate international law? Advocates want an investigation	GENEVA (AP) — Human rights advocates are calling for an independent investigation into the deadly explosions of pagers and walkie-talkies in Lebanon and Syria, suggesting the blasts may have violated international law if the devices were fashioned as booby traps. The explosions that have been widely blamed on Israel killed at least 37 people and wounded more than 3,000, including many members of the Iranian-backed militant group Hezbollah. Israel has not confirmed or denied involvement. The United Nations human rights office and some advocacy groups have cried foul, arguing that the strikes were 'indiscriminate' because it's nearly impossible to know who was holding the devices, or where they were, when they went off. But some academics insist the explosions were precisely focused because the devices had been distributed to Hezbollah members. The International Committee of the Red Cross, which aims to help protect civilians and other noncombatants in conflict and aims to stay neutral, said: 'This was a unique operation, and it will take time to have all the facts to establish a legal opinion.' The committee declined to comment publicly about whether the operation violated international humanitarian law, which is difficult to enforce and sometimes flouted by countries. International law has never addressed the targeting of communication devices that people carry on their bodies. The Geneva Conventions, which provide a rule book for the protection of civilians during conflict, were adopted 75 years ago, long before pagers, mobile phones and walkie-talkies were in widespread public use. The legal situation is further complicated by the fact that Hezbollah is an armed nonstate group acting inside Lebanon, a sovereign member of the U.N. 'There must be an independent, thorough and transparent investigation as to the circumstances of these mass explosions, and those who ordered and carried out such an attack must be held to account,' the U.N. human rights chief, Volker Türk, said in a statement. Did devices amount to booby traps? The question of how to apply international rules to the attack seems to center mostly on whether a secret explosive embedded in a personal electronic device might be considered a booby trap. Israel has been blamed for targeted strikes and assassinations in the past, but a large strike using mobile communication devices is virtually unheard of. A booby trap is defined as 'any device designed or adapted to kill or injure, and which functions unexpectedly when a person disturbs or approaches an apparently harmless object,' according to Article 7 of a 1996 adaptation of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, which Israel has adopted. The protocol prohibits booby traps 'or other devices in the form of apparently harmless portable objects which are specifically designed and constructed to contain explosive material.' Lama Fakih, Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch, said the rules were designed to protect civilians and avoid 'the devastating scenes that continue to unfold across Lebanon today.' She too called for an impartial investigation. The convention also sets rules for the use of land mines, remnants of cluster bombs and other explosives. It bars use of other 'manually emplaced munitions,' such as improvised explosive devices that 'are designed to kill or injure, and which are actuated manually, by remote control or automatically after a lapse of time.' The pagers were used by members of Hezbollah, but there was no guarantee that the members would be holding the devices when they went off. Many of the casualties were among members of Hezbollah's extensive civilian operations mainly serving Lebanon’s Shiite community. Laurie Blank, a professor at Emory Law School in Atlanta who specializes in international humanitarian law and the law of armed conflict, said the law of war doesn’t prohibit use of booby traps outright, but places limits on them. She said she believed the attack was 'most likely lawful under international law.' She said booby traps can be used to target enemy forces in or near a military objective, including the communication systems used by Hezbollah fighters. 'That said, it’s not clear that this is a booby-trap scenario. For example, if the attack is attacking the pagers themselves, then it’s not an issue of booby-trapping,' Blank wrote in an email. Did ‘indiscriminate' nature of attack make it illegal? Experts said the pager explosions suggested a long-planned and carefully crafted operation, possibly carried out by infiltrating the supply chain and rigging the devices with explosives before they were delivered to Lebanon. 'There is no world in which the explosion of hundreds, if not thousands, of pagers is not an indiscriminate attack prohibited by international law,' Mai El-Sadany, who heads the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy, a Washington-based think tank, wrote on X. 'The pager holders were scattered across civilian areas, from shopping malls to crowded streets and apartment buildings to hospitals, surrounded by women, children and men,' she told The Associated Press. 'An attack like this cannot anticipate what innocent passerby is in the impact area or what carefree child picks up the pager when it beeps.' British lawyer Geoffrey Nice, who prosecuted former Yugoslav and Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, said in an interview: 'It’s pretty obvious here it’s a war crime. And we should call it out for what it is.' But he noted criminal conduct on both sides of the Israel-Hamas conflict, alluding to rocket strikes by Hamas militants on Israel and casualties caused by Israel's military operation in Gaza, where the Health Ministry says at least 41,000 people have been killed since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on southern Israel that triggered the latest war. Rules require countries to ‘minimize’ harm Amos Guiora, a professor at the S.J. Quinney College of Law at the University of Utah, said the strikes were 'justified in the context of self-defense,' but he acknowledged the risks of collateral damage against civilians. 'International law does not articulate a number as to what is legitimate or illegitimate collateral damage, it’s just to ‘minimize.’ The tragic reality of collateral damage is that innocent people will be harmed and killed,' he said. 'I do have a sense on this one that there was a conscious effort to minimize it — with the understanding it will be never perfect.' 'This particular attack strikes me — whoever did it — is as pinpointed as pinpointed can be,' said Guiora, who spent 20 years in the Israeli military and advised its commanders in Gaza in the 1990s. Israel has already faced heavy international criticism over its military response in Gaza and, more recently, in the West Bank since the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas. Back in May, the top prosecutor at the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for top Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as well as Hamas leaders behind the attacks, over their actions in the war. Israel ignored an order from the U.N.’s top court to halt its military offensive in southern Gaza after South Africa accused Israel of genocide. Russia, too, has ignored the court’s call for it to end its invasion of Ukraine. Hamas has also been investigated. Human Rights Watch released a report in July that concluded Hamas-led armed groups committed numerous war crimes during the attacks in Israel. Hezbollah has been linked to numerous indiscriminate attacks on civilians over the years, including in Argentina, Bulgaria and, of course, Israel. ___ Chehayeb reported from Beirut.

Biden opens busy foreign policy stretch as anxious allies shift gaze to Trump, Harris	WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden is opening a busy stretch Friday tending to international allies anxious about where U.S. foreign policy is headed when he leaves office in four months, most likely leaving behind a difficult set of crises for former President Donald Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris to contend with. But even as Biden launches into a week of talks with world leaders that will take place in Delaware, the White House and at the United Nations, global attention has begun drifting toward Trump and Harris, who are offering voters — and the world— sharply diverging views on foreign policy. 'The more I talk to people around the world, the more I get a sense of profound anxiety about the shape of the U.S. election,' said Jon Alterman, a senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. Alterman added that Biden’s upcoming engagements with world leaders could seem like 'a sideshow' as much of the world focuses on Harris and Trump. Biden kicks off his spurt of diplomacy on Friday when he hosts Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese for talks at his home near Wilmington, Delaware. After Albanese, the president will hold one-on-one talks at his house on Saturday with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. They're all visiting the president's hometown for a meeting of the Indo-Pacific group known as the Quad. The four leaders will get together for a joint meeting on Saturday, and Biden will hold a dinner for them at the high school he attend more than 60 years ago. Biden will then welcome United Arab Emirates' President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan to the White House on Monday for talks before setting off for three days at the U.N. General Assembly, where the wars in Gaza and Ukraine are expected to dominate the agenda and be at the heart of Biden's Tuesday address to the assembly. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will come to Washington on Thursday for talks with Biden. And more leader meetings on the sidelines of the U.N. are expected to be added to the president's schedule. All the while, world leaders are beginning to seek audiences with Harris and Trump as they try to get a better understanding of what comes next. Trump said this week that he plans to meet with Modi during the Indian leader's U.S. visit for the U.N. gathering and Quad summit. The former president, speaking at a campaign rally, called Modi 'fantastic' even as he grumbled that India had become a 'very big abuser' in its trade relationship with the United States. Trump said he will also 'probably' meet with Zelenskyy next week. The two last spoke by phone in July and last met in person on the sidelines of the 2019 U.N. General Assembly. That face-to-face meeting happened about two months after a phone call in which Trump called on Zelenskyy to investigate Biden’s actions in Ukraine when he was vice president during the Obama administration. It was the call that led to Trump's first impeachment. The Ukrainians have informed the White House that they are arranging a meeting with Trump, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to comment publicly. The White House did not respond to a request for comment on whether it was informed by the Indian government or Trump about the planned Modi visit with the GOP nominee. Zelenskyy will also meet with Harris on Thursday, separately from Biden's sitdown, the White House said. Harris last met Zelenskyy on the sidelines of an international gathering in Switzerland in July, days before Biden abandoned his reelection bid and endorsed her candidacy. The White House said that Harris would also hold her own meeting on Monday with UAE president. Biden in his final months in office is trying to manage a set of foreign policy crises that could still worsen and complicate his legacy. White House-led efforts to win a cease-fire and hostage deal in the nearly year-old Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza have stalled. The conflict is now in danger of spiraling into a full-blown regional war as tensions rise on the Israel-Lebanon border. Those tensions heightened after Israel on Friday carried out targeted air strikes near Beirut. The action followed two waves of deadly attacks earlier this week in which hundreds of hand-held pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah militants exploded. The sophisticated sabotage operations are widely believed to have been carried out by Israel. The operations killed dozens and wounded hundreds. The air strikes and audacious electronic device attacks are raising questions about whether Biden's influence with Israel is waning, a notion that the White House disputes. A day before Tuesday's first wave of attacks, senior White House official Amos Hochstein visited Israel and warned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli officials against taking action that could intensify the conflict. Asked if getting a hostage deal may be slipping out of reach in the final months of his presidency, Biden told reporters Friday he still had hope and that his national security team continues to work to get a deal completed. 'If I ever said it wasn’t realistic, we might as well leave,' Biden said. 'A lot of things don’t look realistic until we get them done. We have to keep at it.' Meanwhile, Ukraine is pressing Biden to allow the use of Western provided long-range weapons to strike deeper into Russia. It's a move that President Vladimir Putin has warned would mean that the U.S. and European countries are at war with Russia. Harris, if elected, is expected to take a similar approach to foreign policy as Biden. Since jumping into the presidential race, Harris has pitched herself as a critical member of Biden's foreign policy team, deeply engaged with the administration's response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Hamas' invasion of Israel and helping the president bolster ties in the Pacific. At the same time, Harris has called out Trump for being too cozy with authoritarian leaders during his four years in the White House. During this month's presidential debate, Harris told Trump that Putin 'would eat you for lunch' and noted Trump had exchanged 'love letters' with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and generally 'admires dictators.' 'It is absolutely well known that these dictators and autocrats are rooting for you to be president again, because they’re so clear they can manipulate you with flattery and favors,' Harris previously told Trump. For his part, Trump has claimed that Harris is not capable as a negotiator, 'hates Israel,' and shares responsibility for the Biden administration's 'embarrassing' troop withdrawal from Afghanistan. Biden's plans for the weekend's summit show he is trying to bring a personal touch to the gathering, welcoming leaders for talks at his private residence and hosting Saturday night's dinner at his high school alma mater, Archmere Academy, in Claymont, Delaware. The White House said the leaders would also roll out an announcement related to Biden's Cancer Moonshot Initiative, a long-running passion project of the president and his wife aimed at reducing cancer deaths. The Bidens' son Beau died in 2015 at the age 46 of brain cancer. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that the summit was designed to have a more intimate feel. 'He wanted to have a private moment with them, to continue to grow those relationships,' Jean-Pierre said. 'That’s what this is about.'	https://apnews.com/article/biden-quad-summit-modi-albanese-kishida-delaware-trump-kamala-harris-441f74e9f0442e08f1ca40689980a892	2024-09-20T09:16:35-07:00	
Gucci casts for 'casual grandeur,' Tod's focuses on Artisanal Intelligence and Versace plays it safe	MILAN (AP) — The fashion palate cleanser of the season: white. Milan fashion houses, more often than not this season, are opening their runway preview shows for next spring and summer with all-white looks. Tod’s put the emphasis on white with tables of artisans constructing white driving shoes inside the showroom, and followed by opening the show with a crisp white look, as did a host of other fashion houses this week, including Moschino, Alberta Ferretti, Del Core and Cavalli. The fashion crowd arriving at the highly anticipated Gucci show passed through a white tunnel that burst into the colors of a sunset along the length of the runway. Highlights from mostly womenswear previews for next spring and summer on the fourth day of Milan Fashion Week on Friday: Gucci offers ‘Casual Grandeur’ Sabato De Sarno starts a new fashion cycle a year after debuting his first Gucci collection, focusing on some of his self-described obsessions: tailoring, lingerie, leather and a 1960s silhouette. In its simplest form, a white tank with Gucci-stripe piping was paired with dark trousers with a hemline slit over sneakers, referencing menswear. In its most elaborate, Gucci-monogram overcoats dragged imperially on the runway, and lingerie peeked out of glossy, textured leather. A blouse slinked insouciantly off the shoulder. Sequined dresses rustled. Crepe dresses were anchored with bamboo-shaped hardware. Mini-skirts bubbled slightly. Floral headscarves or big sunhats finished the looks. De Sarno dubbed the collection 'casual grandeur.' 'Moment after moment, I have built my ideas for Gucci,'' he said in notes. 'A casual grandeur that takes shape through my obsessions ... and always with an irreverent attitude.' Gucci's front-row glistened with Jessica Chastain, Kirsten Dunst, Nicola Coughlan — who stopped to take a selfie with fans — and Italy's own tennis hero, Jannick Sinner, a Gucci ambassador. A crowd of K-pop fans chanted in anticipation of the arrival of Jin from BTS, another brand ambassador. Versace plays it safe The opening movement of Beethoven’s Fifth signaled the start of the Versace runway show inside a courtyard of the medieval Sforza Castle. But as soon as the models hit the runway, the tempo shifted to contemporary house music as a drone recorded the scene from overhead. The Spring-Summer 2025 collection was conservative by Donatella Versace standards, looks for good girls mixing and matching satiny pencil skirts, polos and demure cardigans, easily tied together by a car coat. The silhouette and the mod hairstyles suggested an inspiraiton at the cusp of the 1960s and 1970s. The most daring ensembles comprised short-shorts with tights and platform heels, or a chiffony dress left open from the belly button to reveal a pair of wavy-patterned panties. Gigi Hadid modeled an off-shoulder floral midi dress, that was pretty without being in any way provocative. A metallic-finish dress with a plunging cowl projected the most sensuality. The menswear was very much a companion to the women’s looks: the same wavy knits in a trio of colors, and satiny floral prints as shirts or pajama suiting. That is, many pieces to mix and match, light on the attitude. Tod’s celebrates Artisanal Intelligence In a world abuzz over artificial intelligence, Tod’s highlighted artisanal intelligence. Dozens of craftspeople flanked the showroom, hand-stitching the brand’s trademark Gommino driving shoe. Models emerged from beneath a pair of sculptor Lorenzo Quinn’s oversized white hands, grasping a spiral of leather. 'Artisanal intelligence goes against what everyone is talking about,’’ creative director Matteo Tamburini said before the show. 'The focus is on a very elevated product, which is the cornerstone of Made in Italy.' The Spring-Summer 2025 collection started with crisp cotton pairings: trousers or skirts with oversized shirts. The looks were reproduced in a soft leather, intentionally fluid for the warmer months, while a leather overcoat was more sturdily vintage. Asymmetrical cuts and wraps gave the collection a touch of casual elegance. Looks were finished with barely there criss-cross sandals, the new Gommino in glove leather or a clog version. Tamburini said the only thing he uses AI for is to craft talking points for journalists. 'I am not a writer,’’ he said, laughing. SUNNEI GROWS UP? The Sunnei fashion brand marked its 10th anniversary questioning the very notion of 'growing up,' and casting aspersions on the idea of 'maturing.' With a dose of irony and fob for diversity, brand founders Simone Rizzo and Loris Messina, both in their mid-30s, cast only older models, mostly graying, and most probably falling into a demographic of over 65s that the show notes say make up a quarter of Milan’s population. The pace of the show, spanning two floors, was kept slow, which the notes suggested was due to the stairs, but could also have been in consideration of the colorful platform flip-flops the brand has created in collaboration with Camper. In any case, the collection retained the brand’s winning, youthful jubilance, depicted in oversized garb like billowing bubble tops gathered at the waist, a striped T-shirt so big it became a tunic, and a blouse that tented over an A-line pleated leather skirt. The trouser of the season for men and women gathered at the ankle with fanning pleats. A more simply tailored pant has a built-in apron, over which to layer a utility belt full of zippered pockets. The designers candidly acknowledged an Artificial Intelligence fail, falling back on the human design team for the collection's prints of six faces that appeared on dresses and tops, and which were available for purchase immediately after the show on Sunnei’s website. Backstage, brand founders Rizzo and Messina celebrated their team with hugs, tears and shouts of, 'Bravissimi!'	https://apnews.com/article/milan-fashion-week-tods-gucci-versace-sunnei-8f7b0508f1f815ee4b3dcfaed1e5a463	2024-09-20T08:15:16-07:00	
Explorers or passengers? Things to know about testimony on the Titan sub disaster	Last year, five people hoping to view the Titanic wreckage died when their submersible imploded in the Atlantic Ocean. A Coast Guard panel that’s investigating the Titan submersible disaster is in its second week of testimony. Previous witnesses provided testimony that raised serious questions about whether warning signs were ignored. Here's what witnesses have been saying so far: NASA, Boeing describe limited roles in creation of submersible Titan NASA and Boeing officials on Thursday described what they called their limited roles in the creation of the doomed submersible Titan even though the co-founder of OceanGate previously touted ties to NASA and aerospace manufacturers. Justin Jackson, a materials engineer, said NASA was unable to fulfill a role in building and testing the carbon fiber hull because of the COVID-19 pandemic. He said NASA officials were uncomfortable with being linked to the experimental submersible, saying 'our folks had some heartburn' when OceanGate suggested NASA's endorsement. Boeing was involved in an early feasibility study of the use of carbon fiber for Titan’s hull and in OceanGate’s acoustic sensors on the hull before the relationship ended. Mark Negley, material and process engineer at Boeing, said OceanGate ultimately departed from some of its recommendations on the pressure hull. Key employee says there was ‘urgency’ to complete dives but not if it meant putting lives at risk A key employee with the company that owned the experimental submersible that imploded pushed back at a question from a Coast Guard investigator focusing on whether OceanGate felt a sense of 'desperation' to complete the dives because of the high price tag. Amber Bay, director of administration for OceanGate, insisted Tuesday that the company would not 'conduct dives that would be risky just to meet a need.' That said, told the Coast Guard panel, 'There definitely was an urgency to deliver on what we had offered and a dedication and perseverance towards that goal.' She also referred to clients as 'mission specialists' and 'explorers,' not passengers. She tearfully noted that she knew all of them. 'There’s not a day that passes that I don’t think of them, their families and the loss, she testified through tears. Company co-founder hopeful for a renewed interest in exploration The co-founder of the company that owned the experimental submersible that imploded en route to the wreckage of the Titanic told a Coast Guard panel Monday that he hopes the tragedy yields a renewed interest in exploration. 'This can’t be the end of deep ocean exploration,' said businessman Guillermo Sohnlein, who helped found OceanGate with Stockton Rush. He said the company was started with a laudable goal: 'We wanted to give humanity greater access to the ocean, specifically the deep ocean,' Sohnlein said. Expert says carbon fiber is susceptible to fatigue failure Roy Thomas of the American Bureau of Shipping testified about challenges associated with carbon fiber, which was the material used for the pressure hull of the doomed Titan submersible. He noted that carbon fiber is difficult to manufacture and salt water can damage and weaken the material in multiple ways. He said there's no recognized standard for a submersible carbon fiber pressure hull for human occupancy and that carbon fiber is 'susceptible to fatigue failure under repeated external pressurization.' The lead engineer says he wouldn't get in the Titan When testifying about a dive that took place several years before the fatal accident, lead engineer Tony Nissen said he felt pressured to get the Titan ready and he refused to pilot it. 'I’m not getting in it,' Nissen said he told Rush. Nissen said Rush was difficult to work for, made demands that often changed day-to-day, and was focused on costs and schedules. Nissen said he tried to keep his clashes with Rush hidden so others in the company wouldn't be aware of the friction. The Titan malfunctioned a few days before its fatal dive Scientific director Steven Ross said that on a dive just a few days before the Titan imploded, the vessel had a problem with its ballast, which keeps vessels stable. The issue caused passengers to 'tumble about' and crash into the bulkhead, he said. 'One passenger was hanging upside down. The other two managed to wedge themselves into the bow,' Ross testified. He said nobody was injured but it took an hour to get the vessel out of the water. He said he didn't know if a safety assessment or hull inspection was carried out after the incident. It wasn't the first time the Titan had problems A paid passenger on a 2021 mission to the Titanic said the journey was aborted when the vessel started experiencing mechanical problems. 'We realized that all it could do was spin around in circles, making right turns,' said Fred Hagen. 'At this juncture, we obviously weren’t going to be able to navigate to the Titanic.' He said the Titan resurfaced and the mission was scrapped. Hagen said he was aware of the risks involved in the dive. 'Anyone that wanted to go was either delusional if they didn’t think that it was dangerous, or they were embracing the risk,' he said. One employee said authorities ignored his concerns Operations director David Lochridge said the tragedy could possibly have been prevented if a federal agency had investigated the concerns he raised with them on multiple occasions. Lochridge said that eight months after he filed a complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, a caseworker told him the agency had not begun investigating and there were still 11 cases ahead of his. By that time, OceanGate was suing Lochridge and he had filed a countersuit. A couple of months later, Lochridge said, he decided to walk away from the complaint. He said the case was closed and both lawsuits were dropped. 'The whole idea behind the company was to make money,' Lochridge testified. 'There was very little in the way of science.' After Lochridge’s testimony this week, the federal agency responded that, at the time, it had 'promptly referred' his safety concerns to the Coast Guard. Some people had a rosier view Renata Rojas, a member of the Explorers Club which lost two paid passengers in the fatal dive, struck a different tone with her testimony. She said she felt OceanGate was transparent in the run-up to the dive and she never felt the operation was unsafe. A passenger on a previous dive, Rojas was volunteering with the surface crew when the Titan imploded. 'Some of those people are very hardworking individuals that were just trying to make dreams come true,' she said.	https://apnews.com/article/titan-titanic-oceangate-coast-guard-hearing-implosion-9210d8563a8c08cd84794a9b856018e4	2024-09-20T08:11:37-07:00	
AP Explains: Migration is more complex than politics show	For decades politicians in both parties have bemoaned a U.S. immigration system that virtually all call broken. Attempts at comprehensive reform have failed and popular emotion and partisan rancor have it a new high over the last two years as cities and towns struggled to accommodate migrants. With emotions high, Republican-led states have bussed new arrivals to Democratic-led cities. The presidential election now has shifted the spotlight to a city whose latest residents are legally in the country. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and running mate Ohio Sen. JD Vance have jumped on disproven rumors that Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio are eating household pets. The bottom line: Immigrants are coming and staying in this country through a mix of methods and programs that are not easily captured or acknowledged in political rhetoric, but fearmongering over immigration is nearly as old as the country itself. Many ways to come to the United States The roughly 15,000 Haitians residing in Springfield are in the U.S. legally. Most of them are under Temporary Protected Status, which allows them to stay and work. Trump and Vance have failed to make that distinction, which many critics see as part of Trump's long history of targeting Black people. Last weekend at a rally in Las Vegas, the Republican presidential nominee said the city has 'been taken over by illegal migrants.' Trump would not be able to legally deport Haitians who have protected status. His supporters such as Vivek Ramaswamy have falsely stated that the federal government transported Haitians to Springfield’s front doorstep. In reality, migrants with legal status or granted asylum have to foot the bill for their own transportation. The Haitian population there grew largely as migrants who went where they could find family, housing and work. The benefits of immigration Historically, immigrants or people with temporary protected status come to the U.S. to work and often take jobs that Americans reject, filling a need in the workforce as older generations retire and fewer babies are born. And many American cities' cultural, economic and religious identities were shaped by migrants. 'Most Americans are fundamentally immigrants, and so it’s always just kind of crazy when this gets called into question, and there’s some idea that immigration is not a strength,' said Republican Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt. One in five Oklahoma City residents are Latino, Holt said, and the restaurants and small businesses they operate have become an integral part of the city of about 700,000 people. In the 1970’s and 1980’s, thousands of Vietnamese immigrants flocked to the city and today their community a few miles west of the state capitol is known for its bustling markets and many restaurants. 'Their culture and their food are now very much a part of what makes Oklahoma City unique,' Holt said. After the evacuation of Afghanistan in 2021, Holt welcomed more than 2,000 Afghan refugees to the city. One of them, Feroz Bashari, swore Holt in for his second term as mayor. Bashari had been the spokesperson for the Afghan government before the U.S. withdrew. He fled with his family when the government was toppled. 'A friend of mine who came before me told me it’s a nice place for living, raising your children,' Bashari said. 'It’s a conservative place, they believe in God, they’re very religious. They have almost the same religious culture we have.' Immigrants can revitalize little populated neighborhoods and decaying streets by setting up businesses and paying taxes. Miami’s Little Havana, San Francisco’s Chinatown or Chicago’s Polish Triangle are fixtures touted to visitors. But migrants also change the fabric and the culture of a city, as well as the country, in ways that longer-term residents find hard. The complications of immigration A census survey conducted between July 2022 and July 2023 found that Ohio’s foreign-born population included 5,442 people from Haiti. In comparison, Florida and New York had populations of over 370,000 and 119,000 Haitian-born residents, respectively. Springfield officials have placed the figure today at between 15,000 and 20,000, and they say the size of the influx combined with the language barrier has created delays in receiving health care, accessing social services and using everyday government services, like getting a license. Traffic accidents involving death or injury also have increased in town, as have pressures on the housing stock. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine has deep ties to Haiti, having traveled there with his wife more than 20 times in support of a tuition-free school named after their late daughter. DeWine, who was born in Springfield and is a lifelong resident of the area, said Haitians who have landed in the city are hard workers, and have helped close labor shortages in factories and warehouses. But he said that a sudden influx of Haitians in a city of 58,000 has also stretched the city’s resources. Some of those frustrations spilled out at a Springfield City Commission meeting last week. A school-bus driver said he and other bus drivers are forced to take evasive maneuvers every day 'avoiding people who can’t drive.' A man spoke of a friend who was kicked out of his home by a landlord who then tripled the rent. Other residents complained about overcrowded schools and an increase in homelessness among longtime residents. 'I feel like there should be a no-vacancy sign right now,' one man said. DeWine, at a news conference this week, said that, 'Yes, we have challenges.' 'But we’re going to meet those challenges,' he said. 'We may not meet them overnight, but we’re going to work at those challenges and those problems.' Earlier this month, DeWine announced the city would get $2.5 million over the next two years for health-care demands. Long history of fears over immigration Trump has alleged that migrants have caused skyrocketing crime rates in cities like Springfield and Aurora, Colorado, although authorities in both cities have debunked that. Many studies show that crime is lower among immigrants compared to native-born residents. Nearly 200 years before Trump and Vance perpetuated unfounded fears that Haitians in Springfield, Ohio abduct and eat dogs and cats, Chinese laborers in California faced similar demonization. Many Chinese men emigrated from the West in the 1850s — first to dig for gold and then build the transcontinental railroad. Propaganda at the time fostered fears that the Chinese were a 'yellow peril' who smoked opium and ate strange foods. This sentiment led to Congress to pass the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. It was the first law restricting immigration based on ethnicity. In 1924, the U.S. established a comprehensive immigration law with a quota system based on nation of origin. It heavily favored immigrants from northern and western Europe. The intention was to limit immigrants from Asia as well as Jews and others fleeing Europe. A monumental change came in 1965 with the Hart-Celler Immigration Act, which abolished the quotas and was intended to help immigrants bring family members with them to the U.S., a practice known as chain migration that first benefited Europeans and now aids prople from Asia and Latin America. ____ This story has been updated to remove an incorrect reference to the Ramaswamy town hall being sponsored by the Trump campaign. ____ Graham Lee Brewer, of Oklahoma City, and Terry Tang, of Phoenix, are members of AP's Race and Ethnicity team.

Election 2024 Latest: Trump and Harris campaign for undecided voters with just 6 weeks left	Vice President Kamala Harris is set to give a speech on Friday focused squarely on abortion rights and she’ll do so in Georgia, where news reports have documented women’s deaths in the face of the state’s six-week ban. Meanwhile, lawmakers are scrambling to ensure that the U.S. Secret Service has enough money and resources to keep the nation’s presidential candidates safe amid repeated threats of violence. The efforts follow a July assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump at a Pennsylvania rally and after a second apparent attempt last weekend at his golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida. With early voting beginning Friday in three states, voters are split on whether Harris or Trump would better handle the economy, a new AP-NORC poll finds. Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: Obama to appear at LA fundraiser expected to raise $4M for Harris campaign A Beverly Hills fundraiser featuring Barack Obama is expected to bring in over $4 million for Kamala Harris' election effort. The Friday event is intended to be smaller than other blowout fundraisers for the Democratic ticket over the past year in the beating heart of America’s entertainment industry, which have featured entertainers such as Lenny Kravitz. The minimum donation for a ticket is $50,000, according to a Los Angeles-based consultant. It will be held at the home of James Costos, the former president’s ambassador to Spain, and his partner Michael Smith. It’s not the only fundraiser for Harris to be held in the Los Angeles area on Friday. Hillary Clinton was slated to appear at an event hosted by Sybil and Matthew Orr, said the consultant, who insisted on anonymity to provide private details for the events. Nearly eight years removed from office, the $4 million figure raised by Obama suggests he has still has lasting star power in Hollywood. Harris campaign says North Carolina ad is its first to link Trump with a down-ballot candidate Harris’ campaign is airing a new ad in battleground North Carolina, aiming to highlight Trump’s ties to the embattled GOP gubernatorial nominee and top Trump surrogate. The ad alternates between Trump’s praise for Robinson and the lieutenant governor’s comments in support of a statewide abortion ban without exceptions. It comes as Harris is set to give a speech Friday focused squarely on abortion rights in Georgia, where news reports have documented women’s deaths in the face of the state’s six-week ban. Her campaign says Harris’ ad is its first to link Trump to a down-ballot candidate. The rollout follows a CNN report Thursday about Robinson’s alleged posts on a pornography website’s message board. Robinson has denied writing the posts, which include racial and sexual comments. He said wouldn’t be forced out of the race by 'salacious tabloid lies.' Trump campaigns in Wilmington on Saturday, but a person on the Trump campaign, and a second person familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal planning, told AP that Robinson will not be with him. The Harris campaign says the ad is part of its $370 million in digital and television advertising reservations between Labor Day and Election Day. In addition, the Democratic National Committee is running billboards in nine places across North Carolina, including Robinson’s hometown of Greensboro, showing a photo of him standing alongside Trump. There’s also text of positive things the Republican presidential nominee and former president has said about Robinson. Jill Biden attends her first Cabinet meeting to discuss women's health President Joe Biden invited a special guest to his meeting with his Cabinet on Friday: his wife, Jill Biden. It was her first time attending. Biden called on her to update the group on a new White House effort to change the approach to and boost funding for research into women’s health issues. The first lady said 'incredible progress' had been made since she and the president launched the initiative in November after she learned about 'huge gaps in our understanding of women’s health.' She called out several departments and agencies, including Health and Human Services, Veterans Affairs and the National Institutes of Health, for committing hundreds of millions of dollars to spur research and innovation. The first lady said she’ll be making a new announcement on Monday in New York. She said the steps taken so far are 'building momentum for this research' but added, 'We have to keep moving forward.' Early voting begins in Minnesota, South Dakota and Virginia In-person voting for this year’s presidential election has officially begun, kicking off the six-week sprint to Election Day. Voters lined up Friday to cast their ballots in Minnesota, South Dakota and Virginia, the states with the first early in-person voting opportunities. About a dozen more states will follow by mid-October. Some of the voters who cast ballots Friday suggested that they didn’t want to wait, hoping to avoid the potential for trouble or chaos at the polls after a summer of political turmoil. Other early voters might opt for early in-person balloting instead of mail-in absentee ballots to ensure their votes get counted, given the ongoing struggles of the U.S. Postal Service. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has often sought to sow doubt about mail voting and encouraged voters to cast ballots in person on Election Day. But this year, Trump and the Republican National Committee, which he now controls, have begun to embrace early and mail voting as a way to lock in GOP votes before Election Day, just as Democrats have done for years. At a polling site in Minneapolis, Jason Miller arrived well before the polls opened at 8 a.m. and was first in line. He was among roughly 75 people who cast ballots in the first hour at the city’s early voting center. 'Why not try to be first? That’s kind of fun, right?' said the 37-year-old house painter. Teamsters Rail Conference endorses Harris after national union declined to make an endorsement The Teamsters Rail Conference, which represents 70,000 members, endorsed Kamala Harris and Tim Walz on Friday. The announcement comes as a flurry of Teamsters locals back the Democratic ticket even though the national union declined to make an endorsement in the presidential race. 'The lives and livelihoods of railroaders are more dependent than most workers on decisions made by the federal government,' said the Teamsters Rail Conference, which cited Democrats’ support for worker-friendly regulations like paid sick leave. The rail workers’ endorsement differs from a previous statement from the Teamsters’ national leadership, which cited Harris’ stance on rail strikes as a reason not to endorse her. Harris says she's ‘very proud’ to have Taylor Swift's support Vice President Kamala Harris said she’s 'very proud' to have earned Taylor Swift’s endorsement but poked at the pop superstar over the Super Bowl in a new video interview released Friday. The Kansas City Chiefs defeated the San Francisco 49ers 25-22 to win February’s game. Harris and Swift supported opposing teams. Harris, a former San Francisco district attorney, is a 49ers fan, while Swift backs the Chiefs. Her boyfriend is Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. In WIRED’s Autocomplete Interview, which Harris sat for earlier this week, she noted the split with Swift over the Super Bowl but said, 'Who’s mad at anyone for being loyal to their team?' On Swift’s endorsement, Harris said, 'I am very proud to have the support of Taylor Swift' and described the singer-songwriter as 'an incredible artist.' 'I really respect the courage that she has had in her career to stand up for what she believes is right,' the vice president said. Swift announced her endorsement shortly after the conclusion of Harris’ debate on Sept. 10 with Republican Donald Trump. Swift has a dedicated following among young women, a key demographic in the November election, and her latest tour has generated more than $1 billion in ticket sales Tourists can finally visit the Oval Office. A replica is opening near the White House Washington, D.C., has a new tourist stop that surely will be made over once the next president settles into office. 'The Peoples’s House: A Washington Experience' is set to open on Monday, covering three floors in an office building a block from the White House. The education center boasts a full-scale replica of the Oval Office decorated just as President Joe Biden’s currently is — right down to his desk, the armchairs in front of the fireplace and the weathered family Bible resting on a side table. But it won’t look that way for long. The plan is to update the replica Oval next year after either Democrat Kamala Harris or Republican Donald Trump is elected in November and assumes office, and the décor is set. The replica will always mirror the Oval Office of the sitting president, so it will be updated regularly, said Stewart McLaurin, president of the White House Historical Association. The nonprofit organization raised money to open the education center. Admission is free; timed tickets are required. Harris talks openly about her gun ownership Vice President Kamala Harris has grown more open about her gun ownership in recent weeks, but on Thursday she for the first time said what she’d do with the handgun she owns. Speaking during a campaign event hosted by the talk show host Oprah Winfrey, Harris was addressing her efforts to cut down on violence and pass a new ban on assault-style weapons, when she referenced owning a handgun — surprising Winfrey. 'If somebody’s breaking into my house they’re gettin shot,' Harris added. She continued: 'I probably shouldn’t have said that. My staff will deal with that later.' Oprah and Kamala Harris host town hall A live stream with Vice President Kamala Harris and talk show host Oprah Winfrey billed as a 'Unite for America' rally kicked off Thursday night with more than 230,000 viewers on YouTube alone even before Harris joined, as the Democrat looks to digital-first events to reach voters. The event was hosted by Winfrey from suburban Michigan, one of this election’s key battlegrounds, and leaned on celebrities like Brian Cranston, Jennifer Lopez, Chris Rock, and Meryl Streep, but also the stories of ordinary voters to promote Harris’s message. 'I want to bring my daughters to the White House to meet this Black woman president,' said comedian Chris Rock. Trump speaks to Jewish leaders in D.C. Donald Trump appeared before Jewish leaders in Washington D.C. on Thursday to talk about antisemitism. But as the former president is wont to do, he took a large detour at the top of his speech, name-checking his Republican allies in the crowd, discussing the Green New Deal 'scam' and pontificating about his polling numbers at length. Trump was roughly an hour late to his speech, which was slated to begin around 6 p.m. 'Kamala Harris has done absolutely nothing. She has not lifted a single finger to protect you, or protect your children, or even protect you with words... I’m here to tell you today that this ugly kind of antisemitic hate for all of us — bigotry and hate — will be turned back ... starting at noon on Jan. 23rd,' he said. 'With your vote, I will be your protector and defender and I will be the best friend Jewish Americans have ever had in the White House.'	https://apnews.com/article/trump-harris-election-2024-georgia-d4bc4f96289a228d737f7d13a3e3427a	2024-09-20T05:41:57-07:00	
Woman whose firm was linked to the exploding pagers is under Hungarian protection, her mother says	ROME (AP) — The woman whose company was linked to thousands of pagers that exploded in Lebanon and Syria this week is under the protection of the Hungarian secret services, her mother told The Associated Press on Friday. Cristiana Bársony-Arcidiacono has not appeared publicly since the deadly simultaneous attack that targeted Hezbollah on Tuesday and that has been widely blamed on Israel. She is listed as the CEO of Budapest-based BAC Consulting, which the Taiwanese trademark holder of the pagers said was responsible for the manufacture of the devices. Her mother, Beatrix Bársony-Arcidiacono, told the AP that her daughter had received unspecified threats and 'is currently in a safe place protected by the Hungarian secret services.' The 'Hungarian secret services advised her not to talk to media,' she said by phone from Sicily. Hungary's national security authorities did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and the AP could not independently verify the claim. Two days of attacks this week, first targeting pagers and then walkie-talkies, have killed at least 37 people and wounded more than 3,000, including civilians. Hezbollah and the Lebanese government have blamed Israel, which has neither confirmed nor denied involvement. Cristiana Bársony-Arcidiacono's company came under scrutiny after Gold Apollo, a Taiwanese firm, said it had authorized BAC Consulting to use its name on the pagers that were used in the first attack, but that the Hungarian company was responsible for manufacturing and design. On Wednesday, a Hungarian government spokesman said the pagers delivered to Hezbollah were never in Hungary, and that BAC Consulting merely acted as an intermediary. Beatrix Bársony-Arcidiacono, who also uses the name Beatrice, echoed that. 'She is not involved in any way, she was just a broker. The items did not pass through Budapest. ... They were not produced in Hungary,' she said. BAC Consulting shares the ground floor of a modest building in Budapest with numerous other enterprises, but has no physical offices and uses the property in Hungary's capital — like the other companies based there — only as an official address, according to a woman who emerged from the building earlier this week and refused to be named. The company's website said it specialized in 'environment, development, and international affairs.' The corporate registry listed 118 official functions including sugar and oil production, retail jewelry sales and natural gas extraction. It brought in $725,000 in revenue in 2022 and $593,000 in 2023, according to the company registry. Last year, the company spent nearly $324,000, or around 55% of its revenue, on 'equipment.' The company's website has been unavailable since Wednesday. Beatrix Bársony-Arcidiacono said her daughter was born in Sicily and studied at the University of Catania there before pursuing a Ph.D. in London. She worked in Paris and Vienna before moving to Budapest in October 2016 to care for her elderly grandmother. In May 2022, she incorporated the company at the heart of the mystery of the pagers. On social media, the younger Bársony-Arcidiacono describes herself as a strategic adviser and business developer with a doctorate who has worked for major international organizations such as the International Atomic Energy Agency and the CARE humanitarian agency, as well as for venture capital firms. The 49-year-old received her Ph.D. from University College London, where she was enrolled in the early to mid-2000s, according to her LinkedIn page. There, she worked with Ákos Kövér, a Hungarian physicist and now-retired professor, who confirmed her enrollment. Kövér said of Bársony-Arcidiacono in an email to the AP: 'At the time, we also published some joint articles. I am not aware of her other activities, as far as i know she has not done any scientific work since then.' ___ Spike reported from Budapest, Hungary.

Mayor of French town apologizes for his comments downplaying mass rape case	MAZAN, France (AP) — The mayor of a French town making headlines for the trial of dozens of men accused of rapes that occurred there over almost a decade has apologized for comments that appeared to downplay the case. 'I have been criticized for minimizing the seriousness of the heinous crimes of which the defendants are accused,' Louis Bonnet, the mayor of Mazan in southern France, said in a statement Thursday. 'I understand that these remarks are shocking and I sincerely apologize.' Dominique Pelicot, 71, told the court this week in the nearby city of Avignon that for nearly 10 years he drugged his wife and invited dozens of men to rape her as she lay defenseless. In an interview with the BBC, Bonnet said the case could have been far more serious. 'There were no children involved, no women were killed, the family will have a hard time but they can rebuild. After all, nobody died,' he told the broadcaster. Gisèle Pelicot, who was married to her husband for 50 years and had three children with him, has become a hero to many rape victims and a symbol of the fight against sexual violence in France for waiving her anonymity in the case, letting the trial be public and appearing openly in front of the media. Her ex-husband and the 50 other men on trial, who range in age from 26 to 74, face up to 20 years in prison if convicted. 'This terrible story has deeply wounded our community,' the mayor said in the statement. 'But I am fully aware that this wound is in no way comparable to the suffering of Gisèle Pelicot and her family.'	https://apnews.com/article/france-rape-trial-mayor-apologies-6d740afb0dfc638123473d93963cb7d4	2024-09-20T03:25:36-07:00	
Philippine senator says China should do more to help fight cybercrime gangs	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — China should do more to battle the illegal online gambling and scam call centers run by Chinese criminal syndicates in Southeast Asian countries often using forced labor, a Philippine senator who led an investigation into the centers said Friday. The U.N. human rights office has said that such gangs have forced hundreds of thousands of people into participating in online scam operations, including false romantic ploys, bogus investment pitches and illegal gambling schemes. Sen. Risa Hontiveros also called for stronger international cooperation to end cybercrime, saying that the gangs undermine the rule of law and could provide a platform for espionage activities, although she acknowledged there is no clear evidence linking the gambling hubs to Chinese surveillance operations. A number of Chinese gambling complexes which have been shut down by Philippine authorities were located near a Philippine air force base north of Manila where American forces have been authorized to build a presence and near a residential compound inhabited by American diplomats and military officials, according to Hontiveros. China has expressed alarm over increased U.S. military deployments in Asia, including in the Philippines, Washington's longtime treaty ally. Chinese-run online gambling outfits are estimated to number more than 400 across the Philippines, and they employ tens of thousands of Chinese and Southeast Asian nationals, many of them illegally trafficked into the country, Philippine officials said. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. ordered a ban on online gambling operations in July, saying they have mocked Philippine laws and committed crimes including financial scams, human trafficking, torture, kidnappings and murder. China has banned gambling, but most of the clients of the online syndicates which operate in the Philippines were mainland Chinese citizens, who defy their government’s prohibition, Hontiveros said. 'China is not doing enough, given her impressive powers that she has not been shy to wield and display on so many fronts,' Hontiveros said. 'We would all benefit from more regional and international cooperation in, for example, making the social media companies more accountable for the use and misuse of their products and services, their platforms, for these malign operations,' Hontiveros told foreign news correspondents in a briefing. There was no immediate reaction from Chinese officials in Manila or Beijing. The Chinese government, however, has said it has cooperated with Filipino authorities in shutting down the online gambling and scam outfits of Chinese syndicates in the Philippines and rescuing large numbers of Chinese and other Southeast Asians who were illegally recruited and forced to run the illegal operations and scams. Lucrative online gambling operations catering to Chinese citizens have also flourished in Southeast Asian countries allied with Beijing, including Cambodia and Myanmar, Hontiveros said. The online gambling industry has flourished across the Philippines largely due to corruption in government regulatory agencies and big payoffs to officials, officials said. The mayor of a town in Tarlac province north of Manila was dismissed by authorities after she was linked to an illegal online gambling complex with dozens of buildings. The former mayor, Alice Guo, has also been accused of faking Filipino nationality to run for public office in 2022. Guo fled the Philippines after the Senate committee led by Hontiveros ordered her arrest for failing to attend public hearings, but was arrested in Indonesia two weeks ago and deported to Manila. Guo, who remains in detention, has denied any wrongdoing.	https://apnews.com/article/philippines-china-illegal-online-gambling-scams-55a5bf33db5d956a92f2af96aa5bf641	2024-09-20T02:53:12-07:00	
Israel carries out targeted strike in Beirut after Hezbollah hits northern Israel with 140 rockets	BEIRUT (AP) — Israel hit a Beirut suburb with an airstrike Friday, not long after Hezbollah pounded northern Israel with 140 rockets following a vow by the militant group’s leader Hassan Nasrallah to retaliate against Israel for a mass bombing attack, the Israeli military and the militant group said. The Israeli military said it had carried out a 'targeted strike' in Beirut. It offered no further immediate details, but explosions could be heard coming from the city's southern suburbs. Beirut-based Al-Mayadeen TV reported that a drone fired several missiles on the heavily-populated area known as Dahiyeh. A Hezbollah official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak to the media, confirmed to The Associated Press that an airstrike struck the area, without giving further details. The strike came after Hezbollah pounded Israel with 140 rockets, which the Israeli military said came in three waves targeting sites along the ravaged border with Lebanon. Following the attacks, the Israeli military said that it had struck areas across southern Lebanon targeting Hezbollah infrastructure, but didn't provide details of damage. Hezbollah said that its attacks had targeted several sites along the border with Katyusha rockets, including multiple air defense bases as well as the headquarters of an Israeli armored brigade they said they’d struck for the first time. The Israeli military said that 120 missiles were launched at areas of the Golan Heights, Safed and the Upper Galilee, some of which were intercepted. Fire crews were working to extinguish blazes caused by pieces of debris that fell to the ground in several areas, the military said. The military didn't say whether any missiles had hit targets or caused any casualties. Another 20 missiles were shot at the areas of Meron and Netua, and most fell in open areas, the military said, adding that no injuries were reported. Hezbollah said that the rockets were in retaliation for Israeli strikes on villages and homes in southern Lebanon, not two days of attacks widely blamed on Israel that set off explosives in thousands of Hezbollah pagers and walkie-talkies. On Thursday, Israel said its military had struck 'hundreds of rocket launcher barrels' in southern Lebanon, saying that they 'were ready to be used in the immediate future to fire toward Israeli territory' The army also ordered residents in parts of the Golan Heights and northern Israel to avoid public gatherings, minimize movements and stay close to shelters in anticipation of the rocket fire that eventually came Friday. Hezbollah and Israel have exchanged near-daily fire since Oct. 8, a day after the Israel-Hamas war’s opening salvo, but Friday's rocket barrages were heavier than normal. Nasrallah on Thursday vowed to keep up daily strikes on Israel despite this week’s deadly sabotage of its members’ communication devices, which he described as a 'severe blow.' At least 20 were killed in the attacks and thousands were wounded when pagers, walkie-talkies and other devices exploded in Lebanon on Tuesday and Wednesday. The sophisticated attacks have heightened fears that the cross-border exchanges of fire will escalate into all-out war. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied involvement in the attacks. In recent days, Israel has moved a powerful fighting force up to the northern border, officials have escalated their rhetoric, and the country’s security Cabinet has designated the return of tens of thousands of displaced residents to their homes in northern Israel an official war goal. Fighting in Gaza has slowed, but casualties continue to rise. Overnight, Palestinian authorities said that 15 people were killed in multiple Israeli attacks in the Gaza Strip. Those included six people, including an unknown number of children, in an airstrike early Friday morning in Gaza City that hit a family home, Gaza’s Civil Defense said. Another person was killed in Gaza City when a strike hit a group of people on a street. Israel maintains that it only targets militants, and accuses Hamas and other armed groups of endangering civilians by operating in residential areas. The military, which rarely comments on individual strikes, had no immediate comment. Gaza’s Health Ministry says that more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in the territory since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack. The ministry doesn't differentiate between fighters and civilians in its count, but says a little over half of those killed were women and children. Israel says it has killed more than 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. More than 95,000 people have also been wounded in Gaza since Oct. 7, the Health Ministry said. The war has caused vast destruction and displaced about 90% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million. ___ Julia Frankel reported from Jerusalem.

Israel challenges international court request for arrest warrants Israel's foreign ministry said Friday it submitted two legal briefs in response to the International Criminal Court prosecutor’s request for arrest warrants against the country's leaders. The court’s prosecutor is seeking arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as top Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and other Hamas leaders. One of them was since assassinated in what was believed to be an Israeli strike. The foreign ministry said it has submitted two legal briefs challenging the court’s jurisdiction to arrest Israeli leaders and claiming the court did not provide Israel the opportunity to investigate itself before requesting the warrants. 'No other democracy with an independent and respected legal system like that which exists in Israel has been treated in this prejudicial manner by the Prosecutor,' wrote Foreign Ministry spokesperson Oren Marmorstein on the social media platform X. He said Israel remained 'steadfast in its commitment to the rule of law and justice' and would continue to protect its citizens against militancy. Israel is not a party to the court. Rights groups say the country has struggled to investigate itself in the past. Netanyahu has brushed off calls for a state investigation into the failings that led to the Oct. 7 attack. Leader of Iraqi militia reportedly killed in Syria BAGHDAD — A leader of an Iranian-backed Iraqi militia was killed Friday in a strike in Syria, a war monitor and a militia official said. Iraq’s Kataeb Hezbollah group — which is different from the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah — said in a statement that Abu Haidar al-Khafaji was killed 'while performing his duties as a security advisor in Damascus.' The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights had earlier reported that a leader in Iraq’s Kataeb Hezbollah group was killed and another person injured in a drone strike on the car they were traveling in on the road to the Damascus airport. An official with an Iraqi militia confirmed that a car carrying a group of militia members was struck in Damascus, killing one person and injuring three others. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. There was no comment from Israeli officials on the strike. Israel frequently strikes Iranian and Iran-linked groups in Syria but rarely acknowledges the strikes. Tensions have heightened in the region following a wave of apparently remotely detonated explosions in Lebanon targeting pagers and walkie talkies belonging to the Lebanese Hezbollah. The attacks, widely blamed on Israel, which has not commented on them, killed at least 37 people - including two children - and wounded about 3,000. — By Qassim Abdul-Zahra in Baghdad Israel military says it killed 2 Hezbollah members planting explosives along the border BEIRUT — Israel’s military killed two Hezbollah members who were planting explosives along the border over the weekend, Israel’s military and an official with a Lebanese group said. The official with a Lebanese group said the two members of the militant group were killed Sunday and their bodies were taken by Israeli troops because they were too close to the fence along the tense frontier. The official spoke Friday on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. On Thursday, Israel’s military released a video it said was taken by one of the fighters showing the militants coming under fire. The military said that the two fighters were killed by Israeli troops as they tried to plant an improvised explosive device near a military post. In the days following the tense border interaction, thousands of devices exploded in different parts of Lebanon and Syria, killing 37 people and wounding around 3,000 others. The attack was blamed on Israel, and many of those killed or injured were members of Hezbollah. ___ Associated Press writer Bassem Mroue contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-latest-20-september-2024-03ffd81ceb3afc8737fbfbb2c89413ef	2024-09-20T02:21:00-07:00	
Lawyers say former Harrods boss Al Fayed was a 'monster' who abused young women and girls	LONDON (AP) — Lawyers representing dozens of women who say they were raped and sexually abused by Mohamed Al Fayed, the former boss of the famous London department store Harrods, said the case was akin to the crimes of sex offenders Jimmy Savile, Jeffrey Epstein and Harvey Weinstein. At a press briefing in London on Friday in the wake of the BBC documentary 'Al-Fayed: Predator At Harrods,' the lawyers described the Egypt-born businessman who died last year at the age of 94 as a 'monster' who abused young women and girls who worked at the department store during his 25-year ownership. 'This case combines some of the most horrific elements of the cases involving Jimmy Savile, Jeffrey Epstein and Harvey Weinstein,' said lead lawyer Dean Armstrong. 'Savile because in this case, as in that, the institution, we say, knew about the behavior. Epstein because in that case, as in this, there was a procurement system in place to source the women and girls — as you know there are some very young victims. And Weinstein, because it was a person at the very top of the organization who was abusing his power.' One of Al Fayed’s alleged victims, who went by the name Natacha, told the press conference that the billionaire businessman was 'highly manipulative' and 'preyed on the most vulnerable, those of us who needed to pay the rent and some of us who didn’t have parents to protect them.' In a statement given to the BBC documentary, the new owners of Harrods, who bought out Al Fayed in 2010, said they were 'utterly appalled' by the allegations of abuse but added that they were only made aware of them last year. 'While we cannot undo the past, we have been determined to do the right thing as an organization, driven by the values we hold today, while ensuring that such behaviour can never be repeated in the future,' the owners said in a statement. However, Armstrong queried Harrods' claim that it knew nothing as sexual allegations had been made against Al Fayed for decades. 'We are here to say publicly and to the world, or to Harrods in front of the world, that it is time that they took responsibility, and it is time that they set matters right, and that is something they should do as soon as possible,' he said. U.S. lawyer Gloria Allred, who has represented victims in some of the most notorious sexual abuse cases in recent years, including Epstein, Weinstein and Bill Cosby, also spoke. 'Harrods is often referred to as the most beautiful store in the world … many women dreamed of working there, to be associated with this prestigious corporation and to further their careers,' she said. 'However, underneath the Harrods glitz and glamour was a toxic, unsafe and abusive environment.'	https://apnews.com/article/harrods-alfayed-britain-sexual-abuse-390052e7bf52d7667b9e3be1a77ded37	2024-09-20T01:44:02-07:00

The EU's chief is trying to help Ukraine prepare for winter. Half its energy network is destroyed.	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen arrived in Ukraine on Friday focused on helping the country to repair and reconnect its war-damaged electricity grid and boost its heating capacity as winter approaches. Around half of Ukraine’s energy infrastructure has been destroyed during its war with Russia, and rolling electricity blackouts leave parts of the east in darkness for four hours at a time. Von der Leyden said it was as though all of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia had lost electricity. Meanwhile, winter is approaching. 'Heating season starts in two weeks and Russia’s relentless attacks on Ukraine’s civilian energy infrastructure aims to inflict maximum damage,' von der Leyen said as she arrived in Kyiv for talks with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. 'We will help Ukraine in its brave efforts to overcome this.' The main aim is to help Ukraine decentralize its power grid, and to become less reliant on the big power stations that make easier targets for Russian forces. Around 260 missiles rained down in a major attack on energy infrastructure late last month. The Europeans have already sent more 10,000 generators and transformers, and they're supplying small and more mobile gas turbines too. These types of electricity-providing equipment is harder to hit and easier to repair. Ukraine’s winter runs from late October through March, with January and February the toughest months. The Europeans hope to help supply around 25% of the 17 gigawatts of power that the country is likely to need this winter. One aim of the EU assistance is to provide an incentive for people to stay in Ukraine. Some 4 million people have fled since the war began in February 2022, often to Poland and other neighboring countries. The EU is providing assistance, such as short-term help to find a place to stay, jobs or education. But recently the number of people leaving has climbed. The commission, the EU’s powerful executive branch, estimates that 10,000 more people are applying for help each week. On Thursday, the commission announced that it would provide an extra 160 million euros ($180 million) to help fortify Ukraine’s energy network. Of that, 100 million euros ($112 million) come from the windfall profits the EU has earned from interest on frozen Russian assets. Von der Leyen said the plan is to make 'Russia pay for it through the revenue generated by their frozen assets.' Denmark is also leading the charge on using the money to place orders for weapons and military equipment directly with Ukraine’s defense industry. She and Zelenskyy will also discuss the use of loans organized by the Group of Seven major industrial powers to help bolster Ukraine’s conflict-ravaged economy, and weigh progress in Kyiv’s efforts to join the EU.	https://apnews.com/article/eu-ukraine-energy-repairs-power-war-leyen-c34f6d182d7d9f5e9a30436374c41674	2024-09-19T21:28:21-07:00	
Thousands of exploding devices in Lebanon trigger a nation that has been on edge for years	BEIRUT (AP) — Chris Knayzeh was in a town overlooking Lebanon's capital when he heard the rumbling aftershock of the 2020 Beirut port blast. Hundreds of tons of haphazardly stored ammonium nitrates had exploded, killing and injuring thousands of people. Already struggling with the country’s economic collapse, the sight of the gigantic mushroom cloud unleashed by the blast was the last straw. Like many other Lebanese, he quit his job and booked a one-way ticket out of Lebanon. Knayzeh was in Lebanon visiting when news broke Tuesday that hundreds of handheld pagers had exploded across the country, killing 12, injuring thousands and setting off fires. Israel, local news reports said, was targeting the devices of the militant Hezbollah group. Stuck in Beirut traffic, Knayzeh started panicking that drivers around him could potentially be carrying devices that would explode. Within minutes, hospitals were flooded with patients, bringing back painful reminders of the port blast four years ago that killed more than 200 people and injured more than 6,000, leaving enduring mental and psychological scars for those who lived through it. In total, the explosions of pagers and walkie-talkies over two days killed at least 37 people and injured more than 3,000. Israel is widely believed to be behind the blasts, although it has neither confirmed nor denied responsibility. 'The country's state is unreal,' Knayzeh told The Associated Press. The port blast was one of the biggest non-nuclear explosions ever recorded, and it came on top of a historic economic meltdown, financial collapse and a feeling of helplessness after nationwide protests against corruption that failed to achieve their goals. It compounded years of crises that have upended the lives of people in this small country. Four years after the port catastrophe, an investigation has run aground. The ravaged Mediterranean port remains untouched, its towering silos standing broken and shredded as a symbol of a country in ruins. Political divisions and paralysis have left the country without a president or functioning government for more than two years. Poverty is on the rise. On top of that and in parallel with Israel’s war in Gaza, Lebanon has been on the brink of all-out war with Israel for the past year, with Israel and Hezbollah trading fire and Israeli warplanes breaking the sound barrier over Beirut almost daily, terrorizing people in their homes and offices. 'I can’t believe this is happening again. How many more disasters must we endure?' said Jocelyn Hallak, a mother of three, two of whom now work abroad and the third headed out after graduation next year. 'All this pain, when will it end?' A full-blown war with Israel could be devastating for Lebanon. The country’s crisis-battered health care system had been preparing for the possibility of conflict with Israel even before hospitals became inundated with the wounded from the latest explosions, many of them in critical condition and requiring extended hospital stays. Still, Knayzeh, now a lecturer at a university in France, can't stay away. He returns regularly to see his girlfriend and family. He flinches whenever he hears construction work and other sudden loud sounds. When in France, surrounded by normalcy, he agonizes over family at home while following the ongoing clashes from afar. 'It’s the attachment to our country I guess, or at the very least attachment to our loved ones who couldn’t leave with us,' he said. This summer, tens of thousands of Lebanese expatriates came to visit family and friends despite the tensions. Their remittances and money they spend during the holidays help keep the country afloat and in some cases are the main source of income for families. Many, however, cut their vacations short in chaotic airport scenes, fearing major escalation after the dual assassinations of Hezbollah and Hamas commanders in Beirut and Tehran last month, blamed on Israel. Even in a country that has vaulted from one crisis to another for decades, the level of confusion, insecurity and anger is reaching new heights. Many thought the port blast was the most surreal and frightening thing they would ever experience — until thousands of pagers exploded in people’s hands and pockets across the country this week. ’’I saw horrific things that day,' said Mohammad al-Mousawi, who was running an errand in Beirut’s southern suburb, where Hezbollah has a strong presence, when the pagers began blowing up. 'Suddenly, we started seeing scooters whizzing by carrying defaced men, some without fingers, some with their guts spilling out. Then the ambulances started coming.' It reminded him of the 2020 port blast, he said. 'The number of injuries and ambulances was unbelievable. ' 'One more horror shaping our collective existence,' wrote Maha Yahya, the Beirut-based director of the Malcolm H. Kerr Carnegie Middle East Center. 'The shock, the disarray, the trauma is reminiscent of Beirut after the port explosion. Only this time it was not limited to a city but spread across the country,' she said in a social media post. In the aftermath of the exploding pagers, fear and paranoia has taken hold. Parents kept their children away from schools and universities, fearing more exploding devices. Organizations including the Lebanese civil defense advised personnel to switch off their devices and remove all batteries until further notice. One woman said she disconnected her baby monitor and other household appliances. Lebanon’s civil aviation authorities have banned the transporting of pagers and walkie-talkies on all airplanes departing from Beirut’s Rafik Hariri International Airport 'until further notice.' Some residents were sleeping with their phones in another room. In the southern city of Tyre, ahead of a speech by Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, city resident Hassan Hajo acknowledged feeling 'a bit depressed' after the pager blasts, a major security breach for a secretive organization like Hezbollah. He was hoping to get a boost from Nasrallah’s speech. 'We have been through worse before and we got through it,' he said. In his speech, Nasrallah vowed to retaliate against Israel for the attacks on devices, while Israel and Hezbollah traded heavy fire across the border. Israel stepped up warnings of a potential larger military operation targeting the group. Another resident, Marwan Mahfouz, said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been threatening Lebanon with war for the past year and he should just do it. 'If we are going to die, we’ll die. We are already dying. We are already dead,' he said. ___ Karam reported from London.

Western nations were desperate for Korean babies. Now many adoptees believe they were stolen	Yooree Kim marched into a police station in Paris and told an officer she wanted to report a crime. Forty years ago, she said, she was kidnapped from the other side of the world, and the French government endorsed it. She wept as she described years spent piecing it together, stymied at every turn to get an answer to a simple question: How was she, a bright, diligent schoolgirl, with known parents whom she loved, documented as an abandoned orphan in South Korea in 1984 and sent to strangers in France? She believes the government of France — along with many Western nations — allowed families to 'mail order children' through international adoption, and did nothing to protect them. 'They were reckless,' she said. 'They never questioned anything. They never checked where I was from. They never checked whether my parents existed or not.' Kim was caught in an adoption machine that sent hundreds of thousands of Korean children to families in the United States, Europe and Australia. Now adults, many have since discovered that their adoption paperwork was untrue, and their quest for accountability now has spread far beyond South Korea’s borders to the Western countries that claimed them. Those governments turned a blind eye to rampant fraud and sometimes pressured the South Korean government to keep the kids coming, an investigation led by The Associated Press has found. Documents show that at the peak of adoptions from South Korea, Western diplomats processed papers like an assembly line, despite evidence that adoption agencies were aggressively competing for babies to send abroad, pressuring mothers and paying hospitals. Governments focused on satisfying intense demand from Western families desperate for children. The AP, in collaboration with Frontline (PBS), spoke with more than 80 adoptees in the U.S., Australia and Europe and examined thousands of pages of documents to reveal evidence of kidnapped or missing children ending up abroad, fabricated names, babies switched with one another and parents told their newborns were gravely sick or dead, only to discover decades later they’d been sent to new parents overseas. The seismic consequences are ricocheting around the world and challenging the entire international adoption industry, which was built on the model created in South Korea. The Netherlands in May announced it would no longer allow its citizens to adopt from abroad. Denmark’s only international adoption agency said it was shutting down, Sweden stopped adoptions from South Korea, and Norway is investigating. Switzerland apologized for failing to prevent illegal adoptions. France in March released a scathing assessment of its own culpability. The U.S., the pioneer of this system and long the country to adopt the most foreign orphans, has not analyzed its own accountability, and some have questioned why. The State Department said questions from AP over several months have prompted it to begin trying to piece together its history from archives. An early review found that widespread practices in South Korea at the time 'may have resulted in adoptions based on falsified documentation' but no indication yet that U.S. officials were aware of it. Kim believes Western governments clung to the narrative that they were saving needy children and ignored evidence that suggested otherwise. Foreign diplomats in the country surely would have noticed that Seoul’s streets weren’t packed with abandoned babies and street children, she said. 'We were commodified like a good to be sold,' she said. 'They made fake orphans and fed the market.' ___ This story is the second in an ongoing investigation led by The Associated Press in collaboration with FRONTLINE (PBS). The first story is here. The investigation includes an interactive and the upcoming documentary South Korea’s Adoption Reckoning, premiering Sept. 20 on PBS and online. ___ ‘Illicit practices of a systemic nature’ The Korean adoptee diaspora of around 200,000 children is thought to be the largest in the world. At the peak in the 1970s and '80s, South Korea was sending out babies by the hundreds per month. It’s impossible to tell how many adoptions involved fraud, and advocates argue most went well. But France, the country that took in Yooree Kim, acknowledged in March that its own government had long known of 'the existence of illicit practices of a systemic nature.' 'The public authorities were alerted early and were late in taking action,' the report said. 'In France, diplomatic archives and the archives of associations effectively showed these practices existed in countries over long periods of time and they were alerted at times at the highest levels, often in isolation, without any political reaction to put an end to them.' Access to birth control and abortion in the Western world had caused the number of domestically adoptable babies to plummet, and families clamored for children. The system was designed for the convenience of consumers, and most adoptive parents didn’t even have to visit South Korea. 'To put it simply, there was supply because there was demand,' said Park Geon-Tae, who leads a team with South Korea’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission now investigating its adoption practices. 'Were there so many abandoned children in South Korea? We have yet to see this.' In 1974, South Korea tried to stop adoptions to Scandinavia, after its political rival, North Korea, charged that children were 'being sold like animals in the foreign land.' South Korean government records from the time show that diplomats from Sweden, Denmark and Norway began begging for babies. 'The adoption of Korean orphans by Swedish parents is not because Korea is neglecting its orphans, but because Swedish couples without children are desiring to adopt them, so it would be good to continue the transfers of orphans,' the Swedish ambassador said in a meeting with South Korea’s deputy foreign minister in January 1975. South Korean Health Minister Ko Jae-pil wrote in a report that the countries sent nine pleas for adoptions to continue, citing at least 1,455 requests for Korean children. Ambassadors visited Korean officials multiple times and 'have kept badgering by sending diplomatic documents' that practically threatened halted adoptions would damage relations, the report says. One wrote that he was 'concerned that the public opinion against South Korea would worsen' if they halted adoptions to Scandinavia. A Danish citizen wrote to the South Korean president directly to plead for him to expedite the adoptions of two Korean boys. Under pressure, South Korea reversed course. 'Accepting the strong requests by related nations to resume adoptions is considered to promote international friendships,' Ko wrote in 1975. In July of that year, Choi Young-ja’s toddler ran out of the house to chase a cloud of insecticide sprayed by a fumigation truck with friends and never returned. She and her husband reported him missing and created posters with his photo and name, Paik Sang-yeol. They carried the posters into the country’s largest adoption agency, Holt Children’s Services, every month for years. Each time, they were told there was no information. Nearly 50 years later, after exhausting all other options, she submitted her DNA to a police unit that helps Korean adoptees find their families. Choi has been fighting stomach cancer. As she was rolled into the operating room, all she thought was that she could not die without seeing her son. When she learned last year that they had found him, she fell to the ground and wept. He’d been adopted to Norway in December 1975, five months after he went missing. The documents that went with him made up a new name, and included a photo — black-and-white, his lips pursed tight, his hands curled inward. His adoption case number, K-8818, was taped to his chest. The adoption agency that sent him away was Holt, the same agency she had visited so many times. She stormed into Holt’s offices in Seoul, demanding her son’s full adoption files, she said. When a worker refused without her son’s signoff, Choi snapped: She flipped a chair, hurled a trash bin, and swung a roll of paper. 'Did you get me to sign off when you sold away my 4-year-old?!' Choi recalled shouting. Holt did not respond to a request to verify Choi’s account of the meeting. She’s working with lawyers to file a lawsuit against the South Korean government and Holt for sending her son to Norway. Norwegian authorities 'are aware of serious findings that have come to light' about adoptions, said Ingeborg Gloppen Johnsen, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The country launched an investigation last year to uncover whether illegal or unethical practices happened, and if Norwegian officials failed to control them. In late October, Choi nervously paced her narrow living quarters, double-checked flight arrival times and dug through an album of fading photographs. She hadn’t slept for days. Her boy — now a graying 52-year-old fashion designer — was coming to visit. Choi quietly stood at the Incheon International Airport, sporting freshly styled hair and a vibrant pink cardigan she handpicked for the reunion. She’d been rehearsing what to say, and practiced 'I’m sorry' in English. Then he emerged from the crowd. She knew him immediately — the familiar round cheeks, the prominent ears, the wide, grinning eyes. She buried her face into his chest and wailed, managing to choke out the words: 'I’m sorry.' ___ ‘We constantly dropped the ball' Americans pioneered the modern adoption system and brought home far more South Korean children than any other nation. In the 1950s, Harry and Bertha Holt, evangelical Christians from Oregon, said they’d received a calling from God to save Korean War orphans. Until then, international adoptions were not common. But after the war, biracial babies born to Korean women and American soldiers were shunned by a society that valued racial purity and saw them as a painful reminder of U.S. imperialism. Harry Holt, a farmer and timberman, flew to Korea and rounded up a dozen orphans — eight for himself and four for friends. The Holts were 'deluged' with letters from others who wanted orphans of their own, Bertha Holt wrote in a memoir. Harry Holt began flying planeloads of babies to the U.S. The only qualification for adoptive families was that they were born-again Christians. The government knew its citizens were desperate for children: Aching letters had been pouring into U.S. government offices from hopeful parents, begging for help finding someone to adopt, according to archives. A woman wrote she felt she was 'cheating' her husband out of a family. Another said they wanted a child born to parents suitably intelligent. Yet another asked for a baby 'or one as young as I can get it.' U.S. officials wanted to process the adoptions as quickly as possible to avoid bad publicity, according to internal government memos at the National Archives. A social worker wrote that an immigration official told her his boss 'wants no reports to reach Washington of dissatisfied customers due to delays in processing.' The mothers of biracial children didn’t always want to give them up, records show. In a letter to his wife in 1956, Harry Holt wrote: 'One poor girl almost had hysterics in the office. She thought she could keep track of her baby after he had gone to America. I had to tell her it was a clean break and forever. Poor girl, her baby wasn’t weaned yet and she cried and cried.' The adoption business boomed and attracted competitors, including Eastern Social Welfare Society, Korea Welfare Services and Korea Social Service. Holt remained the largest, sending about half of Korean adoptees abroad. Holt split in 1977, forming a separate Oregon-based agency, Holt International, that often partnered with its Korean sister. By then, South Korea was climbing out of post-war poverty, yet the numbers of adoptions kept skyrocketing. An International Social Service social worker who visited the U.S. Embassy in Seoul around that time found what she saw 'distasteful,' according to documents at the agency’s archives at the University of Minnesota Libraries. 'It showed the callous way in which children going to the US. were processed, to me, it was a real assembly line type method,' Patricia Nye, the east Asia director for ISS, wrote. 'Only documents are seen, children are never seen by the visa officers.' American officials seemed to defer entirely to the agencies, she wrote: 'I was told that it is the US embassy’s feelings that each agency should be left to their own cognizance.' Nye has since died. At a hearing in 1977, a U.S. Congressman asked why so many children were still coming from South Korea. Immigration officials acknowledged it was because of 'the active cooperation of the Korean government' and 'very active adoption agencies.' An official testified that an officer in Tokyo would fly to Seoul for one week a month to make sure the children were adoptable orphans. But with hundreds of stories to verify in a single week, only a tiny fraction of adoptions were denied. 'We didn’t pay attention when we should have been in the beginning. Somebody should have said, what is going on? How is that possible?' said Susan Jacobs, a retired State Department official who has worked on adoption reform efforts. 'We were wrong, we were totally wrong, we constantly dropped the ball.' Laws tended to favor the desires of adoptive parents, she said, and there were few safeguards built into the system. International adoptions were shoehorned into a process built for domestic adoptions. After the federal government issued the initial visas, adoptions were finalized through thousands of local courthouses with different judges, laws and standards. In 1985, Judge Homer Stark in Gwinnett County, Georgia, noticed the adoption file before him for twin Korean boys included no acknowledgement of the birth parents or proof that they consented. The only paperwork submitted was a statement signed by a guardian, and it was unclear how the person came into possession of the children. 'That opens a lot of holes for illegal things,' Stark remembers thinking, in a recent conversation with AP. 'I don’t know where this child came from, he might have been picked up off the street.' Stark asked the attorney general for an opinion. Assistant Attorney General David Will wrote that granting adoptions without documentation of the birth parents’ consent 'would condone the practice of the sale of kidnapping of foreign children for ultimate adoption in this state.' Will soon got a call from his boss to look in their office lobby, he told AP. Mothers had pushed their adopted children in strollers into the attorney general’s office for a sit-in, claiming he was trying to shut down adoption. He says he tried to tell them: 'We just want adoptions to be done right, to respect the rights of the parents and make sure that no one is stealing a child or buying a child.' When Stark rejected the petition, it was granted by a judge in another Georgia county where the U.S. adoption agency was based. The adoptive father, who asked to not be named, still treasures the photo from that day — him and his wife, the judge and their twin sons, all smiling. The year after his boys arrived, the adoption industry took its case to the legislature. Georgia’s governor signed a bill into law in April 1986 that exempted the requirement to prove that birth parents gave their consent for foreign adoptions. It fell to federal officials to determine whether a child was truly an adoptable orphan. 'For us, it seemed like we were sending children to a better situation — whether that’s true or not, I can’t tell you, but that’s what it seemed like,' said Donald Wells, who was chief of the State Department’s immigrant visa unit in Seoul from 1980 to 1984. 'I’ve always considered that we were doing a good thing.' He estimates they processed more than 12,000 visas, and immigration officers checked if the child met the definition of an eligible orphan. If the paperwork then looked right to the State Department, they accepted it. 'We saw paperwork, we did not see children,' he said, 'and we did not have the resources to go out and investigate the background and find out where this child came from.' The immigration officer he worked with there did question where all the kids were coming from. Robert Ackerman, immigration attache at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul, told reporters in 1988 that he had heard allegations of birth mothers being bribed. But he said he saw 'no evidence of fraud or profiteering' in his five years at the embassy, despite complaints that he was too tough with adoption applications. Ackerman, who has died, said then that he was 'bothered' by the business. 'When I see 500 kids going out of the country a month, I have to ask, ‘Do we have a humanitarian effort or just a baby pipeline?’' Ackerman told United Press International. 'Where does humanitarianism end and business begin?' ___ ‘That day has come’ Today, the United States is in the middle of an emotional debate about how best to move forward with adoptions built on a model some call deeply flawed. Maureen Flatley, a consultant who’s helped write reforms of the international adoption system, believes it can only do so after looking at its past. She recalled telling a lobbyist fighting against safeguards in the 1990s that one day, adoptees would grow up and tell their own stories, and that would force a reckoning. 'I think that day has come and I’m glad it’s here,' she said. 'I think it’s long past time for the U.S. government to conduct a deep and thorough and searching investigation into what these practices have been. There’s a reason the old saying is ‘Those who don’t learn from history are doomed to repeat it.’' Michelle Bernier-Toth, the State Department’s special adviser for children’s issues, said the agency is tracking developments in Europe, and has been in contact with South Korea’s truth-finding commission on adoptions. They are sympathetic to adoptees who believe their lives were shaped by fraud and deceit. The State Department just started working with an archivist to understand its own history, she said, but records are sparse and difficult to find. The department emphasized that adoption now is very different. The United States in 2008 ratified the Hague Adoption Convention, an international treaty meant to safeguard intercountry adoptions. Agencies must now be accredited, there are far more regulations and a more stringent process for evaluating orphans. Most children now are older or have special needs, and the number of intercountry adoptions to the U.S. has plummeted from 20,000 in 2004 to less than 2,000, with just 47 from Korea last year. That has caused some to warn of the danger of stringent regulations making it too hard to save children from dire conditions abroad. 'Of course, I, like all adoption advocates, would prefer that we have even better systems… to make sure that there are as few as possible illegal adoptions that happen,' said Elizabeth Bartholet, a Harvard law professor and adoptive parent. 'But if you set the standard to be ‘we want zero,’ you are going to deny millions of kids homes. And that’s enormously destructive.' The lobby of Holt International, on a leafy street in Eugene, Oregon, is a museum to its origin story and Christian mission: to find families for the world’s neediest children. It is a well-respected agency that works all over the world, and has called for stricter safeguards in the industry. Holt asked Susan Soonkeum Cox, who retired last year after working for 40 years at the adoption agency, to speak to AP and Frontline. Holt brought Cox from Korea to the U.S. at around 4 years old in 1956. Cox rejects the allegations that agencies foraged for babies to send abroad. 'What I’m aware of is the franticness of so many children being brought to orphanages,' she said. 'It would be wonderful if every child born in Korea and every other country could stay with their biological family and live a happy, fulfilling life. But that’s not the reality.' Holt’s South Korea operation, a separate company from the U.S. Holt International, declined to comment on specific allegations, as did the three other Korean adoption agencies. Holt Korea in recent years has denied wrongdoing, attributing adoptees’ complaints to misunderstandings and the country’s problems with social welfare. Kim Jin Sook, president of Eastern, said the agency was just carrying out government policies to find Western homes for 'discarded children.' Cox said that as a representative of Holt, she’s often at an 'uncomfortable juxtaposition' where some fellow adoptees blame her. But she believes the majority are happily living their lives. Cox still refers to Bertha Holt as 'grandma,' and remembers finding a snapshot of a little girl staring off into the distance in a giant scrapbook when she first began working for Holt. 'Oh my God, that’s me,' she gasped at the time. 'Any kind of hint or a clue is so precious.' She later learned that her father was a Western soldier, and her mother, now dead, gave her the name Soonkeum — 'pure gold' in Korean. On her 40th birthday, she reclaimed that name as part of her own. ___ ‘Answer me!’ Most adoptees were babies and have no memories of their own. But Yooree Kim remembers. She was 11 when she and her younger brother were sent by the Korean agency Holt to a couple in France who’d requested siblings around their ages. After a divorce, her impoverished single mother had put them in an orphanage so at least they could eat, a common practice then in Korea. Two days before Christmas in 1983, an orphanage worker pulled her aside to say they would be sent away. She was terrified. She claimed she was abused at her new home, which her adoptive parents deny. Her brother also denies it, she said, but he did not respond to AP requests for comment. A judge dismissed a complaint she filed against her adoptive father for insufficient evidence. Ten years after her traumatic move to France, she remembered her Korean family’s names, their addresses. So she found them. 'Why did you abandon me?' she asked her mother. Her mother said she never did. When she returned to the orphanage, Angel’s Home in Seoul, she learned her daughter was already gone. Angel’s Home has since closed. From 1973 to 1990, at least 390 children from there were sent to foreign adopters, including 217 to the U.S. and 127 to France, according to information AP obtained through a records request. All but seven were handled through Holt. Kim’s paperwork contains three conflicting stories of how she and her brother were turned into orphans. One said they were relinquished by their paternal grand-aunt, whom Kim never recalls meeting. Korean law made clear that consent for adoption can only come from parents, direct-line grandparents or legal guardians. Another document says Kim’s mother agreed to the adoption. A third says the siblings were found 'roaming' the streets and were 'emotionally hardened' by the experience. She wondered: How did no one in this system, from South Korea to France, catch such discrepancies? She called the former president of Holt in Korea, who signed her paperwork. 'How can you say you knew nothing when you were the president?' she asked on the call, which she recorded and provided to AP. He scolded her. 'You are now 50, you should know better,' he said to Kim. 'This was something that happened 40 years ago.' Then he hung up. When reached by AP, the president, Kim Han-Kyu, refused to comment on individual cases. 'What would I know? The president stamps the paperwork as the guardian and the nuts and bolts are handled by working-level employees,' he said. He added that he didn’t know where Holt got its children, but insisted it 'didn’t do bad things' and agencies didn’t compete for children. 'No, no, no, the children were sent abroad as a government policy,' he said. 'Holt and other social welfare organizations had the role of transport stations. You sent them because the government approved it, otherwise you couldn’t.' Kim’s French agency, Les Amis des Enfants du Monde, didn’t respond to requests for comment. Kim wants the world to know what happened to her and to so many others. She stormed up to the home of a French adoption agency leader with a Korean film crew, pressed the buzzer and held it down for a full minute. 'Why did you steal me from my Korean parents?...They never abandoned me,' she screamed, unsure if anyone was listening. 'Answer me!' ___ AP researcher Rhonda Shafner and reporter Lori Hinnant and Frontline’s Lora Moftah and Emily Sternlicht contributed to this report. ___ Part One: South Korea’s government, Western countries and adoption agencies worked in tandem to supply some 200,000 Korean children to parents overseas, despite years of evidence they were being procured through questionable or downright unscrupulous means, an investigation led by The Associated Press found. Those children grew up and searched for their roots — and some realized they are not who they were told.

Brazil drought punishes coffee farms and threatens to push prices even higher	CACONDE, Brazil (AP) — Silvio Almeida’s coffee plantation sits at an ideal altitude on a Brazilian hillside, whose clay-rich soil does well at retaining moisture from rainfall and a nearby reservoir. Lately, though, water is scarce on Almeida's modest farm in Caconde, a town in one of Sao Paulo state’s key growing regions. He can’t get his coffee to grow the way it should. In Brazil, the world's largest coffee producer, Almeida and other farmers have started grappling with the nation's worst drought in more than seven decades and above-average temperatures. Almeida expected to harvest 120 sacks of coffee beans this harvest season, but instead managed just 100. 'Given the conditions here, the 2025 crop is already affected,' he told The Associated Press, pointing to a part of his plantation where flower buds died before blooming. 'I won’t say it’s doomed, because with God anything is possible. But based on the situation, it’s already compromised.' Brazil's harvest season that ends this month was virtually flat from last year, and exports surged, but the ongoing drought is already complicating the start of the 2025/2026 season, according to a report Monday by the Center for Advanced Studies on Applied Economics at the University of Sao Paulo’s agribusiness school. At the same time, Vietnam, the world’s second-biggest coffee producer, is experiencing heat and drought, affecting its crops. Potential supply shortages in both countries have started driving up global coffee prices, according to the report. The market is closely monitoring how Brazilian coffee plants endure these adverse climate conditions, which can cause flowers to stop blooming, fail to turn into cherries or produce lower-quality beans, said Felippe Serigati, who coordinates the master’s program in agribusiness at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a university in Sao Paulo. 'It could result in a smaller coffee harvest,' Serigati said. 'Since the market tends to anticipate these movements, we’ve already seen the price of arabica coffee in New York and robusta (coffee) in Europe trading at higher levels.' Coffee prices haven’t reached the record highs the world saw in the late 1970s, after a severe frost wiped out 70% of Brazil’s coffee plants. But they have been soaring in recent years. In August, the International Coffee Organization’s Composite Indicator Price – which combines the price of several types of green coffee beans – averaged $2.38 per pound, up nearly 55% from the same month a year ago. In part, prices are rising because of higher demand, particularly in Asia. But weather is also driving increases. Drought, frost and fire have damaged as much as one-fifth of arabica coffee producers’ growing areas in Brazil, said Billy Roberts, a senior economist for food and beverage at Colorado-based CoBank. 'It’s not looking like it will get that much better in the near term. They will need consistent rainfall to recover,' he said. Uncontrolled, manmade wildfires across Brazil have lately been ravaging protected areas and farms. One of them ripped through Caconde last week. Almeida, who is also a math teacher at a local public school, helped calculate the damage for a regional association. So far, he estimates the blazes affected 519 hectares (1,282 acres). Half was native Atlantic Forest, 30% pasture and 15% coffee plantations. On Almeida's own land, 2,000 of his 15,000 plants were torched. His neighbor, João Rodrigues Martins, lost everything. Martins, 71, had 2,500 coffee plants on a small plot, now completely blackened by soot. The coffee he sells to a local cooperative is his livelihood and also pays for his son’s medical treatment. For smallholders, seeing years of cultivation reduced to ash is tough to reckon with. Last week, Martins ran through fire to save his bee boxes. Today, he is finding the strength to continue forward. 'Faith is a boat that helps us navigate life,' he said. ___ Durbin reported from Detroit.	https://apnews.com/article/brazil-climate-change-drought-coffee-harvest-a6516a4b314e6ba7c11513c08afb6996	2024-09-19T19:28:43-07:00	
Stock market today: Wall Street closes out a record-setting week on a quiet note	NEW YORK (AP) — A record-setting week for Wall Street closed on a quieter note. U.S. stocks mostly pulled back from their highs hit during a worldwide rally the day before, even as the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up to another record. The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.2% Friday, but it still had its fifth winning week in the last six. The Dow eked out a gain of 0.1%. The Nasdaq composite fell 0.4%. FedEx sank after its profit and revenue for the latest quarter fell short of expectations. Nike rose after naming a new CEO. Treasury yields held steady in the bond market. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below. NEW YORK (AP) — A record-setting week for Wall Street is closing on a quieter note Friday, and U.S. stocks are pulling back from their highs hit during a worldwide rally the day before. The S&amp;P 500 was down 0.5% in late trading, though it's still on track for a fifth winning week in the last six. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shaved 71 points, or 0.2%, off its all-time high, which it likewise set the day before. The Nasdaq composite was 0.6% lower, as of 2:45 p.m. Eastern time. FedEx dragged on the market with a drop of 13.9% after its profit and revenue for the latest quarter fell short of analysts’ expectations. It said U.S. customers sent fewer packages through priority services, while it had to contend with higher wages for workers and other costs. FedEx also cut its forecast for revenue growth for its fiscal year. Helping to limit the market's losses was Nike, which ran 5.7% higher after it named Elliott Hill as its chief executive. Hill, 60, had spent more than three decades at Nike in various leadership positions before retiring in 2020. Constellation Energy also leaped 21.5% after announcing it will restart the Three Mile Island nuclear plant and sell the power to Microsoft. Shares in Trump Media and Technology Group fell 5.5% as its biggest shareholder, former President Donald Trump, won the freedom to sell his shares if he wants. Trump owns more than half of the $2.8 billion company behind the Truth Social platform. But Trump and other insiders in the company had been unable to cash in because a 'lock-up agreement' prevented them from selling any of their shares. Before the lockup expired, Trump said he was in no rush to sell. TMTG stock has dropped below $14 from more than $60 in March, and its decline Friday was actually fairly typical in size. Over the last six months, it’s often swung by at least 5% in a day, up or down. Homebuilder Lennar fell 4.8% after delivering a mixed earnings report. Its profit for the latest quarter topped expectations. But it also said it made less in profit on each $100 of home sales, and it expects that margin to stay flat in the current quarter. Conditions may be set to improve for homebuilders, though. The Federal Reserve earlier this week cut its main interest rate for the first time in more than four years, with more likely to come. That could make mortgages more affordable for home buyers. The cut closed the door on a run where the Fed kept its main interest rate at a two-decade high in hopes of slowing the U.S. economy enough to stamp out high inflation. Now that inflation has fallen from its peak two summers ago, Chair Jerome Powell said the Fed can focus more on keeping the job market solid and the economy out of a recession. The Fed is still under pressure because hiring has begun to slow under the weight of higher interest rates. Some critics say the central bank waited too long to cut rates and may have damaged the economy. Critics also say the U.S. stock market may be running too hot on the belief the Federal Reserve will pull off what earlier seemed nearly impossible: getting inflation down to 2% without creating a recession. Barry Bannister, chief equity strategist at Stifel, is still calling for a sharp drop for the S&amp;P 500 by the end of the year. He points to how much faster stock prices have climbed than profits at companies. When stocks have looked this expensive on such measures in the past, he said a recession and sharp downturn for stocks has followed. He also warned in a report that slowing hiring 'is now symbolic of recession risk.' No economic releases were on the calendar for Friday to show where the economy may be heading. Next week will have preliminary reports on U.S. business activity, the final revision for how quickly the economy grew during the spring and the latest update on spending by U.S. consumers. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury held steady at 3.72%, where it late Thursday. In stock markets abroad, indexes slumped across much of Europe after rising in Asia. Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 rose 1.5% after the Bank of Japan left interest rates steady, as was expected. In China, the central bank left key lending rates unchanged on Friday. Indexes rose by 1.4% in Hong Kong and less than 0.1% in Shanghai. __ AP Writers Matt Ott and Zimo Zhong contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-rates-fed-japan-acfb636ed8e0e341a1e93b1567ff0358	2024-09-19T19:24:09-07:00	
Protests ousted Sri Lanka's last president. Ahead of new election, many are still waiting for change	COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) — Two years ago, tens of thousands of Sri Lankans rose up against their president and forced him to flee the country. As the country prepares for its first election since then, many say they’re still waiting for change. As Sri Lanka sank into economic collapse in 2022, people from various walks of life rallied to change a long-entrenched government they saw as responsible. The unprecedented island-wide public uprising they led was a moment of hope for the country long been fatigued by war and economic instability. Days ahead of Saturday’s presidential election, many still complain of corrupt leaders, economic mismanagement, and the entrenched power of the political old guard, but former protesters are having a hard time coming together behind a candidate. They agree on one thing: Sri Lanka needs a new political system that can take it out of economic and political turbulence. Days after Rajapaksa fled the country, Sri Lanka’s parliament replaced him with then-prime minister Ranil Wickremensignhe in a vote that many protesters saw as a victory for the status quo. Many Sri Lankans say the current government is largely made up of the same politicians who have ruled the island nation for decades through a devastating civil war that ended in 2009 to the economic crisis that began during the coronavirus pandemic. Even though he was later jailed for seven days on charges of violence that saw Sri Lankan dissidents ransacking the presidential palace, 42-year-old physician Pathum Kerner said the protests achieved one goal: bringing in a new leader who could address the country’s economic woes. The worst of the economic crisis is over, he says, but there’s still a long road ahead. 'We wanted to create a new party, a new political culture, and emerging leaders, but we could not do that,' said Kerner, who joined the protests in their first days and helped to start the 'Go Home, Gota' slogan that became a rallying cry for Rajapaksa’s foes. Wickremensignhe has made progress steadying Sri Lanka’s economy, but discontent remains strong as he’s introduced economic policies that have raised the cost of living, like tax cuts and a debt restructuring program. Meanwhile, many of the protest movement’s political demands remain unmet, from accountability from his predecessors for the economic crisis, to curtailment of president’s powers and a democratic replacement. Ajantha Perera, an academic and scientist who was part of the protests, said she hoped at first that Wickremeisnghe would work with the protesters to find solutions to the crisis. Instead, she said, the new president went after civil society leaders who were instrumental in the citizens’ movement, delayed local elections citing lack of funds, and protected the powerful Rajapaksa clan that had ruled Sri Lanka for more than 12 years. 'All of a sudden he turned into something totally different. He was trying to please the Rajapaksas who left,' Perera said. Like many former protesters, she wants Sri Lanka to strip its presidency of most of its powers, moving them to a more powerful parliament and prime minister. 'Executive presidency is a white elephant for Sri Lanka,' she said, saying that any new president could use it to tighten their grip over the country. 'We can’t afford it. We don’t need it.' The former protesters are finding that they don’t always agree the course their country should take, spurring divisions between one-time allies. Wickremensignhe’s main challengers — opposition leader Sajith Premadasa and parliamentarian Anura Dissanayake, a surprise top contender who heads a new leftist coalition — have promised major political changes, including renegotiating a deal with the International Monetary Fund to win more favorable terms. Dissanayake has even promised to nationalize the country’s resources to spur growth. Those promises worry Kerner, who says he’s eager to hold the government to its promises but doesn’t trust leftists with the economy. 'Bringing in a leftist to this crisis,' Kerner said, 'is like leaving laxatives to a patient who’s dying from dehydration.' Human rights lawyer Swasthika Arulingam says that the emerging political splits among former protesters are a sign of healthier democracy. Arulingam, who offered legal aid to protesters during the uprising, says Sri Lankans have become 'politically conscious' after decades of voting on ethnic lines. 'This was the moment when the political status quo broke and people came out to the streets and demanded for systemic change. So definitely there’s a shift in politics in terms of the younger generation,' Arulingam said. 'Political parties and candidates can no longer come and say whatever they want. People are asking questions now.' The 37-year-old, a member of the minority Tamil community that bore the brunt of the civil war — is helping run a campaign for a candidate from the newly minted People’s Struggle Alliance. It’s another leftist political movement that is vying for a place in Sri Lanka’s political landscape. On a recent afternoon in Homagama, a town which is about 24 kilometers (15 miles) south-east of Colombo, Arulingam spoke in front a small crowd of supporters and urged them to vote for change. Arulingam admits her party won’t win this election, but she says it won’t hesitate to hit the streets again if the country’s politicians don’t meet demands for change. 'We are gearing up for a political fight, and we are preparing the ground,' she said. —— Associated Press writers Krishan Francis and Bharatha Mallawarachi contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/sri-lanka-election-economy-wickremesinghe-imf-protests-e197eaf330758f2f35ece447a3f2739c	2024-09-19T19:18:14-07:00	
Youth activists protest to demand action on climate as big events open in NYC	NEW YORK (AP) — Activists geared up Friday for protests around the world to demand action on climate change just as a pair of major weeklong climate events were getting underway in New York City. The actions in Berlin, Brussels, Rio de Janeiro, New Delhi and many other cities were being organized by the youth-led group Fridays for Future, and included the group's New York chapter, which planned a march across the Brooklyn Bridge followed by a rally that organizers hoped would attract at least 1,000 people. More protests were planned Saturday and Sunday. New York is hosting Climate Week NYC, an annual event that promotes climate action, at the same time the U.N. General Assembly takes up the issue on several fronts, including raising trillions of dollars to aid poorer countries suffering the most from climate change. In Berlin, dozens of people took to the streets although in fewer numbers than in previous years. Activists held up signs saying 'Save the Climate' and 'Coal is Over!' as they watched a gig put on outside the German Chancellor's Office. Protesters in London held up letters spelling out 'Pay up,' calling for the country to pay more to adapt to climate change and transition away from fossil fuels. The New York protest wants to take aim at 'the pillars of fossil fuels' — companies that pollute, banks that fund them, and leaders who are failing on climate, said Helen Mancini, an organizer and a senior at the city's Stuyvesant High School. Youth climate protests started in August 2018 when Greta Thunberg, then an unknown 15-year-old, left school to stage a sit-down strike outside of the Swedish parliament to demand climate action and end fossil fuel use. In the six years since Thunberg founded what became Fridays for Future, global carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels has increased by about 2.15%, according to Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists who monitor carbon pollution. The growth of emissions has slowed compared to previous decades and experts anticipate peaking soon, which is a far cry from the 43% reduction needed to keep temperature increases to an agreed-upon limit. Since 2019, carbon dioxide emissions from coal have increased by nearly 1 billion tons (900 million metric tons), while natural gas emissions have increased slightly and oil pollution has dropped a tiny amount, according to the International Energy Agency. That growth has been driven by China, India and developing nations. But emissions from advanced or industrialized economies have been falling and in 2023 were the lowest in more than 50 years, according to the IEA. Coal emissions in rich countries are down to levels seen around the year 1900 and the United Kingdom next month is set to shutter its last coal plant. In the past five years, clean energy sources have grown twice as fast as fossil fuels, with both solar and wind individually growing faster than fossil fuel-based electricity, according to the IEA. Since Thunberg started her protest six years ago, Earth has warmed more than half a degree Fahrenheit (0.29 degrees Celsius) with last year setting a record for the hottest year and this year poised to break that mark, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the European climate agency Copernicus. ___ Associated Press journalist David Keyton in Berlin contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Passenger on a previous Titan sub dive says his mission was aborted due to apparent malfunction	A paid passenger on an expedition to the Titanic with the company that owned the Titan submersible testified before a U.S. Coast Guard investigatory panel Friday that the mission he took part in was aborted due to apparently mechanical failure. The Titan submersible imploded last year while on another trip to the Titanic wreckage site. A Coast Guard investigatory panel has listened to four days of testimony that raised questions about the company’s operations before the doomed mission. Fred Hagen was first to testify Friday and was identified as a 'mission specialist,' which he and other witnesses have characterized as people who paid a fee to play a role in OceanGate’s underwater exploration. He said his 2021 mission to the Titanic was aborted underwater when the Titan began malfunctioning and it was clear they weren't going to reach the fabled wreck site. 'We realized that all it could do was spin around in circles, making right turns,' Hagen said. 'At this juncture, we obviously weren't going to be able to navigate to the Titanic.' Hagen said the Titan resurfaced and the mission scrapped. He said he was aware of the potentially unsafe nature of getting in the experimental submersible. 'Anyone that wanted to go was either delusional if they didn't think that it was dangerous, or they were embracing the risk,' he said. OceanGate co-founder Stockton Rush was among five people who died when the submersible imploded en route to the site of the Titanic wreck in June 2023. Earlier this month, the Coast Guard opened a public hearing that is part of a high-level investigation into the cause of the implosion. The public hearing began Sept. 16 and some of the testimony has focused on problems the Washington state company had prior to the fatal 2023 dive. During Thursday's testimony, company scientific director Steven Ross told the investigators the sub experienced a malfunction just days before the Titanic dive. Earlier in the week, former OceanGate operations director David Lochridge said he frequently clashed with Rush and felt the company was committed only to making money. 'The whole idea behind the company was to make money,' Lochridge testified. 'There was very little in the way of science.' Other witnesses scheduled for Friday include engineer Dave Dyer of the University of Washington Applied Physics Lab and Patrick Lahey of Triton Submarines. The hearing is expected to resume next week and run through Sept. 27. Lochridge and other witnesses have painted a picture of a company led by people who were impatient to get the unconventionally designed craft into the water. Lochridge said he filed a complaint with the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration about the company. OSHA 'promptly referred his safety allegations regarding the Titan submersible to the Coast Guard,' a spokesperson for the agency said Thursday. The deadly accident set off a worldwide debate about the future of private undersea exploration. Coast Guard officials noted at the start of the hearing that the submersible had not been independently reviewed, as is standard practice. That and Titan’s unusual design subjected it to scrutiny in the undersea exploration community. But Renata Rojas, a mission specialist for the company, told the Coast Guard the firm was staffed by competent people who wanted to 'make dreams come true.' Rojas’ testimony struck a different tone than some of the earlier witnesses. 'I was learning a lot and working with amazing people,' Rojas said. 'Some of those people are very hardworking individuals that were just trying to make dreams come true.' OceanGate suspended its operations after the implosion. The company has no full-time employees currently, but has been represented by an attorney during the hearing. During the submersible’s final dive on June 18, 2023, the crew lost contact after an exchange of texts about the Titan’s depth and weight as it descended. The support ship Polar Prince then sent repeated messages asking if the Titan could still see the ship on its onboard display. One of the last messages from Titan’s crew to Polar Prince before the submersible imploded stated, 'all good here,' according to a visual recreation presented earlier in the hearing. When the submersible was reported missing, rescuers rushed ships, planes and other equipment to an area about 435 miles (700 kilometers) south of St. John’s, Newfoundland. Four days later, wreckage of the Titan was found on the ocean floor about 330 yards (300 meters) off the bow of the Titanic, Coast Guard officials said. No one on board survived. OceanGate said it has been fully cooperating with the Coast Guard and NTSB investigations since they began. The Titan had been making voyages to the Titanic wreckage site going back to 2021.	https://apnews.com/article/titan-tourist-sub-titanic-ce07039ec4abf4e83ba38bf13a40829f	2024-09-19T19:06:15-07:00	
It's been a decade since 43 students disappeared in Mexico. Their parents still fight for answers	TIXTLA, México (AP) — Clemente Rodríguez has been documenting the long search for his missing son with tattoos. First, it was an ink drawing of a turtle — a symbol of 19-year-old Christian Rodríguez's school — with a smaller turtle on its shell. Then, an image of Mexico's patron saint, the Virgin of Guadalupe, accompanied by the number 43. Later, a tiger for strength and a dove for hope. 'How else is my son going to know that I have been looking for him?' asked Rodríguez. To the heartbroken father, the body art is evidence that he never stopped searching — proof he could perhaps one day show to his boy. On Sept. 26, 2014, Christian Rodríguez, a tall boy who loved to folk dance and had just enrolled in a teachers college in the southern state of Guerrero, disappeared along with 42 classmates. Every year since, on the 26th of each month, Clemente Rodríguez, his wife, Luz María Telumbre, and other families meet at the Rural Normal School at Ayotzinapa and take a long bus ride to the capital, Mexico City, to demand answers. They will do so again next week, on the 10th anniversary of their sons’ disappearance. 'It is hard, very hard,' Clemente Rodríguez said. There are many questions and few answers Rodríguez and the other parents are not alone. The 43 students are among more than 115,000 people still reported as missing in Mexico, a reflection of numerous unresolved crimes in a country where human rights activists say violence, corruption and impunity have long been the norm. Over the years, authorities have offered different explanations. The previous administration of President Enrique Peña Nieto said that the students were attacked by security forces linked to a local drug cartel, and that the bodies were then turned over to organized crime figures, who burned their bodies in a dump and threw their ashes in a river. A bone fragment of one of the students was later found in the river. President Andrés Manuel López Obrador's administration confirmed the source of the attack. But the current justice department — along with the Interamerican Commission on Human Rights and a Truth Commission formed specifically to investigate the students’ disappearance — refuted the story about the incineration of the bodies in a dump. They accused top former officials of planting the bone fragment in the river to suit their narrative. They also unearthed clues in a different location, including bone fragments from one of Christian's feet. But the families still don't have any solid answers about what happened to the students. For his part, Clemente Rodríguez is far from convinced that his son is dead. Parents launch a desperate search for their children Not long after the students disappeared, parents took matters into their own hands, charging into remote, often gang-controlled mountain towns to search for their children. They encountered others who had been displaced by violence. Fear was everywhere. 'When I left the house, I never knew if I would come back alive,' Rodríguez said. During the search, Christina Bautista, the 49-year-old mother of missing student Benjamin Ascencio, says strangers told her they'd been searching for a son for three years or a daughter for five. She had thought it would be a matter of weeks. 'I couldn’t take it, I took off running,' she said. 'How could there be so many disappeared?' Dozens of bodies were found, but not those of their children. A decade of fighting has upended lives A decade of fighting to keep the case alive has turned the parents’ lives inside out. Before his son’s disappearance, Rodríguez sold jugs of water from the back of his pickup and tended a small menagerie of animals in the town of Tixtla, not far from the school. Telumbre sold handmade tortillas cooked over a wood fire. When the students vanished, however, they dropped everything. Parents sold or abandoned their animals, left fields untended and entrusted grandparents with the care of other children. Rodríguez, 56, has since managed to partially reassemble his clutch of livestock and has planted some corn on the family's plot of land. The family's main income, however, comes from homemade crafts sold on trips to Mexico City: mats woven from reeds; bottles of an uncle's locally brewed mezcal decorated with twine and colorful tiger faces; and cloth napkins embroidered by Telumbre. Sometimes the stocky, soft-spoken Rodríguez visits his land to think or to release his anger and sadness. 'I start to cry, let it all go,' he said. Parents find support and respect at Ayotzinapa Parents also find solace at the Rural Normal School at Ayotzinapa. The school, which trains students to teach in poor remote villages, is part of a network of rural educational facilities with a long history of radical activism. School walls painted with slogans demanding justice for the missing students also display murals honoring Che Guevara and Karl Marx. For the poorest families, Ayotzinapa offers a way out: Students receive free room, board and an education. In exchange, they work. The atmosphere has militaristic undertones: New students’ heads are shaved and the first year is about discipline and survival. They are tasked with tending cattle, planting fields and commandeering buses to drive to protests in the capital. The students who disappeared in 2014 were abducted from five buses they had taken over in the city of Iguala, 120 kilometers (75 miles) north of the school. Parents arrived at Ayotzinapa little by little from villages deep in the mountains. They gathered on the school’s basketball court, a concrete pad under a pavilion where 43 chairs still hold photos of each of the missing students. In the years since, a certain codependency has developed. The school's fight for justice is fueled by the parents' grief and anger. The school's students, meanwhile, 'are our strong arm,' Bautista says. 'Here is where the movement started.' Students treat the parents respectfully and affectionately, greeting them as 'aunt' or 'uncle' as they pass through the guarded gates. Another meeting ends in disappointment and anger In late August, Rodríguez and other parents met for the last time with López Obrador, who leaves office at the end of this month. The exchange was a grave disappointment. 'Right now, this administration is just like that of Enrique Peña Nieto,' Rodríguez said. 'He’s tried to mock us' by hiding information, protecting the Army and insulting the families' lawyers, he said. López Obrador continues to insist that his government has done its best to find answers. He cites dozens of arrests, including that of a former attorney general charged with obstructing justice. He has downplayed the role of the military, however. Years ago, López Obrador declared the students’ abduction a 'state crime,' pointing to the involvement of local, state and federal authorities, including the Army. The families met in July with López Obrador’s successor, Claudia Sheinbaum, who will take office Oct. 1, but she made no promises or commitments. After the August meeting, Rodríguez posed for a portrait in the National Palace, his gaze firm and his fist raised. Like other parents, he vows to keep fighting. 'During these 10 years, we have learned a lot about obfuscation ... lies,' Rodríguez said. Top military and government authorities 'have the answers,' he added. 'They can reveal them.'	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-missing-students-teachers-college-10th-anniversary-e2bf00122e95ac7e38e8391af47ec3e8	2024-09-19T19:04:43-07:00	
Israeli soldiers pushed three apparently lifeless bodies from roofs during a West Bank raid	QABATIYA, West Bank (AP) — Israeli soldiers pushed three apparently lifeless bodies from rooftops during a raid in the northern part of the occupied West Bank on Thursday, according to an Associated Press journalist at the scene and video obtained by AP. An AP journalist in the town of Qabatiya witnessed three soldiers push the bodies off the roofs of adjacent multi-story buildings, sending them falling out of view. It was the latest in a series of suspected violations by Israeli forces since the start of the Israel-Hamas war that rights groups say show a pattern of excessive force toward Palestinians. 'This is a serious incident that does not coincide with IDF values ​​and the expectations from IDF soldiers,' the military said in a statement, using the acronym it goes by. 'The incident is under review.' Israel said its troops had killed four militants during operations in Qabatiya on Thursday. The Palestinian Health Ministry in Ramallah did not immediately confirm multiple deaths, but said one person had been killed in the town and that Israeli gunfire sent 10 Palestinians to the hospital. In the video obtained by AP, three soldiers can be seen picking up what appears to be a stiff body and then dragging it toward the edge of a roof as troops stand on the ground below. The soldiers on the roof peer over the edge before heaving the body off. On an adjacent rooftop, the soldiers hold another apparently lifeless body by its limbs and swing it over the edge. In a third instance, a soldier kicks a body toward the edge before it falls from view. Photos captured by AP during Thursday’s raid show an Israeli army bulldozer moving near the buildings where the bodies were dropped. Other journalists at the scene also witnessed the bodies being pushed off the roofs. The identities of the dead and the cause of their deaths were not immediately known. When withdrawing from raids, the army usually leaves behind any Palestinians killed by Israeli gunfire. Occasionally the army brings dead bodies into Israel. Under international law, soldiers are supposed to ensure dead bodies, including those of enemy combatants, are treated decently. 'There is no military need to do this. It’s just a savage way of treating Palestinian bodies,' said Shawan Jabarin, the director of Palestinian rights group Al-Haq, after watching the footage. Jabarin said the video was shocking but not surprising, and he was doubtful Israel would properly investigate the incident. The Israeli military rarely prosecutes soldiers in cases of reported harm to Palestinians, rights groups say. 'The most that will happen is that soldiers will be disciplined, but there will be no real investigation and no real prosecution,' said Jabarin. The AP reporter who witnessed the raid saw a blindfolded and shirtless Palestinian man kneeling before an Israeli army jeep and armed soldiers. Smoke billowed from several buildings that appeared damaged. As the world’s attention focuses on the far more deadly war in Gaza less than 80 miles away, scores of Palestinians have been killed, shot and arrested in the West Bank, where the Israeli military has waged a monthslong crackdown. Over 700 Palestinians in the West Bank have been killed by Israeli fire since the war erupted on Oct. 7, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. The northern West Bank has seen some of the worst violence since the war’s outbreak. Israel says the raids are necessary to stamp out militancy, which has flared since Oct. 7. In that time, Palestinian gunmen have attacked Israelis at checkpoints and staged several attacks within Israel. Earlier this month, Israel staged its deadliest raid into the northern West Bank since the war began, killing at least 33 people. ___ Frankel reported from Jerusalem. AP reporter Jack Jeffery contributed reporting from Ramallah, West Bank.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-soldiers-qabatiya-west-bank-ae65d70f7da5db4603ba1b7c77f2ccd3	2024-09-19T13:43:48-07:00	
US agency review says Nevada lithium mine can co-exist with endangered flower	RENO, Nev. (AP) — U.S. land managers said Thursday they've completed a final environmental review of a proposed Nevada lithium mine that would supply minerals critical to electric vehicles and a clean energy future while still protecting an endangered wildflower. 'This environmental analysis is the product of the hard work of experts from multiple agencies to ensure that we protect species as we provide critical minerals to the nation,' Bureau of Land Management Director Tracy Stone-Manning said in a statement Thursday. The agency's final environmental impact statement is subject to a 30-day comment period. It's likely to face legal challenges from environmentalists who say it clearly violates the Endangered Species Act and will cause the desert flower Tiehm's buckwheat to go extinct at the only place it exists in the world near the California line halfway between Reno and Las Vegas. The Australian mining company pushing the project said completion of the review is a 'significant milestone' in a six-year-long effort to build the Rhyolite Ridge mine. It anticipates production to begin as early as 2028 of the element key to manufacturing batteries for electric vehicles. 'Today's issuance not only advances the Rhyolite Ridge project but brings the United States closer to a more secure and sustainable source of domestic critical minerals,' said Bernard Rowe, managing director of Ioneer Ltd. Opponents of the project say it’s the latest example of President Joe Biden's administration running roughshod over U.S. protections for native wildlife, rare species and sacred tribal lands in the name of slowing climate change by reducing reliance on fossil fuels and cutting greenhouse gas emissions. The Fish and Wildlife Service added the 6-inch-tall (15-centimeter-tall) wildflower with yellow and cream-colored blooms to the list of U.S. endangered species on Dec. 14, 2022, citing mining as the biggest threat to its survival. The bureau said Thursday the mine could potentially produce enough lithium to supply nearly 370,000 electric vehicles a year. By 2030, worldwide demand for lithium is projected to have grown six times compared to 2020. 'The Rhyolite Ridge project represents what we can do when we work together — with industry, states, tribes and stakeholders — to ensure the swift consideration and adaptation of projects to fulfill our energy needs while respecting cultural and ecologically sensitive areas,' said Laura Daniel-Davis, acting deputy secretary of the bureau's parent Interior Department. The bureau said in announcing its completion of the review that details of the final EIS would be published Friday in the Federal Register. The Center for Biological Diversity has been fighting the mine since its inception and has vowed to do whatever it takes to block it. Patrick Donnelly, the center’s Great Basin director, said Thursday that despite the administration's assurances the flower would be protected, the mining plan has changed little from an earlier draft and would still destroy much of the plant's critical habitat. 'It’s an outrage that the BLM and Fish and Wildlife Service capitulated to the demands of a mining company whose plans clearly run afoul of the Endangered Species Act,' he said. 'These agencies are entrusted with preserving our biodiversity for future generations, and instead they’re turning this flower’s only known habitat into an industrial site, condemning it to extinction,' he said. The bureau insisted Ioneer had adjusted its latest blueprint to minimize destruction of habitat for the plant, which grows in eight sub-populations that combined cover approximately 10 acres (4 hectares) — an area equal to the size of about eight football fields. 'We are eager to get to work in contributing to the domestic supply of critical materials essential for the transition to a clean energy future,' Ioneer Executive Chairman James Calaway said Thursday. In addition to scaling back encroachment on the plant, Ioneer's strategy includes a controversial propagation plan to grow and transplant flowers nearby — something conservationists say won’t work. Nevada is home to the only existing lithium mine in the U.S. and another is currently under construction near the Oregon line 220 miles (354 kilometers) north of Reno. That Lithium Americas mine at Thacker Pass survived numerous legal challenges from environmentalists and Native American tribes who said it would destroy lands they considered sacred where their ancestors were massacred by U.S. troops in 1865.	https://apnews.com/article/lithium-endangered-wildflower-nevada-california-clean-energy-3c98e60655f61e30715bbf79bf9b0419	2024-09-19T12:38:20-07:00	
Here's a look at the US military presence in the Middle East	WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. has increased its military presence in the Middle East by several thousand troops, sending an array of fighter jets and other aircraft to bolster the protection of U.S. forces and allies. The decision brings the total number of American troops in the region to as many as 43,000, including more than a dozen warships. Israel's latest surge in attacks in Lebanon, including strikes that have killed Iran-backed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallahand several of his top commanders and officials, is a significant escalation that has fueled fears of all-out war in the Middle East. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has increased the readiness levels of additional U.S. forces so they are prepared to deploy for any contingency, Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said. Austin and other leaders 'remain focused on the protection of U.S. citizens and forces in the region, the defense of Israel and the deescalation of the situation through deterrence and diplomacy,' said Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary. Here’s a look at the U.S. military presence in the Middle East: Troops Normally, about 34,000 U.S. forces are deployed to U.S. Central Command, which covers the entire Middle East. That number grew in the early months of the Israel-Hamas war to about 40,000 as additional ships and aircraft were sent in. It spiked to nearly 50,000 when Austin ordered two aircraft carriers and their accompanying warships to stay in the region as tensions roiled between Israel and Lebanon. One carrier strike group has since left and moved into the Asia-Pacific. But the decision to send more aircraft is moving the troop total to roughly 43,000. The Pentagon recently said it was sending a small number of additional troops to the Middle East. Officials have not provided details about the deployment to Cyprus but have suggested the teams are part of ongoing preparations for any needs in the region, including the possibility of an evacuation of Americans from Lebanon. The beefed-up presence is designed both to help defend Israel and protect U.S. and allied personnel and assets. U.S. officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details of troop deployments. Navy warships are scattered across the region, from the eastern Mediterranean Sea to the Gulf of Oman, and both Air Force and Navy fighter jets are strategically based at several locations to be better prepared to respond to any attacks. Warships The U.S. has one aircraft carrier in the region, the USS Abraham Lincoln, which had been slated to leave around mid-October. Austin has extended its deployment for about another month, according to one of the officials. Austin has done the same to a few other carriers and warships in the region several times in the past year so that there has been the rare presence of two carriers at once. A second carrier, the USS Harry S. Truman, along with two destroyers and a cruiser, are in the Atlantic Ocean heading east. They will be in the European region in a few days and then travel into the Mediterranean Sea. American military commanders have long argued that the presence of a formidable aircraft carrier — with its array of fighter jets and surveillance aircraft and sophisticated missiles — is a strong deterrent against Iran. The Lincoln and one destroyer are in the Gulf of Oman, while four U.S. Navy destroyers and a littoral combat ship are in the Red Sea. The USS Georgia guided missile submarine, which Austin ordered to the region last month, had been in the Red Sea and remains in U.S. Central Command, but officials decline to say where. There are six U.S. warships in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. They are the USS Wasp amphibious assault ship with the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit aboard and two accompanying vessels and three Navy destroyers. The Wasp would be prepared to assist in any evacuation. About a half dozen of the F/A-18 fighter jets from the USS Abraham Lincoln have been moved to a land base in the region. Officials declined to say where. Aircraft The Air Force sent in an additional squadron of advanced F-22 fighter jets in August, bringing the total number of land-based fighter squadrons in the Middle East to four. That force also includes a squadron of A-10 Thunderbolt II ground attack aircraft, F-15E Strike Eagles and F-16 fighter jets. The Air Force is not identifying what countries the planes are operating from. The U.S. was now sending in more aircraft, Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said. The additional personnel includes squadrons of F-15E, F-16 and F-22 fighter jets and A-10 attack aircraft, and the personnel needed to support them. The jets were supposed to rotate in and replace the squadrons already there. Instead, both the existing and new squadrons will remain in place to double the airpower on hand. The squadrons would not be used in any evacuation of American citizens but would be used to defend U.S. forces and Israel if necessary, Singh said. The addition of the F-22 fighter jets gives U.S. forces a hard-to-detect aircraft that has a sophisticated suite of sensors to suppress enemy air defenses and carry out electronic attacks. The F-22 also can act as a 'quarterback,' organizing other warplanes in an operation. But the U.S. also showed in February that it doesn’t have to have planes based in the Middle East to attack targets. In February, a pair of B-1 bombers took off from Dyess Air Force Base in Texas and flew more than 30 hours in a roundtrip mission in which they struck 85 Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force targets in Iraq and Syria in response to an attack by IRGC-backed militias that killed three U.S. service members.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-us-military-ships-aircraft-3ef96cbdf87238de559e84e28573f611	2024-09-19T11:25:51-07:00	
Mexican president blames the US for bloodshed in Sinaloa as cartel violence surges	CULIACAN, Mexico (AP) — Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador blamed the United States in part on Thursday for the surge in cartel violence terrorizing the northern state of Sinaloa which has left at least 30 people dead in the past week. Two warring factions of the Sinaloa cartel have clashed in the state capital of Culiacan in what appears to be a fight for power since two of its leaders were arrested in the United States in late July. Teams of gunmen have shot at each other and the security forces. Meanwhile, dead bodies continued to pop up around the city. On one busy street corner, cars drove by pools of the blood leading to a body in a car mechanic shop, while heavily armed police in black masks loaded up another body stretched out on a side street of the Sinaloan city. Asked at his morning briefing if the U.S. government was 'jointly responsible' for this violence in Sinaloa, the president said, 'Yes, of course ... for having carried out this operation.' The recent surge in cartel warfare had been expected after Joaquín Guzmán López, a son of former Sinaloa cartel leader Joaquín 'El Chapo' Guzmán, landed near El Paso, Texas on July 25 in a small plane with Ismael 'El Mayo' Zambada. Zambada was the cartel’s elder figure and reclusive leader. After his arrest, he said in a letter circulated by his lawyer that he had been abducted by the younger Guzmán and taken to the U.S. against his will. On Thursday afternoon, another military operation covered the north of Culiacan with military and circling helicopters. Traffic was heavy in Culiacan and most schools were open, even though parents were still not sending their children to classes. Businesses continue to close early and few people venture out after dark. While the city has slowly reopened and soldiers patrol the streets, many families continue to hide away, with parents and teachers fearing they'll be caught in the crossfire. 'Where is the security for our children, for ourselves too, for all citizens? It’s so dangerous here, you don’t want to go outside,' one Culiacan mother told the Associated Press. The mother, who didn't want to share her name out of fear of the cartels, said that while some schools have recently reopened, she hasn't allowed her daughter to go for two weeks. She said she was scared to do so after armed men stopped a taxi they were traveling in on their way home, terrifying her child. During his morning press briefing, López Obrador had claimed American authorities 'carried out that operation' to capture Zambada and that 'it was totally illegal, and agents from the Department of Justice were waiting for Mr. Mayo.' 'If we are now facing instability and clashes in Sinaloa, it is because they (the American government) made that decision,' he said. He added that there 'cannot be a cooperative relationship if they take unilateral decisions' like this. Mexican prosecutors have said they were considering bringing treason charges against those involved in the plan to nab Zambada. He was echoed by President-elect Claudia Sheinbaum, who said later in the day that 'we can never accept that there is no communication or collaboration.' It's the latest escalation of tensions in the U.S.-Mexico relationship. Last month, the Mexican president said he was putting relations with the U.S. and Canadian embassies 'on pause' after ambassadors criticized his controversial plan to overhaul Mexico's judiciary by requiring all judges to stand for election. Still, the Zambada capture has fueled criticisms of López Obrador, who has throughout his administration refused to confront cartels in a strategy he refers to as 'hugs not bullets.' On previous occasions, he falsely stated that cartels respect Mexican citizens and largely fight amongst themselves. While the president, who is set to leave office at the end of the month, has promised his plan would reduce cartel violence, such clashes continue to plague Mexico. Cartels employ an increasing array of tactics, including roadside bombs or IEDs, trenches, home-made armored vehicles and bomb-dropping drones. Last week, López Obrador publicly asked Sinaloa's warring factions to act 'responsibly' and noted that he believed the cartels would listen to him. But the bloodshed has only continued.	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-sinaloa-cartel-violence-culiacan-lopez-obrador-671dd018e57d9bea1e3f8b58c866939b	2024-09-19T10:57:30-07:00	
Zelenskyy to meet Biden, Harris as Ukraine pushes US to loosen restrictions on long-range weapons	WASHINGTON (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will travel to Washington next Thursday for talks with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris as he presses for the U.S. to allow Ukraine to use Western-provided weapons to strike deeper into Russia. 'I’m looking forward to hosting my friend President Zelenskyy of Ukraine next week at the White House,' Biden said in message posted on X. 'During his visit, I’ll reaffirm America’s commitment to supporting Ukraine as it defends its freedom and independence.' The Biden administration still is not convinced that it should give Ukraine the authority to launch long-range missiles deeper into Russia, and U.S. officials say they are seeking more detailed information about how Kyiv would use the weapons and how they fit into the broader strategy for the war. U.S. officials said they have asked Ukraine to spell out more clearly its combat objectives should the administration green light loosening restrictions on long-range weaponry. Administration officials are concerned that loosening restrictions would have limited impact and come with great risk. Russian President Vladimir Putin last week warned that Russia would be 'at war' with the United States and its NATO allies if they allow Ukraine to use the long-range weapons. U.S. defense officials have repeatedly argued that the long-range missiles are limited in number and that Ukraine already is using its own long-range drones to hit targets farther into Russia. Zelenskyy is notably meeting separately with Harris, who is looking to succeed Biden. She last met with the Ukrainian president in July at an international gathering in Switzerland to discuss the war, shortly before Biden announced he was abandoning his bid for reelection and endorsed Harris. Former President Donald Trump has repeatedly said that he would move to quickly end the war should he win the November election. His running mate, Sen. JD Vance, said in a recent interview with the 'Shawn Ryan Show' that Trump's plan would include establishing a 'demilitarized zone,' and Ukraine would not reclaim territory that Russia occupies and would agree not to join NATO. ___ AP writer Lolita C.

A new genetic analysis of animals in the Wuhan market in 2019 may help find COVID-19's origin	LONDON (AP) — Scientists searching for the origins of COVID-19 have zeroed in on a short list of animals that possibly helped spread it to people, an effort they hope could allow them to trace the outbreak back to its source. Researchers analyzed genetic material gathered from the Chinese market where the first outbreak was detected and found that the most likely animals were racoon dogs, civet cats and bamboo rats. The scientists suspect infected animals were first brought to the Wuhan market in late November 2019, which then triggered the pandemic. Michael Worobey, one of the new study’s authors, said they found which sub-populations of animals might have transmitted the coronavirus to humans. That may help researchers pinpoint where the virus commonly circulates in animals, known as its natural reservoir. 'For example, with the racoon dogs, we can show that the racoon dogs that were (at the market) … were from a sub-species that circulates more in southern parts of China,' said Worobey, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona. Knowing that might help researchers understand where those animals came from and where they were sold. Scientists might then start sampling bats in the area, which are known to be the natural reservoirs of related coronaviruses like SARS. While the research bolsters the case that COVID-19 emerged from animals, it does not resolve the polarized and political debate over whether the virus instead emerged from a research lab in China. Mark Woolhouse, a professor of infectious diseases at the University of Edinburgh, said the new genetic analysis suggested that the pandemic 'had its evolutionary roots in the market' and that it was very unlikely COVID-19 was infecting people before it was identified at the Huanan market. 'It’s a significant finding and this does shift the dial more in favor of an animal origin,' Woolhouse, who was not connected to the research, said. 'But it is not conclusive.' An expert group led by the World Health Organization concluded in 2021 that the virus probably spread to humans from animals and that a lab leak was 'extremely unlikely.' WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus later said it was 'premature' to rule out a lab leak. An AP investigation in April found the search for the COVID origins in China has gone dark after political infighting and missed opportunities by local and global health officials to narrow the possibilities. Scientists say they may never know for sure where exactly the virus came from. In the new study, published Thursday in the journal Cell, scientists from Europe, the U.S. and Australia analyzed data previously released by experts at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. It included 800 samples of genetic material Chinese workers collected on Jan. 1, 2020 from the Huanan seafood market, the day after Wuhan municipal authorities first raised the alarm about an unknown respiratory virus. Chinese scientists published the genetic sequences they found last year, but did not identify any of the animals possibly infected with the coronavirus. In the new analysis, researchers used a technique that can identify specific organisms from any mixture of genetic material collected in the environment. Worobey said the information provides 'a snapshot of what was (at the market) before the pandemic began' and that genetic analyses like theirs 'helps to fill in the blanks of how the virus might have first started spreading.' Woolhouse said the new study, while significant, left some critical issues unanswered. 'There is no question COVID was circulating at that market, which was full of animals,' he said. 'The question that still remains is how it got there in the first place.' ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

A charred transformer on a Kyiv square makes for an unusual Ukraine war exhibit	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A charred transformer from one of Ukraine’s badly damaged power plants has come to a square in Kyiv's city center — a stark reminder of the scale of destruction caused by Russian strikes on the country's energy system. The massive blackened hulk juxtaposed with a Ferris wheel farther down Kontraktova Square — or Square of Contracts in honor of the place's mercantile past — also serves as a contrast between the peacetime that was and the harsh reality of war in Ukraine. The exhibition by private energy company DTEK, a nongovernmental organization and Ukraine’s Ministry of Energy opened on Thursday with a message urging people to feel 'the pain and despair over the destroyed equipment' that energy workers experience first hand. The organizers said that while they realize the transformer creates a somber atmosphere, their intention was not to 'get anyone down' but to raise awareness of how difficult it is to bring light back to the houses in Ukraine after every Russian attack. The exhibit is to stay in Kyiv for the next two months — by then, Ukraine will inch closer to what will likely be another winter of war. The government has warned residents to brace for their toughest winter yet since Russia's full-scale invasion began in February 2022 as airstrikes against the country’s beleaguered energy infrastructure intensify. Russia continues to hammer Ukraine’s energy generation capacity, leaving the country heavily reliant on its three functioning nuclear power stations and electricity imports from European Union countries. According to Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko, there have been over 1,000 attacks targeting the country’s power grid. 'There is no place, no region, no type of energy infrastructure that has not been affected by these attacks,' he said in a statement. Ukrainians, meanwhile, have to cope with frequent nationwide blackouts, enduring hours without electricity. The shortages have exacerbated war fatigue as there appears no end of the conflict in sight. Dmytro Tiuzin, a 37-year-old IT specialist who lives near Kontraktova Square, said he came to see the transformer in person on Thursday after seeing images of the installation on social media. 'I am worrying about it,' he said of the destruction of Ukraine's power system. 'I work remotely and I am very dependent on the electricity and internet.' In the months between March and August, Russia launched nine coordinated attacks against electricity infrastructure in Ukraine, destroying approximately 9 gigawatts of electricity generation capacity, according to a U.N. report on Thursday. The amount represents half of Ukraine’s energy needs during the winter months, the report by the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission said. 'This winter will be bad enough with people likely having to cope with scheduled blackouts across the country,' said Danielle Bell, head of the mission. 'Any additional attacks leading to prolonged electricity blackouts could have catastrophic consequences.' Rebuilding the damage caused may take years. The Kyiv School of Economics in an assessment published in May estimated that restoring the energy sector will require $50 billion. 'This project is not meant to ... make people feel depressed about how bad things are,' said Katya Taylor from the Port of Culture, an NGO that curated the exhibition. 'But rather, just to thank those people who are there for us,' she added. Serhii, a worker from the power plant where the transformer was brought from, said he had spent 32 years of his life working there. The name of the power plant and Serhii’s family name could not be disclosed under government regulations due to security concerns. 'Sometimes tears come to my eyes, seeing this,' he said. The destruction he witnessed also makes him angry and determined not to give up, 'no matter what.' ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-russia-war-blackouts-65299f8fefe9f9cb6bb5e2cff71c3c99	2024-09-19T07:21:58-07:00	
An iconic Churchill photo stolen in Canada and found in Italy is ready to return	ROME (AP) — Canadian and Italian dignitaries on Thursday marked the successful recovery of a photo portrait of Winston Churchill known as 'The Roaring Lion,' stolen in Canada and recovered in Italy after a two-year search by police. At a ceremony at the Canadian Embassy in Rome, Italian carabinieri police handed over the portrait to the Canadian ambassador to Italy, Elissa Goldberg, who praised the cooperation between Italian and Canadian investigators that led to the recovery. The 1941 portrait of the British leader taken by Ottawa photographer Yousuf Karsh is now ready for the last step of its journey home to the Fairmont Château Laurier, the hotel in Ottawa where it was stolen and will once again be displayed as a notable historic portrait. Canadian police said the portrait was stolen from the hotel sometime between Christmas 2021 and Jan. 6, 2022, and replaced with a forgery. The swap was only uncovered months later, in August, when a hotel worker noticed the frame was not hung properly and looked different than the others. Nicola Cassinelli, a lawyer in Genoa, Italy, purchased the portrait in May 2022 at an online Sotheby’s auction for 5,292 British pounds. He says he got a phone call from the auction house that October advising him not to sell or otherwise transfer the portrait due to an investigation into the Ottawa theft. Cassinelli, who attended Thursday’s ceremony, said he thought he was buying a regular print and quickly agreed to send the iconic Churchill photograph home when he learned its true story. 'I immediately decided to return it to the Chateau Laurier, because I think that if Karsh donated it to the hotel, it means he really wanted it to stay there, for the particular significance this hotel had for him, and for his wife too,' Cassinelli told The Associated Press. The famous image was taken by Karsh during Churchill’s wartime visit to the Canadian Parliament in December 1941. It helped launch Karsh’s career, who photographed some of the 20th century’s most famed icons, including Nelson Mandela, Albert Einstein and Queen Elizabeth. Karsh and his wife Estrellita gifted an original signed print to the Fairmont Chateau Laurier in 1998. The couple had lived and operated a studio inside the hotel for nearly two decades. Geneviève Dumas, general manager of the Fairmont Château Laurier, said on Thursday she felt immensely grateful. 'I would like to extend my deepest gratitude to everybody involved in solving this case, and ensuring the safe return of this priceless piece of history.' Police arrested a 43-year-old man from Powassan, Ontario, in April and have charged him with stealing and trafficking the portrait. The man, whose name is protected by a publication ban, faces charges that include forgery, theft over $5,000 and trafficking in property obtained by crime exceeding $5,000.	https://apnews.com/article/italy-stolen-photo-portrait-churchill-canada-hotel-police-search-10b124ce64984d967844d93e97961ab0	2024-09-19T06:58:14-07:00	
The Lebanon explosions raise a question: Deep into the smartphone era, who is still using pagers?	The small plastic box that beeped and flashed numbers was a lifeline to Laurie Dove in 1993. Pregnant with her first baby in a house beyond any town in rural Kansas, Dove used the little black device to keep in touch with her husband as he delivered medical supplies. He carried one too. They had a code. 'If I really needed something I would text ‘9-1-1.’ That meant anything from, ‘I’m going to labor right now’ to ‘I really need to get ahold of you,’' she recalls. 'It was our version of texting. I was as nervous as a long-tailed cat in a room full of rockers. It was important.' Beepers and all they symbolized — connection to each other or, in the 1980s, to drugs — went the way of answering machines decades ago when smartphones wiped them from popular culture. They resurfaced in tragic form Tuesday when thousands of sabotaged pagers exploded simultaneously in Lebanon, killing at least a dozen people and injuring thousands in a mysterious, multi-day attack as Israel declared a new phase of its war on Hezbollah. In many photos, blood marks the spot where pagers tend to be clipped — to a belt, in a pocket, near a hand — in graphic reminders of just how intimately people still hold those devices and the links — or vulnerability — they enable. Then as now — albeit in far smaller numbers — pagers are used precisely because they are old school. They run on batteries and radio waves, making them impervious to dead zones without WiFi, basements without cell service, hackings and catastrophic network collapses such as those during the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Some medical professionals and emergency workers prefer pagers to cell phones or use the devices in combination. They're handy for workers in remote locations, such as oil rigs and mines. Crowded restaurants use them, too, handing patrons blinking, hockey puck-like contraptions that vibrate when your table is ready. To those who distrust data collection, pagers are appealing because they have no way to track users. 'A mobile phone at the end of the day is like a computer that you’re carrying around, and a pager has got a fraction of that complexity,' said Bharat Mistry, the UK’s technical director for Trend Micro, a cybersecurity software company. 'Nowadays it’s used by people who want to maintain their privacy ... You don’t want to be tracked but you do want to be contactable.' Pagers were the first iteration of ‘always on’ From the start, people have been ambivalent about pagers and the irksome feeling of being summoned when it's convenient for someone else. Inventor Al Gross, regarded by some as the 'founding father' of wireless communication, patented the pager in 1949 intending to make it available to doctors. But they balked, he said, at the prospect of being on-call 24/7. 'The doctors wanted to have nothing to do with it because it would disturb their golf game or it would disturb the patient,' Gross said in a video made when he received the Lemelson-MIT Lifetime Achievement Award in 2000. 'So it wasn't a success, as I thought it would be when it was first introduced. But that changed later.' By the 1980s, millions of Americans used pagers, according to reports at the time. The devices were status symbols — belt-clipped signals that a wearer was important enough to be, in effect, on call at a moment's notice. Doctors, lawyers, movie stars and journalists wore them through the 1990s. In 1989, Sir Mix-a-Lot wrote a song about them, rapping: 'Beep diddy beep, will I call you maybe.' By then, pagers also had become associated with drug dealers and schools were cracking down. More than 50 school districts, from San Diego to Syracuse, New York, banned their use in schools, saying they hampered the fight to control drug abuse among teenagers, The New York Times reported in 1988. Michigan prohibited the devices' use in schools statewide. 'How can we expect students to ‘just say no to drugs’ when we allow them to wear the most dominant symbol of the drug trade on their belts,″ James Fleming, associate superintendent for the Dade County Public Schools in Florida, was quoted as saying. By the mid-90s, there were more than 60 million beepers in use, according to Spok, a communications company. Dove, who went on to serve as the mayor of Valley Center, Kansas, and become an author, says she and her family use cell phones now. But that means accepting the risk of identity theft. In some ways, she fondly recalls the simplicity of pagers. 'I do worry about that,' she says. 'But that risk just feels like a part of life now.' The pager market today is small but persistent The number of pagers globally is hard to come by. But more than 80% of Spok’s paging business deals with healthcare, with about 750,000 subscribers across large hospital systems, according to Vincent Kelly, CEO of the company. 'When there’s an emergency, their phones don’t always work,' Kelly said, adding that pager signals are often stronger than cell phone signals in hospitals with thick walls or concrete basements. Cell networks are 'not engineered to handle every single subscriber trying to call at the same time or send a message at the same time.' Members of Iran-backed Hezbollah on Israel’s northern border have used pagers to communicate for years. In February, the group’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, directed Hezbollah members to ditch their cell phones in an effort to dodge what’s believed to be Israel’s sophisticated surveillance on Lebanon’s mobile phone networks. Tuesday’s attack appeared to be a complex Israeli operation targeting Hezbollah. But the widespread use of pagers in Lebanon meant the detonations cost an enormous number of civilian casualties. They exploded in a moment across the landscape of everyday life — including homes, cars, grocery stores and cafes. Kelly says first responders and large manufacturers also use pagers. The manufacturers have employees use the devices on factory floors to prevent them from taking photos. Most medical personnel use combinations of pagers, chat rooms, messaging and other services to communicate with patients without revealing home numbers — an effort to be truly off-duty when they’re not working. Dr. Christopher Peabody, an emergency physician at San Francisco General Hospital, uses pagers every day — albeit grudgingly. 'We’re on a crusade to get rid of pagers, but we’re failing miserably,' said Peabody, who is also director of the UCSF Acute Care Innovation Center. Peabody said he and others at the hospital tested a new system and 'the pager won': The doctors stopped answering the two-way text messages and would only respond to pagers. In some ways, Peabody understands the resistance. Pagers provide a certain autonomy. In contrast, two-way communication carries the expectation to immediately answer and could provide an avenue for follow-up questions. The problem, Peabody said, is that paging is one-way communication and providers can’t communicate back and forth through the paging system. The technology, he said, is inefficient. And paging systems are not necessarily secure, a critical issue in an industry that must keep patient information private. 'This has been a culture of medicine for many, many years,' he said, 'and the pager is here to stay, most likely.' ____ Parvini reported from Los Angeles.	https://apnews.com/article/pagers-explosions-lebanon-doctors-security-israel-f35bd0f0e0a57bb5f37c139d1f32926d	2024-09-19T06:26:26-07:00

The Latest: Both presidential candidates making appearances to fire up core supporters	Both major presidential candidates are making appearances Thursday meant to fire up their core supporters. Vice President Kamala Harris is participating in a livestream with Oprah Winfrey, who has endorsed Harris and spoke at the Democratic convention in August. Donald Trump will be in Washington to address a 'Fighting Anti-Semitism in America' evening event with Miriam Adelson, a co-owner of the NBA’s Dallas Mavericks and widow of billionaire casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, who founded the Las Vegas Sands casino and was one of the Republican Party’s largest donors. Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: U.S. Senator introduces bill to provide security protections to presidential and vice presidential candidates U.S. Sen. Rick Scott announced Thursday morning that he’s leading a bill meant to provide protections to presidential and vice presidential candidates and spouses at the same level of protection provided to the sitting president. Scott introduced this bill with 11 other Republican senators, and he said in an interview that he’s been texting back and forth with Trump. He said that from these conversations, he understands that Trump is 'committed to winning the race and committed to fighting.' In this interview, he said that his bill would push these protections for Trump as a major presidential candidate, but he clarified that his bill wouldn’t apply to former presidents, including former President Barack Obama or President Joe Biden after November. Scott also said he supported the state investigation on the assassination attempt and believes that federal prosecutors needed to be more transparent about details to avoid misinformation. 'Here’s a guy that’s now twice, in what 64 days, somebody tried to kill him,' Scott said. 'This is not normal, and we’ve got to figure this out.' Trump no longer visiting a Polish-American shrine in Pennsylvania Donald Trump is no longer planning to visit a Polish-American shrine in Pennsylvania Sunday where he would have crossed paths with Polish President Andrzej Duda. That’s according to a person familiar with Trump’s plans who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the trip, which had not been formally announced. It’s unclear why the change was made, but Trump will be in Pennsylvania Monday for a pair of campaign events in the critical battleground state. Duda’s office has said he will attend a Roman Catholic Mass at the National Shrine of Our Lady of Czestochowa followed by the unveiling of a monument to the anti-communist Solidarity movement. He’ll be in the U.S. for the United Nations General Assembly happening in New York. Trump's campaign argues its case to Hispanic voters Trump’s campaign is making its argument that Hispanic voters are better suited to pick the GOP nominee over Harris this November. During a call held with reporters Thursday to mark National Hispanic Heritage Month, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida said Harris 'has tried to undo' Trump’s achievements that benefit Hispanic Americans and that the 'world was just a safer and more stable place' under the Republican president’s administration. Rubio cited Harris’ co-sponsorship while in the U.S. Senate of a bill aimed at making it easier for the Cuban military to benefit and profit from American tourism and 'making all kinds of concessions to Venezuela.' Trump’s campaign held the call to mark National Hispanic Heritage Month, an annual tradition that showcases the diversity and culture of Hispanic people. The month is celebrated each year from Sept. 15 to Oct. 15. Rubio and former California Lt. Gov. Abel Maldonado gave remarks on the call in both English and Spanish. Immigration wasn’t a focus of Thursday’s call, but it has been a major line of contrast between Harris and Trump. Speaking at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute’s annual leadership conference on Wednesday, Harris criticized Trump’s promise to deport millions of people who are in the United States illegally, questioning whether he would rely on massive raids and detention camps to carry it out. Trump has promised to carry out 'the largest deportation operation in the history of our country' if he’s elected in November but has offered no details on how such an operation would work. Kamala Harris steps up outreach to Mormon voters in battleground Arizona Vice President Kamala Harris is stepping up her efforts to win over voters who belong to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, enlisting prominent members of the faith to make the case in pivotal Arizona that Donald Trump does not align with the church’s values. Her state campaign announced on Thursday an advisory committee to formalize the outreach to current and former members of the church, widely known as the Mormon church. With nearly 450,000 church members in Arizona, about 6% of the state’s population, Latter-day Saints and former church members could prove critical in what will likely be an extremely close race. Latter-day Saints have traditionally voted Republican and are likely to remain part of the GOP coalition. Clustered in solidly Republican states, they have long been a major force in GOP primaries and local politics across the West, but they have not held much sway in national elections. In 2020, about 7 in 10 Mormon voters nationally supported Trump, according to AP VoteCast, while about one-quarter backed Democrat Joe Biden. Leaders of Democratic protest of Israel-Hamas war won’t endorse Harris but warn against Trump Leaders of a Democratic protest vote movement against the Israel-Hamas war said Thursday that they would not endorse Vice President Kamala Harris ’ presidential bid but strongly urged their supporters to vote against Donald Trump in November. The 'Uncommitted' movement drew hundreds of thousands of votes in Democratic primaries earlier this year in protest of President Joe Biden ’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war. The group’s leaders urged the administration to change its policy on the conflict, warning that some Democratic voters might otherwise abstain from voting in November, particularly in swing state Michigan. Despite months of discussions with top Democratic officials, discontent within the protest-vote ranks only grew after the Democratic National Convention when they were denied a speaker on stage and other demands weren’t met. Harris’ 'unwillingness to shift on unconditional weapons policy or to even make a clear campaign statement in support of upholding existing U.S. and international human rights law has made it impossible for us to endorse her,' movement leaders said in a statement. Group leaders also made clear in their statement that they strongly opposed supporters voting for Trump or a third-party candidate who 'could help inadvertently deliver a Trump presidency.' Instead, they urged voters to register 'anti-Trump votes and vote up and down the ballot.'	https://apnews.com/article/harris-trump-election-2024-winfrey-ddf2b13fb112693f4b35d14aee22baf5	2024-09-19T06:15:46-07:00	
The exploding device attacks dealt a major but not crippling blow to Hezbollah, analysts say	BEIRUT (AP) — The waves of remotely triggered explosions that hit pagers and walkie-talkies carried by Hezbollah members in grocery stores, on streets and at a funeral procession this week made for an eerie and shocking spectacle. Analysts said Hezbollah will be able to regroup militarily and find communications workarounds after the attack, but the psychological effects will likely run deep. The explosions — widely blamed on Israel, which has neither confirmed nor denied involvement — killed at least 37 people, including two children, wounded more than 3,000 and deeply unsettled even Lebanese who have no Hezbollah affiliation. The detonating devices hit workers in Hezbollah’s civilian institutions, including its health care and media operations, as well as fighters, dealing a blow to the militant group's operations beyond the battlefield. It is not clear how many civilians with no link to Hezbollah were injured. The attacks also exposed the weaknesses in the low-tech communications system the group had turned to in an attempt to avoid Israeli surveillance of cellphones. Retired Lebanese army Gen. Elias Hanna described the attacks as the 'Pearl Harbor or 9/11 of Hezbollah.' Mohanad Hage Ali, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center think tank who researches Hezbollah, said that because the blasts hit people across the group’s institutions, the attack was 'like a sword in the guts of the organization.' Hundreds of people were severely wounded, including many who lost eyes or hands. 'It will require time to heal and replace those who were targeted,' he said. But Hage Ali and other analysts agreed that the loss of manpower is not a crippling blow. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has said the group’s fighting force numbers more than 100,000, meaning that the attack — as dramatic as it was — would have put only a small percentage of its militants out of commission even if all those wounded and killed were fighters. Qassim Qassir, a Lebanese analyst close to Hezbollah, said the detonating devices actually struck mostly civilian workers within the group and not military or security officials, which has allowed it to contain the impacts on its war effort. Hezbollah, which is Lebanon’s strongest armed force, has exchanged fire with Israel’s military almost daily since Oct. 8, the day after a deadly Hamas-led assault in southern Israel triggered a massive Israeli counteroffensive and the ongoing war in Gaza. Since then, hundreds have been killed in strikes in Lebanon and dozens in Israel, while tens of thousands on each side of the border have been displaced. Hezbollah said its strikes are in support of its ally, Hamas, and that it will halt its attacks if a cease-fire is implemented in Gaza. Speaking Thursday, Nasrallah acknowledged that the pager and walkie-talkie attacks represented a 'severe blow,' but he vowed that the group would emerge stronger than before. Hezbollah continued to launch rockets over the border Wednesday and Thursday after the pager and walkie-talkie attacks, including one that killed two Israeli soldiers. The impacts on Hezbollah’s communications network are likely to be more disruptive than the human loss. 'Telecommunications is the nerve of military operations and communications,' said retired Lebanese army Gen. Naji Malaeb, an expert on security affairs. A delay in communication could spell disaster, he said. In February, Nasrallah warned members not to carry cellphones, which he said could be used to track them and monitor their communications. But long before that, Hezbollah relied on pagers and its own private fiber-optic landline network to avoid the monitoring of its communications. The pagers that detonated Tuesday were a new model the group recently began using. It appears that small quantities of explosives had been implanted in the devices at some stage in the manufacturing or shipping process and then remotely detonated. Hanna said the group might rely more heavily on its landline network — which Israel has attempted to tap into on multiple occasions — going forward, or on even lower-tech solutions such as hand-delivered letters. 'Maybe you have to go back to human communication, the postman,' he said. 'This is what is really helping (Hamas leader) Yahya Sinwar not to be targeted' in his hiding spot in Gaza. Orna Mizrahi, a senior researcher at the Tel Aviv-based think tank Institute for National Security Studies and former intelligence analyst for the Israeli military and prime minister’s office, said losing the ability to communicate through pagers is a 'dramatic blow,' but the militant group has other communication methods and will rebuild their communication network. The bigger damage to Hezbollah was psychological, she said. 'It’s the humiliation of having such an operation, it shows how much the organization is exposed to the Israeli intelligence,' she said. Amal Saad, a lecturer in politics and international relations at Cardiff University in Wales who researches Hezbollah, said much of the attack's impact was the 'demoralization and the fear' it sowed. 'It’s not just a security breach against the military,' she said. 'Hezbollah’s entire society is going to be extremely concerned because everything is liable now to being hacked and rigged.' The group will 'be rethinking many things now, not just the pagers,' Saad said. ___ Associated Press reporter Melanie Lidman in Jerusalem contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/hezbollah-israel-exploding-pagers-walkie-talkies-devices-b8506471525e3848023b1d6a863827e8	2024-09-19T05:11:49-07:00	
Sweden charges a woman with war crimes for allegedly torturing Yazidi women and children in Syria	COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — Swedish authorities on Thursday charged a 52-year-old woman associated with the Islamic State group with genocide, crimes against humanity and serious war crimes against Yazidi women and children in Syria — in the first such case of a person to be tried in the Scandinavian country. Lina Laina Ishaq, who's a Swedish citizen, allegedly committed the crimes from August 2014 to December 2016, in Raqqa, the former de facto capital of the self-proclaimed IS caliphate and home to about 300,000 people. The crimes 'took place under IS rule in Raqqa, and this is the first time that IS attacks against the Yazidi minority have been tried in Sweden,' senior prosecutor Reena Devgun said in a statement. 'Women, children and men were regarded as property and subjected to being traded as slaves, sexual slavery, forced labor, deprivation of liberty and extrajudicial executions,' Devgun said. When announcing the charges, Devgun told a press conference that they were able to identify the woman through information from UNITAD, the U.N. team investigating atrocities in Iraq. 'IS tried to annihilate the Yazidi ethnic group on an industrial scale,' Devgun said. In a separate statement, the Stockholm District Court said the prosecutor claims the woman detained a number of women and children belonging to the Yazidi ethnic group in her residence in Raqqa, and 'allegedly exposed them to, among other things, severe suffering, torture or other inhumane treatment as well as for persecution by depriving them of fundamental rights for cultural, religious and gender reasons contrary to general international law.' According to the charge sheet, obtained by The Associated Press, Ishaq is suspected of holding nine people, including children, in her Raqqa home for up to seven months and treating them as slaves. She also abused several of those she held captive. The charge sheet said that Ishaq, who denies wrongdoing, is accused of having molested a baby, said to have been 1 month old at the time, by holding a hand over the child’s mouth when he screamed to make him shut up. She is also suspected of having sold people to IS knowing they risked being killed or subjected to serious sexual abuse. In 2014, IS militants stormed Yazidi towns and villages in Iraq’s Sinjar region and abducted women and children. Women were forced into sexual slavery, and boys were taken to be indoctrinated in jihadi ideology. The woman earlier had been convicted in Sweden and was sentenced to three years in prison, for taking her 2-year-old son to Syria in 2014, in an area that was then controlled by IS. The woman had claimed that she had told the child’s father that she and the boy were only going on a holiday to Turkey. However, once in Turkey, the two crossed into Syria and the IS-run territory. In 2017, when the Islamic State’s reign began to collapse, she fled from Raqqa and was captured by Syrian Kurdish troops. She managed to escape to Turkey where she was arrested with her son and two other children, she had given birth to in the meantime, with an IS foreign fighter from Tunisia. She was extradited from Turkey to Sweden. Before her 2021 conviction, the woman lived in the southern town of Landskrona. The court said the trial was planned to start Oct. 7 and last approximately two months. Large parts of the trial are to be held behind closed doors.	https://apnews.com/article/sweden-islamic-state-yazidi-women-war-crimes-44b7d31d9cc36131023f808aa55fce01	2024-09-19T02:58:21-07:00	
Hezbollah fires new volley at Israel as fears of greater war mount after electronic devices bombing	BEIRUT (AP) — Hezbollah fired a new barrage into northern Israel on Thursday, continuing its drumbeat of exchanges with the Israeli military as fears of a greater war rise after hundreds of electronic devices exploded in Lebanon, killing at least 32 people and wounding more than 3,000 others. The device explosions appeared to be the culmination of a monthslong operation by Israel to target as many Hezbollah members as possible all at once. Over two days, pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah detonated, wounding and even crippling some fighters, but also maiming civilians connected to the group’s social branches and killing at least two children. It was unclear how the attack fit into warnings by Israeli leaders in recent weeks that they could launch a stepped-up military operation against Hezbollah, Lebanon’s strongest armed force. The Israeli government has called it a war aim to end the Iranian-backed group’s crossborder fire in order to allow tens of thousands of Israelis to return to homes near the border. Speaking to Israeli troops on Wednesday, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said, 'We are at the start of a new phase in the war — it requires courage, determination and perseverance.' He made no mention of the exploding devices but praised the work of Israel’s army and security agencies, saying 'the results are very impressive.' Gallant said that after months of fighting Hamas in Gaza, 'the center of gravity is shifting to the north by diverting resources and forces.' Hezbollah said early Thursday it had targeted military positions in northern Israel, without specifying what weapons it used. Israeli hospitals reported that they treated at least eight patients injured in the attacks. The military said early Thursday that it had struck several militant sites in southern Lebanon overnight. The volley of strikes was a signal by Hezbollah that it would continue its near daily fire, which it says is a show of support for Hamas amid Israel’s 11-month-old campaign in Gaza in retaliation for the Palestinian militants’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel. Israel has responded to Hezbollah’s fire with strikes in southern Lebanon, and has struck senior figures from the group in the capital Beirut. The exchanges have killed hundreds in Lebanon and dozens in Israel and forced the evacuation of tens of thousands of residents on each side of the border. Israel and Hezbollah have repeatedly pulled back from an all-out war under heavy pressure from the United States, France and other countries. But in their recent warnings, Israeli leaders have said they are determined to change the status quo dramatically. Israeli began moving more troops to its border with Lebanon on Wednesday as a precautionary measure, Israeli officials said. Israel’s army chief, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, said plans have been drawn up for additional action against Hezbollah, though media reported the government has not yet decided whether to launch a major offensive in Lebanon. Meanwhile, Lebanon was still reeling from the unprecedented mass bombings of Tuesday and Wednesday. The explosions have rattled anxious Lebanese fearing a full-scale war. The Lebanese Army said it has been locating and detonating suspicious pagers and communication devices, while the country’s civil aviation authorities banned pagers and walkie-talkies on all airplanes departing from Beirut’s international airport until further notice. The attack was likely to severely disrupt Hezbollah’s internal communication as it scrambles to determine safe means to talk to each other. Hezbollah announced the death of five combatants today, but didn’t specify if they were killed in the explosions or on the front lines. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was scheduled to speak later Thursday as the group vowed to retaliate against Israel. The blasts went off wherever the holders of the pagers or walkie-talkies happened to be in multiple parts of Beirut and eastern and southern Lebanon — in homes and cars, grocery stores and cafes and on the street, even at a funeral for some killed in the bombings, often with family and other bystanders nearby. Many suffered gaping wounds on their legs, abdomens and faces or were maimed in the hand. Tuesday’s pager blasts killed 12 people, including two children, and wounded some 2,800 others. The following day’s explosion killed 20 and wounded more than 450. Health Minister Firas Abiad praised Lebanon’s hospitals, saying they had managed to deal with the flood of wounded within hours. 'It was an indiscriminate attack. It was a war crime,' he said. Mary Ellen O’Connell, a professor of law and international peace studies at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana, said booby-traps are banned under international law. 'Weaponizing an object used by civilians is strictly prohibited,' she said.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-exploding-devices-hezbollah-mideast-ab2436cf5bae5e2fe2dddb293671a0ac	2024-09-19T02:14:00-07:00	
UK leader Starmer is facing flak for taking freebies. He says he's done nothing wrong	LONDON (AP) — Less than three months after he was elected on a promise to restore trust in politics, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is trying to shake off criticism over donations from a wealthy businessman and the hefty salary of his most senior aide. The Labour Party leader, who won power in a landslide victory on July 4, denies impropriety over thousands of pounds (dollars) worth of clothes and eyeglasses paid for by Waheed Alli, a media entrepreneur and longtime Labour donor. Starmer is also facing grumbling among his own employees over the salary of chief of staff Sue Gray. The BBC disclosed that she is paid 170,000 pounds ($225,000) a year — about 3,000 pounds more than the prime minister's salary. Gray’s salary is at the top of a set of pay bands for political advisers, which have been raised since the election. The government said it did not interfere in setting the pay scale. 'The pay bands for any official, any adviser, are not set by politicians. There’s an official process that does that,' Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said Thursday. In recent days British media have been full of largely anonymous grumbling from government officials about Gray, a former senior civil servant best known for leading an investigation into lockdown-breaching parties in government buildings during the COVID-19 pandemic. Gray’s findings helped topple Conservative Prime Minister Boris Johnson, and her subsequent move to work for Starmer led the Conservatives to claim the 'partygate' probe was politically biased, something Gray denies. Labour claims the leak of Gray’s salary and the donation revelations -– branded 'frockgate' in the press after dresses bought for the prime minister’s wife, Victoria Starmer -- is being whipped up by the Conservatives and their media supporters to tarnish the government. Lawmakers are allowed to accept gifts but have to declare donations and extra-parliamentary income within 28 days. Starmer missed the four-week deadline to declare the donations of clothes and a personal shopper for his wife from Alli. He says the delay was due to his staff seeking advice on exactly what needed to be declared. 'I’m very consistent with following the rules,' Starmer said this week. He rejected suggestions that prime ministers should get a wardrobe budget, saying taxpayers should not have to pay for politicians’ clothes. Starmer dismissed claims of dissent among his staff about Gray and her salary, insisting he's 'completely in control.' 'I’m focused and every day the message from me to the team is exactly the same, which is we have to deliver,' he told the BBC on Thursday. ''We were elected on a big mandate to deliver change, I am determined that we are going to do that.' The scale of the freebies accepted by Starmer has raised eyebrows even among supporters. Sky News reported that Starmer has declared 'gifts, benefits and hospitality' worth more than 100,000 pounds since December 2019, more than any other lawmaker. The donations include thousands of pounds’ worth of tickets for Premier League games involving Starmer’s beloved team Arsenal. 'I’m a massive Arsenal fan,' Starmer told reporters during a trip to Rome this week. 'I can’t go into the stands because of security reasons. Therefore, if I don’t accept a gift of hospitality I can’t go to a game. You could say, ‘Well bad luck.’ … But, you know, never going to an Arsenal game again because I can’t accept hospitality is pushing it a bit far.'	https://apnews.com/article/uk-labour-keir-starmer-donations-sue-gray-8b5488dfdde0abc0b7156f8df5596f5a	2024-09-19T02:04:34-07:00	
Huge python grabs Thai woman in her kitchen, squeezes her two hours before she can be freed	BANGKOK (AP) — A 64-year-old woman was preparing to do her evening dishes at her home outside Bangkok when she felt a sharp pain in her thigh and looked down to see a huge python taking hold of her. 'I was about to scoop some water and when I sat down it bit me immediately,' Arom Arunroj told Thailand's Thairath newspaper. 'When I looked I saw the snake wrapping around me.' The four-to-five-meter-long (13-to-16-foot-long) python coiled itself around her torso, squeezing her down to the floor of her kitchen. 'I grabbed it by the head, but it wouldn't release me,' she said. 'It only tightened.' Pythons are non-venomous constrictors, which kill their prey by gradually squeezing the breath out of it. Propped up against her kitchen door, she cried for help but it wasn't until a neighbor happened to be walking by about an hour and a half later and heard her screams that authorities were called. Responding police officer Anusorn Wongmalee told The Associated Press on Thursday that when he arrived the woman was still leaning against her door, looking exhausted and pale, with the snake coiled around her. Police and animal control officers used a crowbar to hit the snake on the head until it released its grip and slithered away before it could be captured. In all, Arom spent about two hours on Tuesday night in the clutches of the python before being freed. She was treated for several bites but appeared to be otherwise unharmed in videos of her talking to Thai media shortly after the incident. Encounters with snakes are not uncommon in Thailand, and last year 26 people were killed by venomous snake bites, according to government statistics. A total of 12,000 people were treated for venomous bites by snakes and other animals 2023. The reticulated python is the largest snake found in Thailand and usually ranges in size from 1.5 meters to 6.5 meters (5 to 21 feet), weighing up to about 75 kilograms (165 pounds). They have been found as big as 10 meters (33 feet) long and 130 kilograms (287 pounds). Smaller pythons feed on small mammals such as rats, but larger snakes switch to prey such as pigs, deer and even domestic dogs and cats. Attacks on humans are not common, though do happen occasionally.	https://apnews.com/article/thailand-snake-python-kitchen-0e2ad8b8fcdeeb9d8d17ffeb137fa85f	2024-09-19T01:18:45-07:00	
Flood-hit regions in Central Europe will get billions in EU aid	WARSAW, Poland (AP) — European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen on Thursday pledged billions of euros in aid for Central European countries that suffered enormous damage to infrastructure and housing during the massive flooding that has so far claimed 24 lives in the region. Von der Leyen paid a quick visit to a flood-damaged area in southeastern Poland and met with heads of the governments of the affected countries — Poland, Austria, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. She said funds will be made available quickly for infrastructure repair from the EU’s solidarity fund, as well as 10 billion euros ($11 billion) from what is called the cohesion fund — for the most urgent repairs. In a special approach, no co-financing will be required from these countries for the money to be released. 'Here we say it’s 100% European money, no co-financing,' von der Leyen told a news briefing. 'These are extraordinary times, and extraordinary times need extraordinary measures. ' Meanwhile, a massive flood wave threatened new areas and heavy rains also caused flooding and evacuation of some 1,000 people in the northern Italian region of Emilia-Romagna. In Central Europe, the receding waters revealed the scale of the destruction caused by exceptionally heavy rains that began a week ago. Czech Interior Minister Vit Rakušan said one more person was reported killed on Thursday in the country's hard-hit northeast, bringing the death toll there to five. There were also seven deaths each in Poland and Romania, and five in Austria — with the overall death toll now at 24. Authorities deployed troops to help. In the northeastern Czech Republic, soldiers joined firefighters and other emergency crews to help with the recovery efforts. Army helicopters distributed humanitarian aid while soldiers were building temporary bridges in place of those that were swept away. Some 400 people remained evacuated from the homes in the regional capital of Ostrava. In the southwest, the level of the Luznice River reached an extreme high but the evacuation of 1,000 people in the town of Veseli nad Luznici was not necessary for the moment, officials said. Cleanup efforts were underway in Austria, where flooding washed away roads and led to landslides and bridge damage. Firefighters and soldiers pumped water and mud out of houses and disposed of damaged furniture, broadcaster ORF quoted fire department spokesperson Klaus Stebal as saying. The governor of Lower Austria province, Johanna Mikl-Leitner, said reconstruction was expected to take years, according to the Austria Press Agency. The Vienna public transport company has had to pump almost 1 million liters (260,000 gallons) of water since last weekend. Ten towns and areas were still inaccessible on Thursday, APA reported. In Hungary, flood waters continued to rise as authorities closed roads and rail stations. Ferries along the Danube River halted. In the capital, Budapest, water spilled over the city’s lower quays and threatened to reach tram and metro lines. Some transport services were suspended. Further upriver, in a region known as the Danube Bend, homes and restaurants near the riverbanks were inundated. Nearly 6,000 professionals, including members of Hungary’s water authority and military, were mobilized, and prison inmates were involved in filling sandbags, Prime Minister Viktor Orbán said at a news conference Thursday. The Danube stood at over 771 centimeters (25 feet), approaching the 891-centimeter (29.2 feet) record set during major flooding in 2013. In southwestern Poland, the high waters reached the city of Wroclaw and an extended wave was expected to take many hours, even days to pass, exerting pressure on the embankments. The water level on the Oder River just before Wroclaw was 6.4 meters (21 feet), some 2 meters (6.5 feet) above alarm levels but still lower compared to the disastrous flooding in 1997. In the two most-affected towns, Stronie Slaskie and Ladek-Zdroj, tap water and power were restored, said Gen. Michal Kamieniecki, who was put in charge of the recovery operations there after an emotional appeal to Prime Minister Donald Tusk for help the day before by a young woman identified only as Katarzyna. As concerns mounted, Tusk invited von der Leyen to Wroclaw to see the situation first hand. Government leaders from the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Austria were also there. In Italy, rivers flooded in the provinces of Ravenna, Bologna and Forlì-Cesena, as local mayors asked people to stay on the upper floors or leave their houses. Those areas were hit by devastating floods in 2023, when more than 20 rivers overflowed, killing 17 people. Italy’s vice minister for transport and infrastructure, Galeazzo Bignami, said Thursday that two people were reported missing in Bagnocavallo, in Ravenna province. At least 800 residents in Ravenna and almost 200 in Bologna province spent the night in shelters, schools and sports centers. Trains were suspended and schools closed while residents were advised to avoid travel. ___ Associated Press writers Justin Spike in Budapest, Hungary, Karel Janicek in Prague and Giada Zampano in Rome contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/central-europe-floods-poland-wroclaw-oder-czech-d96d5343577cd6e11c680c1ed08d604f	2024-09-19T01:16:14-07:00	
Oktoberfest tightens security in wake of deadly knife attack in western Germany	MUNICH (AP) — Security has tightened at Oktoberfest in the wake of last month’s deadly knife attack in Solingen in western Germany, and officials warned revelers to expect longer lines at entry points as metal detectors will be deployed for the first time in the Bavarian beer festival's 189-year history. Authorities say there are no specific threats to the world's largest folk festival, which begins Saturday with the traditional keg-tapping in Munich and runs through Oct. 6. Some 6 million participants, many wearing traditional lederhosen and dirndl dresses, are expected over the course of the event. The stepped-up security comes after an Aug. 23 attack in Solingen that left three dead and eight wounded. A 26-year-old Syrian suspect was arrested. He was an asylum-seeker who was supposed to be deported to Bulgaria last year but reportedly disappeared for a time and avoided deportation. The Islamic State militant group has claimed responsibility for the violence, without providing evidence. The violence left Germany shaken and pushed immigration back to the top of the country’s political agenda. In response, the Interior Ministry extended temporary border controls to all nine of its frontiers this week. The closures are set to last six months and are threatening to test European unity. The effects of the Solingen attack and other recent violence across Germany will also be felt at Oktoberfest. Hand-held metal detectors will be used for the first time, with police and security staff using them on a random basis or following suspicious activity. 'We have had to react to the fact that attacks with knives have increased in recent weeks and months,' Munich Mayor Dieter Reiter told The Associated Press during a media tour of the festival grounds to highlight the new security measures. 'We will do everything we can to ensure that nobody comes to Oktoberfest with a knife or other dangerous weapons.' In addition to some 600 police officers and 2,000 security staff, more than 50 cameras will be spread across the grounds of the festival, which will be fenced off as well. Festival-goers also are prohibited from bringing knives, glass bottles and backpacks. Oktoberfest is no stranger to increased security throughout its history. In 2016, authorities implemented tighter measures in response to a series of attacks, including when a German teenager fatally shot nine people at a Munich mall before killing himself. Peter Neumann, a professor of security studies at King’s College London, said Oktoberfest officials are taking sensible approaches to security in light of Solingen, as well as other foiled plots across Europe recently. Extremists and groups like the Islamic State seek locations where an attack would garner international headlines and 'cause a lot of terror,' he said. French authorities say they thwarted three plots to hit the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Paris and other cities that hosted the summer events, which included plans to attack ' Israeli institutions or representatives of Israel in Paris.' And Austrian officials last month arrested a 19-year-old who had plotted to attack now-canceled Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna in a scheme to kill tens of thousands of fans that was allegedly inspired by the Islamic State group. 'These are all global events where you can expect to cause a lot of attention,' Neumann told The Associated Press. Neumann said the Islamic State has been gaining momentum during the Israel-Hamas war. The group even referenced the war when it claimed responsibility for the Solingen violence, saying the attacker targeted Christians and that as a 'soldier of the Islamic State' he carried out the assaults 'to avenge Muslims in Palestine and everywhere.' Oktoberfest is a difficult event for police to secure completely, though authorities say there aren’t any concrete threats to the festival. 'It’s an iconic event and this is exactly the kind of event that they’d want to strike,' he said. 'But with millions of people — drunk people to be honest — running around, it’s really difficult to control every movement.' The festival's organizer, Clemens Baumgärtner, promised a safe public space, possibly 'the safest place in Germany' during the 16 days of Oktoberfest.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-oktoberfest-security-e06aec985018e38380c3847a84023db0	2024-09-19T01:06:28-07:00	
Modi visits Indian-administered Kashmir on local election campaign amid massive security	SRINAGAR, India (AP) — India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the main city in Himalayan Kashmir on Thursday to campaign for his party in the local election, the first such vote since New Delhi stripped the disputed region’s semi-autonomy in 2019. Modi’s visit to Srinagar city in the Kashmir Valley — the heartland of decades of anti-India rebellion — comes amid strong public opposition there to New Delhi’s changes five years back. That move revoked the region’s semi-autonomous status, annulled its separate constitution, downgraded and split the former state into two centrally governed union territories— Ladakh and Jammu-Kashmir — and removed inherited protections on land and jobs. The region has since remained on edge with civil liberties curbed and media freedoms gagged. Authorities laid razor wires and erected road checkpoints to close the roads leading to the venue of Modi’s election rally in Srinagar’s main commercial center. Armed paramilitary troops and police in flak jackets patrolled the area, snipers and sharpshooters were positioned atop buildings near the venue. The multistage election will allow Kashmir to have its own truncated government and a local legislature, called an assembly, instead of remaining under New Delhi’s direct rule. However, there will be a limited transition of power from New Delhi to the local assembly as Kashmir will continue to be a 'Union Territory' — directly controlled by the federal government — with India’s Parliament remaining its main legislator. Kashmir’s statehood must be restored for the new government to have powers similar to other states of India. 'We have said in the parliament that we will restore (the region’s) statehood. Only BJP will fulfill this commitment,' Modi said to a cheering crowd at the rally while referring to his Bharatiya Janata Party, without specifying any timeline for the return of statehood. He called the ongoing election the festival of democracy in the region. 'Jammu and Kashmir is strengthening the democracy of India and I congratulate the people for this,' he said. Kashmir has been at the heart of a conflict between India and Pakistan after British rule of the subcontinent ended in 1947 with the creation of the two rival countries. Both administer part of it but claim the territory in its entirety. Militants in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir have been fighting New Delhi’s rule since 1989. Many Muslim Kashmiris support the rebels’ goal of uniting the territory, either under Pakistani rule or as an independent country. India insists the insurgency is Pakistan-sponsored terrorism, a charge Islamabad denies. Tens of thousands of people have been killed in the fighting, which many Kashmiri Muslims consider a legitimate freedom struggle. Kashmir has remained an important part of a muscular rhetoric by Modi and his party colleagues in their outreach to the Hindu support base in India where few issues reach as broad a consensus as that the region must remain a part of the country at any cost. Modi’s government has repeatedly said the changes would spur investment, bring more development and root out separatism in Kashmir. But critics and many Kashmiris fear this could dilute the region’s demographics. 'It seemed odd to claim that this place is celebrating democracy,' said Siddiq Wahid, historian and former vice chancellor of a university in Kashmir. 'For the past five years, it has been led by an unelected administration unfamiliar with the region’s idiosyncrasies, it has been dismantled as a state, and unspecified executive powers of its Chief Minister and assembly transferred' to New Delhi appointed administrators, he added. 'New Delhi's centralization of power has increased public frustration over political stasis here,' Wahid said. Thursday’s visit was Modi’s second to the Muslim-majority region to campaign for his party candidates in the ongoing election. Voting began on Wednesday, with a brisk turnout in the first phase. The vote is the first in a decade, and the first since his Hindu nationalist government’s 2019 move. Kashmir’s pro-India political parties have promised to fight to undo those changes. Last week, Modi addressed a similar rally in southern Doda district. The second and third phases of the polling are scheduled for Sept. 25 and Oct. 1. The process is staggered for logistical reasons and to allow troops to move around to stop potential violence in the Himalayan region. Votes will be counted on Oct. 8, with results expected that day. At the rally in Srinagar, Modi launched a scathing attack on India’s main opposition Congress party and the regional parties, the National Conference and the Peoples Democratic Party, calling them 'three families' responsible for 'destruction' and bringing 'nothing but chaos and fear' to the region. 'I am sincerely working towards restoring peace here,' he said. India’s ruling BJP has a strong political base in the region’s Hindu-dominated areas of Jammu that largely favor the 2019 changes and has won multiple seats from there in the past elections. But it is weak in the Kashmir Valley where the BJP has never won a seat. The party has fielded only 19 candidates for the 47 seats in the valley while it is contesting all 43 seats in Jammu. Modi’s party is not officially aligned with any local group, but many politicians believe it is tacitly supporting some parties and independent candidates in the Kashmir Valley who privately agree with it. The region’s main pro-India political parties accused the BJP of trying to manipulate the election and fragment the valley’s vote through independents. About 43% of 503 candidates contesting in the Kashmir Valley are independents, in contrast to 35% in Jammu.	https://apnews.com/article/kashmir-india-modi-election-pakistan-conflict-e0a53722aef64e33c19e5a649819ccae	2024-09-19T01:05:17-07:00	
Bank of England keeps its main interest rate on hold at 5% in wake of big US Fed rate cut	LONDON (AP) — The Bank of England kept its main interest rate unchanged at 5% Thursday despite a big cut from the U.S. Federal Reserve, its first since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic more than four years ago. The decision was widely expected amid ongoing concerns about inflation within the bank’s monetary policy committee, particularly the elevated levels in the crucial services sector, which accounts for around 80% of the British economy. Figures on Wednesday showed that inflation overall in the U.K. held steady at an annual rate of 2.2% in August, still above the bank’s goal. Minutes to the meeting showed that eight of the nine members of the panel voted to keep rates unchanged, while one backed a quarter-point reduction. 'The economy has been evolving broadly as we expected. If that continues, we should be able to reduce rates gradually over time,' said Bank Gov. Andrew Bailey. 'But it’s vital that inflation stays low, so we need to be careful not to cut too fast or by too much.' The bank, which last month cut interest rates for the first time since the pandemic, is widely expected to reduce borrowing costs again at its next meeting in November, especially as it will have details of the government’s budget on Oct. 30. On Wednesday, the Fed cut its main interest by half of a percentage point to roughly 4.8% from a two-decade high of 5.3%, where it had stood for 14 months. It also signaled that there will be more cuts to come in the next few months. Central banks around the world dramatically increased borrowing costs from near zero during the coronavirus pandemic when prices started to shoot up, first as a result of supply chain issues built up and then because of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine which pushed up energy costs. As inflation rates have fallen from multi-decade highs recently, they have started cutting interest rates. On Wednesday, the Fed became the latest major central bank to reduce borrowing costs, cutting its main interest by half of a percentage point to roughly 4.8% from a two-decade high of 5.3%, where it had stood for 14 months. It also signaled that there will be more cuts to come in the next few months. Though Thursday's decision could be seen as bad news for borrowers, they should get some relief over the coming months, with most economists predicting that the bank will reduce its main rate to around 3.5% by the end of 2025, with a consequent reduction in the cost of personal loans and mortgage rates. The bank is widely expected to reduce borrowing costs again at its next meeting in November, especially as it will have details of the government's budget on Oct. 30. The new Labour government has said that it needs to plug a 22 billion pound ($29 billion) hole in the public finances and has indicated that it may have to raise taxes and lower spending, which would likely weigh on the near-term outlook for the British economy and put downward pressure on inflation. Luke Bartholomew, deputy chief economist at abrdn, formerly Aberdeen Asset Management, said the Bank of England 'will need to incorporate any fiscal changes in its next forecasts, which could provide the foundation for more rapid cuts in due course.'	https://apnews.com/article/britain-economy-interest-rates-inflation-53fe73fd2e1f6f96b25fce0098358873	2024-09-18T23:54:49-07:00	
At least 1000 people evacuated as flooding hits northern Italy	ROME (AP) — About a thousand residents were evacuated in the northern Italian region of Emilia-Romagna after it was hit by torrential rains and severe flooding overnight, local media reported Thursday. Rivers flooded in three of the region's provinces — Ravenna, Bologna and Faenza — as local mayors asked people to stay on upper floors or leave their houses. At least 800 residents in the Ravenna area and almost 200 in Bologna province spent the night in shelters, schools and sports centers as local rivers overflowed. Trains were suspended and schools closed across the affected areas, and residents have been advised to avoid travel and work from home where possible. The Faenza area was just recovering from the devastating floods that hit Emilia-Romagna in May 2023, claiming 17 lives and causing billions of euros in damages. 'The night was dramatic, we waited for the river flood to cross the city,' Faenza mayor Massimo Isola told state TV Rainews. 'It rose really close to the limit, but thanks to the works done over the past year we managed to avoid an overflow in the center of the city.' Several Central and Eastern European nations have been plagued by severe flooding in recent days, including Austria, the Czech Republic, Poland and Romania, with the death toll rising over 20 people across the region.	https://apnews.com/article/italy-flooding-emilia-romagna-europe-rivers-8179828dae59d1c653d3131d75187e17	2024-09-18T23:05:42-07:00	
Pygmy hippo Moo Deng is so adored she may get her own patent	CHONBURI, Thailand (AP) — Only a month after Thailand's adorable baby hippo Moo Deng was unveiled on Facebook, her fame became unstoppable both domestically and internationally. Zookeeper Atthapon Nundee has been posting cute moments of the animals in his care for about five years. He never imagined Khao Kheow Open Zoo's newborn pygmy hippo would become an internet megastar within weeks. Cars started lining up outside the zoo well before it opened Thursday. Visitors traveled from near and far for a chance to see the pudgy, expressive 2-month-old in person at the zoo about 100 kilometers (60 miles) southeast of Bangkok. The pit where Moo Deng lives with her mom, Jona, was packed almost immediately, with people cooing and cheering every time the pink-cheeked baby animal made skittish movements. 'It was beyond expectation,' Atthapon told The Associated Press. 'I wanted people to know her. I wanted a lot of people to visit her, or watch her online, or leave fun comments. I never would’ve thought (of this).' Moo Deng, which literally means 'bouncy pork' in Thai, is a type of meatball. The name was chosen by fans via a poll on social media, and it matches her other siblings: Moo Toon (stewed pork) and Moo Waan (sweet pork). There is also a common hippo at the zoo named Kha Moo (stewed pork leg). 'She’s such a little lump. I want to ball her up and swallow her whole!' said Moo Deng fan Areeya Sripanya while visiting the zoo Thursday. Already, Moo Deng has been made into memes. Artists are drawing cartoons based on her. Social media platform X even featured her in its official account’s post. With all that fame, zoo director Narongwit Chodchoi said they have begun patenting and trademarking 'Moo Deng the hippo' to prevent the animal from being commercialized by anyone else. 'After we do this, we will have more income to support activities that will make the animals’ lives better,' he said. 'The benefits we get will return to the zoo to improve the life of all animals here.' The zoo sits on 800 hectares (almost 2,000 acres) of land and is home to more than 2,000 animals. It runs breeder programs for many endangered species like Moo Deng's. The pygmy hippopotamus that's native to West Africa is threatened by poaching and loss of habitat. There are only 2,000-3,000 of them left in the wild. To help fund the initiative, the zoo is making Moo Deng shirts and pants that will be ready for sale at the end of the month, with more merchandise to come. Narongwit believes a factor of Moo Deng's fame is her name, which compliments her energetic and chaotic personality captured in Atthapon's creative captions and video clips. Appropriately, Moo Deng likes to 'deng,' or bounce, and Atthapon got a lot of cute and funny moments or her giddy bouncing on social media. Even when she's not bouncing, the hippo is endlessly cute — squirming as Atthapon tries to wash her, biting him while he was trying to play with her, calmly closing her eyes as he rubs her pinkish cheeks or her chubby belly. Atthapon, who has worked at the zoo for eight years taking care of hippos, sloths, capybaras and binturongs, said baby hippos are usually more playful and energetic, and they become calmer as they get older. The zoo saw a spike in visitors since Moo Deng’s fame — so much that the zoo now has to limit public access to the baby's enclosure to 5-minute windows throughout the day during weekends. Narongwit said the zoo has been receiving over 4,000 visitors during a weekday, up from around just 800 people, and more than 10,000 during a weekend, up from around 3,000 people. But the fame has also brought some hostile visitors to Moo Deng, who only wakes up ready to play about two hours a day. Some videos showed visitors splashing water or throwing things at the sleeping Moo Deng to try to wake her up. The hippo pit now has a warning sign against throwing things at Moo Deng — posted prominently at the front in Thai, English and Chinese. Narongwit said the zoo would take action under the animal protection law if people mistreat the animal. But clips emerged of people treating Moo Deng poorly, and the backlash was fierce. The zoo director said that since then, they haven’t seen anyone doing it again. For fans who can't make the journey or are discouraged after seeing the crowds for Moo Deng, the Khao Kheow Open Zoo set up cameras and plan to start a 24-hour live feed of the baby hippo in the coming week.	https://apnews.com/article/moo-deng-baby-hippo-thailand-zoo-27485f0cbc70071252be45d870d507aa	2024-09-18T22:51:35-07:00	
Israel-Hamas war latest: Hezbollah leader says Israel crossed a `red line'	The leader of Lebanon's Hezbollah is promising to retaliate for deadly attacks on its communication devices after Israel's defense minister announced a 'new phase' of the war. Hezbollah and the Israeli military traded new strikes over the border on Thursday. Fears are increasing that 11 months of exchanges of fire between the two sides will escalate into all-out war. Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's leader, said Israel crossed a 'red line' this week after bombings widely blamed on Israel in which hundreds of pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah were remotely detonated in Lebanon and Syria. Hezbollah began striking Israel almost immediately after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack that sparked the Israel-Hamas war. They have come close to a full-blown war on several occasions. Gaza’s Health Ministry says more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in the territory since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack. The ministry does not differentiate between fighters and civilians in its count but says a little over half of those killed were women and children. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. Here's the latest: Israel accuses Iran and Hezbollah of sending threatening texts to millions of Israelis JERUSALEM — Israel is accusing Iran and Hezbollah of bombarding millions of Israelis with threatening text messages as the conflict between the Israeli military and the Lebanese militant group escalated. Israel's National Cyber Directorate said Thursday that a flood of Hebrew-language text messages popped up on cellphones nationwide, falsely purporting to be a communication from the Israeli Home Front Command. The government said roughly 5 million suspicious SMS texts were sent to Israelis late Wednesday. It determined that Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah hacked an Israeli mobile service provider and exploited its customer accounts. The Israeli government did not say which provider. It was not immediately clear whether additional customer information was compromised. 'Say goodbye to your loved ones,' read one of the messages seen by The Associated Press. 'Don’t worry, you will hug them in hell.' Israel’s Cyber Directorate described the deluge of texts as an 'unsophisticated attempt to incite public panic.' It said Israelis received three versions of the messages, all containing 'harmful' links to unknown websites that it said were 'rendered inactive within a short period of time.' There was no immediate response to the Israeli allegations from Hezbollah or Iran. The U.K. is urging its citizens to leave Lebanon LONDON — The U.K.’s top diplomat is urging British nationals to leave Lebanon. Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the situation could deteriorate rapidly after consecutive rounds of explosive attacks that appeared to target the Hezbollah militant group. 'My message to British nationals in Lebanon is leave while commercial options remain,' he wrote on the X social media platform. Lammy said he had spoken with the Lebanese prime minister about negotiating a solution to restore stability. 'I spoke with Najib Mikati and expressed my deep concern over rising tensions and civilian casualties in Lebanon,' Lammy said. The British government has been advising its citizens to leave the country for more than a month. WHO says it's helping Lebanon's Health Ministry GENEVA — The head of the World Health Organization says it is working with Lebanon’s Health Ministry as it deals with those wounded by exploding communications devices. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanon Ghebreyesus said the strikes have 'severely disrupted Lebanon’s already-fragile health system.' He said WHO has distributed trauma and emergency surgery supplies and, 'We are working to meet immediate needs, including blood supplies and blood testing kits, and monitoring how the health system is functioning.' Dr. Abinasir Abubakar, the WHO country representative in Lebanon, said at least one health care worker was killed. WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan said the device explosions 'came without warning, and the whole health system came under immense pressure — and very, very quickly.' Israel's defense minister says the goal is for Israelis to be able to return home JERUSALEM — Israel’s defense minister said Thursday that Hezbollah 'will pay an increasing price' as Israel seeks to make conditions near its border with Lebanon safe enough for residents to return to their homes. Yoav Gallant’s comments came as Israel and Hezbollah exchanged strikes and the group’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, vowed retaliation against Israel for a mass bombing attack in Lebanon. 'Our goal is to ensure the safe return of Israel’s northern communities to their homes. As time goes by, Hezbollah will pay an increasing price,' said Gallant. 'The sequence of our military actions will continue.' Hezbollah's leader says attack on communications devices was a `severe blow' The leader of Hezbollah on Thursday said this week’s deadly attack on the Lebanon-based militant group’s communications devices was a 'severe blow' that crossed a 'red line.' Hassan Nasrallah said the group is investigating how the two-day attack, which killed more than 30, wounded thousands and was widely believed to be carried out by Israel. 'Yes, we were subjected to a huge and severe blow,' Nasrallah said. 'The enemy crossed all boundaries and red lines,' he added. As usual, Nasrallah spoke by video from an undisclosed location. Hezbollah typically convenes a rally for supporters to watch his speeches on a big screen, but this time they did not. French President Emmanuel Macron expresses deep concern about the escalation PARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron has expressed 'deepest concern' that unprecedented bombings in Lebanon, which detonated hundreds of pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah, will contribute to 'a dangerous escalation of tensions in the region,' according to a statement from the French presidency Thursday. Macron’s comments come after the French leader, who aims to keep France as an important diplomatic player in Lebanon, spoke on the phone with the country’s top political and military officials. The French president urged them to 'act responsibly in order to avoid an escalation.' He also asked them to 'send messages of restraint to all Lebanese parties, starting with Hezbollah,' the statement added. Macron will speak about the dangers of an escalation with the Israeli prime minister, the statement also said, adding that 'All parties must act to avoid war.' US urges American citizens in Lebanon to keep a low profile WASHINGTON —The State Department is urging U.S. citizens in Lebanon to maintain a low profile and review their security awareness following a spate of explosions of pagers and walkie-talkies that targeted members of the militant group Hezbollah. In alerts sent to the American community in Lebanon on Tuesday and Wednesday, the U.S. Embassy in Beirut repeated existing advice to consider leaving the country and reiterated the State Department’s warning against all travel to the country. State Department and White House officials say there are long-standing contingency plans for the potential evacuation of Americans in Lebanon but that they have no information to suggest that those will become operational anytime soon. 'We have evacuation plans available for places all over the world,' National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters on Wednesday. 'But I wouldn’t lead that to believe that we’re in a moment now where we think we need to imminently call for that or act on that right now.' Previous evacuations of Americans from Lebanon have included the use of military assets but have relied mainly on chartered ferries from Beirut to Cyprus. There are tens of thousands of Americans living in and visiting Lebanon at any one time, the vast majority of whom are dual U.S.-Lebanon citizens. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez calls for restraint after receiving the Palestinian President in Madrid MADRID —Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has called for restraint following the wave of explosives attacks in the Middle East, after he received the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Madrid. 'Today the risk of escalation has again dangerously increased. President Abbas and I have been talking about it in Lebanon, so we have to make a new and strong call for restraint, for de-escalation, for peaceful coexistence between countries. In short, to peace,' said Sánchez after a 45-minute meeting with Abbas. This was the first meeting between the leaders since Spain recognized Palestine as a state on May 28, in a coordinated action with Ireland and Norway. Sanchez mentioned the strong importance that his government gave to the advisory opinion given by the International Court of Justice, which established the illegality of the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories. Abbas, for his part, called for a Middle East Peace Conference to be held in Madrid, like the one that took place 33 years ago in the Spanish capital. Second day of device explosions in Lebanon killed 25 people and wounded more than 600 others BEIRUT — Lebanon’s health minister says 25 people were killed and more than 600 wounded during the second day of exploding device attacks that were blamed on Israel. Firass Abiad told reporters on Thursday that the injuries were more severe in Wednesday's attack, since the walkie-talkies that exploded then were bigger than the pagers used a day earlier. Of the 608 people wounded on Wednesday, 61 remain in intensive care, Abiad said, adding that 141 surgeries were performed. The number of dead in the first day of attacks, on Tuesday, remained 12, the minister said, noting that more than 1,300 people suffered injuries ranging from mid-level to severe. Abiad said 226 people wounded on Tuesday remain in intensive care and 955 operations have been performed. The latest death toll raises the number of people killed by exploding devices to 37 since Tuesday, while the number of injured is above 3,000. Many of those killed and wounded were members of the militant Hezbollah group. Iranian ambassador injured in Lebanon device attack is transferred to Tehran TEHRAN, Iran — The Iranian ambassador to Lebanon, who was injured in the exploding device attacks this week, has been transferred to Tehran, the Iranian Embassy said Thursday. Ambassador Mojtaba Amani's general health is 'very good,' the embassy said in a statement. Amani along with some 90 injured Lebanese citizens were transferred to Tehran on Wednesday night, it added. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi visited Amani in a Tehran hospital, state media reported. Iran is the main supporter of Hezbollah, the militant Lebanese group that Israel sees it as its most direct threat. Many of the group’s fighters were killed and injured in the explosions on Tuesday and Wednesday. Turkish foreign minister alleges that exploding device attacks are Israeli strategy to expand war to Lebanon ANKARA, Turkey — Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan has described the waves of exploding communication devices as a strategy by Israel to expand the war in Gaza to Lebanon. Fidan, in an interview with the state-run Anadolu Agency on Thursday, also voiced concerns over a wider regional conflict. 'We have seen that (Israel) has, step by step, started to escalate (the conflict) toward Lebanon,' he said. Pagers and walkie-talkies used mainly by members of the militant Hezbollah group exploded in different parts of Lebanon over the past two days, killing killing dozens and wounding 3,000 people. 'The escalation in the region is really worrying,' Fidan said. 'We have reached the point where these operations being carried out by Israel are increasingly turning more provocative and in return, Hezbollah, Iran and other elements that are close to them are being faced with no other option than to respond.' Hezbollah says it struck military positions in northern Israel, wounding at least 8 people JERUSALEM — Hezbollah has struck what it says are military positions in northern Israel as part of its ongoing attacks in support of the Palestinians in Gaza, wounding at least eight people. The militant group has vowed to continue such operations after several of its members were killed and thousands wounded when their personal devices exploded, in what appeared to be a sophisticated attack by Israel. Hezbollah claimed to have struck three military positions near the border on Thursday, two of them with armed drones. The Israeli military said the drones crashed near communities and did not report any casualties. Sharon Koren, a spokesperson for Ziv Hospital, said two people were undergoing orthopedic surgery and four were lightly wounded in the attacks. Avi Weissman, the deputy director of Rambam Hospital, said one person was undergoing surgery and another was in moderate condition. Hezbollah began striking northern Israel shortly after Hamas’ Oct. 7 surprise attack ignited the war in Gaza. Hezbollah and Hamas are both close allies of Iran. Israel has responded to the near-daily fire with escalating strikes of its own and in recent days has warned of a wider military operation. The military said early Thursday that it had struck several militant sites in southern Lebanon overnight. Israeli strikes kill at least 10 in Gaza, including 3 women and 3 children KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip — Israeli strikes have killed at least 10 people in the Gaza Strip, including three women and three children. They were laid to rest Thursday after the overnight strikes in the southern cities of Rafah and Khan Younis. Records at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis confirmed the toll and an Associated Press reporter counted the bodies. Mohammed Abu Huweij said his wife and three children were killed while he was out getting food. 'The eldest, Mira, was 8 years old and the youngest was 9 months. What did they do?' he said. 'I left, and when I came back my entire family had been martyred.' Israel says it only targets militants and tries to avoid harming civilians in its nearly yearlong campaign against Hamas, which operates in residential areas. The military rarely comments on individual strikes, which often kill women and children. The war began after Hamas launched a surprise attack into Israel on Oct. 7 in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people and took around 250 hostage. Israel’s offensive has killed over 41,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. It does not say how many were fighters, but says a little over half were women and children. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. Lebanon bans pagers and walkie-talkies on all flights departing from Beirut airport BEIRUT — Lebanon’s civil aviation authorities have banned pagers and walkie-talkies on all airplanes departing from Beirut’s Rafik Hariri International Airport. The measure announced Thursday comes after such devices, mainly used by members of the militant Hezbollah group, exploded in different parts of Lebanon, killing dozens and wounding 3,000 people over the past two days. The authorities called on all airline companies to inform passengers using the airport that carrying pagers and walkie-talkies onto jets is banned 'until further notice.' It added that authorities will confiscate such devices found with passengers. Israeli citizen indicted for involvement in Iranian assassination plot, Israeli security officials say JERUSALEM — Israeli security officials say an Israeli citizen has been indicted for involvement in an Iranian assassination plot against top Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. A statement from the Shin Bet internal security agency on Thursday said that the citizen was recruited by Iranian intelligence to 'carry out terrorist activities' on Israeli soil and 'promote assassination attacks' on Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and the head of the Shin Bet, Ronen Bar. It was unclear how far the alleged plot had advanced. The statement did not say whether the Israeli had obtained a weapon or developed a concrete plan. The statement said the Israeli had traveled to Iran twice — once in August following the assassination of top Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in an explosion in Iran’s capital that was widely blamed on Israel. Israel has not said whether it was involved. The Shin Bet said the assassination plot was an attempt by Iran to follow through on its pledge to avenge his death. The statement said the Israeli was paid 5,000 euros ($5,575.60) but had demanded a million dollars before doing anything. The Iranians refused the demand but said they would be in touch, according to the Shin Bet. Bulgaria rejects claims that exploding devices were shipped through its territory SOFIA, Bulgaria — Bulgarian authorities rejected claims that exploding devices have been shipped through the territory of the Balkan country. 'No customs operations with communication equipment (pagers) have been carried out through the territory of Bulgaria,' the state agency for national security said in a statement on Thursday. It came in response to media reports alleging that a company registered in Bulgaria had supplied the Lebanese organization Hezbollah with the devices, which later exploded in Lebanon and Syria. The statement added that the agency was carrying out joint checks with the National Revenue Agency and the Ministry of Interior over the alleged involvement of a Bulgarian-registered company in the supply of communications equipment to Hezbollah. The Sofia-based company Norta Global Ltd., owned by a Norwegian citizen, has been linked by Hungarian media to the sale of the devices that exploded in Lebanon. Norta Global Ltd. was registered in April 2022 as a project management company, but there is no data available that they produce anything, and there are no records available about their financial operations. It is registered at the same address in downtown Sofia as 196 other companies. Japanese electronics company says walkie-talkie with its logo reportedly used in explosive attacks against Hezbollah was discontinued 10 years ago TOKYO — Japanese wireless communication equipment-maker Icom says it cannot confirm whether a walkie-talkie used in the explosive attacks against Hezbollah was related to the company, noting that the production and sales of that device and its battery were discontinued about a decade ago. The Osaka-based Icom was responding Thursday to a report that said one of the walkie-talkies used in the attacks a day earlier had a sticker with the company’s logo. Icom also noted that the device in question did not have an anti-counterfeit hologram sticker, which all authentic Icom products should be carrying. Company executive Yoshiki Enomoto told Japanese television NTV he was 'surprised' by the news. He said the company could not confirm if the unit in question was Icom-made. 'This specific device had a lot of fake copies out in the market,' he said, adding that company officials could only determine its authenticity if they see its circuits. Icom said the wireless radio unit IC-V82 was once manufactured for export including to the Middle East from 2004 to October 2014. But the production and shipment of its main unit ended about 10 years ago and batteries for the main units have also been discontinued.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-latest-19-september-2024-4d068997118172922d26887a5b191b6f	2024-09-18T22:28:46-07:00	
The Vatican is set to rule on reported apparitions of the Virgin Mary at a Bosnian shrine	VATICAN CITY (AP) — The Vatican is providing its long-awaited assessment on one of the more contested aspects of Roman Catholicism in recent years: the reported 'apparitions' of the Virgin Mary in an otherwise unremarkable village in southern Bosnia. Following nearly 15 years of study, the head of the Vatican’s doctrine office, Cardinal Víctor Manuel Fernández, is headlining a news conference Thursday on what the Vatican called 'the spiritual experience of Medjugorje.' In 1981, six children and teenagers reported seeing visions of the Madonna on a hill in the village of Medjugorje, located in the wine-making region of southern Bosnia. Some of those original 'seers' have claimed the visions have occurred regularly since then, even daily, and that Mary sends them messages. As a result, Medjugorje has become a major European pilgrimage destination for Christian believers, attracting millions of people over the years. Last year alone, 1.7 million Eucharistic wafers were distributed during Masses there, according to statistics published on the shrine’s website, a rough estimate of the numbers of Catholics who visited. However, unlike at the more well-known and established Catholic sanctuaries in Fatima, Portugal or Lourdes, France, the alleged apparitions at Medjugorje have never been declared authentic by the Vatican. And over the years, local bishops and Vatican officials have cast doubt on the reliability and motivations of the 'seers,' because of concerns that economic interests may have been driving their reports of continued visions. Religious tourism has become an important part of the local economy, with an entire industry catering to pilgrims – hotels, private accommodations, family-run farm businesses, even sports complexes and camping sites -- and popping up around Medjugorje. Their growth has contributed to the surrounding municipality's financial well-being after the Bosnian war in the 1990s devastated the economy. All of which has led to intense speculation about what, exactly, the Vatican will say Thursday, with journalists parsing the significance of the fact that the Vatican didn’t refer to 'apparitions' or 'visions' in its announcement of the briefing, but merely 'the spiritual experience of Medjugorje.' In 2010, Pope Benedict XVI appointed an international commission of theologians and bishops to formally investigate the reported apparitions, tapping his vicar of Rome, Cardinal Camillo Ruini, to head it. Pope Francis received Ruini’s report in 2013 or early 2014. In a sneak-preview, Francis in 2017 said the key of the Vatican investigation was to distinguish between the original reported visions in 1981, and the current claims of continuous apparitions, on which Francis cast doubt. 'I prefer Our Lady to be a mother, our mother, and not a telegraph operator who sends out a message every day at a certain time,' he said at the time. 'This is not the mother of Jesus and these alleged apparitions have no great value.' But in an airborne press conference returning home from Fatima, Francis added that it was undeniable that people go to Medjugorje and are converted from sin. 'This isn’t a magic wand. You can’t deny this spiritual and pastoral fact,' he said. Francis went on to appoint two personal envoys to oversee the shrine and the needs of the faithful there, and in 2019 explicitly allowed official church pilgrimages, while making clear that such permission didn’t amount to a decision about the authenticity of the reported visions. Whatever is announced Thursday, it is unlikely to be a point-blank declaration of authenticity about the Medjugorje phenomena. That is because Fernández earlier this year announced the Vatican was no longer in the business of declaring alleged visions, weeping statues and stigmata as authentic or not. He released a new criteria for examining such reports and said the Vatican would not make definitive declarations unless the reported event is clearly a hoax. The aim is to prevent the faithful from being harmed by people trying to make money off of their beliefs, he said. The new criteria envisages six main outcomes, with the most favorable being that the church issues a noncommittal doctrinal green light, a so-called 'nihil obstat.' Such a declaration means there is nothing about the event that is contrary to the faith, and therefore Catholics can express devotion to it. Whatever the outcome, it will surely impact Medjugorje, which lies in the municipality of Citluk, one of the smallest in Bosnia with some 18,000 residents but economically well-off. The municipality has declared that tourism is key for its development, largely thanks to Medjugorje, and hosts various festivals and gatherings each year organized by Christian humanitarian organizations drawn to the place. Municipal workers say 2024 could be a record year, because Christian pilgrims are tending to stay away from Israel because of the war, and are opting for Medjugorje instead. 'Medjugorje means a lot, all economic sectors lean on Medjugorje,' said Ante Kozina, the tourism association chief. 'It is a growth generator for the entire municipality.' ___ Gec contributed from Belgrade, Serbia.	https://apnews.com/article/vatican-medjugorje-shrine-pope-7141cafa786438ebd14f0980c06371d3	2024-09-18T20:37:25-07:00	
Relentless fighting is devastating Sudan and escalating in Darfur's capital, UN says	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Relentless violence has devastated Sudan and large-scale fighting has escalated in and around the only capital in Sudan’s western Darfur region not held by paramilitary forces, the United Nations top humanitarian official said Wednesday. Acting humanitarian chief Joyce Msuya told the U.N. Security Council that famine has already struck Zamzam camp, about 15 kilometers (10 miles) from North Darfur’s embattled capital of El Fasher. She said a large-scale humanitarian operation is 'a matter of life and death.' Sudan plunged into conflict in mid-April 2023, when long-simmering tensions between its military and paramilitary leaders broke out in the capital Khartoum and spread to other regions including Darfur. The U.N. says over 14,000 people have been killed and 33,000 injured. Msuya urged the council to demand that the warring government and paramilitary Rapid Support Force refrain from targeting civilians, hospitals, schools and other civilian infrastructure, and allow unimpeded delivery of humanitarian aid through all border crossings and across conflict lines. She also called on the U.N.’s 193 member nations to pressure the parties 'to agree to a humanitarian pause to save lives, give civilians respite and allow us to deliver assistance.' Two decades ago, Darfur became synonymous with genocide and war crimes, particularly by the notorious Janjaweed Arab militias, against populations that identify as Central or East African. Up to 300,000 people were killed and 2.7 million were driven from their homes. That legacy appears to have returned, with the International Criminal Court’s prosecutor, Karim Khan, saying in January there are grounds to believe both sides may be committing war crimes, crimes against humanity, or genocide in Darfur. Msuya said 'the world should not abide in El Fasher the atrocities we witnessed in West Darfur.' In June, the Security Council adopted a resolution calling for 'an immediate halt to the fighting and for de-escalation in and around El Fasher.' Regrettably, Msuya said, both sides ignored the call, and fighting escalated in the past week with 'constant and heavy' shelling and bombing. 'Civilians, especially women and children, have been hit (and) civilian sites and infrastructure — including hospitals and internally displaced persons’ camps — have been hit,' she said. 'Of the three main hospitals in El Fasher, only one is functioning, although only partially following an attack that caused extensive damage in August.' In August, international experts confirmed there is famine in Zamzam camp, which houses around 500,000 displaced people. Msuya said close to 1.7 million people in North Darfur face 'acute food insecurity,' adding that 13 other localities in Sudan have been identified as at risk of famine. In February, Doctors Without Borders reported that a child was dying every two hours in Zamzam camp, she said. The latest screening by the medical aid organization and the Ministry of Health between Sept. 1 and 5 indicates the situation is getting worse. 'About 34% of the children are malnourished, including 10% who are severely malnourished,' Msuya said. Aid deliveries have been impeded by fighting and flooding, but Msuya said that as floodwaters subside in the coming weeks, the U.N. will be able to start moving food and other assistance to El Fasher and other areas at risk of famine. The acting undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs stressed that to address 'the atrocious humanitarian situation,' there are two keys: a de-escalation in fighting and a willingness by both sides to facilitate access to those in need. 'Be in no doubt: Without safe and predictable access and a steady supply of food and humanitarian supplies, we will see a dramatic spike in mortality — including children — in Zamzam and in other areas around El Fasher,' she said. 'The same goes for the situation across Sudan,' Msuya said, especially the capital Khartoum and neighboring Sennar and Jazeera states in southeast Sudan, which continue to be devastated 'by relentless violence.'	https://apnews.com/article/un-sudan-famine-violence-el-fasher-darfur-8cc6ee91caca3e8b61d04f01791ba80c	2024-09-18T19:47:26-07:00	
Sri Lanka's presidential election a test for current leader, 2 years after its economy hit bottom	COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) — Two years ago, food cart worker Fathima Shiyama had to wait in line, sometimes for days, to get cooking gas, fuel and other essentials. It was a test of patience for her and millions of other Sri Lankans as their country languished in economic and political chaos. Since then, under President Ranil Wickremesinghe, the South Asian island nation's economy has begun a fragile recovery. As the country gears up for a crucial presidential vote, key economic indicators have improved and there are no shortages of food and fuel. Inflation is almost under control after peaking at 70%. Sri Lankans who usually vote along religious and ethnic lines will be keeping the state of the economy in mind when they vote Saturday on a new president. Many are still struggling, borrowing money or leaving the country to cope with rising living costs and limited opportunities. Shiyama says she isn’t still earning enough to cover her monthly expenses and pay for her ailing daughter’s medical tests. In desperation, she has turned to borrowing from loan sharks at an exorbitant 20% interest rate. 'We are trying our best to survive despite many difficulties,' said the 48-year-old mother of five, as she was selling 'string hopper' noodles and coconut 'pittu,' popular traditional dinner items, from a cart on the outskirts of Colombo. As Sri Lanka sank into economic collapse in 2022, a popular uprising led its then president Gotabaya Rajapaksa to flee the country. This weekend's election pits his successor, Wickremesinghe, against opposition leader Sajith Premadasa and Anura Dissanayake, leader of a Marxist-led coalition that has been gaining popularity. Poll results are due Sunday. All the candidates have promised to lead Sri Lanka into a prosperous future by developing new industries, improving agriculture, broadening the tax base to increase revenue and creating tens of thousands of new jobs. Under Wickremesinghe, Sri Lanka has been negotiating with the international creditors to restructure the country's staggering debt and get the economy back on track. The International Monetary Fund approved a four-year bailout program last year, but many Sri Lankans are unhappy over the government’s efforts to increase revenue by raising electricity rates and imposing heavy taxes on professionals and businesses, to meet IMF conditions for its assistance. Overall conditions have improved after the long dry spell during and after the pandemic. Vital tourism earnings have risen and the Sri Lankan rupee has recovered. But rising prices due to the government's austerity measures are squeezing many households. 'We are in a very critical time' said Murtaza Jafferjee, an economic analyst and chairman of Advocata Institute, a Colombo-based independent policy think tank. 'The economy is looking up,' he said, but has not fully recovered. The government should aim for at least 4% growth this year, instead of its target of 3%. Politicians need to focus on policies that don't just benefit the country's elite, Jafferjee said. 'It is high time that we run this country for the benefit of the 22 million people,' he said. Sri Lanka’s economic crisis began well before the upheavals of 2022. Staggering economic mismanagement by successive governments was compounded by poor policy choices and then the pandemic. Rajapaksa pushed through big tax cuts in 2019. Then, he banned imports of chemical fertilizer to preserve Sri Lanka’s scarce foreign reserves, hurting crop yields in a a country largely dependent on agriculture. With the war in Ukraine, food and fuel prices surged and fuel, cooking gas, medicine and food ran short. Sri Lankans lined up for government rice handouts and charity meals. Today, inflation has dropped below 5% and there's no need to line up to buy essentials. But key parts of the economy remain in crisis. Jagath Dissanayake said conditions remain dire for his construction firm in Gampaha, a town located about 30 kilometers (19 miles) north of Colombo after prices of building materials tripled. Most of Dissanayake projects are suspended and he had to lay off two-thirds of his employees. 'People have no money to do new construction as they give priority to buying essentials. We hardly get any new work,' Dissanayake said. His income is down almost 75%, he said, so there is no more dining out and Dissanayake rides a motorbike instead of driving a car, to save money on fuel. 'Of course, there are no queues for petrol anymore, but we don't have enough money to buy it.' he said. Sri Lanka’s construction industry has shed about 400,000 jobs in the last four years, according to some estimates. Once a booming industry that contributed nearly 12% to the country’s growth figures, its share has dropped to 7% this year. Many Sri Lankans have sought jobs abroad. Viraj Maduranga, formerly a teacher in a government school, went to Dubai in 2021 to find work when he became unable to repay loans he had taken to build his house and buy a vehicle. 'Either I had to sell off the house and the car, or find an alternative income. So, I decided to leave. It was not an easy decision for me and my wife, but we have to make sacrifices to build our lives,' said Maduranga, who now works as a teacher in Dubai and won’t be able to vote in the election. Not everyone is impressed with the promises made by the candidates in this election. 'We have seen it in the past, politicians saying various things, but when they come into power they have simply ignored what they have said during campaigns,' said W.A. Wijewardena, an economic analyst and former deputy governor of Sri Lanka's central bank. Jafferjee, the economic analyst, said the election is 'extremely crucial' for Sri Lanka’s economic recovery. The next president should use his executive powers to 'enact pro-consumer policies' and be more open to trade. 'This (crisis) is not insurmountable, but you need to make unpopular choices. What you need basically is a president who looks to grow the pie,' said Jafferjee. In the meantime, Sri Lankans like Maduranga are impatiently waiting for change. He longs to rejoin his wife and 8-year-old son in Sri Lanka, but still needs to repay his loans. 'This is not the best time to go back,' Maduranga said. 'I want to live in Sri Lanka as a free man without being indebted to anyone.' ___ Saaliq reported from New Delhi.	https://apnews.com/article/lanka-election-economy-wickremesinghe-imf-e2df0bbc35ea715494f6d617af0741ee	2024-09-18T19:29:52-07:00	
Adoption fraud separated generations of South Korean children from their families, AP finds	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s government, Western countries and adoption agencies worked in tandem to supply some 200,000 Korean children to parents overseas, despite years of evidence they were being procured through questionable or downright unscrupulous means, an investigation led by The Associated Press has found. Those children grew up and searched for their roots — and some realized they are not who they were told. Their stories have sparked a reckoning that is rocking the international adoption industry. The investigation, in collaboration with Frontline (PBS), was based on interviews with more than 80 adoptees in the U.S., Australia and six European countries, along with parents, agency employees, humanitarian workers and government officials. It also drew on more than 100 information requests and thousands of pages of documents — including many never publicly seen before and some the AP got declassified. In dozens of cases AP examined, it found: Children were kidnapped off the streets. Parents claim they were told their newborns were dead or very sick, only to have them shipped away. Documents were fabricated, leading adoptees to anguished later reunions with supposed parents — only to discover they were not related at all. Government officials declined to answer questions about its past, saying it will let a fact-finding commission finish its work. But in a written statement, the Health Ministry acknowledged that skyrocketing adoptions in the 1970s-80s were possibly driven by an intent to reduce welfare spending. The adoption agencies declined to comment on specific cases, but have long defended their practices as a way to search for foreign families for vulnerable children. Here are further findings: Desperate to reduce spending, South Korea targeted its weakest citizens Korea’s adoption program grew out of the wreckage of the 1950-53 Korean War, when Americans took in the unwanted biracial children of Korean women and Western soldiers. It expanded to include the children of unwed mothers and poor families. Korea relied on private adoption agencies as its social safety net, bringing millions of dollars into the economy. Korean officials fit their laws to match American ones to make children adoptable in the West, where access to birth control and abortion had caused the domestic supply of adoptable babies to plummet. The government endorsed 'proxy adoptions' for families to adopt children quickly without ever visiting Korea. Korea also rewrote its laws to remove minimal safeguards or judicial oversight. Concerns were raised early. In a 1966 internal memo obtained by AP, International Social Service, a Geneva-based organization, wrote that it suspected the Korean government assessed agencies not by child welfare standards, but by the money they brought in. Korean officials were aware that lost children were documented as abandoned; the origins of alleged orphans weren’t verified; and some were 'disguised' by agencies as being born from unwed mothers to make them adoptable, according to records seen by AP. In the early 1980s, the government itself likened the agencies’ child-hunting practices to 'trafficking.' Workers warned that adoption agencies were aggressively hunting for children Former adoption workers told AP that agencies paid to have every corner of the country scoured for children. One worker, employed at an agency from 1979 to 1984, said the agencies had no process to verify the backgrounds of children and invested 'zero effort' in confirming the child was orphaned. Private counseling records in a 1988 document prepared by the country’s largest adoption agency, Holt Children’s Services, show that some parents who relinquished their children soon pleaded for them back, with no success. The document, obtained by AP, describes how agency’s workers told parents that their children would thrive in good Western families and may return home someday rich or 'with Ph.Ds.' Humanitarian workers openly worried about what they were seeing. Francis Carlin, who then ran Korea’s Catholic Relief Services, said there weren’t enough legitimate orphans to feed Western demand, which led to 'a lot of the compromises, a lot of the hanky panky' involving larger agencies. 'These, I would call them brokers, were going out and trying to get more and more children,' Carlin said. 'They would put the legitimate parent on a guilt trip and say, what are you doing? You can’t afford to take care of this child…. You’re so selfish.' Children were stolen from parents, bought from hospitals and falsely described as abandoned By the 1980s, agencies were procuring most of their children directly from hospitals and maternity homes, which often received illegal payments for babies, according to records seen by AP. Though the stated intention of adoption was to spare children from orphanages, they gathered more than 4,600 children from hospitals in 1988, 60% of their supply. A government audit in 1989 shows that Holt Children’s Services, the biggest agency, made nearly 100 illegal payments to hospitals during six months in 1988, worth about $16,000 now. Eastern Social Welfare Society gave even more, worth about $65,340, to hospitals over that period. Despite the agencies' common practice of labeling children as 'abandoned,' records from 1980 to 1987 show that more than 90% of the Korean children sent to the West almost certainly had known relatives, said Philsik Shin, a scholar at Korea’s Anyang University. It was 'almost customary' to document children as abandoned, said Helen Noh, who matched hundreds of children with U.S. parents at Holt from 1981 to 1982. As complaints mount, South Korea is under pressure Robyn Joy Park, who was adopted by parents in Minnesota in 1982, traveled to South Korea in 2007 to meet a woman her agency, Eastern, said was her biological mother. She developed a deep bond with the woman over several years, but was devastated after a DNA test in 2012 showed they weren’t related. The AP spoke to 10 others who found their identity was switched with someone else. When children processed for adoption died, became too sick to travel or were found by their biological families, agencies often replaced them with other children, according to former adoption workers. At a meeting with an adoptee in 2021 where AP was present, a longtime worker said Western partner agencies were willing to take 'any child of the same sex and similar age, because it would take too much time to start over again.' Park is among more than 360 adoptees who have asked South Korea’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate the circumstances surrounding their adoptions. Nobody knows how many Korean adoptions were questionable or even fraudulent, in part because of the privacy and sensitivities involved along with the vagueness and unreliability of the documents. Advocates say many adoptions have happy endings.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-international-adoption-fraud-investigation-takeaways-25fb71223bf86bfd0709863e5063faba	2024-09-18T19:27:48-07:00	
Rampant adoption fraud separated generations of South Korean children from their families, AP finds	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — As the plane descended into Seoul, Robert Calabretta swaddled himself in a blanket, his knees tucked into his chest like a baby in the womb. A single tear ran down his cheek. The 34-year-old felt like a newborn — he was about to meet his parents for the first time since he was 3 days old. Most of his life, he thought they’d abandoned him for adoption to the United States. When he finally found them, he learned the truth: The origin story on his adoption paperwork was a lie. Instead, he said, his parents were told in 1986 that their infant was very sick and they thought he had died. 'I am so sorry,' his birth father had written when they found each other, his words interrupted by fits of weeping. 'I miss you. How did you endure this cruel world?' Calabretta is among a growing and vocal community of victims of an adoption system they accuse of searching out children for would-be parents, rather than finding parents for vulnerable children — sometimes with devastating consequences only surfacing today. South Korea’s government, Western countries and adoption agencies worked in tandem to supply some 200,000 Korean children to parents overseas, despite years of evidence they were being procured through questionable or downright unscrupulous means, an investigation led by The Associated Press found. Those children grew up and searched for their roots — and some realized they are not who they were told. Their stories have sparked a reckoning that is rocking the international adoption industry, which was built in South Korea and spread around the world. European countries have launched investigations and halted international adoption. The South Korean government has accepted a fact-finding commission under pressure from adoptees, and hundreds have submitted their cases for review. The AP investigation, done in collaboration with Frontline (PBS), was based on interviews with more than 80 adoptees in the U.S., Australia and six European countries, along with parents, agency employees, humanitarian workers and government officials. It also drew on more than 100 information requests and thousands of pages of documents — including many never publicly seen before and some the AP got declassified — from courts, archives, government files and adoption papers. In dozens of cases AP examined with Frontline, it found: Children were kidnapped off the streets and sent abroad. Parents claim they were told their newborns were dead or too sick to survive, only to have them shipped away. Documents were fabricated to give children identities that belonged to somebody else, leading adoptees to anguished reunions with supposed parents — to later discover they were not related at all. The agencies and governments each played a part in keeping the baby pipeline pumping. Adoption agencies created a competitive market for children and paid hospitals to supply them, documents show. The South Korean government not only knew of fraudulent practices but designed laws to speed up the exportation of children it deemed undesirable. Western governments turned a blind eye, sometimes even pressuring South Korea for children, while promoting the narrative that they were saving orphans with no other options. Calabretta doesn’t believe he was saved; he believes he was stolen. And many in his network of adult adoptees believe they were, too. Advocates say the vast majority of adoptions are honest and end well. But it is impossible to know how many adoptions are fraudulent because unreliable documents prevent adoptees from finding their birth families and learning the truth. Government data obtained by AP shows less than a fifth of 15,000 adoptees like Calabretta, who have asked South Korea for help with family searches since 2012, have managed to reunite with relatives. In 2019, a Korean government agency told Calabretta they had found his father. He pictured himself as a rock on a beach, with two waves crashing over it. The first was joy — he had been loved. The other was fury that something profound had been taken from him. 'You’re constantly in flux between two worlds,' he said, 'the one you could have and should have been in, and the one where you are.' 'A baby factory' Adoptions from South Korea peaked in the 1980s, fueled by the government, just as Calabretta’s parents arrived at the hospital with a blanket in which to carry their firstborn son home. The adoption industry had grown out of the wreckage of the Korean War in the 1950s, when Americans took in the unwanted biracial children born of Korean women and Western soldiers. As it clawed its way out of post-war poverty, South Korea continued to rely on private adoption agencies as its social safety net, bringing millions of dollars into the economy and saving even more by never building its own child welfare program. Meanwhile, in the West, the number of adoptable babies plummeted because of access to birth control and abortion. The desires of two cultures collided: couples in wealthy nations desperately wanted babies, and South Korea desperately wanted to rid itself of mouths to feed. As the supply of biracial babies dwindled, South Korea turned to those it saw as unwelcome citizens: fully-Korean children of poor families and unwed mothers. Korean officials fit their laws to match American ones to make children adoptable for what some deride as 'baby diplomacy' to satisfy Western demand. The government endorsed 'proxy adoptions,' for families to adopt children quickly without ever visiting Korea, meeting them by the planeloads at American airports. In an internal memo from 1966 obtained by AP, International Social Service, a Geneva-based organization, wrote that it suspected the Korean government assessed agencies not by child welfare standards, but by the money they brought in. 'There is quite a bit of rivalry and competition among the different agencies, and it is not beyond agencies to bribe or pressure mothers for the release of these children, and not beyond agencies to try to compete with each other for the same child,' officials noted in the document, now at the agency’s archives at the University of Minnesota Libraries. In 1976, Patricia Nye, east Asia director for ISS, concluded in a memo that the South Korean government was 'entirely irresponsible.' What was happening, she wrote, was 'close to being scandalous, the mass exportation of children, Korea has been called a baby factory.' Nye, who has died, said publicly on a BBC program called 'A Traffic in Babies,' that Korean adoptions had 'gone out of control.' 'We are not talking about little pets or pieces of wood,' Nye said into the camera. 'It’s almost like a trade in children … Asian children flowing from Asia to Europe and North America.' The Korean government tried to downplay the concerns. Documents reveal an official insisted the show — which described the country’s adoption program as 'baby wholesaling' — actually depicted it as 'organized and well-managed.' In December 1976, the government facilitated a new law that widened the legal definition of adoptable children, removed judicial oversight and granted vast powers to the heads of private agencies. The government empowered four agencies to handle most adoptions: Holt Children’s Services, which had pioneered sending Korean children to the U.S., and three others, Eastern Social Welfare Society, Korea Welfare Services and Korea Social Service. A 1983 Health Ministry audit cited all four agencies and accused Holt of providing larger-than-allowed payments to impoverished birth mothers. The ministry’s response was to issue a 'warning.' Records show that officials were aware of a laundry list of dubious practices in the industry: lost children were documented as abandoned; the origins of alleged orphans weren’t verified; some were 'disguised' by agencies as being born from unwed mothers to make them adoptable, according to Health Ministry records seen by AP. In the early 1980s, the government itself likened the agencies’ child-hunting practices to 'trafficking.' At a meeting in 1982, documents show, the ministry admitted to child 'intake' problems and cautioned agencies to improve their practices to avoid the appearance of 'trafficking, profiteering.' Yet the government still called for 'as many adoptions as possible.' Calabretta was taken from the Red Cross Hospital in Daegu in 1986. His father, Lee Sung-soo, said an administrator told him his son had serious lung and heart problems. The family didn’t have a lot of money. The only option, the administrator said, was a high-risk and very expensive surgery that could leave the baby dead or severely disabled. She advised Lee to relinquish his son to Holt, which would pay for the surgery and find a home for a disabled child if he survived. Lee said he signed the paper, believing it was the only way to save his son, and wept. The AP could not verify Lee’s account — the hospital closed and its records were destroyed. Information obtained through a records request show that 470 children born in that hospital were adopted during the 80s and 90s. 'It felt like the sky was falling,' Lee said. 'I felt like my heart was being ripped apart.' By then, agencies were procuring most of their children directly from hospitals and maternity homes, which often received illegal payments for babies, records show. Though the stated intention of adoption was to spare children from orphanages, they gathered more than 4,600 children from hospitals in 1988, 60% of their supply. 'In paying rewards for childbirth delivery costs to hospitals, maternity homes, local administrative offices and others when acquiring children for adoption,' the Health Ministry wrote in 1988, 'the social welfare institutions (agencies) have lost their morality and have descended to become trafficking institutions.' A government audit the following year shows that Holt made nearly 100 illegal payments to hospitals during six months in 1988, worth about $16,000 now. Eastern Social Welfare Society gave even more, now worth about $64,000, to hospitals over that period. The South Korean government declined to answer questions about its responsibility for the past, saying it will let the fact-finding commission finish its work. In a statement, the Health Ministry acknowledged that skyrocketing adoptions in the 1970s-80s were possibly driven by an intent to reduce welfare spending to balance cuts in foreign aid. Lee Moo-ja, a retired local official in Boryeong city, recalled a sense of helplessness during the 1980s. Abandoned children were supposed to be reported to city officials, who would assign them to an orphanage, she said. But instead, agencies were directly scooping them up, and the pleading letters she sent to hospitals went nowhere. The national government wasn’t interested in enforcement, she said, leaving local officials like her powerless to stop it. Calabretta’s parents felt powerless too; they got onto an elevator with other couples holding their newborn children. All they had was the empty blanket. ___ 'Is this really all for children?' With the government on their side, agencies raced against time for children. Employees were told to process them as quickly as they could, said two former adoption workers who spoke anonymously because Korean law forbids them from publicizing confidential information. 'All I heard was work faster, faster,' said one, employed at an agency from 1979 to 1984. 'Do it faster and faster.' Even now, the woman clenches her hands and clutches a pillow as she said she convinced herself they were saving orphans. She couldn’t help but quietly wonder: 'Is this really all for children?' Agencies had intake workers scour every region of the country for children, she said. They invested 'zero effort' in confirming a child was truly orphaned. She questioned whether dubious practices were baked into the system, from beginning to end. A colleague once brought in a girl allegedly abandoned in Daegu, about 145 miles away from Seoul. She refused to process the girl for adoption because she thought it was too soon to conclude she was abandoned. Not long after, the Daegu worker sent the same girl again, with the same photo — but a new name and background story that claimed she’d been abandoned earlier. The former worker said she never learned whether the girl was adopted. Some lost children ended up overseas. Laurie Bender was approached by a strange woman while playing in the front yard in South Korea in 1975. She remembers the woman saying that Bender’s family didn’t want her anymore because her mother had another baby. She went with the woman, and felt so sad she thought she might die. Bender says she was 4, but Korea calculates birthdays differently and her records say she was 6. Every day, her mother, Han Tae-soon, went to police stations, government offices, adoption agencies. Every night, she slept with a picture of her missing daughter. That picture was displayed everywhere — in subway stations, on lamp posts, on bags of snacks that advertised missing children, the Korean version of American milk cartons. But Bender was on the other side of the globe — sent by Holt to an American family who believed she was an orphan. The U.S. took in the highest number of orphans by far, and to be eligible for a visa, they had to have lost one or both parents to death, disappearance or abandonment. The agencies seized on the word abandonment, applying it to most of the children they acquired. Records from 1980 to 1987 show that more than 90% of the Korean children sent to the West almost certainly had known relatives, said Philsik Shin, a scholar at Korea’s Anyang University. The number of children sent for adoption was often more than 10 times higher than the police count for abandoned children, he found — close to 9,000 in 1985. Listing children as abandoned made adoptions easier because agencies didn’t have to verify child origins or obtain parental relinquishment. It was 'almost customary' to document children as abandoned, said Helen Noh, who matched hundreds of children with U.S. parents at Holt Children’s Services from 1981 to 1982. Now a scholar at Seoul’s Soongsil University, Noh said Holt workers understood the agency was charging adopters about $3,000 per child. 'My salary was 240,000 won, which is like less than $200 a month,' Noh said. 'If you send one child … that amount could pay at least one worker for the whole year.' Documents obtained by AP show that agencies were likely charging even more, around $4,000 to $6,000. But they pocketed some of that money through improper means, such as charging for travel expenses for adoption workers but arranging for commercial passengers to carry babies instead. Workers tried to meet specific requests from adoptive families. Some asked for siblings, Noh said, so she and her colleagues would compete over the small number of twins in their networks. Another former worker, employed at two agencies from the 1970s to early 1990s, said anybody facing challenges in raising their children would be strongly encouraged to give them away. 'Many of the children we gathered would have stayed with their biological parents with a little help,' the former worker said. 'But what we heard (from management) was always the same – if we don’t take that child, another adoption agency will.' Private counseling records in a 1988 Holt document obtained by AP show that some parents who relinquished their children soon pleaded for them back. The agency’s workers told them that their children would thrive under good Western parents and may return home someday rich or 'with Ph.Ds.' In one case, a mother returned and asked to see her son. The boy was still in Seoul, but a Holt worker told the mother he’d been flown to the U.S. 'After being told the lie,' the worker wrote, 'the birth mother began to regain her peace of mind as expected.' Susan Soonkeum Cox, who long worked for Holt International, the Oregon-based U.S. arm of the Holt adoption network, denied widespread problems. She said the goal was always to find good homes for children who would have otherwise grown up in orphanages. 'Has there been some activity that shouldn’t have happened? Probably. We’re human and everybody is different. There’s good social workers, there’s bad social workers, there’s good employees, bad employees,' she said. 'But…the accusation of systemic, deliberate wrongdoing, that I reject.' The Seoul-based Holt Children’s Services, which split from the American agency in the 1970s, and the three other Korean agencies declined to comment on specific cases. Holt Korea has in recent years denied accusations of wrongdoing and attributed adoptee complaints to misunderstandings and Korea’s social welfare issues. Kim Jin Sook, president of Eastern, has said the agency carried out government policies to find homes for 'discarded children.' But some other agencies on the ground started closing their programs because of ethical concerns. In the 1970s, Francis Carlin ran South Korea’s Catholic Relief Services, which facilitated about 30 adoptions a month, compared to hundreds by the larger agencies. The demand from the West was intense, and there weren’t enough legitimate orphans to feed it, he said, leading to 'a lot of the compromises, a lot of the hanky panky.' The larger agencies toured orphanages, grabbing up healthy babies and leaving older and disabled children, he said. 'These, I would call them brokers, were going out and trying to get more and more children,' Carlin said when reached by AP. 'They would put the legitimate parent on a guilt trip and say, what are you doing? You can’t afford to take care of this child…. Why don’t you just step back and let them have a better life? You’re so selfish.' One Korean social worker expressed disgust in words so crushing they stuck with Carlin all these years: 'It’s sickening, just sickening.' Catholic Relief Services ceased its adoption program in 1974. Carlin remembers standing up at a meeting of humanitarian organizations: 'We are beginning to slide into the abyss,' he said. Four decades later, Laurie Bender took a DNA test because her own daughter was curious about their heritage. In 2019, she got a call: 'Your mother has been looking for you.' Bender dropped the phone. 'It’s like a hole in your heart has been healed, you finally feel like a complete person,' Bender said. 'It’s like you’ve been living a fake life and everything you know is not true.' Bender and her daughter flew to South Korea just weeks later. Her mother, Han Tae-soon, wore her best outfit and lipstick for the first time in a long time. She recognized her daughter immediately in the airport and ran to her, screaming, moaning, running her fingers through her hair. Han, who is in her 70s, has notebooks feverishly annotated with English translations, written during countless hours trying to learn her daughter’s language. Amid the photos of her children on her living room wall is a black-and-white one of Bender as a little girl, stuck in time. Han plans to sue the South Korean government and Holt for robbing them of ever having a real relationship. 'I feel like I am dying. I really am dying,' she said. 'There’s so little time for me.' She jabbed her finger at paperwork that sent her daughter away. 'Isn’t this a government seal?' she demanded. 'Why did you make this up and sell away other people’s children?' ___ This story is part of an ongoing investigation led by The Associated Press in collaboration with FRONTLINE (PBS). The investigation includes an interactive and the upcoming documentary South Korea’s Adoption Reckoning, premiering Sept. 20 on PBS &amp; online. —- Switched identities This system turned children into people with no history, no parents, no ties. Many adoptees will never know the basic facts of their lives — their birthdays, their birth parents, if they were wanted or truly abandoned — because their documents are false. Robyn Joy Park, adopted to the United States, cherished her documents so much that she tattooed her adoption number — 82C-1320 — on her back. It was her only tether to her motherland. Those documents said she was a girl named Park Joo Young, born in Busan in August 1982, and her unmarried mother couldn’t afford to keep her. In 2007, Park traveled to Korea to meet the woman that her adoption agency, Eastern, listed as her mother. Their bond deepened slowly over years. They visited relatives, held hands, shared hotel rooms — the mother spoonfed her rice. The woman’s son changed his name to Park Joon Young, to share the 'Young' syllable in line with Korean naming traditions for siblings. Five years passed. Park asked the woman to take a DNA test in the hope of finding her father. They were not related. She was not Park Joo Young — she was another, unknown, girl. 'I really was so hurt and stunned and devastated and incredibly angry,' Park said. 'I could only imagine what it was like for her.' She lost touch with the woman, although she remains in contact with the man she considered her brother. Her agency offered her nothing but an apology, and declined to comment when reached by AP. Her story is not uncommon. When children processed for adoption died, became too sick to travel or were found by their biological families, agencies often replaced them with other children instead of redoing the process from scratch, according to former adoption workers. At a meeting with an adoptee in 2021 where AP was present, a longtime worker said Western partner agencies were willing to take 'any child of the same sex and similar age, because it would take too much time to start over again.' The AP has spoken to 10 others who found that their identity was switched with someone else. One of them, Mia Sang Jørnø, raised in Denmark, developed a close relationship with the family of the man listed as her father by her agency, Korea Social Service. She attended his funeral in 2000, even joining relatives as they received guests through the traditional three-day mourning procession. He had given her the name of her mother, and she worked up the courage to contact her. They took a DNA test. They weren’t related. The agency told her that her paperwork was mistaken, and she wasn’t even the girl named on her documents, Park Sang Ok. She was Kim Eun-hye. She had mourned a father who wasn’t hers. 'I always have this kind of restlessness, she said, 'of just not knowing that part of me, my identity.' KSS did not respond to questions. In letters seen by AP and Frontline, the agency has admitted to adoptees that the stories on their paperwork were invented to get the adoptions through. 'I would like to apologize for the wrong information in your adoption paper,' a KSS worker wrote to a Danish adoptee in 2016. 'It was made up just for adoption procedure.' The worker could not be reached by AP. In 2022, the agency emailed another adoptee that their 'real background is different' than listed, apologizing that the discrepancy might 'confuse' them. Neither Park nor Jørnø ever found their real parents. They both think often of the girls whose identities they were given, and wonder: What happened to her? ___ 'We were supposed to be a happy family' The Korean government cracked down on the adoption industry when the 1988 Olympics brought attention to the baby trade as a national shame. The Health Ministry instructed agencies to 'improve' their practices and stop 'touring' hospitals and orphanages to gather children, according to a document obtained by AP. They were told they could be punished if they continued to 'competitively engage in unlawful practices.' Adoptions plummeted, from around 8,000 a year in the mid-1980s to around 2,000 a year in the 1990s. But tens of thousands of children were already overseas, including Calabretta. Hospital officials told Calabretta’s mother to assume he had died. She went to a temple three times to offer a Buddhist ceremony to bless the soul of the dead. The documents that went with him to the U.S. in 1986 described him as a 'normal healthy baby, adoptable,' born to an unwed mother, and made no mention of a surgery. Calabretta returned to South Korea in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. His father, Lee Sung-soo, could not wait out the two-week quarantine and showed up outside the apartment the next day. Calabretta threw open the window. 'Dad!' he shouted. 'My son!' Lee shouted back. 'We were supposed to be a happy family, not separated. He was my precious firstborn son,' Lee said. 'For over 30 years, he lived in a foreign land against his will. That makes my heart break.' Calabretta visits South Korea often, and they talk on the phone every few days. He has the same odd divot in his ear as his mother, the same laugh as his father, the same taste in shoes and jackets and music, the same allergies. All those years, Calabretta’s mother kept the blanket she’d carried empty out of the hospital, a symbol of the absence where her son should be. He asked her to rename him, to reclaim him, as her son and a son of Korea. In Korea, there is a sentiment that something isn’t truly yours until you name it, and once you do, you must take care of it. So he prefers his new name now: Hanil Lee. ___ AP reporter Lori Hinnant and researcher Rhonda Shafner and Frontline's Lora Moftah and Emily Sternlicht contributed to this report. ___ COMING TOMORROW: The role of the West Robert Calabretta blames not just South Korea but also the United States for taking him away from his parents and adopting him out to an American family. 'What higher trophy is it of domination than taking one’s children and carting them off?' he asked. 'The audacity of that. And it’s all tied in a bow of, ‘you must feel so lucky that you’re adopted.’' Western governments turned a blind eye to rampant fraud and pressured the South Korean government to keep the kids coming, an Associated Press investigation has found.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-international-adoption-fraud-investigation-e4e7d4b8823212e3b260517c5128cd66	2024-09-18T19:20:20-07:00
