Why Greenland? Remote but resource-rich island occupies a key position in a warming world	Remote, icy and mostly pristine, Greenland plays an outsized role in the daily weather experienced by billions of people and in the climate changes taking shape all over the planet. Greenland is where climate change, scarce resources, tense geopolitics and new trade patterns all intersect, said Ohio University security and environment professor Geoff Dabelko. The world's largest island is now 'central to the geopolitical, geoeconomic competition in many ways,' partly because of climate change, Dabelko said. Since his first term in office, President-elect Donald Trump has expressed interest in acquiring Greenland, which is a semiautonomous territory of Denmark, a longtime U.S. ally and a founding member of NATO. It is also home to a large U.S. military base. Why is Greenland coveted? Think of Greenland as an open refrigerator door or thermostat for a warming world, and it's in a region that is warming four times faster than the rest of the globe, said New York University climate scientist David Holland. Locked inside are valuable rare earth minerals needed for telecommunications, as well as uranium, billions of untapped barrels of oil and a vast supply of natural gas that used to be inaccessible but is becoming less so. Many of the same minerals are currently being supplied mostly by China, so other countries such as the United States are interested, Dabelko said. Three years ago, the Denmark government suspended oil development offshore from the territory of 57,000 people. But more than the oil, gas or minerals, there's ice — a 'ridiculous' amount, said climate scientist Eric Rignot of the University of California, Irvine. If that ice melts, it would reshape coastlines across the globe and potentially shift weather patterns in such a dramatic manner that the threat was the basis of a Hollywood disaster movie. Greenland holds enough ice that if it all melts, the world's seas would rise by 24 feet (7.4 meters). Nearly a foot of that is so-called zombie ice, already doomed to melt no matter what happens, a 2022 study found. Since 1992, Greenland has lost about 182 billion tons (169 billion metric tons) of ice each year, with losses hitting 489 billion tons a year (444 billion metric tons) in 2019. Greenland will be 'a key focus point' through the 21st century because of the effect its melting ice sheet will have on sea levels, said Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colorado. 'It will likely become a bigger contributor in the future.' That impact is 'perhaps unstoppable,' NYU's Holland said. Are other climate factors at play? Greenland also serves as the engine and on/off switch for a key ocean current that influences Earth's climate in many ways, including hurricane and winter storm activity. It's called the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, or AMOC, and it's slowing down because more fresh water is being dumped into the ocean by melting ice in Greenland, Serreze said. A shutdown of the AMOC conveyor belt is a much-feared climate tipping point that could plunge Europe and parts of North America into prolonged freezes, a scenario depicted in the 2004 movie 'The Day After Tomorrow.' 'If this global current system were to slow substantially or even collapse altogether — as we know it has done in the past — normal temperature and precipitation patterns around the globe would change drastically,' said climate scientist Jennifer Francis of the Woodwell Climate Research Center. 'Agriculture would be derailed, ecosystems would crash, and ‘normal’ weather would be a thing of the past.' Greenland is also changing color as it melts from the white of ice, which reflects sunlight, heat and energy away from the planet, to the blue and green of the ocean and land, which absorb much more energy, Holland said. Greenland plays a role in the dramatic freeze that two-thirds of the United States is currently experiencing. And back in 2012, weather patterns over Greenland helped steer Superstorm Sandy into New York and New Jersey, according to winter weather expert Judah Cohen of the private firm Atmospheric and Environmental Research. Because of Greenland's mountains of ice, it also changes patterns in the jet stream, which brings storms across the globe and dictates daily weather. Often, especially in winter, a blocking system of high pressure off Greenland causes Arctic air to plunge to the west and east, smacking North America and Europe, Cohen said. Why is Greenland's location so important? Because it straddles the Arctic circle between the United States, Russia and Europe, Greenland is a geopolitical prize that the U.S. and others have eyed for more than 150 years. It's even more valuable as the Arctic opens up more to shipping and trade. None of that takes into consideration the unique look of the ice-covered island that has some of the Earth's oldest rocks. 'I see it as insanely beautiful. It's eye-watering to be there,' said Holland, who has conducted research on the ice more than 30 times since 2007. 'Pieces of ice the size of the Empire State Building are just crumbling off cliffs and crashing into the ocean. And also, the beautiful wildlife, all the seals and the killer whales. It’s just breathtaking.' ___ Read more of AP’s climate coverage at http://www.apnews.com/climate-and-environment ___ Follow Seth Borenstein on X at @borenbears ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Flying taxis are on the horizon as aviation soars into a new frontier	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — When he was still a boy making long, tedious trips between his school and his woodsy home in the mountains during the 1980s, JoeBen Bevirt began fantasizing about flying cars that could whisk him to his destination in a matter of minutes. As CEO of Joby Aviation, Bevirt is getting closer to turning his boyhood flights of fancy into a dream come true as he and latter-day versions of the Wright Brothers launch a new class of electric-powered aircraft vying to become taxis in the sky. The aircraft — known as 'electric vertical take-off and landing vehicle, or eVTOL — lift off the ground like a helicopter before flying at speeds up to 200 miles per hour (322 kilometers per hour) with a range of about 100 miles (161 kilometers). And these craft do it without filling the air with excessive noise caused by fuel-powered helicopters and small airplanes. 'We are just a few steps from the finish line. We want to turn what are now one- and two-hour trips into five-minute trips,' Bevirt, 51, told The Associated Press before a Joby air taxi took off on a test flight in Marina, California — located about 40 miles south from where he grew up in the mountains. Archer Aviation, a Silicon Valley a Silicon Valley company backed by automaker Stellantis and United Airlines, has been testing its own eTVOLs over farmland in Salinas, California, where a prototype called 'Midnight' could be seen gliding above a tractor plowing fields last November. The tests are part of the journey that Joby Aviation and other ambitious companies that collectively have raised billions of dollars are taking to turn flying cars into more than just pie-in-the-sky concepts popularized in 1960s-era cartoon series, 'The Jetsons,' and the 1982 science fiction film, 'Blade Runner.' Archer Aviation and nearby Wisk Aero, with ties to aerospace giant Boeing Co. and Google co-founder Larry Page, are also at the forefront in the race to bring air taxis to market in the United States. Joby has already formed a partnership to connect its air taxis with Delta Air Lines passengers while Archer Aviation has lined up a deal to sell up to 200 of its aircraft to United Airlines. Flying taxis have made enough regulatory inroads with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to result in the recent creation of a new aircraft category called 'powered lift,' a step that the agency hadn't taken since helicopters were introduced for civilian use in the 1940s. But there are more regulatory hurdles to be cleared before air taxis will be allowed to carry passengers in the U.S., making Dubai the most likely place where eVTOLs will take commercial flight — perhaps by the end of this year. 'It’s a tricky business to develop a whole new class of vehicles,' said Adam Lim, director of Alton Aviation Consultancy, a firm tracking the industry's evolution. 'It is going to be like a crawl, walk, run situation. Right now, I think we are still crawling. We are not going to have the Jetsons-type reality where everyone will be flying around everywhere in the next two to three years.' China is also vying to make flying cars a reality, a quest that has piqued President-elect Donald Trump's interest in making the vehicles a priority for his incoming administration during the next four years. If the ambitions of eVTOL pioneers are realized in the U.S., people will be able to hop in an air taxi to get to and from airports serving New York and Los Angeles within the next few years. Because its electric taxis can fly unimpeded at high speeds, Joby envisions transporting up to four Delta Air Lines passengers at a time from New York area airports to Manhattan in about 10 minutes or less. To start, air taxi prices almost certainly will be significantly more that the cost of taking a cab or Uber ride from JFK airport to Manhattan, but the difference could narrow over time because eVTOLs should be able to transport a higher volume of passengers than ground vehicles stuck in traffic going each way. 'You will see highways in the sky,' Archer Aviation CEO Adam Goldstein predicted during an interview at the company's San Jose, California, headquarters. 'There will be hundreds, maybe thousands of these aircraft flying in these individual cities and it will truly change the way cities are being built.' Investors are betting Goldstein is right, helping Archer raise an additional $430 million late last year from a group that included Stellantis and United Airlines. The infusion came shortly after a Japanese automaker poured another $500 million into Joby to bring its total investment in that company to nearly $900 million. Those investments were part of the $13 billion that eTVOL companies have raised during the past five years, according to Alton Aviation. Both Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation went public in 2021 through reverse mergers, opening up another fundraising avenue and making it easier to recruit engineers with the allure of stock options. Both companies have been able to attract workers away from electric automaker Tesla and rocket maker SpaceX and, in Archer's instance, raiding the ranks of Wisk Aero. The Wisk defections triggered a lawsuit accusing Archer of intellectual property theft in a dispute that was resolved with a 2023 settlement that included an agreement for the two sides to collaborate on some facets of eTVOL technology. Before going public, Joby also acquired eTVOL technology developed by ride-hailing service Uber in an $83 million deal that also brought those two companies together as partners. But none of the deals or technological advances have stopped the losses from piling up at the companies building flying cars. Joby, whose roots date back to 2009 when Bevirt founded the company, has sustained $1.6 billion in losses since its inception while Archer has amassed nearly $1.5 billion in losses since its founding in 2018. While they moved to commercial air taxi services, both Joby and Archer are trying to bring in revenue by negotiating contracts to use their eTVOLs in the U.S. military for deliveries and other other short-range missions. Archer has forged a partnership with Anduril Industries, a military defense technology specialist founded by Oculus headset inventor Palmer Luckey, to help it win deals. The uncertain prospects have left both companies with relatively low market values by tech industry standards, with Joby's hovering around $7 billion and Archer's $6 billion. But Bevirt sees blue skies ahead. 'eVTOLs are going to transform the way we move,' he said. 'It’s a dramatically better way to get around. Seeing the world from the air is better than being stuck in the traffic on the interstate.'	https://apnews.com/article/flying-taxi-joby-archer-evtol-545557562387e946a277fa1b899638ed	2025-01-07T10:50:49-08:00	
Trump says he will change the name of the Gulf of Mexico	President-elect Donald Trump said Tuesday that he would move to try to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the 'Gulf of America,' a name he said has a 'beautiful ring to it.' It's his latest suggestion to redraw the map of the Western Hemisphere. Trump has repeatedly referred to Canada as the '51st State,' demanded that Denmark consider ceding Greenland, and called for Panama to return the Panama Canal. Here's a look at his comment and what goes into a name. Why is Trump talking about renaming the Gulf of Mexico? Since his first run for the White House in 2016, Trump has repeatedly clashed with Mexico over a number of issues, including border security and the imposition of tariffs on imported goods. He vowed then to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and make Mexico pay for it. The U.S. ultimately constructed or refurbished about 450 miles of wall during his first term. The Gulf of Mexico is often referred to as the United States' 'Third Coast' due to its coastline across five southeastern states. Mexicans use a Spanish version of the same name for the gulf: 'El Golfo de México.' Americans and Mexicans diverge on what to call another key body of water, the river that forms the border between Texas and the Mexican states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas. Americans call it the Rio Grande; Mexicans call it the Rio Bravo. Can Trump change the name of the Gulf of Mexico? Maybe, but it's not a unilateral decision, and other countries don't have to go along. The International Hydrographic Organization — of which both the United States and Mexico are members — works to ensure all the world’s seas, oceans and navigable waters are surveyed and charted uniformly, and also names some of them. There are instances where countries refer to the same body of water or landmark by different names in their own documentation. It can be easier when a landmark or body of water is within a country's boundaries. In 2015, then-President Barack Obama approved an order from the Department of Interior to rename Mount McKinley — the highest peak in North America — to Denali, a move that Trump has also said he wants to reverse. Just after Trump's comments on Tuesday, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia said during an interview with podcaster Benny Johnson that she would direct her staff to draft legislation to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico, a move she said would take care of funding for new maps and administrative policy materials throughout the federal government. How did the Gulf of Mexico get its name? The body of water has been depicted with that name for more than four centuries, an original determination believed to have been taken from a Native American city of 'Mexico.' Has renaming the Gulf of Mexico come up before? Yes. In 2012, a member of the Mississippi Legislature proposed a bill to rename portions of the gulf that touch that state's beaches 'Gulf of America,' a move the bill author later referred to as a 'joke.' That bill, which was referred to a committee, did not pass. Two years earlier, comedian Stephen Colbert had joked on his show that, following the massive Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, it should be renamed 'Gulf of America' because, 'We broke it, we bought it.' Are there other international disputes over the names of places? There's a long-running dispute over the name of the Sea of Japan among Japan, North Korea, South Korea and Russia, with South Korea arguing that the current name wasn't commonly used until Korea was under Japanese rule. At an International Hydrographic Organization meeting in 2020, member states agreed on a plan to replace names with numerical identifiers and develop a new digital standard for modern geographic information systems. The Persian Gulf has been widely known by that name since the 16th century, although usage of 'Gulf' and 'Arabian Gulf' is dominant in many countries in the Middle East. The government of Iran threatened to sue Google in 2012 over the company's decision not to label the body of water at all on its maps. There have been other conversations about bodies of water, including from Trump’s 2016 opponent. According to materials revealed by WikiLeaks in a hack of her campaign chairman’s personal account, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2013 told an audience that, by China’s logic that it claimed nearly the entirety of the South China Sea, then the U.S. after World War II could have labeled the Pacific Ocean the 'American Sea.' ___ Kinnard reported from Chapin, South Carolina, and can be reached at http://x.com/MegKinnardAP.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-gulf-of-mexico-bc438f4feca1234475a1adef99344da7	2025-01-07T10:36:30-08:00	
Harris will travel to Asia, Mideast and Europe during her final week in office	WASHINGTON (AP) — Vice President Kamala Harris plans to close out her term with an around-the-world trip making stops in Singapore, Bahrain and Germany, her office said. The trip, which is scheduled to last from Jan. 13 to Jan. 17, will be a final opportunity for Harris to address U.S. foreign policy challenges before Donald Trump takes office. Second gentleman Doug Emhoff is expected to join the vice president. Although she has not disclosed her next steps after losing the presidential election, the expansive travel suggests that Harris might want to continue playing a role on the global stage. There's also speculation that Harris could run for governor of her home state of California. Dean Lieberman, Harris' deputy national security adviser, said in a written statement that 'the vice president felt it important to spend some of her final days in office thanking and engaging directly with U.S. servicemembers deployed overseas, which as she has said, has been one of her greatest privileges as vice president.' There are U.S. troops based at all three of Harris' stops. Harris plans to visit Changi Naval Base in Singapore and meet with leaders of the city-state. Singapore's location in the Indo-Pacific region makes it a key partner for addressing issues involving China, including freedom of navigation in the South China Sea. The next stop is Bahrain, where Harris will visit the headquarters of the U.S. 5th Fleet, which operates in the Persian Gulf. The fleet has been engaged in efforts to protect Israel from Iranian attacks and regional shipping activity from the Houthis in Yemen. Harris' final stop will be Spangdahlem Air Base in Germany, home to a deployment of U.S. Air Force fighter jets. She plans to talk about the importance of NATO in deterring Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly three years ago. Harris has previously visited Germany and Singapore. Bahrain will be the 22nd country she's visited during her term. 'The vice president continues to believe in a strong U.S. global leadership role because it benefits the security and prosperity of the American people, and she will reaffirm this throughout her trip,' Lieberman said.	https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-trip-singapore-bahrain-germany-emhoff-0f0eccb60d01b431ec40fbe59b16d459	2025-01-07T10:00:28-08:00	
Venezuelan opposition leader says his son-in-law has been kidnapped in Caracas	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Self-exiled Venezuelan opposition leader Edmundo González, who claims to have defeated President Nicolás Maduro in last year’s presidential election, said his son-in-law was kidnapped Tuesday in Venezuela's capital. González, who was traveling in the United States, said Rafael Tudares was kidnapped while on his way to drop off González’s two grandchildren at school in Caracas. In a post on X, González said 'hooded men, dressed in black' intercepted the vehicle and loaded Tudares 'into a gold-colored van.' He did not say what happened to his 6- and 7-year-old grandchildren. The kidnapping happened despite a significant increase in police and military presence since New Year’s Day across Caracas ahead of Friday's swearing-in ceremony for Maduro, who the government says won a third term in the July election. The government’s centralized press office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. González, a retired diplomat, represented Venezuela’s Unitary Platform opposition coalition in the presidential election, which he and Maduro both claim to have won. The platform in a statement characterized Tudares' kidnapping as a 'forced disappearance for political reasons.' 'We demand the immediate release of Rafael Tudares and all political prisoners, who are hostages of a regime that knows it is rejected by the vast majority of Venezuelans who spoke with the force of the vote (on July 28),' the coalition said in the statement. González left Venezuela for exile in Spain in September after a judge issued a warrant for his arrest in connection with an election-related investigation. In recent weeks, he has vowed to return to his homeland to take the oath of office. González, 75, is touring the Americas to try to rally support for his effort to get Maduro out of office by Friday. That's when, by law, the South American country’s next presidential term begins. On Monday, González met with U.S. President Joe Biden at the White House as well as with U.S. Rep. Mike Waltz, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s designate to be his national security adviser once he is sworn in on Jan. 20. González, who has been recognized by several governments including the U.S. as Venezuela's president-elect, has not explained how he plans to return to the troubled country or wrest power from Maduro, whose ruling United Socialist Party of Venezuela controls all aspects of government. González had never run for office before July. The Unitary Platform coalition selected him in April as a last-minute stand-in for opposition powerhouse Maria Corina Machado, who was blocked by the Maduro-controlled Supreme Tribunal of Justice from running for any office. Machado last week urged supporters to demonstrate across Venezuela on Thursday, telling them in a video message that Maduro will not step down on his own and they 'must make him leave.' Meanwhile, Maduro has asked his supporters to demonstrate Friday. But it is unclear whether anyone will heed calls to head to the streets with the increased security presence. On Tuesday, despite being the first day of school after the holidays, children were nowhere to be seen during morning rush hour in Caracas, and some schools remained closed. 'There is tension. As soon as night falls, the city is like a ghost town,' Caracas resident Mari Jimenez said. 'We do not feel confident seeing so many police.' Kidnappings were commonplace in Venezuela at the end of last and beginning of this century, when criminals targeted the wealthy and a thriving middle class. But that type of crime decreased in recent years, as the country’s economy came undone and Venezuelans began to emigrate. Recently, people have associated kidnappings with the government practice of detaining its real or perceived opponents without following the law. They are seen as part of a campaign to repress anti-government protests that broke out after the election results were announced. Electoral authorities in July declared Maduro the winner hours after polls closed, but unlike in previous presidential elections, they did not provide detailed vote counts. However, the opposition collected tally sheets from more than 80% of the nation’s electronic voting machines, posted them online and said they showed González had won the election with twice as many votes as Maduro. The U.S.-based Carter Center, which Maduro’s government invited to observe the presidential election, has said the tally sheets published by the opposition are legitimate. Hours after announcing his son-in-law's kidnapping, González announced he was continuing his multi-country tour with a visit to Panama. 'On the way to Panama! We continue,' he posted on X.	https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-opposition-leader-gonzalez-son-kidnap-1060bf16ec50c28a2eb2b9c033129431	2025-01-07T08:58:32-08:00	
Trump refuses to rule out use of military force to take control of Greenland and the Panama Canal	PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday said he would not rule out the use of military force to seize control of the Panama Canal and Greenland, as he declared U.S. control of both to be vital to American national security. Speaking to reporters less than two weeks before he takes office on Jan. 20 and as a delegation of aides and advisers that includes Donald Trump Jr. is in Greenland, Trump left open the use of the American military to secure both territories. Trump's intention marks a rejection of decades of U.S. policy that has prioritized self-determination over territorial expansion. 'I’m not going to commit to that,' Trump said, when asked if he would rule out the use of the military. 'It might be that you’ll have to do something. The Panama Canal is vital to our country.' He added, 'We need Greenland for national security purposes.' Greenland, home to a large U.S. military base, is an autonomous territory of Denmark, a longtime U.S. ally and a founding member of NATO. Trump cast doubts on the legitimacy of Denmark's claim to Greenland. The Panama Canal has been solely controlled by the eponymous country for more than 25 years. The U.S. returned the Panama Canal Zone to the country in 1979 and ended its joint partnership in controlling the strategic waterway in 1999. Addressing Trump's comments in an interview with Danish broadcaster TV2, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen called the United States Denmark’s 'most important and closest ally,' and that she did not believe that the United States will use military or economic power to secure control over Greenland. Frederiksen repeated that she welcomed the United States taking a greater interest in the Arctic region, but that it would 'have to be done in a way that is respectful of the Greenlandic people,' she said. 'At the same time, it must be done in a way that allows Denmark and the United States to still cooperate in, among other things, NATO,' Frederiksen said. Earlier, Trump posted a video of his private plane landing in Nuuk, the Arctic territory’s capital, in a landscape of snow-capped peaks and fjords. 'Don Jr. and my Reps landing in Greenland,' Trump wrote. 'The reception has been great. They, and the Free World, need safety, security, strength, and PEACE! This is a deal that must happen. MAGA. MAKE GREENLAND GREAT AGAIN!' In a statement, Greenland’s government said Donald Trump Jr.’s visit was taking place 'as a private individual' and not as an official visit, and Greenlandic representatives would not meet with him. Panamanian Foreign Minister Javier Martínez-Acha said his government hasn’t had formal contact with Trump or representatives of the incoming administration but reiterated previous comments from the country’s president, José Raúl Mulino, who said last month that the canal will remain in Panamanian hands. 'The sovereignty of our canal is not negotiable and is part of our history of struggle and an irreversible conquest,' Martínez-Acha said. Trump, a Republican, has also floated having Canada join the United States as the 51st state. He said Tuesday that he would not use military force to invade the country, which is home to more than 40 million people and is a founding NATO partner. Instead, he said, he would would rely on 'economic force' as he cast the U.S. trade deficit with Canada — a natural resource-rich nation that provides the U.S. with commodities like crude oil and petroleum — as a subsidy that would be coming to an end. Canadian leaders fired back after earlier dismissing Trump's rhetoric as a joke. 'President-elect Trump’s comments show a complete lack of understanding of what makes Canada a strong country. Our economy is strong. Our people are strong. We will never back down in the face of threats,' Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly said in a post on X. Justin Trudeau, the country's outgoing prime minister, was even more blunt. 'There isn’t a snowball’s chance in hell that Canada would become part of the United States,' he wrote. Promising a 'Golden age of America,' Trump also said he would move to try to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the 'Gulf of America,' saying that has a 'beautiful ring to it.' He also said he believes that NATO should dramatically increase its spending targets, with members of the trans-Atlantic alliance committing to spend at least 5% of their GDPs on defense spending, up from the current 2%. In June, NATO announced a record 23 of its 32 member nations were on track to hit that target as Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine has raised the threat of expanding conflict in Europe. Trump also used his press conference to complain that President Joe Biden was undermining his transition to power a day after the incumbent moved to ban offshore energy drilling in most federal waters. Biden, whose term expires in two weeks, used his authority under the federal Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to protect offshore areas along the East and West coasts, the eastern Gulf of Mexico and portions of Alaska’s Northern Bering Sea from future oil and natural gas leasing. All told, about 625 million acres of federal waters were withdrawn from energy exploration by Biden in a move that may require an act of Congress to undo. 'I’m going to put it back on day one,' Trump told reporters. He pledged to take it to the courts 'if we need to.' Trump said Biden's effort — part of a series of final actions in office by the Democrat's administration — was undermining his plans for once he's in office. 'You know, they told me that, we’re going to do everything possible to make this transition to the new administration very smooth,' Trump said. 'It’s not smooth.' But Biden's team has extended access and courtesies to the Trump team that the Republican former president initially denied Biden after his 2020 election victory. Trump incoming chief of staff Susie Wiles told Axios in an interview published Monday that Biden chief of staff Jeff Zients 'has been very helpful.' In extended remarks, Trump also railed against the work of special counsel Jack Smith, who oversaw now-dropped prosecutions over his role in the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol and possession of classified documents after he left office in 2021. The Justice Department is expected to soon release a report from Smith summarizing his investigation after the criminal cases were forced to an end by Trump's victory in November. ___ Associated Press writers David Keyton in Berlin, Robert Gillies in Toronto, Jill Colvin in New York and Juan Zamorano in Panama City contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-biden-offshore-drilling-gulf-of-america-fa66f8d072eb39c00a8128a8941ede75	2025-01-07T08:14:56-08:00	
US says Sudan rebel force has committed genocide, and it imposes sanctions on the group's leaders	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration said Tuesday it has determined that Sudan’s Rapid Support Force rebel group and proxies are committing genocide in the country’s civil war and has imposed sanctions on the group’s leaders. 'The RSF and RSF-aligned militias have continued to direct attacks against civilians,' Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement. 'The RSF and allied militias have systematically murdered men and boys—even infants—on an ethnic basis, and deliberately targeted women and girls from certain ethnic groups for rape and other forms of brutal sexual violence. Those same militias have targeted fleeing civilians, murdering innocent people escaping conflict, and prevented remaining civilians from accessing lifesaving supplies. Based on this information, I have now concluded that members of the RSF and allied militias have committed genocide in Sudan.' The sanctions announced by the U.S. include several businesses based in the United Arab Emirates, a federation of seven sheikhdoms on the Arabian Peninsula, including one handling gold likely smuggled out of Sudan. The UAE has been repeatedly accused of arming the paramilitary force known as the RSF, something the UAE has strenuously denied despite evidence to the contrary. Emirati officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday night.	https://apnews.com/article/biden-sudan-genocide-7a0d20f857af3fd428750cf2dfd231ae	2025-01-07T06:47:20-08:00	
Senegal and Chad say ousting of French troops was their sovereign decision	DAKAR, Senegal (AP) — Senegalese and Chadian leaders said that the ousting of French troops from their territories was their sovereign decision, rejecting remarks from French President Emmanuel Macron that suggested otherwise. Senegal, Chad and Ivory Coast last month announced the departure of French troops just as Paris was devising a new strategy that would sharply reduce its permanent troop presence in Africa. Macron said Monday at an annual meeting of foreign ambassadors that France had 'proposed to the African heads of state to reorganize our presence.' He added, 'As we are very polite, we have given them the priority of the announcement.' Senegal’s Prime Minister Ousmane Sonko wrote on X late Monday, 'I would like to say that, in the case of Senegal, this assertion is totally erroneous.' 'No discussion or negotiation has taken place to date and the decision taken by Senegal stems from its sole will, as a free, independent and sovereign country,' Sonko added. 'France has neither the capacity nor the legitimacy to ensure Africa’s security and sovereignty.' French troops have already left Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, which are ruled by military juntas. In 2023, Macron promised a 'new security partnership' with reduced numbers of French troops on the continent in a process he said would be based on needs expressed by African partners. Earlier on Monday, Chadian Foreign Minister Abderaman Koulamallah expressed 'deep concern' following Macron’s remarks. Macron’s words 'reflect a contemptuous attitude towards Africa and Africans,' he said in a statement published on social media. 'French leaders need to learn to respect the African people and to recognize the value of their sacrifices.' He added that the 60 years of French presence in Chad 'has often been limited to its own strategic interests, without any real lasting impact on the development of the Chadian people.' Since the independence of French colonies in Africa, Paris has maintained a policy of economic, political and military sway which at the time had been dubbed Françafrique, including having thousands of permanent troops in the region. France currently has 600 troops in Ivory Coast, 350 in Senegal and 350 in Gabon, as well as around 1,500 in Djibouti. It has had 1,000 troops in Chad. France’s Defense Ministry said the role of French troops in Africa is to train local soldiers and reinforce their capacities to fight extremism, mainly in peacekeeping, intelligence and logistics. But critics say keeping boots on the ground also has allowed Paris to retain influence and protect political regimes favorable to France. ___ Associated Press writer Sylvie Corbet in Paris contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/macron-france-africa-military-withdrawal-fcef0463b916b39364f60319579fe801	2025-01-07T06:03:33-08:00	
AP PHOTOS: The Charlie Hebdo slaughter and follow-up terror attacks 10 years ago that changed France	PARIS (AP) — When Charlie Hebdo cartoonist Coco thought back and drew for a new documentary about the slaughter she survived 10 years ago at the French satirical journal, the memories that streamed from her marker pen were all black. Black barrels of the guns that the al-Qaida-linked gunmen used to mow down 12 people, decimating Charlie's staff of cheeky cartoonists who reveled in their right to lampoon all and sundry and poked fun at Islamic extremism with caricatures of the Muslim Prophet Muhammad. The black hoods that the killers wore as they sprayed Charlie's Paris offices with bullets and then rejoiced outside, yelling: 'We avenged the Prophet Muhammad. We killed Charlie Hebdo!' And the darkness that, in the immediate aftermath, seemed to engulf all of France, shaken to the core by the horror and the dawning realization that the bloodshed had profoundly changed the country, scarring it forever. The Charlie attack was just a first blow As France was reeling from the attack, terror struck again. With a massive police manhunt closing in on brothers Chérif and Saïd Kouachi, cornering the Charlie Hebdo killers in the industrial zone of a town northeast of Paris, accomplice Amédy Coulibaly, armed with an assault rifle, pistols and explosives, stormed a kosher grocery store in Paris, killing four people and taking others hostage. 'You are Jews and French, the two things I hate the most,' he told his hostages. Ultimately, all three attackers died in near-simultaneous police raids. 'I am Charlie' In its pain, France came together. The weekend after the attacks, millions marched in rallies of unity across the country. Paris boulevards and squares filled with more than a million people, including dozens of world leaders who walked arm-in-arm. Marchers held up placards reading 'Je Suis Charlie' — 'I am Charlie' — a slogan that caught like wildfire, even overseas at rallies held from Berlin to Bangkok. Mourners also held up pens, symbolizing how the killings drove home, for many, the value of free speech. Charlie bloodied but not bowed Charlie has lived on, continuing to amuse and anger readers with its irreverence. 'INDESTRUCTIBLE!' roared the headline of its edition Tuesday that marked the 10-year anniversary of the Jan. 7, 2015, assault in inimitable Charlie fashion. Inside, under the headline 'yes, we can laugh about God, especially if he exists,' the weekly journal published four pages of drawings from cartoonists who responded to its international call last year for 'the funniest and meanest caricature about God.' 'Ten years on, Charlie Hebdo is still here,' its director and cartoonist Riss, who was wounded in the attack, wrote in an editorial. 'So, too, are the causes of the drama and the determination of the journal’s members.'	https://apnews.com/article/france-charlie-hebdo-photos-terror-f42dc6d41b376ce2f7abec0e75760e7e	2025-01-07T05:42:11-08:00

Donald Trump Jr. arrives in Greenland after his father said the U.S. should own the Arctic territory	The eldest son of President-elect Donald Trump arrived in Greenland on Tuesday for a private visit that heightened speculation that the incoming U.S. administration could seek to take control of the mineral-rich Danish territory that's home to a large U.S. military base. The Danish state broadcaster reported that Donald Trump Jr.'s plane landed in Nuuk, capital of the vast and icy Arctic territory that has some 57,000 residents. Local media broadcast footage of him walking across a snowy tarmac. In a statement, Greenland's government said Trump Jr.'s visit would take place 'as a private individual' and not as an official visit and that Greenlandic representatives would not meet with him. Greenland is an autonomous territory that’s part of Denmark. Trump Jr. is in Greenland for a day trip to shoot video content for podcasting, according to a person familiar with the plans who was not authorized to speak publicly. Mininguaq Kleist, permanent secretary for the Greenland foreign affairs department, told The Associated Press that authorities were informed that Trump Jr. would stay for about four to five hours. Neither Trump Jr.'s delegation nor Greenlandic government officials had requested a meeting, Kleist said. The visit nonetheless had political overtones. The president-elect recently voiced a desire — also expressed during his first presidency — to acquire the territory in the Arctic, an area of strategic importance for the U.S, China, Russia and others. The world’s largest island, Greenland sits between the Atlantic and Arctic oceans and is 80% covered by an ice sheet. 'I am hearing that the people of Greenland are ‘MAGA.’ My son, Don Jr., and various representatives, will be traveling there to visit some of the most magnificent areas and sights,' the president-elect posted on his social media site Monday night, referring to his 'Make America Great Again' movement. 'Greenland is an incredible place, and the people will benefit tremendously if, and when, it becomes part of our nation,' Trump wrote. 'We will protect it, and cherish it, from a very vicious outside world. MAKE GREENLAND GREAT AGAIN!' Greenland’s Prime Minister Múte Egede has called for independence from Denmark, saying in a New Year’s speech that it would be a way for Greenland to free itself from its colonial past. But Egede has also said he has no interest in Greenland becoming part of the United States, insisting that the island is not for sale. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Tuesday that the future of Greenland would be decided by Greenland, and called the United States Denmark’s most important ally. Denmark’s King Frederik X has been asserting the kingdom's rights to Greenland as well as the Faroe Islands, a self-governing archipelago located between Iceland and Norway in the North Atlantic Ocean. Last month, the king changed Denmark's coat of arms to include fields that represent Greenland and the Faroe Islands. Greenland is represented by a silver bear with red tongue. The royal announcement noted that since 1194, the royal coat of arms 'visually symbolized the legitimacy and sovereignty of the state and the monarch.' 'We are all united and each of us committed for the Kingdom of Denmark,' the king said in his New Year’s address, adding: 'all the way to Greenland.' During his first term, the U.S. president-elect mused about purchasing Greenland, which gained home rule from Denmark in 1979. He canceled a scheduled trip to Denmark in August 2019 after its prime minister dismissed the idea. Reviving the issue in a statement last month as he announced his pick for U.S. ambassador to Denmark, Trump wrote: 'For purposes of national security and freedom throughout the world, the United States of America feels that the ownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity.' Trump’s eldest son has become a prominent player in his father’s political movement and has served on his presidential transition team, helping to select the people who will staff the incoming White House.	https://apnews.com/article/greenland-us-trumps-son-visit-56bc01f1d3431c035b22ad6564579938	2025-01-07T04:21:23-08:00	
What would Bonhoeffer do? Anti-Nazi pastor's legacy claimed, debated across political spectrum	Shortly before he was hanged by the Nazis in 1945 at age 39, Dietrich Bonhoeffer reportedly told a fellow prisoner: 'This is the end — for me the beginning of life.' It was – more than he knew. Even as the German theologian — a Lutheran — was anticipating eternal life in heaven, his death marked the beginning of his ever-growing reputation as a martyr and hero to the cause of anti-Nazi resistance. Churches worldwide commemorate him in statues and stained glass. Readers have explored him in books about and by him, particularly his blunt calls to sacrificial discipleship. 'When Christ calls a man, he bids him come and die,' he famously wrote. He’s been widely quoted – and misquoted. People across the ideological spectrum have claimed Bonhoeffer would support their side on issues ranging from the Vietnam War to post-9/11 militarism to same-sex marriage to the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. And the battle for Bonhoeffer is fiercer now than ever, nearly 80 years after his death. 'The desire to harness Bonhoeffer’s moral capital for partisan ends has intensified as knowledge of his life and witness has expanded, and as American society has grown more polarized,' scholar Stephen Haynes wrote in the book, 'The Battle for Bonhoeffer.' Numerous Bonhoeffer scholars and relatives signed statements in recent months decrying the use of his words and example in causes they say would have appalled him – such as modern-day religious nationalism and xenophobia in the United States and Europe. Meanwhile, his story came to the big screen in late 2024 in a new biopic, 'Bonhoeffer: Pastor. Spy. Assassin.' It's slated to begin streaming in late January. Like Bonhoeffer himself, the movie and its provocative marketing have been strongly debated. Even the film’s creators and distributors aren’t seeing eye to eye over the latter’s depiction of Bonhoeffer as an apparent gun-wielding assassin in promotional materials -- something scholars and family members say is bad history. It is 'completely outrageous,' said Ruggero Schleicher-Tappeser of Berlin, a great-nephew of Bonhoeffer. 'It conveys a completely wrong image of the person of Bonhoeffer and his context.' Born in 1906 in Breslau, Germany, Bonhoeffer was devout from an early age and felt drawn to the ministry. He completed his doctoral dissertation at 21 and continued his seminary studies in New York. There he worshipped at Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, where he was shaped by the deep faith and social conscience of the Black church tradition. As the Nazis took over Germany and hurtled it toward war and genocide, Bonhoeffer opposed their coopting of the Protestant churches – exemplified in the movie by a bishop who praises Adolf Hitler as a 'true savior' sent by God to restore Germany. During World War II, Bonhoeffer and other family members were part of a secret anti-Hitler conspiracy within the German intelligence service. Bonhoeffer carried messages to foreign contacts and helped arrange the passage of 14 Jews to safety in Switzerland. Bonhoeffer knew of and supported an ultimately unsuccessful plan to assassinate Hitler. Contrary to the impression given by the 'Bonhoeffer' movie poster, he wasn’t actively involved in its operations. However, the Nazis eventually uncovered his resistance work and executed him after two years’ imprisonment. One of Bonhoeffer’s brothers was also executed. So were two brothers-in-law, including Schleicher-Tappeser’s grandfather. Schleicher-Tappeser said his grandmother taught him values that the family brought to their resistance work: 'To be to behave in an honest way. To seek for truth.' He said that family legacy prompted more than 80 descendants of Bonhoeffer’s siblings to make a public statement in October against right-wing movements in the U.S. and Europe. 'Never would he have seen himself associated with far-right, violent movements such as Christian Nationalists and others who are trying to appropriate him today,' the statement said. 'He would have strongly and loudly condemned these attitudes.' Leaders of the International Bonhoeffer Society and other scholars issued a similar statement in October. They decried the founding document of Project 2025 for quoting Bonhoeffer to support their call for sharply moving U.S. policies to the right. Some key contributors to Project 2025 are joining the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump. The Project 2025 document applied Bonhoeffer’s concept of 'cheap grace' to progressives it claimed supported causes that didn’t cost them personally. The scholars retorted that using Bonhoeffer to 'discredit protection of refugees and care for the environment … is a cheap trick.' Some of the controversy centers on author and radio host Eric Metaxas, whose best-selling 2010 biography, 'Bonhoeffer: Pastor, Martyr, Prophet, Spy,' boosted awareness of Bonhoeffer particularly in evangelical circles. Metaxas sought in part to show Bonhoeffer’s motivations in a deep Christian faith, offsetting claims that he had become liberal or secular. 'A lot of people, their lives are changed by the story of Dietrich Bonhoeffer, and that’s why I wanted to write the book,' he said in an interview. Metaxas, a Trump supporter who supported debunked claims that President Joe Biden’s 2020 victory was rigged, has helped popularize the phrase 'Bonhoeffer moment' – a moral crisis forcing Christians to stand against their government. He and other evangelicals have applied the phrase to everything from opposing the Supreme Court’s 2015 legalization of same-sex marriage to recent controversies. In a 2024 book, 'Religionless Christianity,' Metaxas contended that just as German Christians shouldn’t have trusted in Hitler’s promised benevolence, American Christians should have questioned official assurances about COVID-19 vaccines and the 2020 election. On social media, he has compared President Biden to Hitler. While Metaxas’ Bonhoeffer biography received some positive reviews, other scholars faulted it as lacking context and casting the German theologian in the mold of an American evangelical. Scholars, including evangelicals, have written recent essays saying Bonhoeffer’s views were too complex for any one Christian faction to claim him. The Bonhoeffer scholars’ petition contends Metaxas has manipulated the theologian’s story 'to support Christian Nationalism.' In broadcasts, Metaxas claimed the statement reflected the scholars’ 'bitter jealousy' over the success of his book and said the Bonhoeffer family statement was signed by 'pro-Hamas lunatics' who are 'Jew-hating.' Schleicher-Tappeser called the comments 'outrageous' and said the family was considering legal options. Metaxas told the AP he 'spoke sloppily' about the family and that he subsequently apologized. 'We ought to all agree how wonderful it is that somebody made a film on Bonhoeffer,' Metaxas said. 'Somebody who’s very politically liberal, I guarantee you they’ll love it.' Some reviews have faulted the movie’s presentation of Bonhoeffer as a swashbuckling action hero, rather than the more conflicted theologian with pacifist leanings. Bonhoeffer wrote that the church must not only aid victims of oppression but sometimes must grab the wheel of the state to stop it. He never morally justified the assassination attempt on Hitler, but he saw no alternative, scholars said. Several key actors in the movie, including Bonhoeffer portrayer Jonas Dassler, published their own statement opposing 'far-right' and anti-immigrant appropriations of him. 'The story of Dietrich Bonhoeffer teaches us that it is necessary to speak up against any authoritarian, violent attempt to damage democracy and human rights,' they wrote. The 'Bonhoeffer' movie has largely completed its weeks-long theatrical run in the U.S. but is scheduled for streaming in late January and international distribution. It was acquired for distribution by Angel Studios. Todd Komarnicki, who wrote, directed and produced the movie, said he opposed both the use of the word 'Assassin' in the subtitle and the movie poster depicting Bonhoeffer with a gun. 'I was against both of those, vocally,' said Komarnicki. 'You don’t get final say in marketing with any studio.' He and Metaxas both said the latter had no role in the making of the film. Komarnicki said the script was based on his own readings of Bonhoeffer’s writings and story. 'If you watch the movie without the agenda, it’s very clear what the movie is saying, that nationalism is not Christian,' Komarnicki said. 'What Christians are supposed to do is look after widows and orphans, serve the poor. We’re not seeing a lot of that on the far right.' 'I also think it’s a love story between Dietrich Bonhoeffer with God,' he said. The Battle for Bonhoeffer even took place within Bonhoeffer himself, who in his last years questioned whether he lived up to his reputation among fellow prisoners as confident and resolute. 'Am I really what others tell me?' he wrote in a poem. 'Or am I only what I myself know of me?' ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Why more frequent cold blasts could be coming from global warming	Frigid air that normally stays trapped in the Arctic has escaped, plunging deep into the United States for an extended visit that is expected to provoke teeth-chattering but not be record-shattering. It's a cold air outbreak that some experts say is happening more frequently, and paradoxically, because of a warming world. Such cold air blasts have become known as the polar vortex. It's a long-established weather term that's become mainstream as its technical meaning changed a bit on the way. What it really means to average Americans in areas where the cold air comes: brrrrr. What's happening is the jet stream — that usually west-to-east river of air way above ground that moves weather systems along — has made a roller-coaster like dip from the Pacific Northwest to the Southeast and is stuck on that wavy track. To the west of that plunge, in California, it's hot and dry. But to the east and just above the dip, it's a taste of the North Pole. 'We're just getting a lot of cold Canadian and Arctic air that's being just channeled from north to south,' said Dan DePodwin, AccuWeather director of forecast operations. 'We really expect this to be more of a prolonged stretch of well below historical average temperatures. We're talking 12 to 25 degrees Fahrenheit (7 to 14 degrees Celsius) across a large portion of the eastern half of the country.' The worst will be in areas that just got hit with heavy snow, from Kansas to Washington, said National Weather Service Weather Prediction Center meteorologist Zack Taylor: 'That's where we could see actual overnight lows down well into the single digits, perhaps even below zero in some places across the Ohio Valley and the Plains.' Judah Cohen, seasonal forecast director at the private firm Atmospheric and Environmental Research, called this a polar vortex event. He and DePodwin called it a stretching of the polar vortex, which is cold air normally penned in high above the Arctic that's there year round. 'Think of it as like a rubber band at rest, kind of roundish,' Cohen said. 'If you start pulling on it, it gets elongated like a hot dog or like pulling on a rubber band. It gets stretched out.' When the polar vortex stretches it can either bring that cold air south to the United States or toward Asia, said Cohen, an expert in winter weather. Other times, when something called sudden stratospheric warming happens, the polar vortex moves away from the Arctic and comes south or even splits. That's not the case this time, Cohen said. Other meteorologists, including Yale Climate Connections' Jeff Masters, along with National Weather Service Climate Prediction Center meteorologist Laura Ciasto, who co-writes the agency's 'polar vortex blog, ' say the polar vortex term is being misused. Technically, the polar vortex is 20 miles high in the stratosphere. And what's happening right now is down lower. These type of polar vortex disruptions — stretching or moving entirely out of the North Pole — are happening more frequently, according to a study last month by Cohen, Woodwell Climate Research Center scientist Jennifer Francis and others. 'There's a climate change signal in that,' Francis said. The Arctic is warming four times faster than the rest of the world, which means the difference between temperatures up north and down south are shrinking, Francis said. Arctic sea ice is shrinking, especially near the Barents Sea in Scandinavia, which releases more heat into atmosphere. That means more energy bouncing off and warping or moving the polar vortex, Cohen said. DePodwin, who was not part of the study, said that makes sense because of these changes in the Arctic 'the jet stream seems like in a warming world may be more amplified.' Yet winters globally are on average 1.1 degrees Fahrenheit (0.6 degrees Celsius) warmer than 25 years ago, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration data. There can be more more cold outbreaks and warmer winters at the same time, DePodwin said. 'Keep in mind that this is a small part of the whole climate, a couple of weeks of weather in a small part of the Northern Hemisphere,' DePodwin said, noting that climate change is years and decades across the globe. 'Climate change does not mean that we will expect to see no more cold weather. It just means that the average temperature overall is going up and we still expect to see colder shots.' ___ Read more of AP’s climate coverage at http://www.apnews.com/climate-and-environment ___ Follow Seth Borenstein on X at @borenbears _____ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Jean-Marie Le Pen, French far-right leader known for fiery rhetoric against immigration, dies at 96	PARIS (AP) — Jean-Marie Le Pen, the founder of France’s far-right National Front who was known for fiery rhetoric against immigration and multiculturalism that earned him both staunch supporters and widespread condemnation, died Tuesday. He was 96. A polarizing figure in French politics, Le Pen was convicted numerous times of antisemitism, discrimination and inciting racial violence. Despite those convictions and his eventual political ostracism, the nativist ideas that propelled his decades of popularity — encapsulated in slogans like 'French People First' — remain ascendant in today’s France, across Europe and beyond. Le Pen — who reached the second round of the 2002 presidential election that Jacques Chirac went on to win in a landslide victory — was eventually estranged from his daughter, Marine Le Pen. She renamed his National Front party, ousted him, and transformed it into one of France’s most powerful political forces while distancing herself from her father’s extremist image. Jordan Bardella, president of the National Rally as the party is now known, confirmed Le Pen’s death in a post on social media platform X. Bardella’s unusually warm tribute described Le Pen as a 'voice of the people' who 'always served France' and expressed condolences to his family. The post appeared to blur the boundary the rebranded party had sought to establish between its firebrand founder and its more polished, modern direction under Marine Le Pen. French President Emmanuel Macron, a centrist, offered his condolences to Le Pen's family and friends in an uncharacteristically short statement issued by the presidential palace. 'A historic figure of the far right, he played a role in the public life of our country for almost 70 years, which is now a matter for history to judge,' the statement read. Marine Le Pen, thousands of kilometers (miles) away in the French territory of Mayotte, was inspecting the aftermath of destructive Cyclone Chido at the time of her father’s death. His death came at a crucial time for his daughter. She now faces a potential prison term and a ban on running for political office if convicted in an embezzling trial. A former paratrooper and Foreign Legionnaire who fought to maintain French colonial rule in Indochina and Algeria, Jean-Marie Le Pen was a wily political strategist and gifted orator who used his charisma to captivate crowds. 'If I advance, follow me; if I die, avenge me; if I shirk, kill me,' Le Pen said at a 1990 party congress, reflecting the theatrical style that for decades fed the fervor of followers. The portly, silver-haired son of a Breton fisherman viewed himself as a man with a mission — to keep France French under the banner of the National Front. Picking Joan of Arc as the party’s patron saint, Le Pen made Islam, and Muslim immigrants, his primary target, blaming them for the economic and social woes of France. His statements — including Holocaust denial, racist denunciations of Muslims and immigrants, and his proposal to round up people with AIDS — shocked his critics and strained his political alliances. Le Pen routinely countered that he was simply a patriot protecting the identity of 'eternal France.' Le Pen, who lost his left eye in 1958 while hammering a tent stake, for years wore a black eyepatch that became a symbol of his combative persona. He was a constant force in French political life, impossible for politicians on the left or right to ignore and proved the spoiler in election after election, forcing rivals to scramble to counter him. Today, the National Rally, the successor to the party he founded, has not only solidified its presence in French politics but also pushed Macron to the right on security and immigration, reflecting a broader shift in the political landscape. Le Pen was repeatedly convicted for his remarks, notably in 1990 for one made three years earlier in which he referred to the Nazi gas chambers as a 'detail in World War II history.' In 2015, he repeated the remark, saying he 'did not at all' regret it, triggering the ire of his daughter — by then the party leader — and a new conviction in 2016. He also was convicted for a 1988 remark linking in a play on words a Cabinet minister with the Nazi crematory ovens, and for a 1989 comment blaming the 'Jewish international' for helping seed 'this anti-national spirit.' Le Pen lost his European Parliament seat in 2002 for a year for assaulting a Socialist politician during a 1997 election campaign. More recently, Le Pen and 26 National Front officials, including his daughters Marine and Yann Le Pen, have been accused of using money destined for EU parliamentary aides to pay staff who instead did political work for the party between 2004 and 2016, in violation of the 27-nation bloc’s regulations. Jean-Marie Le Pen was deemed unfit to testify and eventually exempted from prosecution on health grounds. French judicial authorities placed Le Pen under legal guardianship in February at the request of his family as his health declined, French media reported. He had been in frail health for some time. Born June 20, 1928, in the Brittany village of Trinite-Sur-Mer, to Jean Le Pen, a fisherman who would die in World War II, and his wife Anne-Marie, Jean-Marie Le Pen proved an ambitious son attracted early on to the extreme right. Armed with law and political science degrees, Le Pen made his way to Paris, and at 27 became the youngest lawmaker in the National Assembly under the banner of the Union for the Defense of Shopkeepers and Artisans, run by Pierre Poujade. His career never strayed from the far-right path. In 1963, he and Leon Gaultier, who served in the Waffen SS under the Nazis, founded a company, SERP, that churned out political discourses. With the neo-fascist group New Order, Le Pen founded the National Front on Oct. 5, 1972. It would take more than a decade for the party to emerge as a political force — in a September 1983 municipal election when Jean-Pierre Stirbois won 16.7% of the votes in the town of Dreux, west of Paris. A year later, the party won enough votes in European parliamentary elections to seat 10 legislators. The message was clear: France could no longer ignore Le Pen. The party’s entry as a force in national politics came two years later in legislative elections that gave Le Pen’s party 35 seats in France’s National Assembly. By then, Le Pen had replaced the black eyepatch and begun polishing his scrappy image. In 1988, he startled the nation by taking 14% of the vote in the first round of presidential elections. Fourteen years later, in his fifth bid for the presidency, he outdid that — scoring 16.8% — and reached the second-round runoff with Chirac. France shuddered, Europe trembled and the National Front gloated. But a Le Pen victory was not to be. In a rare joining of forces, supporters of the right and left poured into the streets of France in a massive show of solidarity against him. On May 5, 2002, Chirac was returned to office with a record 82% of the vote. Throughout the years, Le Pen’s political line never wavered. In a 2003 speech, he said he wanted the notion of 'national preference' written into the French Constitution to limit employment, housing opportunities and other social assistance to French citizens. Immigration is 'the greatest danger we’re facing,' he said. 'Me? Racist? It’s a gag, a gag,' Le Pen once told The Associated Press. 'But I’m not for the melting pot. I’m for the defense of one’s culture. I’d despair if I found the culture of Brooklyn in France.' His private life was tumultuous. An explosion destroyed the family apartment building in 1976 but injured neither Le Pen nor his wife and three children. The French media relished recounting Le Pen’s divorce saga from wife Pierrette Lalanne. In a reflection of that bitter separation, she famously posed for Playboy in 1987, partly dressed in a risque maid’s costume. The magazine quoted her as saying she was responding to her husband’s Playboy interview in which he said she could become a housekeeper if she needed money. He married for a second time in 1991, to Jeanne-Marie Paschos, known as Jany. Le Pen began laying the groundwork for his succession at a party congress in 2003, naming Marine — the youngest of his three daughters — to the post of vice president. In 2011, she became party president and in 2017 and 2022 reached the presidential runoff herself. Both times she lost to centrist Emmanuel Macron, but with a shrinking margin. She is considered a leading potential contender for the next presidential election in 2027. But her softer style and attempts to distance the party from the most extreme of his views soon brought her into conflict with her father. His refusal to desist from antisemitic provocations clashed with her bid to rid the National Front of its pariah status. She removed him in 2015 from the party he co-founded, and three years later stripped him of his title of honorary president-for-life. A few months later she changed the National Front name to National Rally as part of her strategy to renew the party’s image. Her father called it the 'toughest blow' the party had faced since its founding. Throughout his life, Jean-Marie Le Pen refused to cede, or be silenced. 'I’m a moral authority for the movement ... and I don’t have the habit of keeping my opinions to myself,' Le Pen told The AP in 2014 as the father-daughter feud gained momentum. As Le Pen’s health deteriorated in recent years, he was hospitalized several times, including after he suffered a stroke. Le Pen is survived by his wife and three daughters, Marie-Caroline, Yann and Marine. ___ This story has been updated to correct how Le Pen lost his eye. ___ Ganley, who retired from The Associated Press in 2024, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/jean-marie-le-pen-france-obituary-67c1f95b9c864374b2bcba20f746d530	2025-01-07T03:24:52-08:00	
European court rules against Greece over migrant’s illegal deportation, calls practice 'systematic'	ATHENS, Greece (AP) — The European Court of Human Rights in a landmark ruling Tuesday found that Greece illegally deported a woman back to neighboring Turkey, and described the use of summary expulsions, or 'pushbacks,' as systematic. The decision could impact how Europe handles migrants at its borders, at a time when Greece and several European Union member states are seeking tougher immigration controls. Frontline EU member states receive financial support from Brussels to handle illegal migration. A Turkish woman — identified by her initials A.R.E. — was awarded damages of 20,000 euros ($21,000) after the court ruled that she had been improperly expelled in 2019 after crossing into Greece, with no opportunity to make an asylum claim. 'The court considered that there were strong indications to suggest that there had existed, at the time of the events alleged, a systematic practice of ‘pushbacks’ of third-country nationals by the Greek authorities, from the Evros region (on the Greek border) to Turkey,' the decision said. Citing a lack of evidence, the court rejected a second claim made by an Afghan man who said he had been illegally returned to Turkey from the Greek island of Samos in 2020 when he was 15. Greek government representatives at the hearings denied the allegations, challenging the authenticity of the evidence presented and arguing that Greece's border policies comply with international law. Niamh Keady-Tabbal, a member of the legal team for the Afghan migrant, described the court's decision as broadly significant but also 'profoundly unjust' regarding the man's case. 'It is quite unjust that such a cynical position of blanket denial can serve in practice to shield the Greek government from accountability,' she told The Associated Press. The U.N. refugee agency has urged Greece to more thoroughly investigate multiple allegations of pushbacks, while several major human rights groups have described the alleged irregular deportations as systematic. Greece’s National Transparency Authority, a publicly funded corruption watchdog, said it found no evidence to support the pushback allegations following a four-month investigation in 2022. The European Court of Human Rights is an international court based in Strasbourg, France, that adjudicates human rights violations by 46 member states of the Council of Europe, a body older than the European Union and its predecessor, the European Economic Community. Greece registered more than 60,000 illegal arrivals of migrants last year, an increase of nearly 50% from 2023. It seeks direct funding from the EU to pay for the planned expansion of a border wall along the land frontier with Turkey. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of migration issues at https://apnews.com/hub/migration	https://apnews.com/article/greece-migration-pushbacks-turkey-council-of-europe-3cf087b976d2c983c05303f9ea0eca97	2025-01-07T01:56:03-08:00	
In freezing temperatures, swimmers in China plunge into a river for health and joy	HARBIN, China (AP) — Even as the mercury dropped well below freezing, enthusiasm soared among about a dozen hardy swimmers during a daily ritual in northeast China’s 'ice city' of Harbin. The swimmers trained daily throughout the year for this. They first carved out a pool in the Songhua River, breaking the 10-centimeter (4-inch) thick layer of ice that had formed again overnight and scooping out the pieces. Then they stripped down and, one by one, plunged into the bone-chilling waters of a pool about 10 meters (30 feet) long. Some said their limbs were already numb in the -13 C (8 F) weather. Chen Xia, who came from Zhejiang province about 1,700 kilometers (1,000 miles) to the south, dived into the river even though she had a cold. She said the winter waters in her home city are warmer than those in Harbin, where the water temperature hovered around the freezing mark. The experience strengthened her confidence in winter swimming, a sport she has been devoted to for about two decades. 'I felt prickling all over my body,' said Chen, 56. 'But it still made me feel blissful.' Harbin resident Yu Xiaofeng said that winter swimming in her city can be dated back to the 1970s, after locals saw Russian Orthodox faithful being baptized in the river. The city is near the border with Russia. In 1983, Harbin's winter swimming association was established. The city is considered a 'holy land' for winter swimming, she said, as the sport gained popularity here earlier than in other parts of China. Harbin is also known for its ongoing winter festival, which features giant ice and snow sculptures, and smaller, delicate ones too. Yu, 61, said she found a sense of a big family and joy during her three decades of swimming. 'Since the pandemic, we came up with a slogan: Rather suffer through winter swimming than line up at the hospital,' she said, adding that winter swimmers appeared to have better health than others. You Decang, 76, said that swimming kept him healthy and he had never caught a cold. 'If I go just one day without winter swimming, I feel quite uncomfortable,' he said. ___ Olivia Zhang and Caroline Chen contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/china-harbin-winter-swimming-fc26b27d86b03c29c88f20d0b28496c7	2025-01-07T01:23:40-08:00	
Middle East latest: Israeli strikes kill 17 people in Gaza, nearly all of them women or kids	Israeli airstrikes in southern Gaza killed at least 17 people late Tuesday, nearly all of them women or children, the territory’s Health Ministry and hospital officials said. Five kids were killed as they sheltered together in the same tent, said Ahmed al-Farra, director of the children's ward at nearby Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis. Their bodies were among the eight children and five women brought to the hospital after strikes on tents, homes and a vehicle. Two bodies were unidentifiable. The Israeli military said it targeted militants who had taken part in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that sparked the war, without providing evidence. Israel said it took steps to lessen the risk of hurting civilians and blamed Hamas for the civilian casualties. The Israel-Hamas war in Gaza is raging with no end in sight, although there has reportedly been recent progress in long-running talks aimed at a ceasefire and the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas. Some Palestinians in the Gaza Strip still have hope the war will end soon. Issam Saqr, a displaced man from Khan Younis, told The Associated Press he hopes the ceasefire 'will happen today — before tomorrow!' Here's the latest: Israel says only a ‘limited’ number of its soldiers faced possible arrest overseas JERUSALEM — The Israeli Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday that the number of Israeli soldiers subjected to possible arrest overseas for accusations of war crimes in Gaza is 'very limited,' despite intense media coverage of a case of a soldier forced to leave Brazil this week due to possible legal action. On Sunday, Israel said it had helped the former soldier leave Brazil on a commercial flight, after Brazilian authorities launched an investigation into the soldier based on his social media posts showing him taking part in the demolition of civilian homes in Gaza. The investigation was based on a complaint filed by a pro-Palestinian activist group. The Foreign Ministry said it is aware of fewer than a dozen similar complaints around the world. Eden Bar-Tal, the ministry’s director general, accused 'terrorist organizations' of spearheading the efforts to investigate Israeli soldiers. He dismissed the complaints as a public relations stunt with little chance of succeeding. Palestinians in Gaza hope for a ceasefire as they endure war's harsh conditions KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip — Displaced Palestinians in the Gaza Strip still have hope that Israel’s 15-month war with Hamas will end soon, as both sides appear to be inching toward a ceasefire deal. 'What we are living is not a life. Nobody could bear the situation we’re experiencing for a single day,' said Munawar al-Bik, a displaced woman from Gaza City. 'We wake up at night to the sounds of men crying, because of the bad situation,' al-Bik said. 'The situation is unbearable, we have no energy left, we want it to end today.' She spoke to The Associated Press on a dusty road in the southern city of Khan Younis beside the rubble of a destroyed building. Behind her, a sea of makeshift tents filled with displaced families stretched into the distance. Muhammad Zaqout, a displaced man from Gaza City, said he’s sick of children being killed daily, of the destruction and displacement. In recent months, families who fled their homes in Gaza have had little access to clean water or enough food to eat, and they struggle to cope with harsh winter conditions that have killed several babies from hypothermia in recent weeks. Issam Saqr, displaced from Khan Younis, said he hopes the ceasefire 'will happen today — before tomorrow!' Israeli strike kills at least 17 people in southern Gaza, nearly all of them women or children KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip — Israeli airstrikes in southern Gaza killed at least 17 people late Tuesday, nearly all of them women or children, the territory’s Health Ministry said. Five kids were killed in the same tent as they sheltered together in a camp for displaced Palestinians in Muwasi, said Ahmed al-Farra, director of the child ward at Nasser Hospital in nearby Khan Younis. Their bodies were among the eight children and five women brought to the hospital. The strikes tore into tents for displaced Palestinians, a car and two houses in the the Khan Younis area, the hospital said. Two of the dead were men, and the two in the vehicle were unidentifiable. In the morgue, bodies lay on stretchers or stacked on metal shelves. A young girl in a fuzzy pink sweatshirt rested with her head in the lap of another girl. Other corpses, some disfigured by the explosions, were covered in blankets. The Israeli military said it targeted militants who had taken part in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel that sparked the war, without providing evidence. Israel said it took steps to lessen the risk of harming civilians and blamed Hamas for the civilian casualties. It was not immediately clear if that strike that killed the five children was inside the area in Muwasi Israel's military designated a humanitarian safe zone but has repeatedly targeted. Israel blames Hamas for civilian casualties. Muwasi is a desolate coastal area where hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians are sheltering in makeshift tents during the cold and rainy winter. ___ This post has been updated to reflect that hospital officials lowered the death toll to 17, not 18 as initially reported. Turkey says it is ready to launch a new cross-border operation against Syrian Kurdish militias ANKARA, Turkey — Turkey’s foreign minister says Turkey is ready to launch a new cross-border operation against Syrian Kurdish militias if they do not comply with a Turkish 'ultimatum' demanding that their leaders leave Syria and that other fighters disarm. In an interview with CNN-Turk television on Tuesday, Hakan Fidan said his country was prepared to intervene even if the United States opposes the offensive, saying Turkey had conducted past incursions 'despite' objections from Washington. Fidan also said Syria’s new administration has the strength to battle the U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led fighters. Turkey considers the Syrian Kurdish force an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party and a threat to its security. For the U.S., the militia group has been a key ally in the fight against the Islamic State group. Turkey has conducted several cross-border operations against the group since 2016. Israeli foreign minister travels to UAE for talks with his Emirati counterpart JERUSALEM — Israel’s foreign minister was in the United Arab Emirates for talks with his Emirati counterpart. The Israeli Foreign Ministry said that Gideon Saar discussed 'regional developments and the bilateral relations between the two countries' in his talks with Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan. The statement did not elaborate, but Israeli officials have expressed hope that the United Arab Emirates and other Arab countries could play a role in rebuilding and helping run postwar Gaza. Israel and the UAE established diplomatic relations as part of the 2020 Abraham Accords. Trump says he will send his Middle East envoy to Qatar PALM BEACH, Fla. — President-elect Donald Trump is dispatching his incoming special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, to Qatar this week for talks aimed at a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of some 100 Israeli hostages. Trump speaking at a news conference at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Tuesday reiterated his threat that there will be 'hell to pay' in the Middle East if the hostages are not released prior to his Jan. 20 inauguration. Witkoff, who also spoke briefly at the press conference, said he expected to depart for Qatar later Tuesday or Wednesday but did not detail who he’d be meeting with during his latest visit to the region. Witkoff added that progress is being made on landing a deal, something he said is happening because of the pressure Trump is creating. 'The red lines he’s put out there — that’s driving this negotiation,' Witkoff said. Ireland formally intervenes in ICJ genocide case against Israel LONDON — Ireland has formally asked to intervene in South Africa’s case accusing Israel of committing genocide in Gaza, the International Court of Justice said Tuesday. The request submitted in the Hague on Monday has roiled Irish relations with Israel. Israel, which denies the allegations, announced last month that it would close its embassy in Ireland after the Irish government decided to intervene in South Africa’s case. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said the 'antisemitic rhetoric of the Irish government against Israel are rooted in efforts to delegitimize and demonize the Jewish state.' In May, Israel recalled its ambassador to Dublin after Ireland announced along with Norway, Spain and Slovenia it would recognize a Palestinian state. Several other countries have also intervened in the case: Nicaragua, Colombia, Libya, Mexico, Palestine, Spain, Chile, Bolivia, the Maldives and Turkey. A French diplomat is in Lebanon to help unlock a yearslong political stalemate BEIRUT — France’s special envoy to Lebanon, Jean-Yves Le Drian, arrived in Beirut on Tuesday to help mediate the parliament's latest attempt to elect the country's president — a position that has been empty for more than two years amid sharp political and sectarian divides. Lebanon’s parliament is scheduled to meet on Thursday to elect a president. Le Drian will attend the session at the invitation of Speaker of Parliament Nabih Berri. His visit comes as part of ongoing efforts to 'enable the Lebanese to elect a president, in accordance with the principles agreed upon in Doha in July 2023,' according to a statement from his office. He is working alongside members of the Quintet — France, the U.S., Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Egypt — to push for a resolution to the prolonged stalemate. Le Drian urged lawmakers to reach a consensus, emphasizing that electing a president is 'the first step toward the urgent reactivation of Lebanon’s institutions and the restoration of the country’s sovereignty,' according to the statement. It remains to be seen how much Lebanon's political landscape has shifted in recent months after Hezbollah, a powerful political actor in the country, was severely hobbled after the war with Israel, which killed top officials including longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah, as well as the overthrow of President Bashar Assad in neighboring Syria. Former President Michel Aoun, an ally of Iran-backed Hezbollah, finished his term in October 2022. First international commercial flight since Assad’s ouster lands in Damascus DAMASCUS, Syria — The first international commercial flight since the fall of Syrian President Bashar Assad last month landed Tuesday at the Damascus airport from Qatar. Jordanian state-run Petra news agency also reported that a Royal Jordanian Airlines plane was heading to Damascus on a test flight. The head of Syria's Civil Aviation Regulatory Commission, Capt. Haitham Misto, who was on board the flight with a team of specialists, said the aim was to evaluate the condition of the Damascus airport before resuming regular flights. Israel launches raids in West Bank after attack kills 3 Israelis JERUSALEM — The Israeli military launched a wave of raids across the occupied West Bank overnight and into Tuesday, killing at least three Palestinians it said were militants a day after a deadly shooting attack. The army said it killed two militants in an airstrike after they fired at troops in the area of Tamun in the northern West Bank. It said another militant was killed in 'close-quarters combat' in the nearby village of Taluza and an Israeli soldier was severely wounded. The military said it arrested more than 20 suspected militants. Hamas said in a statement that one of its veteran commanders, Jaafar Dababsah, was killed by Israeli forces in the area of the two deadly raids. The Israeli army said the overnight operations were not related to Monday’s shooting in which gunmen opened fire on a bus carrying Israelis in the West Bank, killing two women in their 70s and a 35-year-old policeman before fleeing. The Palestinian Health Ministry says at least 840 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire in the West Bank since the start of the war in Gaza. At least 46 Israelis, including 19 soldiers, have been killed in violent attacks by Palestinian militants, according to the U.N. The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed across the border in a massive surprise attack nearly 15 months ago, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s air and ground offensive has killed over 45,800 Palestinians in Gaza, according to local health authorities, who say women and children make up more than half of those killed. They do not say how many of the dead were militants. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-syria-lebanon-news-01-07-2025-c7b3e72f9f11513fd80f3f9e3ec74f87	2025-01-07T00:51:15-08:00	
France marks 10 years since deadly Charlie Hebdo attack	PARIS (AP) — A decade after Islamic extremist gunmen stormed the offices of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in a deadly assault that shook France to its core and ignited a global outcry in defense of freedom of speech, the nation paused on Tuesday to honor the victims and renew its resolve to fight for liberty and democracy. President Emmanuel Macron and Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo led solemn tributes at the site of the attack, where 12 people, including some of France’s most beloved cartoonists, were killed on Jan. 7, 2015. Among those remembered was Ahmed Merabet, a police officer who was gunned down on the street while defending the newspaper. In a poignant ceremony, Macron stood with his wife, Brigitte, alongside former President François Hollande, who had steered France through the aftermath of the attack. Macron joined police officers in laying wreaths of flowers against the wall of the former Charlie Hebdo headquarters in the 11th district and the gathering observed a minute of silence. A lone trumpet played, resonating through a neighborhood scarred by that day’s bloodshed. France was plunged into a year of unparalleled terror, beginning with the Charlie Hebdo assault and culminating in the coordinated November 2015 attacks, when Islamic extremists opened fire on cafes in Paris before massacring spectators of a concert at the Bataclan, killing a total of 130 people. Two days after the Charlie Hebdo attack, a gunman stormed a Hypercacher kosher grocery store in Paris, killing four people and taking others hostage. The nation was left grieving, yet public gatherings became acts of resilience, defying fear and standing firm against violence. The massacre at Charlie Hebdo, carried out by two brothers claiming allegiance to al-Qaida, signaled the dawn of a dark new chapter for France. A wave of extremist violence forced the country to reexamine its security measures. In the days following the attack, then German Chancellor Angela Merkel marched arm in arm with Hollande and other world leaders through the streets of Paris — a powerful display of unity in defense of freedom of expression that reverberated far beyond French borders. Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau, speaking on RTL Tuesday, acknowledged how far France has come. while warning of the persistent dangers. 'France has rearmed considerably, but the threat is still there,' he said, pointing to both external dangers and the rise of homegrown radicalization. 'The nature of the threat has changed,' Retailleau added. 'It is now primarily endogenous — young individuals radicalized through social media. Last year alone, our services foiled nine attacks, the highest number since 2017.' The attacks’ impact continued to extend beyond France itself. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz shared a message of solidarity on social media, writing, '#JeSuisCharlie spread around the world after the barbaric attack on Charlie Hebdo 10 years ago. Today, as then, we share the grief of our French friends. The attack targeted our shared values of freedom and democracy—we will never accept this.' The attack on Charlie Hebdo, carried out in retaliation for the newspaper’s irreverent caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad, ignited fierce global debates about the limits of free expression. In the days that followed, millions marched in solidarity, brandishing pens and signs declaring, Je Suis Charlie (I am Charlie). But 10 years on, the unity of that moment has given way to deeper divisions. Charlie Hebdo said its research shows that while a majority of French still believe in the fundamental right to caricature, younger generations increasingly criticize satire they see as divisive or insensitive, particularly toward marginalized communities. 'Are we all still Charlie?' one television special asked. For some, the answer is a resounding yes — a tribute to those who paid the ultimate price for freedom of expression. For others, French media say, it’s a more complicated question. The newspaper remains unapologetic. Its 10th-anniversary edition features a cover cartoon of a reader perched on an AK-47, captioned 'Indestructible.' In an editorial, the magazine’s director, Laurent Sourisseau, known as 'Riss,' defended the power of satire. 'If you want to laugh, it means you want to live,' he wrote.	https://apnews.com/article/charlie-hebdo-attacks-10-years-93a34fb461c793e6a189d2306cba7b6a	2025-01-06T23:56:08-08:00	
At least 9 miners are trapped in a coal mine in India's northeastern Assam state	GUWAHATI, India (AP) — At least nine workers are trapped inside a coal mine in India’s northeastern Assam state, officials said Tuesday, as authorities summoned the army to help in the rescue operation. The miners were trapped on Monday morning in the Umrangso area in Dimapur Hasao district, some 125 miles (200 kilometers) south of the state capital, Guwahati. The workers are 'feared trapped 300 feet below the ground after water gushed in from a nearby unused mine. We are mobilizing resources to rescue them,' said Kaushik Rai, a local government minister who is monitoring the rescue at the site. Authorities brought army soldiers and a national disaster management team to the area to assist in the ongoing operation. Workers at the site said over a dozen miners had been trapped inside the mine, which has bare minimum safety measures, and that some miners managed to escape as water from a nearby unused mine began filling the mine. In India’s east and northeast, workers extract coal in hazardous conditions in small 'rat hole' mines that are rampant in the hilly areas. During the extraction, the coal is placed in boxes that are hoisted to the surface with pulleys. Accidents in illegal mining are frequent and the livelihoods of those who do such mining depend on the illegal sale of coal.	https://apnews.com/article/coal-mine-assam-india-trapped-87320ac112a2ba1725b349e83f42f6a6	2025-01-06T21:15:36-08:00	
Taiwan holds military drills as concerns rise over possible defense budget cut	HSINCHU, Taiwan (AP) — Taiwan began three days of military drills on Tuesday as concerns rose over potential cuts to the defense budget due to legislative wrangling between the island's two major political parties. The drills began in the north with tank maneuvering at a base in Hsinchu featuring outmoded CM-11 tanks, which are gradually being replaced by newly purchased Abrams M1A2T from the U.S. The replacement marks a huge upgrade despite some complaints over the weight of the new tanks and their likely effectiveness at preventing a possible Chinese landing. Troops arrived on armored personnel carriers, while Apache and S-70 helicopters whirled overhead, providing reconnaissance and covering fire. With the equipment Taiwan currently operates, the communication officer is on the ground to coordinate airborne attacks, said Army Captain Chuang Yuan-cheng of the 542 Armored Brigade in Hsinchu county just south of the capital of Taipei. That allows them to guide the helicopters so that 'ground fire and airborne fire are synchronized,' Chuang said. On Wednesday, the army will show off its Patriot III anti-missile system aimed at countering one of China’s most potent weapons against the island of 23 million. And on Thursday, anti-submarine exercises will be held off of Taiwan’s largest port of Kaohsiung, considered China's best conduit for resupplying its troops should it establish a beachhead in the heavily defended region. The annual drills are held in the run-up to the Lunar New Year holiday to reassure the population of Taiwan’s ability to meet China’s threats and to boost recruitment. Taiwan has a backlog of orders from the U.S. for about $20 billion in weapons systems, while it upgrades its M-16 fighters and develops its own submarines. It has also extended compulsory military service to one year. However, the government has warned that new legal amendments being considered could force a 28% cut in the defense budget by altering the way funds are distributed between the central and local governments. That in turn could reduce the willingness of the U.S. and its allies such as Japan and the Philippines to assist Taiwan in the event of an armed clash with China, National Security Council Secretary-General Joseph Wu told legislators last month. The legislation is being pushed by the main opposition Nationalist Party, which has joined with the tiny Taiwan People's Party to oppose the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's legislative agenda. Taiwan currently spends about 2.4% of its GDP, or roughly $20 billion, on the military annually. China has responded furiously to all U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, saying unification with the island is inevitable and warning that Washington is 'playing with fire.' However, apart from regularly sending planes and warships into areas near the island, it has done little more than blacklist companies and executives involved in the production and sales of such equipment. Neither military intimidation, economic coercion nor appeals to their common Chinese ancestry seem to be working on Taiwan's population, the vast majority of whom favor the current status of de-facto independence.	https://apnews.com/article/taiwan-military-exercises-china-tanks-0419555699b4c96b9f9a66ba766314db	2025-01-06T21:05:31-08:00	
Long silenced by fear, Syrians now speak about rampant torture under Assad	DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — Handcuffed and squatting on the floor, Abdullah Zahra saw smoke rising from his cellmate’s flesh as his torturers gave him electric shocks. Then it was Zahra’s turn. They hanged the 20-year-old university student from his wrists until his toes barely touched the floor and electrocuted and beat him for two hours. They made his father watch and taunted him about his son’s torment. That was 2012, and the entire security apparatus of Syria’s then-President Bashar Assad was deployed to crush the protests that had arisen against his rule. With Assad’s fall a month ago, the machinery of death that he ran is starting to come out into the open. It was systematic and well-organized, growing to more than 100 detention facilities where torture, brutality, sexual violence and mass executions were rampant, according to activists, rights group and former prisoners. Security agents spared no one, not even Assad’s own soldiers. Young men and women were detained for simply living in districts where protests were held. As tens of thousands disappeared over more than a decade, a blanket of fear kept the Syrian population silent. People rarely told anyone that a loved one had vanished for fear they too could be reported to security agencies. Now, everyone is talking. The insurgents who swept Assad out of power opened detention facilities, releasing prisoners and allowing the public to bear witness. Crowds swarmed, searching for answers, bodies of their loved ones, and ways to heal. The Associated Press visited seven of these facilities in Damascus and spoke to nine former detainees, some released on Dec. 8, the day Assad was ousted. Some details of the accounts by those who spoke to the AP could not be independently confirmed, but they matched past reports by former detainees to human rights groups. Days after Assad’s fall, Zahra – now 33 -- came to visit Branch 215, a detention facility run by military intelligence in Damascus where he was held for two months. In an underground dungeon, he stepped into the windowless, 4-by-4-meter (yard) cell where he says he was held with 100 other inmates. Each man was allowed a floor tile to squat on, Zahra said. When ventilators weren't running -- either intentionally or because of a power failure -- some suffocated. Men went mad; torture wounds festered. When a cellmate died, they stowed his body next to the cell's toilet until jailers came to collect corpses, Zahra said. 'Death was the least bad thing,' he said. 'We reached a place where death was easier than staying here for one minute.' Assad's system of repression grew as civil war raged Zahra was arrested along with his father after security agents killed one of his brothers, a well-known anti-Assad graffiti artist. After they were released, Zahra fled to opposition-held areas. Within a few months, security agents returned and dragged off 13 of his male relatives, including a younger brother and, again, his father. They were brought to Branch 215. All were tortured and killed. Zahra later recognized their bodies among photos leaked by a defector that showed the corpses of thousands killed while in detention. Their bodies were never recovered, and how and when they died is unknown. Rights groups estimate at least 150,000 people went missing after anti-government protests began in 2011, most vanishing into Assad’s prison network. Many of them were killed, either in mass executions or from torture and prison conditions. The exact number remains unknown. Even before the uprising, Assad had ruled with an iron fist. But as peaceful protests turned into a full-fledged civil war that would last 14 years, Assad rapidly expanded his system of repression. New detention facilities sprung up in security compounds, military airports and under buildings — all run by military, security and intelligence agencies. Touring the site of his torture and detention, Zahra hoped to find some sign of his lost relatives. But there was nothing. At home, his aunt, Rajaa Zahra, saw the pictures of her killed children for the first time. She had refused to look at the leaked photos before. She lost three of her six sons in Branch 215 and a fourth was killed at a protest. Her brother, she said, had three sons, now he has only one. 'They were hoping to finish off all the young men of the country.' Syrians were tortured with ‘the tire’ and ‘magic carpet’ The Assad regime's tortures had names. One was called the 'magic carpet,' where a detainee was strapped to a hinged wooden plank that bends in half, folding his head to his feet, which are then beaten. Abdul-Karim Hajeko said he endured this five times. His torturers stomped on his back during interrogations at the Criminal Security branch, and his vertebrae are still broken. 'My screams would go to heaven. Once a doctor came down from the fourth floor (to the ground floor) because of my screams,' he said. He was also put in 'the tire.' His legs were bent inside a car tire as interrogators beat his back and feet with a plastic baton. When they were done, he said, a guard ordered him to kiss the tire and thank it for teaching him 'how to behave.' Hajeko was later taken to the notorious Saydnaya Prison, where he was held for six years. Many prisoners said the tire was inflicted for rule violations -- like making noise, raising one’s head in front of guards, or praying – or for no reason at all. Mahmoud Abdulbaki, a non-commissioned air force officer who defected from service, was put in the tire during detention at a military police facility. They forced him to count the lashes — up to 200 — and if he made a mistake, the torturer would start over. 'People’s hearts stopped following a beating,' the 37-year-old said. He was later held at Saydnaya, where he said guards would terrorize inmates by rolling a tire down the corridor lined with cells and beat on the bars with their batons. Wherever it stopped, the entire cell would be subjected to the tire. Altogether, Abdulbaki spent nearly six years in prison over different periods. He was among those freed on the day Assad fled Syria. Saleh Turki Yahia said a cellmate died nearly every day during the seven months in 2012 he was held at the Palestine Branch, a detention facility run by the General Intelligence Agency. He recounted how one man bled in the cell for days after returning from a torture session where interrogators rammed a pipe into him. When the inmates tried to move him, 'all his fluids poured out from his backside. The wound opened from the back, and he died,' he said. Yahya said he was given electric shocks, hanged from his wrists, beaten on his feet. He lost half his body weight and nearly tore his own skin scratching from scabies. 'They broke us,' he said, breaking into tears. 'Look at Syria, it is all old men ... A whole generation is destroyed.' But with Assad gone, he was back visiting the Palestine Branch. 'I came to express myself. I want to tell.' The mounting evidence will be used in trials Torture continued up to the end of Assad’s rule. Rasha Barakat, 34, said she and her sister were detained in March from their homes in Saqba, a town outside Damascus. Inside a security branch, she was led past her husband, who had been arrested hours earlier and was being interrogated. He was kneeling on the floor, his face green, she said. It was her last brief glimpse of him: He died in custody. During her own hours-long interrogation, she said, security agents threatened to bring in her sons, 5- and 7-years-old, if she didn’t confess. She was beaten. Female security agents stripped her and poured cold water on her, leaving her shivering naked for two hours. She spent eight days in isolation, hearing beatings nearby. Eventually she was taken to Adra, Damascus’ central prison, tried and sentenced to five years for supporting rebel groups, charges she said were made up. There she stayed until insurgents broke into Adra in December and told her she was free. An estimated 30,000 prisoners were released as fighters opened up prisons during their march to Damascus. Barakat said she is happy to see her kids again. But 'I am destroyed psychologically … Something is missing. It is hard to keep going.' Now comes the monumental task of accounting for the missing and compiling evidence that could one day be used to prosecute Assad’s officials, whether by Syrian or international courts. Hundreds of thousands of documents remain scattered through the former detention facilities, many labeled classified, in storage rooms commonly underground. Some seen by the AP included transcripts of phone conversations, even between military officers; intelligence files on activists; and a list of hundreds of prisoners killed in detention. Shadi Haroun, who spent 10 years imprisoned, has been charting Assad’s prison structure and documenting former detainees’ experiences from exile in Turkey. After Assad’s fall, he rushed back to Syria and toured detention sites. The documents, he said, show the bureaucracy behind the killings. 'They know what they are doing, it is organized.' Civil defense workers are tracking down mass graves where tens of thousands are believed to be buried. At least 10 have been identified around Damascus, mostly from residents’ reports, and five others elsewhere around the country. Authorities say they are not ready to open them. A U.N. body known as the International Impartial and Independent Mechanism has offered to help Syria's new interim administration in collecting, organizing and analyzing all the material. Since 2011, it has been compiling evidence and supporting investigations in over 200 criminal cases against figures in Assad’s government. Robert Petit, director of the U.N. body, said the task is so enormous, no one entity can do it alone. The priority would be to identify the architects of the brutality. Many want answers now. Officials cannot just declare that the missing are presumed dead, said Wafaa Mustafa, a Syrian journalist, whose father was detained and killed 12 years ago. 'No one gets to tell the families what happened without evidence, without search, without work.'	https://apnews.com/article/syria-prisons-torture-assad-missing-ad4c676858c8016ea5fd4f7a4946353e	2025-01-06T20:11:58-08:00	
Mexico drops migrants in troubled resort as it disperses them far from US border	ACAPULCO, Mexico (AP) — About 100 migrants from various countries wandered directionless and disoriented through the streets of the troubled Pacific coast resort of Acapulco. After walking for a couple weeks through southern Mexico with hundreds of other migrants, they accepted an offer from immigration officials to come to Acapulco with the idea they could continue their journey north toward the U.S. border. Instead, they found themselves stuck on Monday. Two weeks ahead of President-elect Donald Trump’s second inauguration, Mexico continues dissolving attention-grabbing migrant caravans and dispersing migrants throughout the country to keep them far from the U.S. border, while simultaneously limiting how many accumulate in any one place. The policy of 'dispersion and exhaustion' has become the center of the Mexican government’s immigration policy in recent years and last year succeeded in significantly reducing the number of migrants reaching the U.S. border, said Tonatiuh Guillén, former chief of Mexico’s immigration agency. Mexico’s current administration hopes that the lower numbers will give them some defense from Trump’s pressures, said Guillen, who left the administration of former President Andrés Manuel López Obrador after Trump threatened to impose tariffs over migration during his first presidency. Acapulco would seem to be a strange destination for migrants. Once a crown jewel of Mexico’s tourism industry, the city now suffers under the thumb of organized crime and is still struggling to climb back after taking a direct hit from devastating Hurricane Otis in 2023. On Monday, Mexican tourists enjoyed the final hours of their holiday beach vacations while migrants slept in the street or tried to find ways to resume their journeys north. 'Immigration (officials) told us they were going to give us a permit to transit the country freely for 10, 15 days and it wasn’t like that,' said a 28-year-old Venezuelan, Ender Antonio Castañeda. 'They left us dumped here without any way to get out. They won’t sell us (bus) tickets, they won’t sell us anything.' Castañeda, like thousands of other migrants, had left the southern city of Tapachula near the Guatemalan border. More than a half dozen caravans of about 1,500 migrants each have set out from Tapachula in recent weeks, but none of them made it very far. Authorities let them walk for days until they’re exhausted and then offer to bus them to various cities where they say their immigration status will be reviewed, which could mean any number of things. Some have landed in Acapulco, where about a dozen sleep at a Catholic church near the immigration agency offices. Several dozen gathered outside the offices Monday looking for information, but no one would tell them anything. Castañeda, who had just received money from his family and was desperate to leave, picked a van driver he judged to be the most trustworthy among various offering rides for up to five times the normal price for a bus ticket to Mexico City Some migrants have discovered the permits authorities give them allow them to travel only within the state of Guerrero, where Acapulco is located. Other migrants have better luck. On Sunday, the latest migrant caravan broke up after hundreds received free transit permits to go anywhere in Mexico for a specified number of days. Cuban Dayani Sánchez, 33, and her husband were among them. 'We’re a little scared by the lack of safety getting on buses, that they’re going to stop us,' she said. Mexico’s drug cartels frequently target migrants for kidnapping and extortion, though many migrants say authorities extort them too. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum insists her immigration strategy has a 'humanitarian' focus, and has allowed more migrants to leave southernmost Mexico. But some migration advocates note that migrants are being taken to violent areas. It’s a concern shared by the Rev. Leopoldo Morales, the priest at the Catholic church in Acapulco near the immigration agency office. He said that in November two or three immigration agency buses arrived with migrants, including entire families. Last weekend, two more arrived carrying all adults. Even though Acapulco isn’t on the usual migration route and was unprepared to receive migrants, several priests have coordinated support for them with water, food and clothing. 'We know they’re going through a very difficult time, with a lot of needs, they arrive without money,' Morales said. Migrants quickly realize that finding work in Acapulco is difficult. After Otis’ destruction, the federal government sent hundreds of soldiers and National Guard troops to provide security and start reconstruction. Last year, another storm, John, brought widespread flooding. But violence in Acapulco hasn’t relented. Acapulco has one of Mexico’s highest rates of homicides. Cab drivers and small business owners complain – anonymously – of rising extortion. Large companies have balked at rebuilding under the current circumstances. Honduran Jorge Neftalí Alvarenga was grateful to have escaped the Mexican state of Chiapas along the Guatemalan border, but was already disillusioned. 'To an extent they lied to us,' said Alvarenga, who thought he was going to Mexico City. 'We asked for an agreement to send us to (Mexico City) for work' or other places like Monterrey, an industrial city in the north with more work opportunities. Now he doesn’t know what to do. ___ Associated Press writer Edgar H. Clemente in Tapachula, Mexico, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-migrants-acapulco-trump-sheinbaum-3f90610817151fafe151e0569a398b59	2025-01-06T20:09:39-08:00	
Canada's Liberals look for a new prime minister as Trump threatens tariffs and an election looms	TORONTO (AP) — Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced his resignation after facing an increasing loss of support both within his party and in the country. Now Trudeau's Liberal Party must find a new leader while dealing with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's threats to impose steep tariffs on Canadian goods and with Canada's election just months away. Trudeau said Monday he plans to stay on as prime minister until a new party leader is chosen. He could not recover after Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, long one of his most powerful and loyal ministers, resigned from the Cabinet last month. Trudeau, the 53-year-old scion of Pierre Trudeau, one of Canada’s most famous prime ministers, became deeply unpopular with voters over a range of issues, including the soaring cost of food and housing as well as surging immigration. What's next for Canada? A new Canadian leader is unlikely to be named before Trump is inaugurated on Jan. 20. The political upheaval comes at a difficult moment for Canada. Trump keeps calling Canada the 51st state and has threatened to impose 25% tariffs on all Canadian goods if the government does not stem what Trump calls a flow of migrants and drugs into the U.S. — even though far fewer of them cross the border from Canada than from Mexico, which Trump has also threatened with tariffs. Trump also remains preoccupied with the U.S. trade deficit with Canada, erroneously calling it a subsidy. Canada’s ambassador to Washington, Kirsten Hillman, has said the U.S. had a $75 billion trade deficit with Canada last year. But she noted that a third of what Canada sells to the U.S. are energy exports and that there is a deficit when oil prices are high. If Trump applies tariffs, a trade war looms. Canada has vowed to retaliate. When will there be a new prime minister? The Liberals need to elect a new leader before Parliament resumes March 24 because all three opposition parties say they will bring down the Liberal government in a no-confidence vote at the first opportunity, which would trigger an election. The new leader might not be prime minister for long. A spring election would very likely favor the opposing Conservative Party. Who will be the next prime minister? It’s not often that central bank governors get compared to rock stars. But Mark Carney, the former head of the Bank of Canada, was considered just that in 2012 when he was named the first foreigner to serve as governor of the Bank of England since it was founded in 1694. The appointment of a Canadian won bipartisan praise in Britain after Canada recovered faster than many other countries from the 2008 financial crisis. He gained a reputation along the way as a tough regulator. Few people in the world have Carney’s qualifications. He is a highly educated economist with Wall Street experience who is widely credited with helping Canada dodge the worst of the 2008 global economic crisis and helping the U.K. manage Brexit. Carney has long been interested in entering politics and becoming prime minister but lacks political experience. Freeland is also a front-runner. Trudeau told Freeland last month he no longer wanted her to serve as finance minister but that she could remain deputy prime minister and the point person for U.S.-Canada relations. An official close to Freeland said Freeland couldn’t continue serving as a minister knowing she no longer enjoyed Trudeau's confidence. The official spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. The person added it's far too early to make declarations but said Freeland would talk to her colleagues this week and discuss next steps. After she resigned, Trump called Freeland 'totally toxic' and 'not at all conducive to making deals.' Freeland is many things that would seem to irritate Trump: a liberal Canadian former journalist. She is a globalist who sits on the board of the World Economic Forum. Freeland, who is of Ukrainian heritage, also has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine in its war against Russia. Another possible candidate is the new finance minister, Dominic LeBlanc. The former public safety minister, and a close friend of Trudeau, LeBlanc recently joined the prime minister at a dinner with Trump at Mar-a-Lago. LeBlanc was Trudeau's babysitter when Trudeau was a child. Is it too late for the Liberals? Recent polls suggest the Liberals' chances of winning the next election look slim. In the latest poll by Nanos, the Liberals trail the opposition Conservatives 47% to 21%. 'Trudeau’s announcement might help the Liberals in the polls in the short run and, once a new leader is selected, things could improve further at least for a little while but that would not be so hard because, right now, they’re so low in the polls,' said Daniel Béland, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal. 'Moreover, because Trudeau waited so long to announce his resignation, this will leave little time to his successor and the party to prepare for early elections,' Béland said. Many analysts say Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre will form the next government. Poilievre, for years the party’s go-to attack dog, is a firebrand populist who blamed Canada’s cost of living crisis on Trudeau. The 45-year-old Poilievre is a career politician who attracted large crowds during his run for his party's leadership. He has vowed to scrap a carbon tax and defund the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.	https://apnews.com/article/trudeau-canada-resignation-politics-election-84ff95a506d0c58226f0653447d8809b	2025-01-06T20:08:25-08:00	
Stock market today: Asian shares mostly rise after Wall Street rally led by Nvidia	TOKYO (AP) — Asian shares mostly rose Tuesday, deriving optimism from rising technology stocks on Wall Street, led by Nvidia. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 jumped 2.2% to 40,164.53. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 edged up 0.3% to 8,285.10. South Korea's Kospi added 0.4% to 2,497.75. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index slid 1.9% to 19,316.53 as shares in technology and games company Tencent plunged 7.8% after it was hit by U.S. sanctions. The Shanghai Composite edged 0.1% higher to 3,209.94. Nippon Steel, whose attempt to take over U.S. Steel is being blocked by the Biden administration, slid 1.5% in Tokyo trading, shortly after its chief executive vowed to keep pushing the deal. U.S. Steel climbed 8.1% overnight after it and Japan’s Nippon Steel filed a federal lawsuit challenging President Joe Biden’s decision to block a proposed nearly $15 billion deal for Nippon to buy its Pittsburgh-based rival. The suit, filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, alleges it was a political decision. Japanese leaders have also said there is scant evidence the merger poses a security concern for the U.S. Investors are also watching for possible policy changes under incoming President Donald Trump, whose term is beginning soon, said Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management. 'The convergence of these financial indicators points to a heightened alert among traders, who carefully calibrate their strategies for potential shifts in policy and economic directives that the new administration may bring,' he said. U.S. indexes recovered more of a holiday-season slide that bridged the new year. The S&amp;P 500 added 0.6% to 5,795.38 for a second straight gain following five straight losses, its longest losing streak since April. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost an early gain to slip 0.1% to 42,706.56, and the Nasdaq composite gained 1.2% to 19,864.98. Slightly more stocks fell in the S&amp;P 500 than rose amid the mixed trading. Tech companies were the clear leaders, including those swept up in the frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. Nvidia climbed 3.4% to top its record set in November ahead of a speech by CEO Jensen Huang at the annual CES convention in Las Vegas after trading ended for the day. Nvidia and other AI stocks have kept climbing despite concern that their stock prices have already shot too high, too fast. Despite worries about a potential bubble, the industry continues to talk up its potential. Uber Technologies drove 2.7% higher after the ride-hailing app said it would accelerate $1.5 billion in purchases of its own stock, part of a previously announced $7 billion buyback program. The New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq will close their stock and options markets on Thursday in observance of a National Day of Mourning for former President Jimmy Carter. But in a potentially market-moving event later in the week, the Federal Reserve will release minutes from its last policy meeting, where it cut its main interest rate for a third straight time. The monthly jobs report, along with an update on how U.S. consumers are feeling, are set for Friday. So far, the economy has remained remarkably resilient. The Fed began cutting interest rates in September after inflation pulled nearly all the way down to its 2% target. Getting the last percentage point of improvement from inflation may prove more difficult. Worries are also rising that tariffs and other policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump could push inflation higher. That's caused worries about rates staying higher than expected, and longer-term Treasury yields have climbed in the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury was at 4.61%, up from 4.60% late Friday. In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude declined 8 cents to $73.48 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 2 cents to $76.28 a barrel. In currency trading, the U.S. dollar rose to 157.87 Japanese yen from 157.65 yen. The euro cost $1.0398, up from $1.0391. ___ Yuri Kageyama is on Threads https://www.threads.net/@yurikageyama	https://apnews.com/article/stock-markets-nvidia-rates-inflation-31cda50a3993325ed2b2a2dafd05137b	2025-01-06T17:36:47-08:00	
Strong earthquake kills at least 53 people in western China near Mount Everest	BEIJING (AP) — A strong earthquake killed at least 53 people in Tibet on Tuesday and left many others trapped as dozens of aftershocks shook the high-altitude region of western China and across the border in Nepal. Video on state broadcaster CCTV showed orange-suited rescue workers climbing piles of debris blocking homes in a heavily damaged village, while chunks that had been knocked off buildings littered streets and crushed cars in other areas. State media reported that about 1,000 houses were damaged and 62 people were injured in addition to the deaths, citing the Tibet earthquake relief headquarters. The U.S. Geological Survey said the earthquake measured magnitude 7.1 and was relatively shallow at a depth of about 10 kilometers (6 miles). China recorded the magnitude as 6.8. The epicenter was about 75 kilometers (50 miles) northeast of Mount Everest, which straddles the China-Nepal border. The area is seismically active and is where the India and Eurasia plates clash and cause uplifts in the Himalayan mountains strong enough to change the heights of some of the world’s tallest peaks. About 50 aftershocks were recorded in the three hours after the earthquake, and the Mount Everest scenic area on the Chinese side was closed after the quake. About 1,500 fire and rescue workers were deployed to search for people, the Ministry of Emergency Management. Two hundred soldiers joined the search, CCTV said. Chinese leader Xi Jinping. called for all-out efforts to rescue people, minimize casualties and resettle those whose homes were damaged. Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing, was dispatched to the area to guide the work. CCTV said there are a handful of communities within 5 kilometers (3 miles) of the epicenter, which was 380 kilometers (240 miles) from Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, and about 23 kilometers (14 miles) from the region’s second-largest city of Shigatse, known as Xigaze in Chinese. The average altitude in the area around the epicenter is about 4,200 meters (13,800 feet), the China Earthquake Networks Center said in a social media post. In Nepal, authorities asked officials in the mountainous area near the epicenter to search for any casualties or damage. The National Emergency Operation Center in Kathmandu said people in northeastern Nepal strongly felt the earthquake but there were no immediate reports of injuries or damage to houses. A police officer in Solukhumbu district, where Mount Everest is located, said by telephone that there were no reports of damage. The area, often crowded with climbers and hikers, was empty in the depth of winter. Many residents move to the south to avoid the harsh winter. About 230 kilometers (140 miles) from the epicenter in Nepal's capital, Kathmandu, the earthquake woke up residents and sent them running out of their homes into the streets. There have been 10 earthquakes of at least magnitude 6 in the area where Tuesday's quake hit over the past century, the USGS said. ___ Associated Press writer Binaj Gurubacharya in Kathmandu, Nepal, and researcher Yu Bing in Beijing contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/china-nepal-tibet-earthquake-himalayas-ca21bd4848209370b9eebcaf107208df	2025-01-06T16:51:33-08:00	
North Korea says it tested hypersonic intermediate range missile aimed at remote Pacific targets	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea said Tuesday its latest weapons test was a new hypersonic intermediate-range missile designed to strike remote targets in the Pacific as leader Kim Jong Un vowed to further expand his collection of nuclear-capable weapons to counter rival nations. The North Korean state media report came a day after South Korea’s military said it detected North Korea launching a missile that flew 1,100 kilometers (685 miles) before landing in waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan. The launch, conducted weeks before Donald Trump returns as U.S. president, came off a torrid year in weapons testing. North Korea demonstrated multiple weapons systems last year that can target its neighbors and the United States, including solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missiles, and there are concerns that its military capabilities could advance further through technology transfers from Russia, as the two countries align over the war in Ukraine. North Korea in recent years has flight tested various intermediate-range missiles, which if perfected, could reach the U.S. Pacific military hub of Guam. In recent months, North has been testing combining these missiles with purported hypersonic warheads to improve their survivability. North Korea since 2021 has been testing various hypersonic weapons designed to fly at more than five times the speed of sound. The speed and maneuverability of such weapons aim to withstand regional missile defense systems. However, it’s unclear whether these missiles are consistently flying at the speeds the North claims. The North’s state media said Kim supervised Monday’s launch, and that the weapon traveled 1,500 kilometers (932 miles), during which it reached two different peaks of 99.8 kilometers (62 miles) and 42.5 kilometers (26.4 miles) and achieved a speed amounting to 12 times the speed of sound, before accurately striking a sea target. Lee Sung Joon, spokesperson of South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the South Korean military believes North Korea was exaggerating capabilities of the system, saying the missile covered less distance and that there was no second peak. Lee said the test was likely a followup to another hypersonic intermediate-range ballistic missile test last April and said it would be difficult to use such systems in a relatively small territory like the Korean Peninsula. He said the South Korean and U.S. militaries were continuing to analyze the missile. Kim described the missile as a crucial achievement in his goals to bolster the North’s nuclear deterrence by building an arsenal 'no one can respond to,' according to the official Korean Central News Agency. 'The hypersonic missile system will reliably contain any rivals in the Pacific region that can affect the security of our state,' the agency quoted Kim as saying. Kim reiterated that his nuclear push was aimed at countering 'different security threats the hostile forces posed to our state,' but KCNA didn’t mention any direct criticism toward Washington, Seoul or Tokyo. The launch took place while U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was visiting Seoul for talks with South Korean allies over the North Korean nuclear threat and other issues. In a news conference with South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul on Monday, Blinken condemned North Korea’s launch, which violated U.N. Security Council resolutions against the North's weapons programs. He also reiterated concerns about the growing alignment between North Korea and Russia in Moscow’s war on Ukraine. He described the military cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow as a 'two-way street,' saying Russia has been providing military equipment and training to the North and 'intends to share space and satellite technology.' According to U.S., Ukrainian and South Korean assessments, North Korea has sent more than 10,000 troops and conventional weapons systems to support Moscow’s war campaign. There are concerns that Russia could transfer to North Korea advanced weapons technology in return, which could potentially enhance the threat posed by Kim’s nuclear-armed military. At a year-end political conference, Kim Jong Un vowed to implement the 'toughest' anti-U.S. policy and criticized the Biden administration’s efforts to strengthen security cooperation with Seoul and Tokyo, which he described as a 'nuclear military bloc for aggression.' North Korean state media did not specify Kim’s policy plans or mention any specific comments about Trump. During his first term as president, Trump met Kim three times for talks on the North’s nuclear program. Even if Trump returns to the White House, a quick resumption of diplomacy with North Korea could be unlikely. Kim’s strengthened position — built on his expanded nuclear arsenal, deepening alliance with Russia and the weakening enforcement of U.S. international sanctions — presents new challenges to resolving the nuclear standoff, experts say.	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-kim-jong-un-hypersonic-irbm-trump-2190733a5bdb63fa68b32d2620c924a4	2025-01-06T15:57:41-08:00	
US transfers 11 Guantanamo detainees to Yemen after more than two decades without charge	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Pentagon said Monday it had transferred 11 Yemeni men to Oman this week after holding them for more than two decades without charge at the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The transfer was the latest and biggest push by the Biden administration in its final weeks to clear Guantanamo of the last remaining detainees there who were never charged with a crime. The latest release brings the total number of men detained at Guantanamo to 15. That's the fewest since 2002, when the George W. Bush administration turned Guantanamo into a detention site for the mostly Muslim men taken into custody around the world in what the U.S. called its 'war on terror.' The U.S. invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq and military and covert operations elsewhere followed the Sept. 11, 2001, al-Qaida attacks. The men in the latest transfer included Shaqawi al Hajj, who had undergone repeated hunger strikes and hospitalizations at Guantanamo to protest his 21 years in prison, preceded by two years of detention and torture in CIA custody, according to the U.S.-based Center for Constitutional Rights. Rights groups and some lawmakers have pushed successive U.S. administrations to close Guantanamo or, failing that, release all those detainees never charged with a crime. Guantanamo held about 800 detainees at its peak. The Biden administration and administrations before it said they were working on lining up suitable countries willing to take those never-charged detainees. Many of those stuck at Guantanamo were from Yemen, a country split by war and dominated by the Iran-allied Houthi militant group. The transfer announced Monday leaves six never-charged men still being held at Guantanamo, two convicted and sentenced inmates, and seven others charged with the 2001 attacks, the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole, and 2002 bombings in Bali.	https://apnews.com/article/guantanamo-detainees-yemen-oman-a0ac3f1353ade7828be9cb3606b36106	2025-01-06T14:03:15-08:00	
Artists who boycott Israel push back against Florida government's ban on hiring them	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — A self-described struggling artist from Missouri, Jacob Burmood says he could have used the $3,500 offered by a South Florida suburb to exhibit one of his abstract metal sculptures. But his heart 'just sank' when he learned the city contract prohibited him from 'engaging in a boycott of Israel.' Burmood turned down the offer, saying he couldn't sign in good faith 'because that would normalize this type of language in contracts. And it would normalize what’s happening right now' in Gaza. Florida is among more than 30 states that block government agencies from hiring companies that boycott Israel. Florida's law has been on the books for years, yet as the 15-month Israel-Hamas war grinds on with no end in sight, it’s sparking concerns among some artists and advocates beyond the state's borders. Supporters of an economic boycott of Israel say the campaign uses nonviolence to resist what they say are Israel’s unjust policies toward Palestinians, comparing the strategy to the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa. Opponents say the campaign veers into antisemitism and aims to delegitimize Israel itself. Burmood requested the city of Sunrise remove the anti-boycott language from the contract, but city staff told him it’s required by state law, according to emails shared with The Associated Press. A spokesperson for the city, Eric Lachs, told the AP that Sunrise 'respects the decision of the artist to not participate in our art program.' Les Gomez-Gonzalez, an artist based in Miami, said it 'was not an option' to sign a similar contract for showing their work at a gallery in a building owned by the city of Pembroke Pines. 'This perpetuates the censorship of those standing in solidarity with Palestine, and manipulates access to adequate funding,' Gomez-Gonzalez said. Shortly after Hamas’ October 2023 attack on Israel that sparked the war in Gaza, Florida’s Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis said his state stands with the key U.S. ally and emphasized 'our commitment to Israel and our fight against anti-Israel sentiments.' In the eyes of Lee Rowland, making artists affirm specific political statements is a violation of their First Amendment right to free expression. Rowland is the executive director of the National Coalition Against Censorship, an advocacy group that has been tracking court challenges to laws banning the boycott, divestment and sanctions campaign, or BDS. 'These kind of contract provisions absolutely violate the right to free expression,' she said, 'because they condition a government contract on your political beliefs and behaviors.' The governor's press secretary, Jeremy Redfern, pushed back on that claim, saying Florida's law deals with 'conduct, not speech.' Burmood said he has felt powerless watching the widespread destruction in Gaza — backed by a record $17.9 billion in U.S. military aid to Israel. Refusing to sign Florida's government contract in December was a small act of protest he could take from halfway across the world in St. Joseph, Missouri. 'I am not going to be silenced,' he said. 'Whatever my tiny little voice can do, I’m going to use it.' ___ Associated Press writer David Fischer in Miami contributed to this report.

Departing U.S. ambassador to Mexico sees 'major changes' under Trump in diplomatic relationship	MEXICO CITY (AP) — The outgoing U.S. ambassador to Mexico said Monday he anticipated 'major changes' in the diplomatic relationship between the U.S. and Mexico during the incoming Trump administration. 'There’s a lot of fear because of some of the threats being made,' Ken Salazar said in his final news conference. But he added that in order to fix a 'broken' immigration system, the U.S. will need to work hand-in-hand with the Mexican government. President-elect Donald Trump has threatened crippling tariffs if Mexico doesn't do more to slow migration and stop fentanyl trafficking. Salazar, who has served as ambassador under the administration of President Joe Biden, is slated to be replaced with Ron Johnson, a former ambassador to El Salvador during Trump's first term who was previously in the CIA. Johnson, who was tapped by Trump in December, awaits Senate confirmation. Salazar’s departure underscores a larger potential shift in relations between the U.S. and Mexico with the incoming Trump administration and newly elected Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum in power, something that could test the economic and political bonds of the most important diplomatic relationship in the hemisphere. The neighboring nations have felt very few bumps in their relationship in recent years. Mexico has helped the U.S. block migrants from going north as figures like Salazar have largely avoided criticizing moves by Sheinbaum’s ally and predecessor, Andrés Manuel López Obrador. In his departing remarks on Monday, Salazar touted what he called 'historic cooperation' between the two countries on security, migration, economic development, and combating fentanyl production. That relationship was strained last year when López Obrador was angered by criticism from Salazar over a controversial judicial reform his government pushed through, and the dramatic kidnapping and capture of narco boss Ismael 'El Mayo' Zambada. The tensions at one point caused López Obrador to put relations with the U.S. Embassy 'on pause.' But Trump’s promise of mass deportations and slapping tariffs on Mexico and other trade partners is likely to only deepen those tensions. While Sheinbaum has responded with a stern but collaborative tone towards Trump, it’s still unclear if she will be able to maintain the same amicable relationship that the Trump once shared with López Obrador, also a populist. Sharing a nearly 2,000-mile (3,218 kilometer) border and an inextricable trade relationship totaling hundreds of billions of dollars a year, maintaining strong diplomatic ties between the U.S. and Mexico have long been a crucial backbone of American foreign policy.	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-us-ambassador-salazar-trump-d5c6285f4a369ee4b4c65148c0c99e6f	2025-01-06T13:43:46-08:00	
Donald Trump Jr. to visit Greenland as his father muses anew about the US taking control of it	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Donald Trump Jr. is heading to Greenland, visiting the Danish territory as his father has continued to stoke seemingly far-fetched suggestions that the U.S. could take control of it. The younger Trump is going for a day trip to shoot video content for podcasting and will not be meeting with any government officials or political figures, according to a person familiar with the plans who was not authorized to speak publicly. 'I am hearing that the people of Greenland are ‘MAGA.’ My son, Don Jr, and various representatives, will be traveling there to visit some of the most magnificent areas and sights,' President-elect Donald Trump posted on his social media site on Monday night, referring to his 'Make America Great Again' movement 'Greenland is an incredible place, and the people will benefit tremendously if, and when, it becomes part of our Nation,' the president-elect wrote. 'We will protect it, and cherish it, from a very vicious outside World. MAKE GREENLAND GREAT AGAIN!' Danish broadcaster DR cited the head of the Department of Foreign Affairs, Mininnguaq Kleist, in reporting that Trump Jr. would be arriving Tuesday for a private visit, and there are no inquiries about a meeting with the Greenland government. Greenland's prime minister, Múte B. Egede, hasn't commented. The island is an autonomous territory that's part of the Kingdom of Denmark. Trump has had designs on Greenland before. In a statement last month as he announced his pick for U.S. ambassador to Denmark, he wrote, 'For purposes of National Security and Freedom throughout the World, the United States of America feels that the ownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity.' Trump’s eldest son has become a prominent player in his father’s political movement and has served on his presidential transition team, helping to select the people who will staff the incoming White House. But Trump Jr. has said he has no plans to join his father’s administration, instead intending to stay a key supporter of his father and his agenda from the outside. He’s especially vocal online, where he often indulges in trolling and sharing memes and hosts his own twice-a-week podcast, 'Triggered With Don Jr.' Greenland media reported that Trump Jr. may meet with Erik Jensen, the chairman of the governing party Siumut and the island’s equivalent to finance minister. The Associated Press hasn’t confirmed the meeting. Also Monday, Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of Tesla and a close advisor to the president-elect, said on X, the social media site he owns, that 'The People of Greenland should decide their future and I think they want to be part of America!' During his first term, Trump mused about purchasing Greenland, which gained home rule from Denmark in 1979. He even canceled a scheduled trip to Denmark in August 2019 after its prime minister dismissed the idea. The world's largest island, Greenland sits between the Atlantic and Arctic oceans and is 80% covered by an ice sheet and is home to a large U.S. military base. In response to Trump's December statement, Egede said, 'Greenland is ours.' 'We are not for sale and will never be for sale,' he said in a statement. 'We must not lose our years-long fight for freedom.' Greenland has its own parliament and government headed by Egede. New elections are expected to take place no later than April 6. Aaja Chemnitz, a member of Greenland’s parliament wrote in a post on Facebook that people in Greenland need to get better at saying no to the president-elect, writing that it is 'incredible that some can be so naive to think happiness is made by us becoming American citizens' and that she doesn’t 'want to be a piece of Trump’s hot dreams of expanding his empire to include our country.' 'Don’t let Trump control the Greenland election campaign and leave the population as losers in that game,' Chemnitz wrote. ___ Price reported from New York.

US eases restrictions on Syria while keeping sanctions in place	WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. on Monday eased some restrictions on Syria's transitional government to allow the entry of humanitarian aid after Islamist insurgents ousted Syrian leader Bashar Assad last month. The U.S. Treasury issued a general license, lasting six months, that authorizes certain transactions with the Syrian government, including some energy sales and incidental transactions. The move does not lift sanctions on the nation that has been battered by more than a decade of war, but indicates a limited show of U.S. support for the new transitional government. The general license underscores America's commitment to ensuring its sanctions 'do not impede activities to meet basic human needs, including the provision of public services or humanitarian assistance,' a Treasury Department statement reads. Treasury Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo said his agency 'will continue to support humanitarian assistance and responsible governance in Syria.' Since Assad's ouster, representatives from the nation's new de facto authorities have said that the new Syria will be inclusive and open to the world. The U.S. has gradually lifted some penalties since Assad departed Syria for protection in Russia. The Biden administration in December decided to drop a $10 million bounty it had offered for the capture of a Syrian rebel leader whose forces led the ouster of Assad last month. The announcement followed a meeting in Damascus between the leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, Ahmad al-Sharaa, who was once aligned with al-Qaida, and the top U.S. diplomat for the Middle East, Barbara Leaf, who led the first U.S. diplomatic delegation into Syria since Assad’s ouster. The U.S. and U.N. have long designated HTS as a terrorist organization. HTS led a lightning insurgency that ousted Assad on Dec. 8 and ended his family’s decades-long rule. From 2011 until Assad’s downfall, Syria’s uprising and civil war killed an estimated 500,000 people. Much of the world ended diplomatic relations with Assad because of his crackdown on protesters, and sanctioned him and his Russian and Iranian associates. Most of Western-led sanctions targeted Assad, and his associates, for the brutal crackdown on protesters and their manufacturing of the amphetamine-like stimulant Captagon, which reportedly generated billions of dollars as packages of the little white pills were smuggled across Syria’s porous borders. With Assad out of the picture, Syria’s new authorities hope that the international community will pour money into the country to rebuild its battered infrastructure and make its economy viable again. Syria’s infrastructure has been battered, with power cuts rampant in the country and some 90% of its population living in poverty. About half the population won’t know where its next meal will come from, as inflation surges. The pressure to lift sanctions has mounted in recent years as aid agencies continue to cut programs due to donor fatigue and a massive 2023 earthquake that rocked Syria and Turkey. The tremor killed over 59,000 people and destroyed critical infrastructure that couldn’t be fixed due to sanctions and overcompliance, despite the US announcing some humanitarian exemptions. Qutaiba Idlbi, a research fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank who leads work on Syria said ahead of the general license issuance: 'There is a general agreement,' among regional and international governments, 'that we need to avoid driving Syria back into chaos.' 'The only path forward is to engage positively.' ___ Chehayeb contributed from Beirut, Lebanon.	https://apnews.com/article/treasury-bashar-assad-sanctions-syria-biden-4df4fb793579c7aa820bcf5392286bd5	2025-01-06T10:48:03-08:00	
Indonesia is admitted to the BRICS bloc of developing nations, Brazil announces	SAO PAULO (AP) — Indonesia has been admitted as a full member of the BRICS bloc of developing economies, the group's presiding country Brazil announced Monday. Indonesia’s candidacy was endorsed by BRICS leaders in August 2023, according to the foreign ministry of Brazil, which holds the group’s presidency for 2025. However, the world's fourth-most populous nation opted to formally join the bloc only after the formation of its newly elected government last year. 'The Brazilian government welcomes Indonesia’s entry into the BRICS,' the government said in a statement. 'With the largest population and economy in Southeast Asia, Indonesia shares with other members a commitment to reforming global governance institutions and contributes positively to deepening South-South cooperation.' BRICS was formed by Brazil, Russia, India and China in 2009, and added South Africa in 2010. Last year, the alliance expanded to embrace Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia and the United Arab Emirates. Saudia Arabia has been invited to join but has not yet done so. Turkey, Azerbaijan and Malaysia have formally applied to become members and a few others have expressed interest. The organization was created as a counterweight to the Group of Seven, comprised of developed nations. Its name derives from an economic term used in the early 2000s to describe rising countries expected to dominate the global economy by 2050. Before Indonesia’s membership, the bloc accounted for nearly 45% of the world’s population and 35% of global gross domestic product, measured using purchasing power parity.	https://apnews.com/article/brazil-brics-indonesia-membership-c05b0c8e2ae493f9046479e62a45d8fa	2025-01-06T10:28:16-08:00	
Hurdles remain as Israel and Hamas once again inch toward a ceasefire deal	JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel and Hamas once again appear to be inching toward a ceasefire that could wind down the 15-month war in Gaza and bring home dozens of Israelis held hostage there. Both Israel and Hamas are under pressure from outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump to reach a deal before the Jan. 20 inauguration. But the sides have come close before, only to have talks collapse over various disagreements. The latest round of negotiations has bogged down over the names of hostages to be released in a first phase, according to Israeli, Egyptian and Hamas officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were discussing ongoing negotiations. Israel wants assurances that the hostages are alive, while Hamas says that after months of heavy fighting, it isn't sure who is alive or dead. Other hurdles remain. The first phase, expected to last for six to eight weeks, would also include a halt in fighting, a release of Palestinian prisoners and a surge in aid to the besieged Gaza Strip, according to the officials. The last phase would include the release of any remaining hostages, an end to the war, and talks on reconstruction and who will govern Gaza going forward. 'If we don’t get it across the finish line in the next two weeks, I’m confident that it will get to completion at some point, hopefully sooner rather than later,' U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in Seoul on Monday. Here’s a closer look at the key issues holding up a deal: The release of hostages from Gaza During its Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel, Hamas and other groups killed some 1,200 people and took about 250 hostages into Gaza. A truce in November 2023 freed more than 100 hostages, while others have been rescued or their remains have been recovered over the past year. Israel says about 100 hostages remain in Gaza — at least a third of whom it believes were killed during the Oct. 7 attack or died in captivity. The first batch of hostages to be released is expected to be made up mostly of women, older people and people with medical conditions, according to the Israeli, Egyptian and Hamas officials. On Monday, a Hamas official shared with AP a list of 34 names of hostages it said were slated for release. An Egyptian official confirmed the list had been the focus of recent discussions. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said the names were from a list Israel had submitted months ago. 'As of now, Israel has not received any confirmation or comment by Hamas regarding the status of the hostages appearing on the list,' it said. A second Hamas official on Monday released a list of 14 names the group claimed Israel had removed from consideration after they were approved by Hamas and substituted with other names. Israel did not respond for a request for comment, but it has pronounced the 14 people dead. An Israeli official said the current impasse was due to Hamas' refusal to provide information on the conditions of the hostages, while another official said the departure of the head of the Mossad intelligence agency for negotiations in Qatar was on hold. A Hamas official, meanwhile, said that 'no one knows' the conditions of all of the hostages. Hamas officials have said that due to the war, they cannot provide a full accounting until there is a truce. Since the war began, over 45,800 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, according to local health authorities, who say women and children make up more than half of those killed. They do not say how many of the dead were militants. Pausing the war or ending it? Families of hostages reacted angrily to reports of the phased approach, saying the government should instead be pursuing a deal that releases all the captives at once. They say time is running out to bring people home safely. 'This morning, I and everyone in Israel woke up and discovered that the state of Israel has put together a Schindler's List — 34 people who will be able to hug their families again, and 66 others whose fate will be sealed,' said Yotam Cohen, whose brother Nimrod, an Israeli soldier held hostage, did not appear on the published list. Netanyahu has said he supports a partial deal that pauses the war, but he has rejected Hamas' demands for a full Israeli withdrawal that would end the war. Netanyahu has vowed to continue fighting until he achieves 'total victory' — including the destruction of Hamas' military capabilities. Israel has inflicted heavy damage on Hamas. But the group continues to stage attacks in Gaza and to fire rockets into Israel. That could portend an open-ended war that could drag on for months or years. The Hostages Forum, a grassroots group representing many hostage families, said it was time for a comprehensive deal. 'We know more than half are still alive and need immediate rehabilitation, while those who were murdered must be returned for proper burial,' it said. 'We have no more time to waste. A hostage ceasefire agreement must be sealed now!' The release of Palestinian prisoners in Israel As part of the deal, Israel is expected to free hundreds of imprisoned Palestinians, including dozens who were convicted in bloody attacks. Israel has a history of large-scale prisoner releases, and hundreds were freed in the November 2023 deal. But the sides have disagreed over the exact number and names of the prisoners to be freed. Hamas wants high-profile prisoners included. Israeli officials have ruled out the release of Marwan Barghouti, who tops Hamas' wish list. Netanyahu's governing coalition includes hardliners who oppose such releases, with some even pledging to quit the government if too many concessions are made. They point to a 2011 prisoner release that included the former Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, a mastermind of the Oct. 7 attacks who was killed by Israel in October. The return of Palestinians to their homes in Gaza The war has displaced an estimated 90% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people, according to U.N. estimates, with the hard-hit northern sector of the territory largely emptied of its prewar population. During the first phase of the developing deal, Israel is expected to withdraw troops from Palestinian population centers and allow some of the displaced to return home. But the extent of the pullback and the number of people allowed to return must still be worked out, the officials say. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

Middle East latest: 3 Israelis fatally shot in West Bank attack on a bus	Gunmen opened fire on a bus carrying Israelis in the occupied West Bank on Monday, killing two 70-year-old women and a 35-year-old policeman, Israel's military said. Israeli soldiers have launched widespread operations in the northern West Bank looking for the attackers. Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war, and the Palestinians seek all three territories for their future state. Meanwhile, the war in Gaza is raging with no end in sight, although there has reportedly been recent progress in long-running talks aimed at a ceasefire and release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza has killed over 45,800 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who say women and children make up more than half of those killed. They do not say how many of the dead were militants. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed across the border in a massive surprise attack nearly 15 months ago, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. ___ Here's the latest: Militants in Gaza fire 3 rockets into Israel, no casualties JERUSALEM - Militants in Gaza fired three projectiles into Israel on Monday, one of which was intercepted, the Israeli military said. There were no reports of casualties, but the rockets damaged a home in the southern Israeli city of Sderot, which is located near Gaza. Israeli media reported it was the third time the same home had sustained damage from rockets from Gaza. After a long pause, militants in northern Gaza have launched near-daily rockets in recent weeks despite the ongoing Israeli military operations in the area. The launches highlighted that although Hamas has suffered major losses, they seem to repeatedly regroup after Israeli operations. Palestinian militants have fired thousands of rockets and missiles towards Israel since the war began on Oct. 7, 2023. Israel’s military offensive has turned vast swathes of Gaza into an uninhabitable wasteland, erasing whole neighborhoods. UN says Israel shot at one of its aid convoys in Gaza CAIRO — Israeli soldiers opened fire on a United Nations aid convoy in central Gaza, according to a World Food Program, which provides desperately needed food and aid. None of the eight staff members were injured, the WFP said Monday. The WFP said the Israeli military shot at least 16 bullets toward their convoy of three vehicles on Sunday, despite receiving necessary clearance from the military. The WFP said shooting at a clearly-marked U.N. aid convoy was 'unacceptable' and called on all sides to allow the safe passage of humanitarian aid. Israel’s military said Monday that 'operating procedures have been clarified, and findings from the inquiry will be analyzed,' without explicitly saying Israeli forces were the ones who fired on the aid convoy. In November, the military struck a car belonging to the charity World Central Kitchen, killing five employees, after claiming that one of the employees had ties to the Oct. 7, 2023 attack that sparked the war in Gaza. The strike highlighted the dangerous work of delivering aid in Gaza, where the war has displaced much of the 2.3 million population and caused widespread hunger. Israeli forces withdraw from a third town in southern Lebanon as part of ceasefire deal BEIRUT — The Lebanese army began deploying to the southern coastal city of Naqoura as the Israeli army withdrew, the U.S. and Lebanon said Monday. Israel has already pulled out of two other southern towns, Khiam and Shamaa, since the ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel went into effect over a month ago. Both Israel and Hezbollah agreed to pull their forces out of southern Lebanon before the end of January, which will be secured by the Lebanese army and U.N. peacekeepers. The phased withdrawal of Israeli forces from southern Lebanon is 'going according to the plan,' said U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein, but he did not confirm whether the pullout would be completed within the 60-day limit under the ceasefire conditions. 'We have 20 days left to reach the 60 days. We are going to continue the same work that has led to the successful withdrawal and deployment that we saw today,' Hochstein said. The Israeli military said it 'is committed to the understanding in regards to the ceasefire conditions.' The deployment coincided with a meeting of the committee overseeing the ceasefire agreement in Ras al-Naqoura, which is home to the headquarters of the U.N. peacekeeping mission. The meeting was attended by Hochstein, who arrived in Beirut on Monday. Hochstein helped broker the ceasefire that ended the 14-month war. After the deployment is completed in Naqoura, the Lebanese army said specialized units will survey the area to remove unexploded ordnance, and urged residents to avoid the area. UN envoy for Yemen arrives in Houthi-held capital city UNITED NATIONS — The U.N. special envoy for Yemen has arrived in the Houthi rebel-held capital of Sanaa. Hans Grundberg's 'visit is part of the ongoing efforts to de-escalate the current tensions that have engulfed the region and Yemen,' U.N. spokesman Stéphane Dujarric said Monday. 'In addition, his efforts will focus on advancing the peace process.' The Iran-backed Houthis have stepped up their missile attacks against Israel, and have been targeting shipping in the Red Sea corridor for over a year — attacks they say won't stop until there's a ceasefire in Gaza. Israel has repeatedly bombarded Yemen's ports, oil infrastructure and the airport in Sanaa, some 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles) away. 'We’ll also be pushing for the release of the arbitrarily detained U.N. personnel and also from other NGOs and civil society,' the U.N. spokesman said. The Houthis claim the detainees, most of them held since June, are part of an 'American-Israeli spy network,' an allegation vehemently denied by the U.N., NGO organizations, governments and others. Three Israelis killed by gunmen targeting bus in the occupied West Bank JERUSALEM — Israel’s rescue service said gunmen attacked a bus carrying Israelis in the occupied West Bank, killing at least three people and wounding eight others. The attack occurred Monday in the Palestinian village of Al-Funduq, on one of the main east-west roads crossing the territory. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to 'settle accounts' with the attackers 'and with everyone who assisted them.' Hamas praised the attack in a statement, but did not claim responsibility for it. Violence has surged in the West Bank since the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza began in October 2023. The Palestinian Health Ministry says at least 838 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire in the West Bank since the start of the war in Gaza. Most appear to have been militants killed in battles with Israeli troops, but the dead also include participants in violent protests — and civilian bystanders. At least 46 Israelis, including 19 soldiers, have been killed in violent attacks by Palestinian militants, according to the U.N.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-syria-lebanon-news-01-06-2025-a73d8271fe097b3bd2e70697a859e222	2025-01-06T09:38:11-08:00	
A far-right leader could soon take the helm in EU member country Austria. Here's why it matters	VIENNA, Austria (AP) — A party that advocates an end to economic sanctions against Russia and has called for the 'remigration of uninvited foreigners' could soon give Austria its first government headed by the far right since World War II, with a leader who has a provocative style at its helm. Attempts to form a government without the far-right Freedom Party collapsed in recent days, more than three months after it won a parliamentary election. President Alexander Van der Bellen on Monday tasked its leader, Herbert Kickl, with trying to put together a coalition in the coming weeks or months. The Freedom Party was founded in 1956 by former Nazis and, over the decades, has become an established political force in Austria. It has led provincial governments and served as a junior partner in national governments — but never, until now, led a national administration. Here’s a look at the background – and the stakes — if Kickl succeeds in forming a new government: What happened to bring Austria to this point? The Freedom Party has come back strongly since its last stint in government ended in a scandal in 2019, benefiting from rising voter anger about immigration and inflation. In September legislative elections, the party won 28.8% of the vote, a nearly 13-point gain from its tally four years earlier. The governing conservative Austrian People's Party came in second with 26.3% and the Social Democrats third with 21.1%. It's usual for Austrian elections to result in coalitions, but this result was particularly complicated because none of the other party leaders at the time were prepared to go into government with the Freedom Party under Kickl. The president asked outgoing Chancellor Karl Nehammer to try to set up a new government, but talks on potential three-way and two-way coalitions without the far right ran aground over how to get Austria's budget in shape and also revive the economy. On Saturday, Nehammer said he would resign. Van der Bellen then called in Kickl – a sharp-tongued provocateur who last year mocked the now 80-year-old president as 'a mummy' and 'senile' – for talks that led to Monday’s offer for the Freedom Party to try to form a new government. Who is Kickl? The 56-year-old is known for deliberately overstepping accepted boundaries and shocking the political establishment. A former speechwriter for late former far-right leader Jörg Haider and a longtime campaign strategist who coined catchy and provocative anti-immigration slogans, Kickl was interior minister from 2017 to 2019 when the Freedom Party was a junior partner in a coalition government under conservative then-Chancellor Sebastian Kurz. He became the Freedom Party leader in June 2021. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Kickl joined some other critics of the World Health Organization in advocating use of Ivermectin, a medicine for treatment of parasitic worms in animals, to treat the disease. Nehammer has said that Kickl 'radicalized himself' and it is 'impossible to shape a state' with him. The Freedom Party over the years has attracted a neo-Nazi fringe, but it has publicly disassociated itself from decades of covert anti-Semitism. In 2015, a party lawmaker was expelled for backing an antisemitic comment on social media and Kickl, the party's general secretary at the time, said she had 'crossed a red line.' While interior minister in 2018, Kickl denied any intention of being provocative when he said asylum-seekers in Austria might be held 'in a concentrated way in one place' as authorities assessed their applications. The European Union rattled again Years after financial crisis drove a wedge in the European bloc, and nearly five years after Brexit, the European Union is facing a new sign of internal discord: The 27-member bloc has been a stalwart supporter of Ukraine, but unity is fraying. Far-right movements have been on the rise in the EU in recent years. The U.S presidential election victory of Donald Trump – who shares many of their values and policy positions – in November has further emboldened them. The Freedom Party is both pro-Russian and skeptical about EU mandates, calling for a 'Fortress Austria' that can wrest decision-making power from Brussels. The party’s rise has coincided with rising voter anger about immigration and inflation. The Freedom Party is part of a right-wing populist alliance in the European Parliament, Patriots for Europe.

UK's anti-corruption minister refers herself to ethics watchdog over links to ousted Bangladeshi PM	LONDON (AP) — A British Treasury minister has referred herself to the U.K. government's ethics watchdog following reports that she lived in London properties linked to her aunt Sheikh Hasina, the ousted Bangladeshi prime minister. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Monday that Treasury economic secretary Tulip Siddiq 'acted entirely properly' by referring herself to his independent adviser on ministerial standards. Siddiq, who is responsible for tackling corruption in financial markets, was named last month in an anti-corruption investigation in Bangladesh against Hasina. The investigation alleged that Siddiq's family was involved in brokering a 2013 deal with Russia for a nuclear power plant in Bangladesh in which large sums of money were said to have been embezzled. The minister faced further questions about her links to her aunt's regime after reports in the Sunday Times and Financial Times newspapers alleged she had used two London apartments given to her by associates of Bangladesh's Awami League, led by Hasina. Hasina was Bangladesh's longest-serving prime minister and ruled the country for 15 years until August 2024, when she was ousted amid a mass uprising in which hundreds of protesters were killed and thousands were injured. Hasina, who has fled to India, faces many court cases over the deaths, including some on charges of crimes against humanity. Siddiq, 42, maintains she has done nothing wrong in her letter to the ministerial standards watchdog, adding: 'For the avoidance of doubt, I would like you to independently establish the facts about these matters.' Starmer said he had confidence in Siddiq, 42, who was elected lawmaker in north London in 2015. She had been due to join a U.K. government delegation to China later this week, but will now stay in Britain.	https://apnews.com/article/uk-bangladesh-tulip-siddiq-sheikh-hasina-bc6afcbe3c71021a3727091152d8330a	2025-01-06T05:32:39-08:00	
Canada's Trudeau is expected to announce his political future after facing growing calls to resign	TORONTO (AP) — Facing growing calls to resign, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is expected to make an announcement Monday about his political future. Trudeau — who has become deeply unpopular over a range of issues, including the soaring cost of food and housing — has kept publicly mum in recent weeks, despite intensifying pressure for him to step down after the abrupt resignation of his finance minister on Dec. 16. The prime minister has now returned to Ottawa after the Christmas holidays. 'His long silence following this political drama speaks volumes about the weakness of his current position,' said Daniel Béland, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal. While all three opposition parties now say they would support a vote to topple Trudeau's minority government, Parliament is not currently in session so that threat isn't immediate. But members of his own party are increasingly calling for his resignation — making his situation appear more and more untenable. The prime minister’s office said he would address the media on Monday morning. Still, there is no mechanism for Trudeau’s party to force him out in the short term. If he hangs on until Parliament returns later this month, his Liberal party could be forced from power by a no-confidence vote that would trigger an election, which would very likely favor the opposing Conservative Party. The 53-year-old was initially hailed for returning the country to its liberal past when he was elected in 2015, but he has become widely unpopular in recent years. The political upheaval comes at a difficult moment for Canada. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to impose 25% tariffs on all Canadian products if Canada does not stem what he calls a flow of migrants and drugs in the United States — even though far fewer of each cross into the U.S. from Canada than from Mexico. Trudeau is scheduled to participate virtually in a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Canada-U.S. Relations on Monday. If Trudeau does step down as party leader, the Liberals could potentially delay the return of Parliament to give them time to choose a new leader. Because Trudeau’s Liberals do not hold an outright majority in Parliament, they have for years depended on the support of the NDP to pass legislation and stay in power. But that support has vanished — NDP leader Jagmeet Singh made clear last month the NDP will vote to bring down the government. The other opposition parties have said the same.	https://apnews.com/article/trudeau-canada-politics-future-resignation-calls-03b27b55590bda7fb341065dd51fb873	2025-01-06T05:14:44-08:00	
Venezuelan opposition leader who claims to have defeated Maduro to meet Biden at White House	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — The Venezuelan opposition leader who claims to have defeated President Nicolás Maduro in last year’s presidential election will meet with U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday at the White House, a senior administration official confirmed to The Associated Press. The meeting comes as Edmundo González, a retired diplomat who represented Venezuela’s main opposition coalition in the July presidential election, tries to rally support for his effort to get Maduro out of office. The official was not authorized to discussed details of the visit publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. González began a tour of the Americas with stops in Argentina and Uruguay on Saturday. He called on Venezuelans living in the Washington area to gather Monday outside the offices of the Organization of American States. Meanwhile, Maduro already received an invitation from the National Assembly to be sworn in for a third term Friday, more than five months after the National Electoral Council, stacked with ruling-party loyalists, declared him winner of the July 28 election. Unlike previous presidential elections, electoral authorities did not provide detailed vote counts. However, the opposition collected tally sheets from more than 80% of the nation’s electronic voting machines, posted them online and said they showed González had won the election with twice as many votes as Maduro. The U.S. and most European governments have rejected the election’s official results and consider González the legitimate winner. ——— Miller reported from Washington, D.C.	https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-edmundo-gonzalez-white-house-maduro-election-3a80969382a3ee3c05f43bf6cefa987c	2025-01-06T04:53:07-08:00	
UK leader Starmer slams 'lies and misinformation' after attacks from Elon Musk	LONDON (AP) — British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Monday condemned 'lies and misinformation' that he said are undermining U.K. democracy, in response to a barrage of attacks on his government from Elon Musk. The billionaire Tesla CEO has taken an intense and erratic interest in British politics since the center-left Labour Party was elected in July. Musk has used his social network, X, to call for a new election and demand Starmer be imprisoned. On Monday he posted an online poll for his 210 million followers on the proposition: 'America should liberate the people of Britain from their tyrannical government.' Asked about Musk’s comments during a question session at a hospital near London, Starmer criticized 'those that are spreading lies and misinformation as far and as wide as possible,' particularly opposition Conservative politicians in Britain who have echoed some of Musk’s claims. Musk often posts on X about the U.K., retweeting criticism of Starmer and the hashtag TwoTierKeir -– shorthand for an unsubstantiated claim that Britain has 'two-tier policing' with far-right protesters treated more harshly than pro-Palestinian or Black Lives Matter demonstrators. During summer anti-immigrant violence across the U.K. he tweeted that 'civil war is inevitable.' Recently Musk has focused on child sexual abuse, particularly a series of cases that rocked northern England towns in which groups of men, largely from Pakistani backgrounds, were tried for grooming and abusing dozens of girls. The cases have been used by far-right activists to link child abuse to immigration, and to accuse politicians of covering up the 'grooming gangs' out of a fear of appearing racist. Musk has posted a demand for a new public inquiry into the cases. A huge, seven-year inquiry was held under the previous Conservative government, though many of the 20 recommendations it made in 2022 — including compensation for abuse victims — have yet to be implemented. Starmer's government said it would act on them as quickly as possible. Musk also has accused Starmer of failing to bring perpetrators to justice when he was England's director of public prosecutions between 2008 and 2013. Starmer defended his record as chief prosecutor, saying he had reopened closed cases and 'changed the whole prosecution approach' to child sexual exploitation. He also condemned language used by Musk about Jess Phillips, a government minister responsible for combating violence against women and girls. Musk called Phillips a 'rape genocide apologist' and said she deserved to be in prison. 'When the poison of the far-right leads to serious threats to Jess Phillips and others, then in my book, a line has been crossed,' Starmer said. 'I enjoy the cut and thrust of politics, the robust debate that we must have, but that’s got to be based on facts and truth, not on lies.' Musk has also called for the release of Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, a far-right activist who goes by the name Tommy Robinson and is serving a prison sentence for contempt of court. Starmer said people 'cheerleading Tommy Robinson … are trying to get some vicarious thrill from street violence that people like Tommy Robinson promote.' Starmer largely avoided mentioning Musk by name in his responses, likely wary of giving him more of a spotlight — or of angering Musk ally Donald Trump, who is due to be inaugurated as U.S. president on Jan. 20. Musk's incendiary interventions are a growing worry for governments elsewhere in Europe, too. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, another target of the X owner's ire, said he is staying 'cool' over critical personal comments made by Musk, but finds it worrying that the U.S. billionaire makes the effort to get involved in Germany's election by endorsing the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. Starmer said the main issue was not Musk's posts on X, but 'what are politicians here doing to stand up for our democracy?' He said he was concerned about Conservative politicians in Britain 'so desperate for attention they are amplifying what the far right are saying.' 'Once we lose the anchor that truth matters … then we are on a very slippery slope,' he said. While some Conservatives, including party leader Kemi Badenoch, have echoed Musk’s points, the main U.K. beneficiary of his interest has been Reform U.K., the hard-right party led by Nigel Farage that has just five seats in the 650-seat House of Commons but big expansion plans. Farage said last month that Musk was considering making a multimillion-dollar donation to the party. But Farage is critical of Tommy Robinson, refusing to let him join Reform, and on Sunday Musk posted: 'The Reform Party needs a new leader. Farage doesn’t have what it takes.' Farage tweeted in response: 'Well, this is a surprise! Elon is a remarkable individual but on this I am afraid I disagree.'	https://apnews.com/article/keir-starmer-elon-musk-far-right-84d1813442f8f155a59b7349fac47db7	2025-01-06T03:25:50-08:00	
Pope Francis has named the first woman to head a major Vatican office	ROME (AP) — Pope Francis on Monday named the first woman to head a major Vatican office, appointing an Italian nun, Sister Simona Brambilla, to become prefect of the department responsible for all the Catholic Church's religious orders. The appointment marks a major step in Francis’ aim to give women more leadership roles in governing the church. While women have been named to No. 2 spots in some Vatican offices, never before has a woman been named prefect of a dicastery or congregation of the Holy See Curia, the central governing organ of the Catholic Church. The historic nature of Brambilla’s appointment was confirmed by Vatican Media, which headlined its report 'Sister Simona Brambilla is the first woman prefect in the Vatican.' The office is one of the most important in the Vatican. Known officially as the Dicastery for the Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life, it is responsible for every religious order, from the Jesuits and Franciscans to smaller newer movements. In an indication of the novelty of the appointment, and the theological implications involved, Francis simultaneously named as a co-leader, or 'pro-prefect,' a cardinal: Ángel Fernández Artime, a Salesian. But the appointment, announced in the Vatican daily bulletin, lists Brambilla first as 'prefect' and Fernández second as her co-leader, which theologically is necessary since the prefect must be able to celebrate Mass and perform other sacramental functions that currently can only be done by men. Brambilla, 59, is a member of the Consolata Missionaries religious order and had served as the No. 2 in the religious orders department since last year. She takes over from the retiring Cardinal Joao Braz de Aviz, 77. Francis made Brambilla’s appointment possible with his 2022 reform of the Holy See’s founding constitution, which allowed laypeople, including women, to head a dicastery and become prefects. Brambilla, a nurse, worked as a missionary in Mozambique and led her Consolata order as superior from 2011-2023, when Francis made her secretary of the religious orders department. Her appointment is the latest move by Francis to show by example how women can take leadership roles within the Catholic hierarchy, albeit without allowing them to be ordained as priests. Catholic women do much of the church’s work in schools, hospitals and passing down the faith to future generations. But they have long complained of second-class status in an institution that reserves the priesthood for men. Francis has upheld the ban on female priests and tamped down hopes that women could be ordained as deacons. But there has been a marked increase in the percentage of women working in the Vatican during his papacy, including in leadership positions, from 19.3% in 2013 to 23.4% today, according to statistics reported by Vatican News. In the Curia alone, the percentage of women is 26%. Among the women holding leadership positions are Sister Raffaella Petrini, the first-ever female secretary general of the Vatican City State, responsible for the territory’s health care system, police force and main source of revenue, the Vatican Museums, which are led by a laywoman, Barbara Jatta. Another nun, Sister Alessandra Smerilli, is the No. 2 in the Vatican development office while several women have been appointed to under-secretary positions, including the French nun, Sister Nathalie Becquart, in the synod of bishops' office. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Residents of Syria's Quneitra are frustrated by lack of action to halt Israeli advance	QUNEITRA, Syria (AP) — A main road in the provincial capital of Quneitra in southern Syria was blocked with mounds of dirt, fallen palm trees and a metal pole that appeared to have once been a traffic light. On the other side of the barriers, an Israeli tank could be seen maneuvering in the middle of the street. Israeli forces entered the area — which lies in a U.N.-patrolled buffer zone in the Golan Heights that was established by a 1974 ceasefire agreement between Syria and Israel — soon after the fall of President Bashar Assad last month in the country's 13-year civil war. The Israeli military has also made incursions into Syrian territory outside of the buffer zone, sparking protests by local residents. They said the Israeli forces have demolished homes and prevented farmers from going to their fields in some areas. On at least two occasions, Israeli troops reportedly opened fired on protesters who approached them. Residents of Quneitra, a seemingly serene bucolic expanse of small villages and olive groves, said they are frustrated, both by the Israeli advances and by the lack of action from Syria’s new authorities and the international community. Rinata Fastas said that Israeli forces raided local government buildings but had not so far entered residential neighborhoods. Her house lies just inside of the newly blocked-off area in the provincial capital formerly called Baath City, after Assad's former ruling party, and now renamed Salam City. She said she is afraid Israeli troops may advance farther or try to permanently occupy the area they have already taken. Israel still controls the Golan Heights, a strategic plateau overlooking northern Israel that it captured from Syria during the 1967 Mideast war and later annexed. The international community, with the exception of the U.S., regards it as occupied. Fastas said she understands that Syria, which is now trying to build its national institutions and army from scratch, is in no position to militarily confront Israel. 'But why is no one in the new Syrian state coming out and talking about the violations that are happening in Quneitra province and against the rights of its people?' she asked. Syria's new rulers are in no rush to confront Israel Israel describes its activity in Syria as defensive and temporary. Officials point to the presence of Iranian-backed forces in Syria before Assad was ousted, and say they want to prevent a cross-border incursion like the Hamas-led attack that triggered the war in Gaza. They are also wary of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the Islamist former insurgent group that is now the dominant faction in Syria's new administration and which previously had ties to al-Qaida, although it has renounced them. Israel’s foreign minister, Gideon Saar, recently called Syria’s new leadership a 'terrorist gang' and claimed that many countries wanted to recognize the new Syrian government only in order to send their Syrian refugees home. The United Nations has accused Israel of violating the 1974 ceasefire agreement by entering the buffer zone. The Israeli army said in a statement that it 'remains committed to the principles' of the agreement. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said troops will stay in Syria 'until another arrangement is found that will ensure Israel’s security.' He was speaking from the snowy peak of Mount Hermon, Syria’s tallest mountain known as Jabal al Sheikh in Arabic, which has now been captured by Israeli forces. The new Syrian government has lodged a complaint with the U.N. Security Council about Israeli airstrikes and advances into Syrian territory. But the issue does not appear to be a priority for Syria’s new rulers as they try to consolidate control over the country, turn a patchwork of former rebel factions into a new national army, and push for the removal of Western sanctions. The country’s new de facto leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, head of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, has also publicly said Syria is not seeking a military conflict with Israel and will not pose a threat to its neighbors or to the West. In the meantime, residents of Quneitra have largely been left to fend for themselves. In the village of Rafid, inside the buffer zone, locals said the Israeli military had demolished two civilian houses and a grove of trees as well as a former Syrian army outpost. Mayor Omar Mahmoud Ismail said when the Israeli forces entered the village, an Israeli officer greeted him and told him, 'I am your friend.' 'I told him, ‘You are not my friend, and if you were, you wouldn’t enter like this,’' Ismail said. Locals who organized a protest were met with Israeli fire In Dawaya, a village outside the buffer zone, 18-year-old Abdelrahman Khaled al-Aqqa was lying on a mattress in his family home Sunday, still recovering after being shot in both legs. Al-Aqqa said he joined about 100 people from the area on Dec. 25 in protest against the Israeli incursion, chanting 'Syria is free, Israel get out!' 'We didn’t have any weapons, we were just there in the clothes we were wearing,' he said. 'But when we got close to them, they started shooting at us.' Six protesters were wounded, according to residents and media reports. Another man was injured on Dec. 20 in a similar incident in the village of Maariyah. The Israeli army said at the time that it had fired because the man was quickly approaching and ignored calls to stop. Regarding the Dec. 25 incident, the Israeli military said its forces had fired 'warning shots solely aimed at the air' after the crowd did not heed a call to stand back. In the village of Swisah, Adel Subhi al-Ali, a local Sunni religious official, sat with his 21-year-old son, Moutasem, who was recovering after being shot in the stomach in the Dec. 25 protest. He was driven first to a local hospital that did not have the capacity to treat him, and then to Damascus where he underwent surgery. When he saw the Israeli tanks moving in, 'We felt that an occupation is occupying our land. So we had to defend it, even though we didn’t have weapons, ... It is impossible for them to settle here,' al-Ali said. Since the day of the protest, the Israeli army has not returned to the area, he said. Al-Ali called for the international community to 'pressure Israel to return to what was agreed upon with the former regime,' referring to the 1974 ceasefire agreement, and to return the Golan Heights to Syria. But he acknowledged that Syria has little leverage. 'We are starting from zero, we need to build a state,' al-Ali said, echoing Syria's new leaders. 'We are not ready as a country now to open wars with another country.' ——— Associated Press writer Josef Federman in Jerusalem contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-israel-golan-quneitra-protests-2aa424ecbeee62119e10c369b1bb4b44	2025-01-06T01:27:40-08:00	
Austrian far right gets mandate to try to lead a government for the first time since World War II	VIENNA (AP) — The leader of Austria's Freedom Party received a mandate Monday to form a new government, which would be the first headed by the far right since World War II if he succeeds. The anti-immigration and euroskeptic Freedom Party, which opposes sanctions against Russia and is led by Herbert Kickl, won Austria’s parliamentary election in September. It took 28.8% of the vote and beating outgoing Chancellor Karl Nehammer’s conservative Austrian People’s Party into second place. But in October, President Alexander Van der Bellen gave Nehammer the first chance to form a new government after Nehammer’s party said it wouldn’t go into government with the Freedom Party under Kickl and others refused to work with the Freedom Party at all. Those efforts to form a governing alliance without the far right collapsed in the first few days of the new year and Nehammer said Saturday that he would resign. The People’s Party then signaled that it might be open to working under Kickl. Van der Bellen said after meeting Kickl for about an hour at the presidential palace Monday that he had tasked the Freedom Party leader with holding talks with the People’s Party to form a new government. 'I did not take this step lightly,' the president told reporters. 'I will continue to take care that the principles and rules of our constitution are correctly respected and adhered to.' The far right and the conservatives have governed together before, but on previous occasions with the Freedom Party as the junior partner. Most recently, they ran Austria from 2017 to 2019 in a government in which Kickl — a 56-year-old with a taste for provocation — served as interior minister. It collapsed in a scandal surrounding the Freedom Party’s leader at the time. Coalition talks between the far right and conservatives aren’t guaranteed to succeed, but there are no longer any other realistic options in the current parliament and polls suggest that a new election soon could strengthen the Freedom Party further. In its election program titled 'Fortress Austria,' the Freedom Party has called for the 'remigration of uninvited foreigners,' for achieving a more 'homogeneous' nation by tightly controlling borders and suspending the right to asylum via an emergency law. The Freedom Party also calls for an end to sanctions against Russia, is highly critical of Western military aid to Ukraine and wants to bow out of the European Sky Shield Initiative, a missile defense project launched by Germany. Kickl has criticized 'elites' in Brussels and called for some powers to be brought back from the European Union to Austria. The Freedom Party is part of a right-wing populist alliance in the European Parliament, Patriots for Europe, which also includes the parties of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and of the Netherlands’ Geert Wilders, whose party dominates the Netherlands’ new government, Van der Bellen noted that the new government won't face an easy task. 'The economic environment is difficult. Austria is in a persistent recession, unemployment is rising; at the same time our state budget must be restructured,' he said. 'It’s not likely that all the measures will be popular, but they will have to be implemented.' He also pointed to the geopolitical threats Austria faces, particularly as a result of Russia’s war in Ukraine, and pointed to the importance of 'constructively strengthening European cooperation in the Union, also in the interest of Austrian industry and exporters.' And the head of state, a liberal who originally hails from the environmentalist Greens, said that he and Kickl had discussed media freedom in Austria at length. Kickl is confident of finding 'viable solutions' in coalition talks, 'and he wants this responsibility,' the president said. Kickl strode past reporters without commenting as he left the meeting. ___ Moulson reported from Berlin.	https://apnews.com/article/austria-new-government-freedom-far-right-kickl-99beae619f784e24bc1ebf382d2b9e0c	2025-01-06T01:17:41-08:00	
Russia claims it captured another town in eastern Ukraine but Kyiv's troops say the fight continues	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russian troops in eastern Ukraine have captured the stronghold of Kurakhove after a monthslong battle, Russia’s Defense Ministry claimed Monday, adding the wrecked town to the Kremlin’s list of conquests during the almost three-year war. But the Ukrainian force defending Kurakhove dismissed the claim while acknowledging that Russian forces were attacking urban areas. 'Measures to identify and destroy enemy assault groups that are trying to infiltrate our battle formations are underway,' the local military command said on Telegram. Russia's claim came a day after its Defense Ministry said Ukrainian forces had pressed new attacks in Russia’s Kursk border region. Ukrainian officials usually comment on major battlefield defeats only days after Russia announces them. The inauguration in two weeks of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has brought a new element of uncertainty and triggered an apparent effort by both sides to establish battlefield gains before any possible peace talks. Trump hasn’t detailed his plans for accomplishing his goal of ending the fighting, but his presence in the White House is likely to significantly affect how the war plays out. Kurakhove is a stronghold for the Ukrainian army on the eastern front line in the partially occupied Donetsk region. It has an industrial zone, a thermal power plant and a reservoir and sits on a highway between eastern and southern Ukraine. In November, The Associated Press reported from the town that some 7,000-10,000 people likely remained there. Its prewar population was about twice that. The town has been under relentless attacks from artillery, multiple rocket launchers, powerful guided bombs and drones that have shattered buildings. Meanwhile, Michael Kofman of the Carnegie Endowment said in an assessment published on social platform X that there has been some cheering news for Ukraine. 'Ukraine is grinding down Russian forces. Russian gains are small relative to costs. There has been no collapse of the front,' Kofman wrote. On the other hand, he said, 'Ukraine is losing territory. The coldest part of the winter is yet ahead. The current theory of success is unclear, or what resources will be made available by the West in 2025.' Russia has been driving westward in a slow and costly effort to capture all of Donetsk. Ukraine is short of troops on the front lines and is straining to hold back the bigger Russian army. Russian forces are trying to close in on Pokrovsk, a key road junction and rail distribution center furnishing supplies to a broad span of the Ukrainian front line. In 2022, Moscow illegally annexed the Donetsk and neighboring Luhansk regions, which make up the Donbas industrial area, together with southeastern provinces of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. But Russian forces don’t fully control any of them. Ukraine is keen to get new Western military aid delivered quickly, and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Sunday he hoped more would be pledged this week at a meeting with Western partners in Germany. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Sunday that Ukraine launched a fresh offensive in the Kursk region, where military analysts estimate Kyiv recently lost 40% of what its forces captured in a lightning insurgency five months ago. Russian officials claimed their forces pushed back the Ukrainian offensive, but some reports from Russian military bloggers indicated that Moscow’s forces faced significant pressure. The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington think tank that monitors the conflict, said Ukrainian forces on Sunday resumed offensive operations in at least three areas of Kursk and made tactical advances. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-kurakhove-kursk-donetsk-1a43d984adf4543b582c61d487fa1cff	2025-01-06T00:31:01-08:00	
What to know about the siege outside South Korea's presidential compound	TOKYO (AP) — A standoff between rival government forces outside the presidential compound in South Korea has been a startling development, even for observers used to the country's famously rough and tumble politics. For weeks, impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol has remained in his compound and refused to respond to detention and search warrants. Scuffles broke out late last week as dozens of investigators were stopped from entering the compound by hundreds of presidential security guards and a barricade. The spectacle followed Yoon's astonishing decision last month to impose martial law during a seemingly routine impasse with the opposition, which dominates parliament. Here's a closer view of recent events as well as South Korea's tempestuous political history, which has seen presidents toppled, arrested, jailed and shamed as millions have taken to the streets in protest. What's the latest? A government agency dedicated to fighting corruption was debating with police more forceful measures to detain Yoon. Dozens of investigators from the agency and police failed last week to bring Yoon into custody following a standoff with his security service. Court warrants have been issued to detain Yoon and to search his residence. The warrants were set to expire on Monday but the anti-corruption agency requested a new warrant aiming to extend the window for Yoon's detention. Yoon has been refusing to appear for questioning over his short-lived martial law decree on Dec. 3. He has described his power grab as a necessary act of governance against a liberal opposition that has bogged down his agenda with its legislative majority. He has vowed to 'fight to the end' against efforts to oust him. Martial law lasted only a few hours, but the country’s politics, diplomacy and financial markets have been shaken for weeks. The decree also exposed South Korea’s deeply polarized society. Yoon’s lawyers on Monday filed complaints with public prosecutors against the anti-corruption agency’s chief prosecutor, Oh Dong-woon, and six other anti-corruption and police officers for orchestrating Friday’s detainment attempt, which they say was illegal. What led to the standoff, and what could come next? Yoon's declaration of martial law unleashed a string of political aftershocks. The anti-corruption agency, which is leading a joint investigation with police and the military, has been weighing charges of rebellion after Yoon declared martial law and dispatched troops to surround parliament. Lawmakers who managed to get past the blockade voted to lift martial law hours later. Yoon’s presidential powers were suspended after parliament voted to impeach him on Dec. 14, accusing him of rebellion. The Constitutional Court has begun deliberations on whether to formally remove Yoon from office or reinstate him. About 150 investigators tried to get Yoon on Friday in a tense standoff with the presidential security service that lasted more than five hours. After getting around a military unit guarding the residence’s grounds, the agency’s investigators and police were able to approach within 200 meters (220 yards) of Yoon’s residential building but were stopped by a barricade of around 10 vehicles and approximately 200 members of the presidential security forces and troops. In a statement, Park Jong-joon, chief of the presidential security service, hit back against criticism that his organization has become Yoon’s private army, saying it has a legal obligation to protect the incumbent president. Yoon’s lawyers said they plan to file complaints against about 150 anti-corruption and police investigators who were involved in Friday’s detention attempt. Why is this happening in South Korea? The why is incredibly tricky. But a mix of history and geography have something to do with it. The Koreas have been sandwiched between big powers for millennia, with China, Russia, Japan and the United States all playing parts of a great global game on the peninsula that extends from the east coast of Asia. South Korea is deeply split, with the divisions reaching into many parts of life, from culture to class to gender to politics. Much of the deep political divide can be traced to what happened at the end of World War II, when U.S. and Soviet forces met in the middle of the Korean Peninsula and agreed to divide the land into Washington and Moscow-backed spheres of influence. This solidified into independent rival Koreas in 1948 and then exploded into war and permanent division in 1950. After that, South Korea was run by a string of dictators until democracy came in the late 1980s. Some of the passion evident in South Korean politics can be seen in the turmoil faced by recent presidents, many of whom have been jailed for corruption after leaving office. A particularly sensational moment came in 2016 when millions protested against conservative President Park Geun-hye, who later became the first democratically elected leader to be forced from office since South Korea turned democratic. Park, who was pardoned in late 2021 by her liberal rival and successor, had been serving a lengthy prison term for bribery and other crimes. ___ Associated Press writer Kim Tong-hyung in Seoul, South Korea, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-politics-president-standoff-martial-law-ab3a91bc7d4ea769ad20ea27f86a4710	2025-01-05T23:45:34-08:00	
Gunmen targeting bus in the occupied West Bank kill 3 people	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Gunmen opened fire on a bus carrying Israelis in the occupied West Bank on Monday, killing three people and wounding eight others. Violence has surged in the territory since Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack out of Gaza ignited the ongoing war there. The shooting occurred in the Palestinian village of Al-Funduq, on one of the main east-west roads crossing the territory used by both Israelis and Palestinians. Israel’s military said two 70-year-old women and a 35-year-old policeman were killed. Widespread operations have been launched in the area looking for the attackers. Palestinians have carried out scores of shooting, stabbing and car-ramming attacks against Israelis, especially during the past 15 months of the Israel-Hamas war. Israel has launched near-nightly military raids across the territory that frequently trigger gunbattle with militants. There has also been a sharp rise in attacks on Palestinians by Israeli settlers, leading the United States to impose sanctions. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to 'reach the despicable murderers' behind Monday’s attack and 'settle accounts with them and with everyone who assisted them. No one will be spared.' Hamas praised the attack in a statement, but did not claim responsibility for it. War in Gaza continues amid rumors of ceasefire While there has reportedly been recent progress in long-running talks aimed at a ceasefire and hostage release, the war in Gaza rages on with no end in sight. Separately on Monday, Ahmed al-Farra, director of the children’s ward at Nasser hospital in the southern Gaza City of Khan Younis said a 35-day-old infant froze to death inside his family’s tent in the humanitarian area designated by the Israeli military on Friday. Gaza Health Ministry official Zaher Al-Wahidi said babies and most children can’t tolerate weather conditions when temperatures dip low as 3 degrees Celsius. Aid groups say Israeli restrictions, ongoing fighting and a breakdown of law and order in many areas make it difficult to provide desperately needed food and other assistance, and there is a shortage of blankets and warm clothing. There is little wood for fire and the tents and patched-together tarps families are living in have grown increasingly threadbare after months of heavy use. Ongoing violence in the West Bank The Palestinian Health Ministry says at least 838 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire in the West Bank since the start of the war in Gaza. Most appear to have been militants killed in battles with Israeli troops, but the dead also include participants in violent protests and civilian bystanders. At least 46 Israelis, including 19 soldiers, have been killed in violent attacks by Palestinian militants, according to the U.N. Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war, and the Palestinians want all three territories for their future state. Some 3 million Palestinians live in the West Bank under Israeli military rule, with the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority administering population centers. Over 500,000 settlers with Israeli citizenship live in well over 100 settlements across the territory, ranging from small hilltop outposts to sprawling communities that resemble suburbs or small towns. Most of the international community considers the settlements illegal. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed across the border in a massive surprise attack nearly 15 months ago, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s air and ground offensive has killed over 45,800 Palestinians in Gaza, according to local health authorities, who say women and children make up more than half of those killed. They do not say how many of the dead were militants. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence. ___ Associated Press writer Melanie Lidman in Jerusalem and Fatma Khaled in Cairo contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-lebanon-hezbollah-iran-news-01-06-2024-0258e5a061f150c36f0e8d416f01810c	2025-01-05T23:01:25-08:00	
What to know about Venezuela's upcoming presidential inauguration	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — The next presidential term in Venezuela is set to begin Friday, when the ruling party-controlled congress hosts a swearing-in ceremony for President Nicolás Maduro, despite serious doubts about the validity of last year’s official election results. Maduro is expected to begin a third six-year term amid demonstrations by his supporters, but it is unclear if anyone among the millions who voted for his main challenger, Edmundo González, will also protest. González, who claimed to have won the July 28 election, left Venezuela for exile in Spain in September after a judge issued a warrant for his arrest. Taking the oath of office will allow Maduro to cement a mishmash of policies that allowed the government to end the scarcities and runaway inflation that dominated most of his 11 years in office. Those measures, however, no longer fulfill his and his predecessor’s self-proclaimed socialist promises and continue to strip Venezuela of its democracy. González has said he intends to be in Caracas on Friday, but he has not explained how he intends to do so or what his plans are upon arrival. Here’s what to know about Venezuela’s next presidential term: Why are there doubts about who should be sworn in as president? The doubts stem from the government’s lack of transparency in handling and announcing the results of the presidential election. Venezuela’s National Electoral Council, stacked with ruling-party loyalists, declared Maduro the winner hours after polls closed. However, unlike previous presidential elections, electoral authorities did not provide detailed vote counts, alleging that a website hack prevented them from doing so. Yet, the opposition collected tally sheets from 80% of the nation’s electronic voting machines, posted them online and said the detailed vote records showed González won the election with twice as many votes as Maduro. Global condemnation over the lack of transparency prompted Maduro to ask the country’s high court, also filled with allies of the ruling United Socialist Party of Venezuela, to audit the election results. The court, without showing thorough evidence, subsequently reaffirmed Maduro’s victory and encouraged the electoral council to release the vote counts. But electoral authorities never did and neither did the ruling party, whose voting center representatives — just like the opposition’s — were entitled to tally sheets from every voting machine. The U.S.-based Carter Center, which Maduro’s government invited to observe the presidential election, has said the tally sheets published by the opposition are legitimate. Will people demonstrate in favor or against Maduro? The government frequently schedules demonstrations, particularly when it wants to show strength in numbers, such as on Friday. Maduro has called on Venezuelans to head to the streets that day, but not everyone marching with a pro-ruling-party shirt supports him. The government often coerces public employees and state-benefits recipients into participating in demonstrations. Whether people will protest against Maduro on Friday remains to be seen since the government’s post-election repression campaign, including the arrests of more than 2,000 people, has had a chilling effect. And even if opposition supporters decide to demonstrate, it is unclear who would lead them. On Sunday, opposition stalwart Maria Corina Machado urged supporters to demonstrate on Thursday across the country to push Maduro out of office. 'Maduro is not going to leave on his own, we must make him leave with the strength of a population that never gives up,' Machado said in a social media video. 'Go outside, shout, fight. It is time to stand firm, and make them understand that this is as far as they go. That this is over.' Machado, who has been hiding for months at an undisclosed location to avoid arrest, told supporters she 'will be with' them Thursday. Meanwhile, González remains away from Venezuela and opposition leaders who often accompanied him and Machado to campaign rallies were jailed after the election. Who will attend the swearing-in ceremony? Members of the National Assembly, ministers and Maduro’s close allies within Venezuela are expected to attend. The government’s centralized public information office did not immediately respond to a request from The Associated Press for a list of the heads of state who have confirmed their attendance. But the list could be in the single digits since the country’s post-election crisis has further isolated Maduro. Maduro has faced criticism for the election’s lack of transparency from dozens of countries, including neighboring Colombia and Brazil, whose leaders had been friendly toward him in practically all other matters. They even attempted to broker a peacemaking deal between his government and the opposition after the July vote. Neither country’s president will attend Friday’s ceremony and will instead send representatives. Maduro’s last inauguration, in 2019, was attended by Cuba’s President Miguel Diaz-Canel and then-Bolivian President Evo Morales. What is expected of Maduro’s next term? The food shortages and four-digit inflation that characterized most of Maduro’s 11-year presidency are gone, but the country’s protracted crisis has no end in sight. These days, the average Venezuelan must cope with a monthly minimum wage of less than $2, soaring food prices, irregular fuel supply and a substandard public education system. But at the same time, a lucky few with ties to Maduro and his allies benefit from jobs and contracts that allow them to afford imported toilet paper that costs $70, import and sell vehicles, open made-for-Instagram restaurants, and offer luxury tourism experiences. That inequality is precisely the kind that was supposed to disappear under the policies that Maduro’s mentor and predecessor, the late President Hugo Chávez, described as socialism for the 21st century. It is expected to widen as the government continues to wrestle with an oil-dependent economy crippled by limited crude production, corruption, mismanagement, economic sanctions, firmly restricted credit access and a lack of private investment. Ahead of the election, voters across the country repeatedly said they or their loved ones would emigrate if Maduro remained in power. Under his watch, more than 7.7 million Venezuelans have already left their homeland in search of better living conditions.	https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-presidential-inauguration-maduro-opposition-edmundo-d0ba3aa9b66bcae0b34f8d4a45e7134e	2025-01-05T21:06:32-08:00	
France's former President Sarkozy standing trial over alleged campaign funding by Libya's Gadhafi	PARIS (AP) — France’s former President Nicolas Sarkozy goes on trial Monday over alleged illegal financing of his 2007 presidential campaign by the government of late Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. The so-called 'Libyan case,' the biggest and possibly most shocking of several scandals involving Sarkozy, is scheduled to run until April 10, with a verdict expected at a later date. Sarkozy, 69, faces charges of passive corruption, illegal campaign financing, concealment of embezzlement of public funds and criminal association, punished by up to 10 years in prison. Sarkozy, who served as president from 2007 to 2012, has denied any wrongdoing. The trial involves 11 other defendants, including three former ministers. Franco-Lebanese businessman Ziad Takieddine, accused of having played the role of intermediary, has fled in Lebanon and is not expected to appear at the Paris court. Sarkozy is looking forward to the hearings 'with determination,' his lawyer Christophe Ingrain said in a statement. 'There is no Libyan financing of the campaign,' the statement said. 'We want to believe the court will have the courage to examine the facts objectively, without being guided by the nebulous theory that poisoned the investigation.' Gadhafi's alleged agreement The case emerged in March 2011, when a Libyan news agency reported that the Gadhafi government had financed Sarkozy’s 2007 campaign. In an interview, Gadhafi himself said 'it’s thanks to us that he reached the presidency. We provided him with the funds that allowed him to win,' without providing any amount or other details. Sarkozy, who had welcomed Gadhafi to Paris with great honors in 2007, became one of the first Western leaders to push for a military intervention in Libya in March 2011, when Arab Spring pro-democracy protests swept the Arab world. Gadhafi was killed by opposition fighters in October that same year, ending his four-decade rule of the North African country. The next year, French online news site Mediapart published a document said to be a note from the Libyan secret services, mentioning Gadhafi’s agreement to provide Sarkozy’s campaign 50 million euros in financing. Sarkozy strongly rejected the accusations, calling the document a 'blatant fake' and filing complaints for forgery, concealment and spreading false news. However, French investigative magistrates eventually said in 2016 the document has all the characteristics of an authentic one, although there is no definitive evidence that such a transaction took place. The official cost for Sarkozy’s 2007 campaign was 20 million euros. Accusations of witness tampering French investigators scrutinized numerous trips to Libya made by people close to Sarkozy, then the interior minister, between 2005 and 2007, including his chief of staff Claude Guéant. They also noted dozens of meetings between Guéant and Takieddine, a key player in major French military contracts abroad. The investigation gained traction when Takieddine told news site Mediapart in 2016 that he had delivered three suitcases from Libya containing millions in cash to the French Interior Ministry. However, Takieddinne reversed his statement four years later. Since then, a separate investigation has been launched into alleged witness tampering as magistrates suspect an attempt to pressure Takieddine in order to clear Sarkozy. Sarkozy and his wife, former supermodel Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, were given preliminary charges as financial prosecutors said the former president is suspected of 'benefitting from corruptly influencing' Takieddine. 11 other defendants The other accused are three former French ministers, including Guéant, and a former adviser close to Sarkozy. Like Takieddine, Franco-Algerian businessman Alexandre Djouhri is accused of having been an intermediary. The case also involves Gadhafi’s former chief of staff and treasurer Bashir Saleh, who sought refuge in France during the Libyan civil war then moved to South Africa, where he survived a shooting in 2018, before settling in the United Arab Emirates. Other defendants include two Saudi billionaires, a former Airbus executive and a former banker accused of having played a role in the alleged money transfers. Shukri Ghanem, Gadhafi’s former oil minister who was also suspected, was found dead in the Danube River in Vienna in 2012 in unclear circumstances. French investigators were able to find Ghanem’s notebook, which is believed to document payments made by Libya. Gadhafi's spy chief and brother-in-law Abdullah al-Senoussi told investigative judges millions have indeed been provided to support Sarkozy’s campaign. Accused of war crimes, he is now imprisoned in Libya. Sarkozy convicted in 2 other cases Sarkozy has been convicted in two other scandals — yet the Libyan case appears as the one most likely to significantly affect his legacy. France’s highest court, the Court of Cassation, last month upheld a conviction against Sarkozy of corruption and influence peddling while he was the head of state. He was sentenced to one year in house arrest with an electronic bracelet. The case was revealed as investigative judges were listening to wiretapped phone conversations during the Libya inquiry. In February last year, an appeals court in Paris found Sarkozy guilty of illegal campaign financing in his failed 2012 reelection bid.	https://apnews.com/article/sarkozy-france-libya-corruption-trial-gadhafi-27323cfc8eeced5deca0b0a3acf5776c	2025-01-05T20:54:04-08:00	
They fled from extremists. Now the government in Burkina Faso tries to hide their existence	OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) — Their loved ones were slaughtered by Islamist extremists or government-affiliated fighters. Their villages were attacked, their homes destroyed. Exhausted and traumatized, they fled in search of safety, food and shelter. This is the reality for over 2.5 million displaced people across the West African nation of Burkina Faso, torn apart by years of extreme violence. But unlike others displaced in the region, they are seen as a challenge to Burkina Faso's military junta that took power two years ago on the pledge of bringing stability. Their existence contradicts its official narrative: that security is improving and people are safely returning home. Those who fled to Ouagadougou, the capital, which has been shielded from violence, find fear instead of respite. They are made into shadows, with many resorting to begging. Most of them are not entitled to support from authorities, and international aid organizations are not authorized to work with them. The Associated Press reached out to several international aid groups, Western diplomats and the United Nations. None would speak on the record about the issue. With no official displacement sites in Ouagadougou, no one knows how many people shelter in the capital or sleep on the streets. A rare acknowledgement of their existence by authorities noted 30,000 last year. But aid groups say real numbers are much higher. And as violence increases, and people crowd displacement sites in the country's remote north and east, exposed to hunger and disease, more are expected to arrive in the capital. One aid worker, speaking like others on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, described the situation as 'a ticking bomb.' 'This is not a life' The AP interviewed four displaced people in Ouagadougou. All spoke at great risk. Three are with the Fulani ethnic group, which authorities accuse of being affiliated with Islamist insurgents. All three said they have faced discrimination in the capital, with trouble finding jobs and sending children to school. For decades, the Fulani were neglected by the central government, and some did join Islamist fighters. As a result, Fulani civilians are often targeted both by the extremists — affiliated with al-Qaida or the Islamic State group — and by rival pro-government forces. A 27-year-old Fulani cattle trader from Djibo, a city besieged by armed groups since 2022, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of repercussions from authorities, said government-affiliated forces indiscriminately treated all Fulani in the area as extremists. 'They started arresting people, bringing them to the city, beating them, undressing them. It was humiliating,' he said. His uncle spent seven months in prison because he received aid from a charity run by extremists in part to spread their ideology. He said he was arrested once in Djibo and beaten by the military, with injuries so extensive that he went to the hospital. He said soldiers told him only that they were 'conducting a security operation.' According to analysts, the junta's strategy of military escalation, including mass recruitment of civilians for poorly trained militia units, has exacerbated tensions between ethnic groups. Data gathered by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project show that militia attacks on civilians significantly increased since Capt. Ibrahim Traore took power. The violence has radicalized some Fulanis, the cattle trader said. 'Every day, you prayed to live through the next 24 hours,' he said. 'This is not a life.' He did not want to flee and leave his parents behind. But one day, his father woke him and said: 'You have to leave, because if you stay, someone will just come and kill you.' His father was later killed. He left in a military convoy over a year ago. Life in Ouagadougou is 'very difficult,' he said. He lives with extended family and relies on odd jobs to get by. 'There are mornings when I wake up and ask myself how will I get something to eat,' he said. 'I used to live with dignity.' His mother has joined him in the capital. They have not received support from the government. Always on the run A 28-year-old mother from the northwest, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said at first the extremists came to her village and stole cattle. But last summer, they came to the market and killed several men, including her husband. Then they ordered women and children to leave. She grabbed her children, and cooking pots, and fled. She walked for hours through the night until she reached her husband’s family home. Ten days later, armed men were approaching. She strapped her 2-year-old daughter to her back, grabbed her 4-year-old son and left for the capital. She said she has not received government support in Ouagadougou. She was promised a job as a cleaner but lost the offer once the employer found out she was Fulani. She secured a place at a rare shelter for displaced women, run with Western-supplied funds by a local activist who tries to keep a low profile. She is learning how to sew and has enrolled her son in school. 'I miss my village,' she said. 'But for the moment I have to wait until the violence is over.' Her stay is precarious. The shelter is full, hosting 50 women and children. Usually, they are allowed to stay for one year. Time is running out. The demand is enormous, the activist said, and there is less and less aid. Local authorities are wary of anyone working with displaced people. 'I don’t know for how much longer I can keep on going,' she said. A veneer of normalcy As much as 80% of Burkina Faso's territory is controlled by extremist groups and more civilians died from violence last year than in the years before, but in Ouagadougou, it is easy to forget that the government is battling an insurgency. Busy open-air restaurants serve beer and the national dish of slowly roasted chicken. In recent months, the capital hosted a theater festival and an international arts and crafts fair. The authorities reinstated a cross-country cycling race, Tour de Faso, previously cancelled due to insecurity. The military leadership has installed a system of de facto censorship, rights groups said, and those daring to speak up can be openly abducted, imprisoned or forcefully drafted into the army. Burkina Faso used to be known for its vibrant intellectual life. Now, even friends are afraid to discuss politics. 'I feel like I am in prison,' said a local women’s rights activist. 'Everyone distrusts each other. We fought for the freedom of speech, and now we lost everything.' Burkina Faso's authorities did not respond to questions. ___ The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

Stock market today: Asian stocks are mixed after Wall St snaps out of its holiday-season funk	HONG KONG (AP) — Asian stocks are mixed after Wall Street snapped out of a spell of holiday season blues, with markets in Tokyo and China declining. Japan’s finance minister rang in the New Year as Tokyo’s market resumed trading after the long traditional holiday, as staff in suits and kimonos clapped for good fortune in 2025. 'The Japanese government will act to secure economic growth led by wage increases and investment,' the finance minister, Katsunobu Kato said, vowing to 'grasp signs of recovery' and to ensure that 'every single citizen can feel the improvement in their salaries.' The prevailing sentiment in much of Asia has been caution over potential changes by President-elect Donald Trump, who has vowed to sharply raise tariffs on imports from China and other countries, potentially denting growth for a region heavily reliant on trade. Nippon Steel was expected to sue after U.S. President Joe Biden rejected its nearly $15 billion bid to acquire Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel Corp. Nippon Steel’s shares fell 0.7% in Tokyo on Monday. U.S. Steel’s shares sank 6.5% on Friday. Tokyo’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index lost 1.6% to 39,258.25, while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong declined 0.5% to 19,654.82. The Shanghai Composite index slipped 0.5% to 3,194.20. Markets shrugged off a report that China’s services economy grew at its fastest pace in seven months in December, while export businesses declined, according to a private sector survey. The index rose to 52.2 in December, surpassing the 50 level that separates expansion from contraction. Elsewhere in Asia, the mood was lighter. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 gained 0.1% to 8,257.40 and Taiwan's Taiex jumped 2.8%. In South Korea, the Kospi jumped 1.8% to 2,485.31, driven by a 9% increase in computer chip maker SK Hynix Inc. and a 2.9% jump in shares in Samsung Electronics, the country's biggest company. South Korea’s anti-corruption agency asked the police to take over efforts to detain impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol after its investigators failed to take him into custody following a standoff with the presidential security service last week. On Friday, the S&amp;P 500 rallied 1.3% to 5,942.47, reaching its first gain since Christmas and its best day in nearly two months. Strength for Big Tech stocks helped it break a five-day losing streak, its longest since April, and trim its loss for the week to 0.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8% to 42,732.13, and the Nasdaq composite leaped 1.8% to 19,621.68. U.S. stock indexes have vaulted to records after the U.S. economy kept growing despite high interest rates that have helped push inflation nearly all the way down to the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. But even though the economy and job market still look solid, the path ahead is not assured. Part of the reason the S&amp;P 500 set more than 50 all-time highs last year was because of the expectation that the Fed would keep cutting interest rates through 2025, after it began easing them in September. Traders are now ratcheting back their expectations for coming cuts to rates. Inflation is proving to be stubborn as the Fed tries to wring out the last percentage point of improvement to get inflation down to 2%. Worries are also rising that tariffs and other policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump could put upward pressure on inflation. All the while, critics say U.S. stock prices simply look too expensive after rising so much faster than corporate profits. In other dealings, U.S. benchmark crude oil lost 29 cents to $73.67 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, dropped 33 cents to $76.18 per barrel. The U.S. dollar rose to 157.73 Japanese yen from 157.22 yen.

Indonesia launches free meals program to feed children and pregnant women to fight malnutrition	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — Indonesia's new government started an ambitious project on Monday to fight malnutrition by feeding nearly 90 million children and pregnant women that is expected to cost $28 billion through 2029, although critics question whether the program is affordable. The Free Nutritious Meal program delivers on a campaign promise by President Prabowo Subianto, who was elected last year to lead the nation, which has more than 282 million people and Southeast Asia's largest economy. He said the program aims to fight the stunting of growth that afflicts 21.5% of Indonesian children younger than 5 and would raise the income of farmers. Subianto has pledged to accelerate GDP growth to 8% from 5% now. In his inauguration speech in October, Subianto said many children are malnourished. His promise to provide free school lunches and milk to 83 million students at more than 400,000 schools is part of a longer-term strategy to develop the nation’s human resources to achieve a 'Golden Indonesia' generation by 2045. 'Too many of our brothers and sisters are below the poverty line, too many of our children go to school without breakfast and do not have clothes for school,' Subianto said. Subianto’s signature program could cost upward of 450 trillion rupiah ($28 billion) by the end of his term in 2029. He said his team has made the calculations to run such a program, and 'We are capable.' The government's target is to reach an initial 19.5 million schoolchildren and pregnant women in 2025 with a budget of 71 trillion rupiah ($4.3 billion) so as to keep the annual deficit under a legislated ceiling of 3% of GDP, said Dadan Hindayana, the head of the newly formed National Nutrition Agency. Hindayana said the money would buy an estimated 6.7 million tons of rice, 1.2 million tons of chicken, 500,000 tons of beef, 1 million tons of fish, vegetable and fruit, and 4 million kiloliters of milk. Nearly 2,000 cooperatives will be involved in the free meals program by providing eggs, vegetables, rice, fish, meat, milk and other food, Cooperative Minister Budi Arie Setiadi said. On Monday, a truck carrying food arrived at SD Cilangkap 08, a primary school in the Jakarta satellite city of Depok. The 740 students were provided rice, stir-fried vegetables, tempeh, stir-fried chicken and oranges. 'We will send a team to each school to facilitate the meal distribution to students every day,' Hindayana said, adding that the program will provide one meal per day for each student from early childhood education to senior high school, covering a third of the daily caloric needs for children, with the government providing the meals at no cost to recipients. But the program has drawn criticism from investors and analysts over the scale of its logistics, the burden on state finances and the economy, and its relation to the interests of industrial lobby groups. Nailul Huda, a researcher at the Center of Economic and Law Studies, said Indonesia’s state finances are not strong enough to support the program and this will lead to additional national debt. 'The burden on our state budget is too heavy if it is forced to reach 100% of the target recipients, and it will be difficult for Prabowo’s government to achieve the economic growth target of 8%,' Huda said. He warned it could also worsen the external balance of payments for the country, which is already a major importer of rice, wheat, soybeans, beef and dairy products. Reni Suwarso, the director of Institute for Democracy, Security and Strategic Studies, said the decline in the stunting rate in Indonesia was far from the target of a 14% reduction in 2024. According to the 2023 Indonesian Health Survey, the national stunting prevalence was 21.5%, down around 0.8% from the previous year. The United Nations Children’s Fund estimated that one in 12 Indonesian children younger than 5 suffers from low weight while one in five is shorter than normal. Both conditions are caused by malnourishment. 'That’s so bad and must be solved,' Suwarso said. 'Child malnourishment has severe consequences, threatening the health and long-term development of infants and young children throughout this nation.' ___ This story corrects that the expected cost of the program is $28 billion instead of $28 million and explains that it is through 2029. ___ Associated Press journalists Edna Tarigan and Andi Jatmiko contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/indonesia-prabowo-subianto-free-meals-children-mothers-213a04587203434f3f85950725e84a8b	2025-01-05T19:12:12-08:00	
South Korea's military says North Korea fired missile into eastern sea	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea on Monday fired a ballistic missile that flew 1,100 kilometers (685 miles) before landing in waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan, South Korea’s military said, extending its heightened weapons testing activities into 2025 weeks before Donald Trump returns as U.S. president. The South’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said the midrange missile was fired from an area near the North Korean capital of Pyongyang and that the launch preparations were detected in advance by the U.S. and South Korean militaries. It denounced the launch as a provocation that poses a serious threat to peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula. The joint chiefs said the military was strengthening its surveillance and defense posture in preparation for possible additional launches and sharing information on the missile with the United States and Japan. Japan's Defense Ministry said the missile landed outside its exclusive economic zone and that there were no reports of damage to vessels or aircraft. The launch came as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was visiting Seoul for talks with South Korean allies over the North Korean nuclear threat and other issues. Blinken’s visit comes amid political turmoil in South Korea following President Yoon Suk Yeol’s short-lived martial law decree and subsequent impeachment by parliament last month, which experts say puts the country at a disadvantage in getting a steady footing with Trump ahead of his return to the White House. In a news conference with South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul, Blinken said they condemn North Korea’s latest launch, which violates U.N. Security Council resolutions against the North, and reiterated concerns about the growing alignment between Pyongyang and Moscow over Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine. According to U.S., Ukrainian and South Korean assessments, North Korea has sent more than 10,000 troops and conventional weapons systems to support Moscow’s war against Ukraine. There are concerns that Russia could transfer North Korea advanced weapons technology in return, which could potentially enhance the threat posed by leader Kim Jong Un’s nuclear-armed military. Blinken described the military cooperation between Russia and North Korea as a 'two-way street,' saying Russia has been providing military equipment and training to the North and 'intends to share space and satellite technology.' Blinken and Cho both dismissed concerns about damage to the U.S.-South Korea alliance in the aftermath of the political turmoil in Seoul. Experts had warned that Yoon’s martial law decree — which lasted only hours but has rattled politics, high-level diplomacy and financial markets for weeks — exposed the fragility of South Korea’s democratic system in a divided society. 'We had serious concerns about some of the actions that President Yoon took and we communicated those directly to the government,' Blinken said. 'At the same time we have tremendous confidence in the resilience of South Korea’s democracy, in the strength of its institutions and in the efforts that it’s making to work through those institutions, pursuant to the constitution and the rule of law to resolve differences and to do so peacefully.' In a year-end political conference, Kim, the North Korean leader, vowed to implement the 'toughest' anti-U.S. policy and criticized the Biden administration’s efforts to strengthen security cooperation with Seoul and Tokyo, which he described as a 'nuclear military bloc for aggression.' North Korean state media did not specify Kim’s policy plans or mention any specific comments about Trump. During his first term, Trump met Kim three times for talks on the North’s nuclear program. Many experts, however, say a quick resumption of Kim-Trump summitry is unlikely as Trump would first focus on conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. North Korea’s support for Russia’s war against Ukraine also poses a challenge to efforts to revive diplomacy, experts say. Before his presidency faltered over the ill-conceived power grab on Dec. 3, Yoon worked closely with U.S. President Joe Biden to expand joint military exercises, update nuclear deterrence strategies and strengthen trilateral security cooperation with Tokyo. South Korea's opposition-controlled National Assembly voted to lift the martial law hours after he announced it on TV and impeached him on Dec. 14. With his presidential powers suspended, Yoon's fate lies with the Constitutional Court, which has begun deliberations on whether to dismiss or reinstate him. __ AP writer Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-ballistic-missile-kim-jong-un-tensions-3750925b34e1700e231b762ffef67183	2025-01-05T18:15:15-08:00

South Korean anti-corruption agency asks police to take over efforts to detain impeached Yoon	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s anti-corruption agency has requested that police take over efforts to detain impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol after its investigators failed to bring him to custody following a standoff with the presidential security service last week. The agency and police confirmed the discussion on Monday, hours before the one-week warrant for Yoon’s detention was to expire. The Seoul Western District Court last Tuesday issued a warrant to detain Yoon and a separate warrant to search his residence after the embattled president defied authorities by refusing to appear for questioning over his short-lived martial law decree on Dec. 3. But executing those warrants is complicated as long as Yoon remains in his official residence. Yoon has described his power grab as a necessary act of governance against a liberal opposition bogging down his agenda with its legislative majority and has vowed to 'fight to the end' against efforts to oust him. While martial law lasted only several hours, it set off turmoil that has shaken the country’s politics, diplomacy and financial markets for weeks and exposed the fragility of South Korea’s democracy while society is deeply polarized. The Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials will likely seek a new court warrant to extend the window for Yoon’s detention, according to police, which said it was internally reviewing the agency’s request. It wasn’t immediately clear whether the anti-corruption agency will make another attempt to detain Yoon on Monday before the deadline expires at midnight. The anti-corruption agency has faced questions about its competence after failing to detain Yoon on Friday, and police have the resources to possibly make a more forceful attempt to detain him. Yoon’s legal team claimed in a statement that the agency’s move to delegate execution of the detainment warrant to police is illegal, saying there’s no legal grounds for it to delegate certain parts of an investigation process to another agency. Yoon’s lawyers had submitted an objection to the warrants against the president on Thursday, but the Seoul Western District Court dismissed the challenge on Sunday. Yoon’s lawyers also on Monday filed complaints with public prosecutors against the anti-corruption agency’s chief prosecutor, Oh Dong-woon, and six other anti-corruption and police officers for orchestrating Friday’s detainment attempt, which they claim was illegal. The lawyers also filed complaints against the country’s acting national police chief, the acting defense minister and two Seoul police officials for ignoring the presidential security service’s request to provide additional forces to block the detention attempt. The lawyers said they also plan to file complaints against some 150 anti-corruption and police investigators who were involved in Friday’s detention attempt. The anti-corruption agency, which leads a joint investigation with police and military investigators, has been weighing charges of rebellion after Yoon declared martial law and dispatched troops to surround the National Assembly. Lawmakers who managed to get past the blockade voted to lift martial law hours later. Yoon’s presidential powers were suspended after the opposition-dominated National Assembly voted to impeach him on Dec. 14, accusing him of rebellion, and his fate now lies with the Constitutional Court, which has begun deliberations on whether to formally remove Yoon from office or reinstate him. Dozens of anti-corruption agency investigators and assisting police officers attempted to detain Yoon on Friday but retreated from his residence in Seoul after a tense standoff with the presidential security service that lasted more than five hours. After getting around a military unit guarding the residence’s grounds, the agency’s investigators and police were able to approach within 200 meters (about 218 yards) of Yoon’s residential building but were stopped by a barricade comprising around 10 vehicles and approximately 200 members of the presidential security forces and troops. The agency said it wasn’t able to visually confirm whether Yoon was inside the residence. The agency has urged the country’s acting leader, Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok, to instruct the presidential security service to comply with their execution of the detainment warrant. Choi has yet to publicly comment on the issue. In a video message on Sunday, Park Jong-joon, chief of the presidential security service, hit back against criticism that his organization has become Yoon’s private army, saying it has legal obligations to protect the incumbent president. Park said he instructed his members to not use violence during Friday’s standoff and called for the anti-corruption agency and police to change their approach. Park and his deputy defied summonses on Saturday from police, who planned to question them over the suspected obstruction of official duty following Friday’s events. Staff from the presidential security service were seen installing barbed wire near the gate and along the hills leading up to Yoon’s residence over the weekend, possibly in preparation for another detention attempt. Yoon’s lawyers argued the detention and search warrants against the president cannot be enforced at his residence due to a law that protects locations potentially linked to military secrets from search without the consent of the person in charge — which would be Yoon. They also argue the anti-corruption office lacks the legal authority to investigate rebellion charges. Hundreds of South Koreans rallied near Yoon’s residence for hours into early Monday, wrapping themselves in silver-coated mats against the freezing temperatures. It was their second consecutive night of protests, with demonstrators calling for his ouster and arrest.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korean-yoon-martial-law-impeachment-detention-police-7ad158876f7821995b6b365d5566b410	2025-01-05T15:08:46-08:00

Congo executes 102 'urban bandits' with 70 more set to be killed, officials say	KINSHASA, Congo (AP) — Some 102 men were executed by the Congolese government in the past week, and 70 more are set to be executed, the country's minister of justice said Sunday in a statement to the Associated Press. It said the men, aged 18 to 35, were armed robbers and 'urban bandits,' locally known as Kulunas, who were executed in northwest Congo at Angenga prison. Forty-five were killed in late December, and the remaining 57 were executed within the last 48 hours. A flight of 70 more people from Kinshasa has arrived at Angenga, but the government hasn't commented on the status of the prisoners. Minister of Justice Mutamba, who is overseeing the executions, said late Sunday the 'third batch will be executed, so the first two have already undergone the measure of execution by the death penalty.' The government’s decision to apply the death penalty has proved divisive. Some have welcomed the measure as a means of restoring order and security in the cities, while others are concerned about the risks of abuse and human rights violations. 'We welcome this decision by the minister because it will help put an end to urban crime. From 8 p.m. onwards, you can’t move around freely because you’re afraid of running into a Kuluna,' said Fiston Kakule, a resident of the eastern city of Goma. Espoir Muhinuka, a human rights activist, warned of the possibility of extrajudicial executions and called for a strict respect for judicial procedures and fundamental guarantees. He fears that political pressure could lead to unjust convictions and arbitrary executions. 'The situation in the DRC is complex and requires a multidimensional approach. The fight against urban gangs must go hand in hand with efforts to combat poverty, unemployment and social exclusion, which are often contributing factors to crime,' he said. The death penalty in Congo is a sensitive issue. The country abolished it in 1981, but it was reinstated in 2006. The last execution took place in 2003 but in March 2024, the Congolese government announced the resumption of capital executions, however, the reinstated death penalty was intended to apply to military personnel accused of treason. In May, eight soldiers were sentenced to death for fleeing the battlefield, and in July, 25 soldiers were convicted of similar offences. None of them is known to have been executed.	https://apnews.com/article/congo-executes-kulunas-bandits-dc460aa0fc69489f2c1005b33796e0c9	2025-01-05T11:52:17-08:00	
Thousands protest in Montenegro to demand ouster of top security officials over mass shooting	PODGORICA, Montenegro (AP) — Several thousand people rallied in Montenegro on Sunday demanding the resignations of top security officials over the shooting earlier this week that left 12 people dead, including two children. Chanting 'Resignations' and 'Killers,' protesters outside the Interior Ministry building in the capital, Podgorica, demanded that Interior Minister Danilo Šaranović and Deputy Prime Minister for Security and Defense Aleksa Bečić step down. Milo Perović, from a student-led group that helped organize the rally, told the crowd that innocent people died during their watch. 'You failed to protect us, so resign!' Perović said. Hours earlier, hundreds of people held 12 minutes of silence for the 12 victims at a rally in Cetinje, Montenegro's historic capital where the shooting took place on Wednesday. It was the second such massacre in the town in less than three years. Many residents of Cetinje and other Montenegrins believe that police mishandled the situation and haven't done enough to boost security since the first massacre, which happened in August 2022. Wednesday's shooting resulted from a bar brawl. A 45-year-old local man went home to get his gun before returning to the bar and opening fire. He killed four people there and eight more at various other locations before killing himself. The massacre fueled concerns about the level of violence in Montenegrin society, which is politically divided. It also raised questions about the readiness of state institutions to tackle the problems, including gun ownership. Police have said the shooting was impossible to predict and prevent, though the gunman, identified as Aco Martinović, had been convicted for violent behavior and illegal weapons possession. His victims were mostly friends and family. Montenegrin authorities swiftly announced a new, strict gun law and other tough measures to curb illegal weapons, which are abundant in the Balkan nation of around 620,000 people. On Sunday, police said they raided several locations in the country and confiscated about 20 weapons, more than 500 rounds of ammunition and explosives. Protesters in Cetinje and Podgorica also demanded a 'demilitarization' of the population through the destruction of illegal weapons, high taxes on gun ownership and a moratorium on new licenses while existing ones are reconsidered under strict criteria. The attacker in 2022 in Cetinje gunned down 10 people, including two children, before he was shot and killed by a passerby. Maja Gardašević, a protest organizer, said during the rally in Cetinje that 'we came here looking for answers' to several questions. 'Why did a massacre happen in Cetinje for the second time?' Gardašević asked. ' Why is no one responsible? Why is it so hard to resign?' ___ Jovana Gec contributed to this report from Belgrade, Serbia.	https://apnews.com/article/montenegro-protests-shooting-resignations-security-officials-3650b3ef647241ffd8c49f394923fdaa	2025-01-05T11:05:25-08:00	
Venezuela doubles down on intention to arrest opposition leader who claims he defeated Maduro	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Venezuela's government Sunday doubled down on its intention to arrest the opposition leader who claims he defeated President Nicolás Maduro in last year's election in the form of a threat from the ruling party-controlled congress. Without mentioning Edmundo González's name, National Assembly leader Jorge Rodriguez said the unicameral body would order the immediate arrest of the retired diplomat should he step on Venezuelan soil. The threat follows the government's recent announcement of a $100,000 reward for information on González’s whereabouts and comes less than a week before Venezuela's next presidential term is set to begin. González left Venezuela for exile in Spain in September after a judge issued a warrant for his arrest in connection with an election-related investigation. In recent weeks, he has vowed to travel to Venezuela to be sworn in for the presidential term which, by law, must begin Jan. 10, but he has not explained how he plans to return or wrest power from Maduro, whose party controls all institutions and the military. 'That unworthy being ... has been saying that he is going to return to the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,' Rodriguez said shortly after he was re-elected as the National Assembly's president. 'Each and every deputy who defends peace will request, if he touches a bit of land of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, his immediate arrest.' González began a tour of the Americas with stops in Argentina and Uruguay on Saturday, when he told reporters he would travel to the United States next and hoped to speak with President Joe Biden. He said he also planned to visit Panama and the Dominican Republic. Meanwhile, Maduro already received an invitation from the National Assembly to be sworn in for a third term Friday, more than five months after the country's National Electoral Council, stacked with ruling-party loyalists, declared him winner of the July 28 election. Unlike previous presidential elections, electoral authorities did not provide detailed vote counts. Yet, the opposition collected tally sheets from more than 80% of the nation’s electronic voting machines, posted them online and said they showed González had won the election with twice as many votes as Maduro. Global condemnation over the lack of transparency prompted Maduro to ask Venezuela’s high court, also controlled by ruling-party supporters, to audit the results. The court subsequently reaffirmed his victory. The U.S. and most European governments have rejected the election’s official results and consider González the legitimate winner. Rodriguez on Sunday told National Assembly members that their potential request to have González arrested would be based on a recently approved measure that allows for the prosecution of anyone who expresses support for economic sanctions like those imposed by the United States against Venezuela.	https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-election-maduro-opposition-edmundo-arrest-0f93ec0dcf85c455b4f9670835dc154d	2025-01-05T09:30:10-08:00	
Man behind New Year's attack visited New Orleans before, recorded video with smart glasses, FBI says	NEW ORLEANS (AP) — The man responsible for the truck attack in New Orleans on New Year's Day that killed 14 people visited the city twice before and recorded video of the French Quarter with Meta smart glasses, an FBI official said Sunday. Shamsud-Din Jabbar also traveled to Cairo and Canada before the attack, though it was not yet clear whether those trips were connected to the attack, Deputy Assistant Director Christopher Raia said at a news conference. Federal officials believe Jabbar, a U.S. citizen and former U.S. Army soldier, was inspired by the the Islamic State militant group to carry out the attack. Police fatally shot Jabbar, 42, during a firefight at the scene of the deadly crash of the rented pickup truck on Bourbon Street, famous worldwide for its festive vibes in New Orleans’ historic French Quarter. Federal investigators so far believe Jabbar acted alone, but are continuing to explore his contacts. 'All investigative details and evidence that we have now still support that Jabbar acted alone here in New Orleans,' said Raia. 'We have not seen any indications of an accomplice in the United States, but we are still looking into potential associates in the U.S. and outside of our borders.' Lyonel Myrthil, FBI special agent in charge of the New Orleans Field Office, said Jabbar traveled to Cairo in the summer of 2023 and then to Canada a few days later. 'Our agents are getting answers to where he went, who he met with and how those trips may or may not tie into his actions here,' Myrthil said. Suspect recorded video with smart glasses while plotting attack, the FBI says Jabbar had also traveled to New Orleans twice in the months preceding the attack, first in October and again in November. On Oct. 31, Myrthil said Jabbar used glasses from Meta, the parent company of Facebook, to record video as he rode through the French Quarter on a bicycle as 'he plotted this hideous attack.' He said Jabbar was also in New Orleans on Nov. 10. He also wore the glasses capable of livestreaming during the attack, but Myrthil said Jabbar did not activate them. The FBI released Jabbar's recorded video from the planning trip to New Orleans as well as video showing him placing two containers with explosive devices in the French Quarter at around 2 a.m. shortly before the attack. One of the containers, a cooler, was moved a block away by someone uninvolved with the attack, officials said. Joshua Jackson, New Orleans special agent in charge, said Jabbar privately purchased a semiautomatic rifle on Nov. 19 from an individual in a legal transaction in Arlington, Texas. 'This was a chance encounter,' Jackson said. 'There’s no way this individual knew that Jabbar was radicalized or had any sort of awareness that this attack was imminent.' Security a prime concern ahead of other major events Police have used vehicles and barricades to block traffic at Bourbon and Canal streets since. Other law enforcement agencies helped city officers provide extra security, said Reese Harper, a New Orleans police spokesperson. The first parade of the Carnival season leading up to Mardi Gras in March is scheduled Monday evening. New Orleans also will host the Super Bowl on Feb. 9. In a previous effort to protect the French Quarter, the city installed steel columns known as bollards to restrict vehicle access to Bourbon Street. The posts normally retract to allow deliveries to bars and restaurants. But they stopped working reliably after being gummed up by Mardi Gras beads, beer and other detritus. When New Year’s Eve arrived, the bollards were gone. New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell acknowledged the city remains uncertain as to whether the new bollards it is installing in the French Quarter would be able to stop a similar vehicle attack. 'The thorough assessment that I am asking for will determine whether they are strong enough,' Cantrell said. 'I can’t say with surety that’s the case but an expert will be able to do so, and we’ll respond accordingly.' Cantrell said she requested that Homeland Security upgrade Mardi Gras to the highest Special Event Assessment Rating to receive more federal support for security and risk assessments. President Joe Biden planned to travel to New Orleans with first lady Jill Biden on Monday to 'grieve with the families and community members impacted by the tragic attack.' After signing the Social Security Fairness Act, Biden was asked Sunday by journalists what his message would be to the families he will meet. He responded, 'I’ve been there. There’s nothing you can really say to somebody that’s just had such a tragic loss, my message is going to be personal if I get to get them alone.' The two explosive devices that Jabbar placed were recovered by federal officials undetonated. ATF Special Agent in Charge Joshua Jackson credited New Orleans police for responding quickly before the devices could be set off. He said both were equipped with receivers and a transmitter was recovered in Jabbar’s truck. Jabbar exited the crashed truck wearing a ballistic vest and helmet and fired at police, wounding at least two officers before he was fatally shot by police. Bomb-making materials were found at Jabbar's home. Jackson said Jabbar appeared to have used a chemical compound known as RDX, which he said is commonly available in the U.S. He said field tests found RDX at Jabbar’s Houston home and they are conducting further tests on similar materials found at the New Orleans rental home. Jabbar tried to burn down the rental house by setting a small fire in a hallway but the flames went out before firefighters arrived. Suspect proclaims support for Islamic State group Jabbar proclaimed support for the Islamic State militant group in online videos posted hours before he struck. It was the deadliest IS-inspired assault on U.S. soil in years, laying bare what federal officials have warned is a resurgent international terrorism threat. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told ABC’s 'This Week with George Stephanopoulos' that the country faces 'not only the persistent threat of foreign terrorism' but 'a significant increase in what we term homegrown violent extremism' in recent years.	https://apnews.com/article/new-orleans-truck-attack-fbi-47fd819355e6d31475529e4f3b1328e5	2025-01-05T08:47:48-08:00	
Rugby star Ilona Maher makes her debut in front of record crowd for Bristol Bears	BRISTOL, England (AP) — U.S. rugby star Ilona Maher made her debut for the Bristol Bears women's team in front of a record home crowd of 9,240 fans on Sunday. But Maher, ' the most followed rugby player on the planet,' could not prevent Bristol from losing 40-17 to defending champion Gloucester-Hartpury in a Premiership Women’s Rugby match. She came on as a substitute in the 61st minute at Ashton Gate with Bristol trailing 28-10. Maher made her presence felt in a couple of rucks and looked for work off the wing but could make little impact to the overall picture in her 20 minutes on the field. The previous attendance record for a Bristol women’s home match was 4,101 against Harlequins in May 2022. Such was the anticipation surrounding Maher's debut that Bristol relocated the match from a smaller venue to Ashton Gate to satisfy demand for seats. The 28-year-old Maher, who helped lead the U.S. to the bronze medal in rugby sevens at the Paris Games, has signed a three-month contract with Bristol in southwestern England. She had begun training with Bristol in December when the team announced the signing before going back to the United States for the holidays. Maher has more than 8 million followers combined on Instagram and TikTok. She was a runner-up on the 'Dancing With The Stars' TV show. The Vermont native is returning to the 15-a-side game in hopes of boosting her chances of making the U.S. team for the 2025 Rugby World Cup in England. She can play at wing or center. Bristol also said the attendance was a record for a stand-alone game in the Premiership. League-leading Harlequins said they set a women’s club rugby record for attendance on Dec. 28 when 18,055 fans watched the team beat Leicester Tigers 42-17 at Twickenham Stadium. That was not a stand-alone match; it was part of a doubleheader with the Harlequins men’s team. ___ AP rugby: https://apnews.com/hub/rugby	https://apnews.com/article/ilona-maher-debut-rugby-bristol-bears-79ca5788b6d994c059989ab4d1a433b0	2025-01-05T07:34:28-08:00	
Syria's foreign minister visits Qatar as new authorities seek regional and global diplomatic ties	DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — Syria's new foreign minister met with his Qatari counterpart and Qatar's prime minister in Doha on Sunday, as Syria’s new de facto authorities under Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, establish diplomatic ties with regional and global governments. Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani posted on X that he’s also set to visit Jordan and the United Arabs Emirates to develop strategic partnerships, and support Syria’s security and economic recovery. Al-Shibani met with his Saudi counterpart in Riyadh on Thursday. And he also welcomed the foreign ministers of Germany and France in Damascus on Friday. HTS led a lightning insurgency that ousted President Bashar Assad on Dec. 8 and ended his family's decades-long rule. From 2011 until Assad's downfall, Syria's uprising and civil war killed an estimated 500,000 people. Much of the world ended diplomatic relations with Assad because of his crackdown on protesters, and sanctioned him and his Russian and Iranian associates. Now, Syria under Islamist rule hopes to reestablish those ties and lift sanctions slapped on HTS and leader Ahmad al-Sharaa to help make Syria's battered economy viable again. Assad was backed by Russia, Iran and Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. HTS now hopes Syria can strengthen ties with Arab countries in the region. Qatar supported opposition groups that fought against Assad and his allies, and was one of a few Arab countries that opposed restoring ties with the ousted Assad and Syria's return to the Arab League in 2023. 'We conveyed to Doha our concerns about the challenges related to the economic sanctions imposed on the Syrian people, and we renew our call on the United States to lift those sanctions,' Syrian radio station Sham FM quoted Al-Shibani as saying. Around 90% of Syrians live in poverty, while more than half of the population doesn't know where their next meal will come from, according to the United Nations. Al-Sharaa has said he will hold a national dialogue summit that includes different groups across Syria to agree upon a new political road map leading to a new constitution and an election. He vowed to dissolve HTS during the summit and has said in an interview with Saudi television network Al-Arabiyya that the de facto rulers are all of the same political background during this transitional phase for the sake of efficiency in running the country. Still, it's unclear whether Washington will lift sanctions anytime soon. Europe, meanwhile, appears hesitant because of fears over how religious minorities and women will be treated.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-diplomacy-qatar-hts-b331443993d0b5a7443b1462183c4be2	2025-01-05T05:00:12-08:00	
Speculation grows that Austrian far right leader Herbert Kickl will be asked to form a government	VIENNA (AP) — Austrian President Alexander van der Bellen on Sunday announced that he would meet with far-right politician Herbert Kickl as speculation grows that he will ask the Freedom Party leader to form a government. Van der Bellen made the announcement after meeting with Chancellor Karl Nehammer and others at his presidential palace. Nehammer has announced his intention to resign after coalition talks between his conservative Austrian People's Party and the center-left Social Democrats collapsed over the budget. Nehammer has ruled out working with Kickl, but others within his party are less adamant. Earlier Sunday, the People's Party nominated its general secretary, Christian Stocker, as interim leader, but the president said Nehammer would remain chancellor for now. Van der Bellen said that he had spent several hours talking to key officials, after which he got the impression that 'the voices within the People's Party who exclude working with the Freedom Party under its leader Herbert Kickl have become quieter.' The president said that this development has 'potentially opened a new path,' which has prompted him to invite Kickl for a meeting on Monday morning. Kickl's Freedom Party topped the polls in the autumn's national election with 29.2% of the vote, but Van der Bellen tasked Nehammer with putting together a new government because no other party was willing to work with Kickl. That decision drew heavy criticism from the Freedom Party and its supporters, with Kickl saying that it was 'not right and not logical' that he did not get a mandate to form a government. Stocker addressed reporters on Sunday afternoon and confirmed that he had been appointed 'unanimously' by his party to serve as interim leader. 'I am very honored and happy,' he said. He also welcomed the decision by the president to meet with Kickl and said that he now expects that the leader of the party that emerged as the clear winner from the last election would be tasked with forming a government. 'If we are invited to negotiations to form a government, we will accept this invitation,' Stocker added. In the past, Stocker has criticized Kickl, calling him a 'security risk' for the country. In its election program titled 'Fortress Austria,' the Freedom Party calls for 'remigration of uninvited foreigners,' for achieving a more 'homogeneous' nation by tightly controlling borders and suspending the right to asylum via an emergency law. The Freedom Party also calls for an end to sanctions against Russia, is highly critical of Western military aid to Ukraine and wants to bow out of the European Sky Shield Initiative, a missile defense project launched by Germany. The Freedom Party has also signed a friendship agreement in 2016 with Putin’s United Russia Party that it now claims has expired. Kickl has criticized 'elites' in Brussels and called for some powers to be brought back from the European Union to Austria. Austria was thrown into political turmoil on Friday after the liberal party Neos pulled out of coalition talks with the the People's Party and the Social Democrats. On Saturday the two remaining parties, who have only a one-seat majority in Parliament, made another attempt to form a government — but that also ended in failure after a few hours, with negotiators saying they were unable to agree on how to repair the budget deficit.	https://apnews.com/article/austria-nehammer-coalition-stocker-4bb25ad73af94692e6e6caffa05f7849	2025-01-05T03:37:41-08:00	
Israeli former soldier leaves Brazil over investigation into alleged war crimes in Gaza	JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel has helped a former soldier leave Brazil after legal action was initiated against him by a group accusing Israelis of war crimes in the Gaza Strip based in part on their own social media posts. Israel’s Foreign Ministry confirmed the incident on Sunday, saying it had helped the former soldier safely depart from Brazil after what it described as 'anti-Israel elements' tried to bring about an investigation last week. It warned Israelis against posting on social media about their military service. The Hind Rajab Foundation, named for a 5-year-old Palestinian girl killed in Gaza, said Brazilian authorities had launched an investigation into the soldier after it filed a complaint based on video footage, geolocation data and photographs showing him taking part in the demolition of civilian homes. It described the move as a 'pivotal step toward accountability for crimes committed in Gaza.' There was no immediate comment from Brazilian authorities. Brazilian media reported Saturday that the investigation was ordered by an on-call federal judge in Brazil’s Federal District. The decision was issued on Dec. 30 but first reported by local media over the weekend. Israel has faced heavy international criticism over its war against Hamas in Gaza, with the International Criminal Court issuing arrest warrants against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister. The International Court of Justice is separately investigating genocide allegations. The Brazil case raised the prospect that rank-and-file Israeli troops could also face possible prosecution while traveling abroad. Israel adamantly rejects the international allegations, saying its forces in Gaza are acting in accordance with international law and that any violations are punished within its own judicial systems. It says Hamas conceals tunnels and other militant infrastructure in residential buildings, necessitating their demolition. Throughout the nearly 15-month war, Israeli soldiers have posted numerous videos from Gaza that appear to show them rummaging through private homes and blowing up or burning residential buildings. In some, they chant racist slogans or boast about destroying the Palestinian territory. The military has pledged to take disciplinary action in what it says are a handful of isolated cases. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s offensive has killed over 45,800 Palestinians in Gaza, according to local health officials. They say women and children make up over half the fatalities but do not distinguish between civilians and militants in their tally. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. The war has caused widespread destruction in Gaza and displaced around 90% of the population of 2.3 million people, with many forced to flee multiple times. Israeli forces kill Palestinian security man accused of being a militant In a separate development, Israeli forces killed a member of the Palestinian security services in the occupied West Bank, saying he was a wanted militant. Israel's paramilitary Border Police said Sunday that they carried out an operation in the village of Meithaloun overnight to arrest Hassan Rabaiya. They said he was killed in a shootout while trying to escape, and that a shotgun, weapons parts and around $26,000 in cash was found inside his home. Israeli authorities released helmet-cam footage that showed the police shooting the suspect and later blowing up what police said was an explosives lab in his home. Meithaloun is near the northern West Bank city of Jenin, an epicenter of Israeli-Palestinian violence in recent years. The Palestinian security services identified Rabaiya as a first lieutenant in its Preventive Security force, saying he was killed while 'performing his national duty.' The Palestinian Authority has been waging a rare crackdown on militants in Jenin in recent weeks, angering many Palestinians. The internationally recognized Palestinian Authority exercises limited autonomy in parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank and cooperates with Israel on security matters. But Israel has long accused it of inciting violence and turning a blind eye to militants, while Palestinian critics view it as a corrupt and ineffective body that aids the occupation. The West Bank has seen a surge of violence since Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack out of Gaza ignited the war there. Israel captured both Gaza and the West Bank, as well as east Jerusalem, in the 1967 Mideast war, and the Palestinians want all three territories for their future state. Israel warns that ceasefire in Lebanon is at risk Israel's defense minister warned Sunday that the truce that ended more than a year of fighting with Lebanon's Hezbollah is at risk. Israel Katz said the agreement requires Hezbollah to withdraw to the north of the Litani River and Lebanese troops to eliminate any militant infrastructure in the buffer zone — 'something that hasn’t happened yet.' 'If this condition is not met, there will be no agreement, and Israel will be forced to act on its own to ensure the safe return of the residents of the north to their homes,' he said. Both sides have accused the other of violating the ceasefire agreement. The deal struck on Nov. 27 to halt nearly 14 months of fighting linked to the war in Gaza required Hezbollah to immediately lay down its arms in southern Lebanon. It gave Israel 60 days to withdraw its forces and hand over control to the Lebanese army and U.N. peacekeepers. So far, Israel has withdrawn from just two of the dozens of towns it holds in southern Lebanon. And it has continued striking what it says are Hezbollah targets, accusing the group of attempting to launch rockets and move weapons before they can be confiscated and destroyed. Hezbollah, which was severely degraded after a wave of Israeli strikes last fall, has threatened to resume fighting if Israel does not fully withdraw its forces by the 60-day deadline. ___ Shurafa reported from Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip.

Heavy snow brings widespread disruption across the UK and Germany	LONDON (AP) — Heavy snow and freezing rain brought widespread disruption across Europe on Sunday, particularly in the U.K. and Germany, with several major airports forced to suspend flights. With the weather set to stay inclement on Sunday in the U.K., there are concerns that many rural communities, particularly in the north of England, could be cut off, with up to 40 centimeters (15 inches) of snow on the ground above 300 meters (985 feet). The National Grid, which oversees the country's electricity network, said it had been working to restore power after outages across the country. Power cuts were reported in the English cities of Birmingham and Bristol, and Cardiff, Wales. Many sporting events have already been postponed, though the heavyweight Premier League fixture between rivals Liverpool and Manchester United is on, following an inspection at Liverpool's Anfield stadium and of local conditions. Liverpool's John Lennon Airport and Manchester Airport had to close runways overnight, but were returning back to normal on Sunday. Leeds Bradford Airport took longer to get flights back in the air. The road network was heavily impacted too on what would have been a very busy day with many families returning home from the Christmas and New Year's break, and students heading back to universities. Many roads had been preemptively closed by local authorities, but stranded vehicles and collisions have caused disruption elsewhere. A number of U.K. train services were canceled, with National Rail warning of disruption continuing into the working week. Britain's main weather forecaster, the Met Office, says sleet and snow will continue to push north on Sunday and will be heaviest in northern England and into southern Scotland. After experiencing freezing rain, which occurs when super-cold rain freezes on impact, the south will turn milder. The Environment Agency has also issued eight flood warnings across southern England on the Taw and Avon rivers. Snow and ice were also causing havoc in Germany, where a bout of wintry weather is spreading from the southwest. Authorities have issued black ice warnings for drivers and pedestrians, advising people to stay home where possible. Frankfurt airport canceled 120 of its 1,090 planned takeoffs and landings on Sunday, according to the Fraport press office. At Munich airport, only one runway was open while the other one was being cleared. In Baden-Wuerttemberg, eight people were injured when a bus skidded off the road near the town of Hemmingen. Long-distance train connections also experienced irregularities in the Frankfurt area. ___ Monika Scislowska reported from Warsaw, Poland.	https://apnews.com/article/britain-snow-travel-disruption-98fcfebc438b521ef7707e6abfa78753	2025-01-05T01:02:58-08:00	
Ukraine will ask allies to boost its air defenses at a meeting in Germany, Zelenskyy says	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he will again call on allies to boost his country's air defenses at a meeting this week in Germany, as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes over later this month with a vow to end the almost three-year war quickly. Zelenskyy said that dozens of partner countries will participate in the meeting of the Ramstein group at Ramstein Air Base in Germany on Thursday, 'including those who can help boost our capabilities not only to defend against missiles but also against guided bombs and Russian aviation.' 'We will discuss this with them and continue to persuade them,' Zelenskyy said in his nightly address on Saturday. 'The task remains unchanged: strengthening our air defense.' U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin will attend the meeting, which had originally been due to take place in October and to be attended by U.S. President Joe Biden. It was postponed because of response to Hurricane Milton that battered the U.S. In its last few weeks in office, the Biden administration has been pressing to send as much military aid as possible to Ukraine before Trump is sworn in Jan. 20. Trump claimed during his election campaign that he could end the war in one day and his comments have put a question mark over whether the United States will continue to be Ukraine’s biggest — and most important — military backer. Zelenskyy said last week that Trump is 'strong and unpredictable,' and those qualities can be a decisive factor in his policy approach to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Russia controls about one-fifth of Ukraine, and capitalized last year on weaknesses in Ukraine’s defenses to slowly advance in eastern areas despite high losses of troops and equipment. The war’s trajectory isn’t in Ukraine’s favor. The country is shorthanded on the front line and needs continued support from its Western partners. Zelenskyy said Saturday that Russian and North Korean troops had suffered heavy losses in the fighting in Russia’s Kursk region. 'In battles yesterday and today near just one village, Makhnovka, in the Kursk region, the Russian army lost up to a battalion of North Korean infantry soldiers and Russian paratroopers,' Zelenskyy said. 'This is significant.' Zelenskyy said last month that 3,000 North Korean troops had been killed and wounded in Kursk, where Ukrainian forces launched an incursion in August, dealing a blow to Russia’s prestige and forcing it to deploy some of its troops from a slow-moving offensive in eastern Ukraine. The incursion didn’t significantly change the dynamic of the war, and military analysts say Ukraine has lost around 40% of the land it initially captured. In other developments, local officials said one person was killed and another wounded in Russian shelling of the city of Nikopol in Ukraine's Dnipropetrovsk region on Sunday. Downstream along the Dnieper River, at least six people were wounded when Russian troops also fired shells into the city of Kherson, capital of the region of the same name. Settlements such as these on the west bank of the river are subject to regular shelling attacks from Russian-controlled territory on the opposite bank. Nine people were wounded in a Russian guided bomb attack on the border town of Semenivka in Ukraine’s northern Chernihiv region on Saturday evening, local officials said. Moscow sent 103 drones into Ukraine overnight into Sunday, Ukrainian officials said. According to Ukraine’s air force, 61 drones were destroyed and 42 were lost likely due to electronic jamming. Russia’s Defense Ministry said that 61 Ukrainian drones were shot down overnight into Sunday in five regions of western Russia. No casualties were reported but Rostov regional Gov. Yuri Slyusar said residential buildings and cars had been damaged by falling drone debris. ___ Morton reported from London. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/zelenskyy-ukraine-war-ramstein-russia-f6e591c4494e6a1e8560cbd86ab5693e	2025-01-05T00:53:59-08:00	
Costas Simitis, former Greek prime minister and socialist leader, dies at 88	ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Costas Simitis, former prime minister of Greece and the architect of the country’s joining the common European currency, the euro, has died at age 88, state TV ERT reported. Simitis was taken to a hospital in the city of Corinth early Sunday morning from his holiday home west of Athens, unconscious and without a pulse, the hospital’s director was quoted as saying by Greek media. An autopsy will be performed to determine the cause of death. The government decreed a four-day period of official mourning. Simitis will receive a state funeral. Warm tributes appeared, and not just from political allies. 'I bid farewell to Costas Simitis with sadness and respect. A worthy and noble political opponent,' Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said in a Facebook post, also saluting the 'good professor and moderate parliamentarian.' Another conservative politician, former European Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos, recalled how he, as mayor of Athens, had cooperated 'seamlessly and warmly' with Simitis in organizing the Olympic Games. 'He served the country with devotion and a sense of duty. ... He was steadfast in facing difficult challenges and promoted policies that changed the lives of (many) citizens,' Avramopoulos added. Simitis, a co-founder of the Socialist PASOK party in 1974, eventually became the successor to the party’s founding leader, Andreas Papandreou, with whom he had an often contentious relationship that shaped the party’s nature. Simitis was a low-key pragmatist where Papandreou was a charismatic, fiery populist. He was also a committed pro-European, while Papandreou banked on strong opposition to Greece’s joining what was then the European Economic Community in the 1970s, before changing tack once he became prime minister. When the profligate first four years of socialist rule, from 1981 to 1985, resulted in a rapidly deteriorating economy, Papandreou elevated Simitis to be finance minister and oversee a tight austerity program. Finances improved, inflation was partly tamed, but Simitis was pushed to resign in 1987 when Papandreou, eyeing an upcoming election, announced a generous wages policy, undermining the goals of the austerity program. The socialists returned to power with Papandreou still at the helm in 1993, but he was ailing and finally resigned the premiership in January 1996. A tight two rounds of voting among the socialist lawmakers unexpectedly elevated Simitis to the post of prime minister, a post he held until 2004. Simitis considered Greece’s entry into the eurozone, in January 2001, as the signature achievement of his premiership. But he also helped secure the 2004 Olympic Games for Athens and presided over a vast program of infrastructure building, including a brand new airport and two subway lines, to help host the games. He also helped Cyprus join the European Union in 2004. Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides praised Simitis as an 'outstanding leader' who has earned a special place in the history of not only Greece, but also of Cyprus. 'His calm political voice, far from populism, and his political course of action were based on a longstanding philosophy of modernization and reform,' Christodoulides said in a written statement. Simitis' critics on the right and left did their best to denigrate his legacy, highlighting a dubious debt swap concluded after the country had joined the eurozone as an attempt to massage the debt numbers. In the end, it was determined opposition from his own party, including trade union leaders, to pension reform in 2001 that fatally weakened Simitis’ administration. He decided to resign his party post and not contest the 2004 election, five months before the Olympics, rather than face certain defeat to the conservatives. George Papandreou, son of the socialist party’s founder, succeeded him as party leader, and in 2008 expelled Simitis from the PASOK parliamentary group after the two men clashed over policies, including Papandreou’s proposal to hold a referendum on the Treaty of Lisbon. Simitis left parliament in 2009, but not before issuing a prescient warning that financial mismanagement would bring the country under the tutelage of the International Monetary Fund, which would impose harsh austerity. In the end, it was the IMF, jointly with the EU, that imposed a harsh regime on a bankrupt country in 2010. Costas Simitis was born on June 23, 1936, the younger son of two politically active parents. His lawyer father Georgios was a member of the left-leaning resistance 'government' during the German occupation and his mother, Fani, was an active feminist. Simitis studied law at the University of Marburg, in Germany, in the 1950s, and economics and politics at the London School of Economics in the early 1960s. He later taught law at the University of Athens. His elder brother Spiros, who died in 2023, was a noted legal scholar in Germany, specializing in data protection. Simitis is survived by his wife of 60 years, Daphne, two daughters and a granddaughter. —— Menelaos Hadjicostis contributed to this story from Nicosia, Cyprus.	https://apnews.com/article/costas-simitis-obituary-pasok-politics-251a320f1144227517f40b8b08a70e7a	2025-01-04T23:55:50-08:00	
Trump appears with Italian Prime Minister Meloni at his Florida club	PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump made an appearance Saturday with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who was visiting his Mar-a-Lago club. Meloni follows Argentina President Javier Milei, who became the first world leader to meet with Trump at Mar-a-Lago after his Election Day victory in November. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Prime Minister Viktor Orbán of Hungry also traveled to Florida to meet with the president-elect. Trump appeared at a screening of a documentary detailing challenges some conservative lawyers report facing in the legal system. He entered the grand ballroom around 7 p.m. and then returned around two hours later after having dinner. Trump told the crowd of Meloni: 'This is very exciting.' 'I’m here with a fantastic woman, the prime minister of Italy. She’s really taken Europe by storm, and everyone else, and we’re just having dinner tonight,' Trump said. The president-elect watched a screening of the documentary with Meloni and with his pick for the incoming administration's secretary of state, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, as well as Florida Rep. Mike Waltz, Trump's choice for national security adviser and his choice to head the Treasury Department, Scott Bessent. Meloni's visit comes after Italian journalist Cecilia Sala was detained by Iranian police while reporting in Tehran late last month. Sala's case has heightened tensions between Italy and Iran, which is demanding Italian authorities release an Iranian businessman who was arrested recently in Milan on a U.S. warrant in connection with a drone attack in Jordan last year that killed three American troops. Meanwhile, President Joe Biden is set to travel to Rome to meet with Meloni, as well as Pope Francis, beginning Thursday. The White House says the Meloni meeting will 'highlight the strength of the U.S.-Italy relationship' and feature Biden thanking the prime minister 'for her strong leadership of the G7 over the past year.'	https://apnews.com/article/trump-meloni-appearance-sala-florida-club-7dd479dde9a39f251ebf98730e42fcdb	2025-01-04T20:20:24-08:00	
Our country ignored Africa,' Jimmy Carter said. He didn't	NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — Jimmy Carter was the first U.S. president to make a state visit to sub-Saharan Africa. He once called helping with Zimbabwe’s transition from white rule to independence 'our greatest single success.' And when he died at 100, his foundation’s work in rural Africa had nearly fulfilled his quest to eliminate a disease that afflicted millions, for the first time since the eradication of smallpox. The African continent, a booming region with a population rivaling China’s that is set to double by 2050, is where Carter's legacy remains most evident. Until his presidency, U.S. leaders had shown little interest in Africa, even as independence movements swept the region in the 1960s and '70s. 'I think the day of the so-called ugly American is over,' Carter said during his warm 1978 reception in Nigeria, Africa's most populous country. He said the official state visit swept aside 'past aloofness by the United States,' and he joked that he and Nigerian President Olesegun Obasanjo would go into peanut farming together. Cold War tensions drew Carter's attention to the continent as the U.S. and Soviet Union competed for influence. But Carter also drew on the missionary traditions of his Baptist faith and the racial injustice he witnessed in his homeland in the U.S. South. 'For too long our country ignored Africa,' Carter told the Democratic National Committee in his first year as president. African leaders soon received invitations to the White House, intrigued by the abrupt interest from the world’s most powerful nation and what it could mean for them. 'There is an air of freshness which is invigorating,' visiting Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda said. Carter observed after his first Africa trip, 'There is a common theme that runs through the advice to me of leaders of African nations: ‘We want to manage our own affairs. We want to be friends with both of the great superpowers and also with the nations of Europe. We don’t want to choose up sides.’' The theme echoes today as China also jostles with Russia and the U.S. for influence, and access to Africa's raw materials. But neither superpower has had an emissary like Carter, who made human rights central to U.S. foreign policy and made 43 more trips to the continent after his presidency, promoting Carter Center projects that sought to empower Africans to determine their own futures. As president, Carter focused on civil and political rights. He later broadened his efforts to include social and economic rights as the key to public health. 'They are the rights of the human by virtue of their humanity. And Carter is the single person in the world that has done the most for advancing this idea,' said Abdullahi Ahmed An-Naim, a Sudanese legal scholar. Even as a candidate, Carter mused about what he might accomplish, telling Playboy magazine, 'it might be that now I should drop my campaign for president and start a crusade for black-majority rule in South Africa or Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). It might be that later on, we’ll discover there were opportunities in our lives to do wonderful things and we didn’t take advantage of them.' Carter welcomed Zimbabwe’s independence just four years later, hosting new Prime Minister Robert Mugabe at the White House and quoting the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.: 'Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.' 'Carter told me that he spent more time on Rhodesia than he did on the entire Middle East. And when you go into the archives and look at the administration, there is indeed more on southern Africa than the Middle East,' historian and author Nancy Mitchell said. Relations with Mugabe’s government soon soured amid deadly repression, and by 1986 Carter led a walkout of diplomats in the capital. In 2008, Carter was barred from Zimbabwe, a first in his travels. He called the country 'a basket case, an embarrassment to the region.' 'Whatever the Zimbabwean leadership may think of him now, Zimbabweans, at least those who were around in the 1970s and ’80s, will always regard him as an icon and a tenacious promoter of democracy,' said Eldred Masunungure, a Harare-based political analyst. Carter also criticized South Africa’s government for its treatment of Black citizens under apartheid, at a time when South Africa was 'trying to ingratiate itself with influential economies around the world,' current President Cyril Ramaphosa said on X after Carter’s death. The think tank Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter founded in 1982 played a key role in monitoring African elections and brokering cease-fires between warring forces, but fighting disease was the third pillar of The Carter Center's work. 'The first time I came here to Cape Town, I almost got in a fight with the president of South Africa, Thabo Mbeki, because he was refusing to let AIDS be treated,' Carter told a local newspaper. 'That’s the closest I’ve come to getting into a fist fight with a head of state.' Carter often said he was determined to outlive the last guinea worm infecting the human race. Once affecting millions of people, the parasitic disease has nearly been eliminated, with just 14 cases documented in 2023 in a handful of African countries. Carter's quest included arranging a four-month 'guinea worm cease-fire' in Sudan in 1995 so that The Carter Center could reach almost 2,000 endemic villages. 'He taught us a lot about having faith,' said Makoy Samuel Yibi, who leads the guinea worm eradication program for South Sudan's health ministry and grew up with people who believed the disease was simply their fate. 'Even the poor people call these people poor, you see. To have the leader of the free world pay attention and try to uplift them is a touching virtue.' Such dedication impressed health officials in Africa over the years. 'President Carter worked for all humankind irrespective of race, religion, or status,' Ethiopia’s former health minister, Lia Tadesse, said in a statement shared with the AP. Ethiopia, the continent’s second most populous country with over 110 million people, had zero guinea worm cases in 2023. ___ Associated Press reporters Farai Mutsaka in Harare, Zimbabwe, and Michael Warren in Atlanta contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/jimmy-carter-africa-06e637a7554c1a1109bd2a9e1e5390de	2025-01-04T20:05:23-08:00	
The Brutalist,' 'Emilia Perez' triumph at Golden Globes	Two wildly audacious films — Brady Corbet's 215-minute postwar epic 'The Brutalist' and Jacques Audiard's Spanish language, genre-shifting trans musical 'Emilia Perez' — won top honors at the 82nd Golden Globes on Sunday. The Globes, which are still finding their footing after years of scandal and makeover, scattered awards around to a number of films. But the awards group put its strongest support behind a pair of movies that sought to defy easy categorization. 'The Brutalist' was crowned best film, drama, putting one of 2024’s most ambitious films on course to be a major contender at the Academy Awards. The film, shot in VistaVision and released with an intermission, also won best director for Corbet and best actor for Adrien Brody. In his acceptance speech, Corbet spoke about filmmakers needing approval on the final cut. 'I was told that this film was un-distributable,' said Corbet. 'No one was asking for a three-and-half-hour film about a mid-century designer in 70mm. But it works.' 'Emilia Pérez' won best film, comedy or musical, elevating the Oscar chances of Netflix’s top contender. It also won best supporting actress for Zoe Saldaña, best song ('El Mal') and best non-English language film. Audiard, the French director, made way for Karla Sofía Gascón, the film's transgender star who plays a Mexican drug lord who undergoes gender affirming surgery, to speak on behalf of the film. 'The light always wins over darkness,' said Gascón, gesturing to her brightly orange dress. 'You can maybe put us in jail. You can beat us up. But you never can take away our soul or existence or identity.' 'I am who I am. Not who you want.' Demi wins her first Globe Though the Globes audience was particularly starry, including nominees Zendaya, Timothée Chalamet, Angelina Jolie and Daniel Craig, most of the winners hailed from smaller, less seen films. That included some surprises. One was Demi Moore's win for best actress in a comedy or musical. Her comeback performance in 'The Substance,' about a Hollywood star who resorts to an experimental process to regain her youth, landed the 62-year-old Moore her first Globe — a victory that came over the heavily favored Mikey Madison of 'Anora.' 'I’m just in shock right now. I’ve been doing this a long time, like over 45 years, and this is the first thing I’ve ever won as an actor,' said Moore, who was last nominated by the Globes for a film role in 1991 for 'Ghost.' 'Thirty years ago, I had a producer tell me that I was a popcorn actress.' Best actress, in a drama film, was an even bigger surprise. The Brazilian actress Fernanda Torres won for her performance in 'I’m Still Here,' a based-on-a-true-story drama about a family living through the disappearance of political dissident Rubens Paiva in 1970s Rio de Janeiro. Torres dedicated the award to her mother, the great actor Fernanda Montenegro, who appears in 'I'm Still Here,' too. 'She was here 25 years ago,' said Torres. 'And this is like a proof that art can endure through life even through difficult moments.' Best supporting actor in a musical or comedy went to Sebastian Stan for 'A Different Man,' in which Stan plays a man with a deformed face who's healed. Stan, who was also nominated for playing Donald Trump in 'The Apprentice,' noted that both films were hard to get made. 'These are tough subject maters but these films are real and they're necessary,' said Stan. 'But we can't be afraid and look away.' Glaser lightly roasts the Globes Comedian Nikki Glaser kicked off the Globes, with a promise: 'I'm not here to roast you.' But Glaser, a stand-up whose breakthrough came in a withering roast of Tom Brady, made her way around the ballroom of the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California, on Sunday picking out plenty of targets in an opening monologue she had worked out extensively in comedy clubs beforehand. While Glaser might not have reached Tina Fey and Amy Poehler levels of laughs, the monologue was a winner, and a dramatic improvement over last year’s host, Jo Koy. Last year's Globes, following a diversity and ethics scandal that led to the dissolution of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, were widely panned. But they delivered where it counted: Ratings rebounded to about 10 million viewers, according to Nielsen. CBS, who waded in after NBC dumped the Globes, signed up for five more years. Hosting the Globes two weeks before the inauguration of Donald Trump, Glaser reserved perhaps her most cutting line for the entire room of Hollywood stars. 'You could really do anything ... except tell the country who to vote for,' said Glaser. 'But it’s OK, you’ll get ’em next time ... if there is one. I’m scared.' The Globes are now owned by Todd Boehly’s Eldridge Industries and Dick Clark Productions, which acquired the award show from the now defunct Hollywood Foreign Press Association. However, more than a dozen former HFPA members are currently seeking to have the sale to Eldridge Industries and Dick Clark Productions rescinded. A win for ‘Wicked’ Unlike last year's Oscar race, when 'Oppenheimer' rolled, this year's season has more uncertain, with a field of contenders. Most of the movies that are seen as having a chance — 'Conclave,' 'Emilia Perez,' 'The Brutalist,' 'Wicked' and 'Anora' — came away with at least one award Sunday. The exception was Sean Baker's Palme d'Or-winning 'Anora,' which went home empty handed despite five nominations. The Globes' award for cinematic and box-office achievement went to Jon M. Chu's 'Wicked,' which has nearly collected $700 million in theaters. In a heavily arthouse Oscar field, 'Wicked' is easily the biggest hit in the best picture mix. Accepting the award, Chu argued for 'a radical act of optimism' in art. Though few awards have been predictable this season, Kieran Culkin is emerging has the clear favorite for best supporting actor. Culkin won Sunday for his performance in Jesse Eisenberg’s 'A Real Pain,' his second Globe in the past year following a win for the HBO series 'Succession.' He called the Globes 'basically the best date night that my wife and I ever have,' and then thanked her for 'putting up what you call my mania.' The papal thriller 'Conclave' took best screenplay, for Peter Straughan's script. 'Flow,' the wordless Latvian animated parable about a cat in a flooded world, took best animated film, winning over studio blockbusters like 'Inside Out 2' and 'The Wild Robot.' Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross won best score for their thumping music for 'Challengers.' TV prizes Most of the TV winners were oft-awarded series, including the Emmy champ 'Shōgun.' It won four awards, including best drama series and acting wins for Hiroyuki Sanada, Anna Sawai and Tadanobu Asano. Other repeat winners were: 'Hacks' (best comedy series, actress for Jean Smart), 'The Bear' (Jeremy Allen White for best actor) and 'Baby Reindeer' (best limited series). Ali Wong won for best stand-up performance, Jodie Foster for 'True Detective' and Colin Farrell for his physical transformation in 'The Penguin.' 'I guess it's prosthetics from here on out,' said Farrell. ___ For more coverage of the 2025 Golden Globe Awards, visit: https://apnews.com/hub/golden-globe-awards	https://apnews.com/article/golden-globes-2025-emilia-perez-timothee-chalamet-efea6919904ccc8bebdc17197369c217	2025-01-04T20:01:37-08:00	
South Korean protesters brave cold to demand Yoon's ouster as detention deadline looms	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Hundreds of South Koreans, bundled up against freezing temperatures and snow, rallied overnight into Sunday near the residence of impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol, calling for his ouster and arrest, as authorities prepared to renew their efforts to detain him over his short-lived martial law decree. Dozens of anti-corruption agency investigators and police attempted to execute a detainment warrant against Yoon on Friday but retreated from his residence in Seoul after a tense standoff with the presidential security service that lasted more than five hours. The one-week warrant for his detention is valid through Monday. There were no immediate indications that anti-corruption authorities were ready to send investigators back to the residence as of Sunday afternoon. Staff from the presidential security service were seen installing barbed wire near the gate and along the hills leading up to Yoon’s residence over the weekend, possibly in preparation for another detention attempt. A Seoul court last Tuesday issued a warrant to detain Yoon and a separate warrant to search his residence after the embattled president repeatedly defied authorities by refusing to appear for questioning and obstructing searches of his office. But enforcing them is complicated as long as Yoon remains in his official residence. Investigators from the country’s anti-corruption agency are weighing charges of rebellion after the conservative president, apparently frustrated that his policies were blocked by a legislature dominated by the liberal opposition, declared martial law on Dec. 3 and dispatched troops to surround the National Assembly. The Assembly overturned the declaration within hours in a unanimous vote and impeached Yoon on Dec. 14, accusing him of rebellion, while South Korean anti-corruption authorities and public prosecutors opened separate investigations into the events. If the anti-corruption agency manages to detain Yoon, it will likely ask a court for permission to make a formal arrest. Otherwise, Yoon will be released after 48 hours. The Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials, which is leading a joint investigation with police and military investigators, says detaining Yoon would be 'virtually impossible' as long as he is protected by the presidential security service. The agency has urged the country’s acting leader, Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok, to instruct the service to comply with their execution of the detainment warrant, but Choi has yet to publicly comment on the issue. The chiefs and deputy chiefs of the presidential security service defied summonses on Saturday from police, who planned to question them over the suspected obstruction of official duty following Friday’s events. Yoon’s legal team said it will file complaints against the anti-corruption agency’s chief prosecutor, Oh Dong-woon, and approximately 150 investigators and police officers involved in Friday’s detention attempt, which they claim was unlawful. The team said it will also file complaints with public prosecutors against the country’s acting defense minister and police chief for ignoring the presidential security service’s request to provide additional forces to block the detention attempt. Yoon’s lawyers had submitted an objection to the warrants against the president on Thursday, but the Seoul Western District Court dismissed the challenge on Sunday. Park Chan-dae, floor leader of the main opposition Democratic Party, called for the anti-corruption agency to move quickly to detain Yoon, saying it was deeply disappointing to see the agency 'hesitating and letting time slip away.' Hundreds of anti-Yoon protesters rallied for hours near the gates of the presidential residence from Saturday evening to Sunday, voicing frustration over the failed detention attempt and demanding stronger efforts to bring Yoon into custody. Separated by police barricades and buses, pro-Yoon protesters were gathering in nearby streets, denouncing his impeachment and vowing to block any efforts to detain him. 'With barely a day left before the execution deadline for Yoon Seok Yeol’s detainment warrant, the presidential security service continues to hide a criminal and the Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials cannot be more relaxed,' Kim Eun-jeong, an activist, said on a stage during the anti-Yoon rally. 'Angry citizens have already spent two freezing nights demanding his immediate detainment. Are their voices not being heard?' Yoon’s lawyers have challenged the detention and search warrants against the president, saying they cannot be enforced at his residence due to a law that protects locations potentially linked to military secrets from search without the consent of the person in charge — which would be Yoon. They also argue the anti-corruption office lacks the legal authority to investigate rebellion charges and that police officers don’t have the legal authority to assist in detaining Yoon. While the presidential security act mandates protection for Yoon, it does not authorize the presidential security service to block court-ordered detainments. The service’s attempts to block the execution of the warrant may amount to an obstruction of official duty, according to Park Sung-bae, an attorney specializing in criminal law. While the president mostly has immunity from prosecution while in office, the protection does not extend to allegations of rebellion or treason. The agency said its outnumbered investigators had several scuffles with presidential security forces that threatened their safety and expressed 'serious regret' that Yoon was not complying with the legal process. After getting around a military unit guarding the residence’s grounds, the agency’s investigators and police were able to approach within 200 meters (yards) of Yoon’s residential building but were stopped by a barricade comprising around 10 vehicles and approximately 200 members of the presidential security forces and troops. The agency said it wasn’t able to visually confirm whether Yoon was inside the residence. The Defense Ministry says the troops at Yoon’s official residence are under the control of the presidential security service. Kim Seon-ho, the acting defense minister, conveyed his concern to the presidential security service, saying that deploying military personnel to block the execution of the detention warrant would be 'inappropriate' and requesting that the troops aren’t placed in a position where they might confront police, according to the ministry. Yoon’s defense minister, police chief and several top military commanders have already been arrested over their roles in the period of martial law. Yoon’s presidential powers have been suspended since the National Assembly voted to impeach him on Dec. 14. Yoon’s fate now lies with the Constitutional Court, which has begun deliberations on whether to uphold the impeachment and formally remove Yoon from office or reinstate him.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korean-yoon-suk-yeol-martial-law-protests-snow-detention-c16cb90593c7a99673d12ffa0853dda8	2025-01-04T19:01:10-08:00	
Austrian Chancellor Nehammer says he will resign after talks on forming a new government fail	VIENNA (AP) — Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer said Saturday he will resign in the coming days after talks on forming a new government failed a second time. The announcement came after the People’s Party and the Social Democrats on Saturday continued coalition talks a day after the liberal Neos party’s surprise withdrawal from discussions. 'Unfortunately I have to tell you today that the negotiations have ended and will not be continued by the People’s Party,' said Nehammer, the conservative party's leader, in a statement on social media. He said that 'destructive forces' in the Social Democratic Party have 'gained the upper hand' and that the People’s Party will not sign on to a program that it considers to be against economic competitiveness. Social democratic leader Andreas Babler said he regretted the People’s Party decision to end the talks. 'This is not a good decision for our country,' he said. Babler said that one of the main stumbling blocks had to do with how to repair the 'record deficit' left by the previous government. 'I have offered to Karl Nehammer and the People’s Party to continue negotiating and called on them not to give up,' he told reporters Saturday evening. The next government in Austria faces the challenge of having to save between 18 to 24 billion euros, according to the EU Commission. In addition, Austria has been in a recession for the past two years, is experiencing rising unemployment, and its budget deficit is currently at 3.7% of Gross Domestic Product — above the EU’s limit of 3%. Babler blamed the collapse of the negotiations on 'forces within the People’s Party' that were against a coalition with the Social Democrats, while praising Nehammer for his readiness to compromise. A coalition between the People’s Party and the Social Democrats was considered shaky from the beginning since the two parties together only have a razor-thin one-seat majority in the Austrian parliament. It was not immediately clear what would happen next. The People’s Party will have to search for a replacement for Nehammer, who has always ruled out the possibility of a coalition with far-right leader Herbert Kickl. But Nehammer’s expected resignation could now prompt the party to rethink its options under new leadership. People's Party officials planned to meet Sunday to discuss choosing a new leader. The People’s Party and the far-right Freedom Party are close on economic policies as well as other issues such as migration and are already working together in five coalitions on the local level. An early election would be another option. But given Austrian election laws, such an election would unlikely take place before May. Coalition talks had dragged on after Austria’s president tasked the conservative chancellor in October with putting together a new government. The request came after all other parties refused to work with the leader of the far-right Freedom Party, which in September won a national election for the first time with 29.2% of the vote. According to the latest opinion polls published in December, the Freedom Party increased its support to between 35% and 37%. Party leader Herbert Kickl criticized Nehammer, Babler and Austria’s President Alexander Van der Bellen in a written statement on Saturday evening for having created 'chaos instead of stability' and said the ball is now in Van der Bellen’s court. Van der Bellen is expected to make a statement tomorrow, Austrian's public broadcaster ORF reports.	https://apnews.com/article/austria-politics-talks-collapse-2e4ce6802617c2ac7a6d28f4842df38e	2025-01-04T09:41:17-08:00	
Pope Francis says bullying at school prepares students for war, not peace	VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis warned that bullying in schools prepares students for war rather than peace, in a speech to Catholic educators gathered at the Vatican on Saturday. Speaking to about 2,000 Italian teachers, educators and parents, Francis stressed his message against bullying, asking the audience to pledge to fight against it both at school and at home. The pontiff praised educational efforts at schools to promote peace, noting that 'imagining peace' lays the foundations for 'a more just and fraternal world' through 'every subject taught and through the creativity of children and young people.' 'But if, at school, you wage war among yourselves or engage in bullying, you are preparing for war, not for peace,' he said The pope also called for more dialogue within families, emphasizing that 'it is dialogue that makes us grow.'	https://apnews.com/article/pope-francis-bullying-schools-families-catholic-teachers-9970a0e5d6305e0b73f4757f999e701c	2025-01-04T07:58:51-08:00	
Central American troops arrive in Haiti to reinforce mission to restore order	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — About 150 military police officers from Central America have arrived in Haiti to reinforce the embattled government's fight against violent gangs that have upended daily life for millions in the Caribbean country. The deployment of around 75 security officers, mostly from Guatemala, was greeted Saturday at Toussaint Louverture International Airport in Port-au-Prince by the Kenyan commander of the U.N.-backed mission that for months has been struggling to restore order. 'The gangs have only two choices: surrender, lay down their weapons, and face justice, or face us in the field,' the officer, Godfrey Otunge, said in remarks at a welcoming ceremony. 'With the addition of the Guatemalan and El Salvador forces, the gangs will have nowhere to hide. We will root them out of their enclave.' A similar sized contingent, which also included a small number of forces from El Salvador, traveled aboard a U.S. Air Force aircraft and was greeted Friday by top Haitian officials and U.S. Ambassador Dennis Hankins. Coordinated gang attacks on prisons, police stations and the main international airport have intensified in Haiti since the 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse. Gangs are estimated to control about 85% of the capital. In what is perhaps the most brazen attack yet, gunmen opened fire on a crowd that gathered on Christmas Eve for the much-anticipated reopening of Haiti's biggest public hospital, which was closed after being rampaged by gangs earlier this year. Two journalists covering the event and a police officer were killed. Prior to this week's deployment, the international mission seeking to quell the violence was led by around 400 security officers from Kenya. Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados, Benin and Chad have also pledged personnel although it isn't clear when they would be sent. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/haiti-gangs-violence-police-2cbf9641d7749d3922f0e7c98eaf1c28	2025-01-04T07:53:29-08:00	
Blast in southwestern Pakistan kills 1 person and wounds 35	QUETTA, Pakistan (AP) — A blast from an improvised explosive device killed one person and wounded 35 others on Saturday in Pakistan's southwestern city of Turbat, a police official said. Footage from the scene showed vehicles moving through the city before an explosion and flames engulfed one of them. Police officer Roshan Baloch said that eight of the wounded were in critical condition, and that the rest were stable. Most of the casualties are soldiers. The device was in a car parked on the side of the road and was detonated remotely, Baloch added. The chief minister for Balochistan province, Sarfraz Bugti, condemned the attack. 'Those who target innocent people do not deserve to be called human beings,' he said. A separatist group called the Baloch Liberation Army claimed responsibility for the blast, but gave higher casualty figures. It also said the IED targeted a military convoy. Balochistan is Pakistan’s largest province but the least populated. It’s also a hub for the country’s ethnic Baloch minority, whose members say they face discrimination by the government. Balochistan is the scene of a long-running insurgency, with several separatist groups staging attacks, mostly targeting security forces in their quest for independence. It also has other militant groups operating from there. Also Saturday, in the country’s northwest, gunmen opened fire on government vehicles carrying officials who were on their way to supervise aid trucks heading to a besieged district. Several people were wounded in the assault. The aid trucks were carrying food, fuel, and medicine for people in the Kurram district, where hundreds have died in recent months in clashes connected to a land dispute. Authorities shut the roads leading in and out of the district and imposed a communications blackout to contain the fighting. But the measures have deprived the local population of essential items. The gun attack prompted the halt of the aid convoy, said a spokesman for the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government Muhammad Ali Saif. It came days after elders brokered a ceasefire.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-balochistan-turbat-explosion-soldiers-72c4df692f4f0950d882d1b3961c32f2	2025-01-04T07:22:38-08:00	
New Orleans attacker had suspected bomb materials at home, reserved truck weeks ago, officials say	NEW ORLEANS (AP) — The man who rammed a pickup truck into a crowd of New Year's revelers in New Orleans had suspected bomb-making materials at his home and reserved the vehicle used in the deadly attack more than six weeks earlier, law enforcement officials told The Associated Press on Friday. Federal authorities searching the home of Shamsud-Din Jabbar in Houston found a workbench in the garage and hazardous materials believed to have been used to make explosive devices, according to law enforcement officials familiar with the search. The officials were not authorized to speak about the ongoing inquiry and spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity. The FBI investigation also revealed that Jabbar purchased a cooler in Vidor, Texas, hours before the attack and gun oil from a store in Sulphur, Louisiana, the officials said. Authorities also determined Jabbar booked his rental of the pickup truck on Nov. 14, suggesting he may have been plotting the attack for more than six weeks. Authorities say 14 people were killed and about 30 were injured in the attack early Wednesday by Jabbar, a former Army soldier who posted several videos on his Facebook hours before the attack previewing the violence he would unleash and proclaiming his support for the Islamic State militant group. The coroner’s office listed the cause of death for all 14 victims as 'blunt force injuries.' Jabbar, 42, was fatally shot in a firefight with police at the scene of the deadly crash on Bourbon Street, famous worldwide for its festive vibes in New Orleans' historic French Quarter. Authorities found crude bombs that had been planted in the neighborhood in an apparent attempt to cause more carnage. Two improvised explosive devices left in coolers several blocks apart were rendered safe at the scene, officials said. Other devices were determined to be nonfunctional. Investigators recovered from Jabbar's rental truck a transmitter intended to trigger the two bombs, the FBI said in a statement Friday. It also said authorities found bomb-making materials at the New Orleans home Jabbar rented prior to the attack. Jabbar tried to burn the house down by setting a small fire in a hallway and placing accelerants to help spread it, the FBI said. The flames burned out before firefighters arrived. Authorities on Friday were still investigating Jabbar's motives and how he carried out the attack. They say he exited the crashed truck wearing a ballistic vest and helmet and fired at police, wounding at least two officers before he was fatally shot by officers returning fire. New Orleans police declined to say Friday how many shots were fired by Jabbar and police, and whether any bystanders may have been hit, citing the active investigation. Stella Cziment, who heads the city's civilian-run Office of the Independent Police Monitor, said investigators are working to account for 'every single bullet that was fired' and whether any of them struck bystanders. Bourbon Street was solemn Friday. A day after the crime scene reopened to the public, locals and tourists stopped to pay respects to victims of the attack as the sound of bucket drums echoed. People shed tears while gathering at a growing memorial. Some left flowers and candles while others dropped to their knees to say a quick prayer. 'New Orleans is about having a good time, you know, just trying to live your best life,' said Tony Lightfoot, who works in Baton Rouge and was visiting New Orleans with his son. He said the attacker 'just decided to disrupt all of that.' Thirteen people remained hospitalized. Eight people were in intensive care at University Medical Center New Orleans, spokesperson Carolina Giepert said. The White House said President Joe Biden would travel to New Orleans next week. The president and first lady planned to visit Monday to 'grieve with the families and community members impacted by the tragic attack.' Police used multiple vehicles and barricades on Friday to block traffic at Bourbon and Canal streets as crowds of pedestrians swelled. Other law enforcement agencies helped city officers provide extra security, said Reese Harper, a spokesperson for the New Orleans Police Department. The first parade of the Carnival season leading up to Mardi Gras was scheduled to take place Monday. New Orleans will also host the Super Bowl on Feb. 9. 'This enhanced safety effort will continue daily, not just during large events,' Harper said in a statement. In a previous effort to protect the French Quarter, the city had installed steel columns known as bollards to restrict vehicle access to Bourbon Street. The posts retracted to allow for deliveries to bars and restaurants, until — gummed up by Mardi Gras beads, beer and other detritus — they stopped working reliably. So when New Year’s Eve arrived, the bollards were gone. They were being replaced ahead of the Super Bowl. Meanwhile, New Orleans City Council President Helena Moreno took steps toward launching an investigation of the attack. In a memo to another council member obtained by AP, Moreno said she was initiating the creation of a local and state legislative committee 'dedicated to reviewing the incident and its implications.' 'This committee will play a crucial role in assessing our current policies, enhancing security measures, and ensuring that we are adequately prepared to respond to any future threats,' Moreno wrote. The FBI concluded Jabbar was not aided by anyone else in the attack, which killed an 18-year-old aspiring nurse, a single mother, a father of two and a former Princeton University football star, among others. Thirteen of the 14 victims have been identified by the New Orleans coroner’s office, with the youngest listed as 18 and the oldest 63. Most of the victims were in their 20s. One victim was a British citizen, 31-year-old Edward Pettifer of west London, according to London’s Metropolitan Police. British media reported that Pettifer was the stepson of Tiggy Legge-Bourke, who was the nanny for Prince William and Prince Harry between 1993 and 1999, which included the time after the death of their mother, Princess Diana. It was the deadliest IS-inspired assault on U.S. soil in years, laying bare what federal officials have warned is a resurgent international terrorism threat. ___ Mustian reported from Black Mountain, North Carolina.

Venezuela opposition leader recognized by US as election victor embarks on Latin America tour	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — Venezuelan opposition leader Edmundo González, who the United States recognized as the winner of last year's presidential election, kicked off a tour of Latin America on Saturday, just days before President Nicolás Maduro is set to be sworn in for a third term in defiance of international pressure. A crowd of a few hundred Venezuelan migrants broke into shouts of 'Edmundo, Presidente' as González emerged from a meeting with Argentine President Javier Milei to wave to supporters from the balcony of the iconic Casa Rosada, or Pink House, in Buenos Aires. 'We are doing whatever the cause of freedom requires,' Milei, an effusive far-right supporter of the Venezuelan opposition, said as he welcomed González to the presidential palace with honors normally reserved for a head of state. González, a retired diplomat, fled into exile in Spain in September after a judge issued an arrest warrant following the July 28 presidential election, in which Maduro was declared the winner by the National Electoral Council, which is stacked with governing party loyalists. In recent weeks, he has been vowing to travel to Venezuela to be sworn in for the presidential term, which according to law must begin on Jan. 10. But he hasn't said how he plans to return or wrest power from Maduro, whose party controls all institutions and the military. On Thursday, Maduro’s government raised the stakes even further, announcing a $100,000 reward for information on González’s whereabouts and plastering the wanted-like bulletin with the retired diplomat's photo on social media and the arrivals board at the country's main airport. Upon arrival to the Argentine capital, where he twice served as Venezuela’s ambassador more than two decades ago, González posted on social media a short video message expressing solidarity with those imprisoned in Venezuela as part of a crackdown by Maduro. He said that he would raise with Milei concerns about the well-being of five Maduro opponents who have been sheltering in the Argentine ambassador’s residence in Caracas for nearly 10 months — a diplomatic standoff that has embittered relations between Venezuela and Argentina. The Biden administration and most European governments have rejected the election's official results, pointing out that authorities didn't provide detailed results as they have in past elections. Meanwhile, copies of tally sheets collected by the opposition from 85% of the nation’s electronic voting machines show that González prevailed by a more than two-to-one margin. González, 75, was a previously unknown career diplomat when he was thrust into rallying the anti-Maduro coalition as a last-minute stand-in for opposition stalwart María Corina Machado, whom the government banned from running for office. After speaking with Milei on Saturday, González is scheduled to cross the Rio de la Plata for a meeting with Uruguayan President Luis Lacalle Pou.	https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-presidential-election-maduro-opposition-edmundo-argentina-9f1bdf94df65163717ede8ce77c4141a	2025-01-04T05:49:11-08:00	
New Israeli airstrikes in southern Gaza kill at least 15, hospital workers say	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli airstrikes killed at least 15 people including a child early Saturday in southern Gaza, hospital staff said, while a new effort at ceasefire talks was said to be underway in Qatar. A small boy cried over his father, and a woman draped herself over one of the bodies wrapped in white plastic. The three airstrikes hit a car, a house and people on the street in the city of Khan Younis, according to staff at Nasser Hospital. And the Civil Defense, first responders affiliated with the Hamas-run government, said an airstrike destroyed a residential area behind the Saraya complex in Gaza City, killing at least five people. There was no immediate comment from Israel's military. Gaza’s Health Ministry said at least 59 people had been killed and more than 270 injured by strikes in the past 24 hours. There were no immediate statements on the indirect negotiations in Qatar’s capital, Doha, toward a ceasefire after nearly 15 months of war. The Hamas militant group on Friday said talks had resumed and added that it was committed to reaching an agreement. It warned against misinformation, which it said can undermine public confidence. The talks mediated by the United States, Qatar and Egypt have repeatedly stalled as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vows to press on in Gaza until Hamas is destroyed. Fighters with Hamas, which wants Israeli forces out of Gaza completely, continue to regroup in areas where Israeli forces withdraw. A new video of a hostage The war is by far the deadliest round of fighting between Israel and Hamas. It began when Hamas and other militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Around 100 hostages are still in Gaza, at least a third believed to be dead. Families of hostages and others have rallied weekly for months to press Netanyahu to reach a ceasefire deal that would bring loved ones home. In a video released by Hamas on Saturday ahead of the latest weekly rally, Israeli soldier and hostage Liri Albag, speaking under duress, expressed anguish over her situation and mentioned being held 450 days. 'Today is the beginning of a new year; the whole world is celebrating. Only we are entering a dark year, a year of loneliness,' she said. She also said a fellow captive had been injured by the fighting in Gaza, adding, 'We are living in an extremely terrifying nightmare.' She did not name the person injured. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed at least 45,717 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the territory’s Health Ministry, which says women and children make up more than half the dead. The ministry doesn’t distinguish between civilians and combatants in its tally. It says uncounted bodies remain beneath rubble or in areas where emergency responders cannot reach. Israel’s military says it only targets militants and blames Hamas for civilian deaths because its fighters operate in dense residential areas. The army says it has killed 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. The war has caused widespread destruction and displaced about 90% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million, many of them multiple times. Winter has now arrived, and hundreds of thousands are sheltering in tents near the sea. A small number of children have died from exposure to the cold. Tensions elsewhere Meanwhile, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, relatives mourned an 18-year-old Palestinian who the Palestinian Health Ministry said was killed Friday during clashes with Israel’s army in the Balata refugee camp in Nablus. The ministry said nine other people were injured. Palestinian health officials have said Israeli raids throughout the West Bank since Oct. 7, 2023, have killed more than 800 Palestinians. Israel says most of these are militants, but youths throwing stones and people not involved in confrontations have also been killed. A fragile ceasefire between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah has held up for over a month, although its terms seem unlikely to be met by the agreed-upon 60-day deadline. Israel and Hezbollah had exchanged fire almost daily since the war in Gaza began. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/gaza-israel-palestinians-war-news-a6f9f03b1c5922a2e6f223f17d9d27cd	2025-01-04T05:21:57-08:00	
Malaysia turns away 2 boats with nearly 300 Rohingya refugees after dozens landed on island	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — Malaysian authorities said Saturday that they have turned away two boats carrying nearly 300 people believed to be Muslim Rohingya refugees who were found to have entered the country illegally. The Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency said that it had information that two more boats were attempting to enter the country after a boatload of 196 Rohingya landed early Friday on a beach on the northeastern resort island of Langkawi. They were all detained by authorities. The agency said authorities had detected the other two boats later Friday off Langkawi. It said the people on the two boats, also believed to be Rohingya, were reported to be exhausted and lacked sufficient food and water supplies. Maritime Enforcement Agency chief Mohamad Rosli Abdullah said in a statement that assistance has been provided to the two boats, including food supplies and and drinking water, before they were escorted out of the country to continue their journey. It didn't say where the boats were heading, and no further details were given. There were also no details about where they came from, but many Rohingya living in refugee camps in Bangladesh have been lured by traffickers to leave to seek a better life elsewhere. Bangladesh hosts more than 1 million Rohingya refugees who fled ethnic and religious violence in Myanmar. Malaysia is a popular destination because of its dominant Malay Muslim population. Many Rohingya fled a brutal counterinsurgency campaign in 2017 by Myanmar’s security forces, who were accused of committing mass rapes and killings. While Malaysia has accepted Rohingya in the past on humanitarian grounds, the country has tried to limit numbers because of fears of a mass influx of people arriving on boats. As of the end of November, there were around 111,410 Rohingya refugees and asylum-seekers registered with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in Malaysia. This makes up about 58% of the total refugee population in Malaysia.	https://apnews.com/article/malaysia-rohingya-refugees-turned-away-c65d5f534c80938a1904bbef55e872fb	2025-01-04T05:20:27-08:00	
Danish police investigate sighting of numerous drones over the port of Koege	COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — Danish police said Saturday they are investigating a report of some 20 drones over the port of Koege, southwest of Copenhagen. Regional police said in a statement quoted by the Danish Radio that when its officers arrived at the location Friday night they were able to see four large drones over the Koege Marina. Police had been called to the site by a witness who claimed to have seen some 20 drones that later disappeared into the Koege Bay at high speed. The police said they were trying to determine the total number of drones and their ownership, as no permission had been issued for drone flights in that area at the time they appeared. The police are also investigating other sightings of drones amid security concerns linked to Russian hybrid attacks detected in some European countries and Moscow's full-scale war against Ukraine.	https://apnews.com/article/denmark-drones-port-police-investigation-18e41a09ff8ce2638c79846ad64cf92e	2025-01-04T05:14:22-08:00	
Russia-appointed officials in Crimea declare emergency as oil spill reaches Sevastopol	Russia-appointed officials in Moscow-occupied Crimea announced a regional emergency on Saturday, as oil was detected on the shores of Sevastopol, the peninsula’s largest city. Fuel oil spilled out of two storm-stricken tankers nearly three weeks ago in the Kerch Strait, close to eastern Crimea — some 250 kilometers (155 miles) from Sevastopol, which lies on the southwest of the peninsula. 'Today a regional emergency regime has been declared in Sevastopol,' regional Gov. Mikhail Razvozhaev wrote on Telegram. Oil was found on four beaches in the region and was 'promptly eliminated' by local authorities working together with volunteers, Razvozhaev said. 'Let me emphasize: there is no mass pollution of the coastline in Sevastopol,' he wrote. Razvozhaev’s announcement came after authorities in Russia’s southern Krasnodar region announced a region-wide emergency last week, as the fuel oil continued washing up on the coastline 10 days after one tanker ran aground and the other was left damaged and adrift on Dec. 15. Krasnodar regional Gov. Veniamin Kondratyev said Friday that more than 5,000 people were still working to clean up the spill. More than 86,000 tons of contaminated sand and soil have been removed along the region’s shoreline since the original spill, he wrote on Telegram. On Dec. 23, the ministry estimated that up to 200,000 tons in total may have been contaminated with mazut, a heavy, low-quality oil product. Russian President Vladimir Putin has called the oil spill an 'ecological disaster.' The Kerch Strait, which separates the Russia-occupied Crimean Peninsula from the Krasnodar region, is an important global shipping route, providing passage from the inland Sea of Azov to the Black Sea. It has also been a key point of conflict between Russia and Ukraine after Moscow annexed the peninsula in 2014. In 2016, Ukraine took Moscow to the Permanent Court of Arbitration, where it accused Russia of trying to seize control of the area illegally. In 2021, Russia closed the strait for several months. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the head of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office, described the oil spill last month as a 'large-scale environmental disaster' and called for additional sanctions on Russian tankers.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-oil-spill-kerch-strait-crimea-environment-1648d99ef20c022540e6ee7a71e0278e	2025-01-04T04:40:56-08:00	
German leader is more worried about Musk's backing of a far-right party than his insults	BERLIN (AP) — German Chancellor Olaf Scholz says he's staying 'cool' against critical personal comments made by Elon Musk but finds it worrying that the U.S. billionaire makes the effort to get involved in Germany’s general election by endorsing the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. Scholz was reacting after Musk, a close aide to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, called the chancellor a 'fool' after his coalition government collapsed in November and later backed the AfD in an opinion piece he wrote for a major newspaper in Germany. Scholz, head of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), told German magazine Stern on Saturday there is 'nothing new' in criticism by 'rich media entrepreneurs who do not appreciate social democratic politics and do not hold back with their opinions.' 'You have to stay cool,' Scholz told Stern. 'I find it much more worrying than such insults that Musk is supporting a party like the AfD, which is in parts right-wing extremist, which preaches rapprochement with Putin’s Russia and wants to weaken transatlantic relations,' Scholz said. The AfD is monitored by Germany’s domestic intelligence service on suspicion of being right-wing extremist and has already been recognized as such in some individual German states. Germany will hold an early parliamentary electionon Feb. 23 after Scholz’s thee-party coalition collapsed in November in a dispute over how to revitalize the country’s stagnant economy. Musk recently caused uproar after backing the AfD in an opinion piece for the Welt am Sonntag, leading to the resignation of the paper’s opinion editor, Eva Marie Kogel, in protest. 'The Alternative for Germany (AfD) is the last spark of hope for this country,' Musk wrote in his translated commentary. The Tesla Motors CEO also wrote that his investment in Germany gave him the right to comment on the country’s condition. The AfD is polling strongly, but its candidate for the top job, Alice Weidel, has no realistic chance of becoming chancellor because other parties refuse to work with the far-right party.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-musk-scholz-election-afd-f621bbb93974c656c9a75b10da4413f0	2025-01-04T03:47:11-08:00	
Japanese woman who was the world's oldest person at 116 has died	TOKYO (AP) — Tomiko Itooka, a Japanese woman who was the world’s oldest person according to Guinness World Records, has died, an Ashiya city official said Saturday. She was 116. Yoshitsugu Nagata, an official in charge of elderly policies, said Itooka died on Dec. 29 at a care home in Ashiya, Hyogo Prefecture, central Japan. Itooka, who loved bananas and a yogurt-flavored Japanese drink called Calpis, was born on May 23, 1908. She became the oldest person last year following the death of 117-year-old Maria Branyas, according to the Gerontology Research Group. When she was told she was at the top of the World Supercentenarian Rankings List, she simply replied, 'Thank you.' When Itooka celebrated her birthday last year, she received flowers, a cake and a card from the mayor. Born in Osaka, Itooka was a volleyball player in high school, and long had a reputation for a sprightly spirit, Nagata said. She climbed the 3,067-meter (10,062-foot) Mount Ontake twice. She married at 20, and had two daughters and two sons, according to Guinness. Itooka managed the office of her husband’s textile factory during World War II. She lived alone in Nara after her husband died in 1979. She is survived by one son and one daughter, and five grandchildren. A funeral service was held with family and friends, according to Nagata. According to the Gerontology Research Group, the world's oldest person is now 116-year-old Brazilian nun Inah Canabarro Lucas, who was born 16 days after Itooka. ___ Yuri Kageyama is on Threads: https://www.threads.net/@yurikageyama	https://apnews.com/article/oldest-person-japan-itooka-914ce99c6f90204311251e2274ae56e8	2025-01-04T00:07:22-08:00	
A fire at a food market in northern China kills at least 8 and injures 15	BEIJING (AP) — A fire at a food market Saturday in northern China killed at least eight people and injured 15 others, state media said. The fire at the Liguang market in the city of Zhangjiakou broke out midday Saturday and was mostly extinguished by 2:00 p.m. (0600 GMT), Xinhua News Agency reported, citing a government official in Qiaoxi District where the market is located. The cause of the fire is under investigation, the report said. Such traditional markets are often tightly packed with shoppers seeking prices lower than at supermarket chains. Fire sources can range from gas bottles to charcoal used to roast meat and discarded cigarettes while aging infrastructure, such as underground gas lines, has also been blamed for fires and explosions. Zhangjiakou, located in Hebei province bordering Beijing, hosted events during the 2022 Winter Olympic Games.	https://apnews.com/article/china-fire-food-market-zhangjiakou-deaths-a21fd9e694ed2498e97f061d60651773	2025-01-03T23:52:01-08:00	
The fragile Israel-Hezbollah truce is holding so far, despite violations	BEIRUT (AP) — A fragile ceasefire between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah has held up for over a month, even as its terms seem unlikely to be met by the agreed-upon deadline. The deal struck on Nov. 27 to halt the war required Hezbollah to immediately lay down its arms in southern Lebanon and gave Israel 60 days to withdraw its forces there and hand over control to the Lebanese army and U.N. peacekeepers. So far, Israel has withdrawn from just two of the dozens of towns it holds in southern Lebanon. And it has continued striking what it says are bases belonging to Hezbollah, which it accuses of attempting to launch rockets and move weapons before they can be confiscated and destroyed. Hezbollah, which was severely diminished during nearly 14 months of war, has threatened to resume fighting if Israel does not fully withdraw its forces by the 60-day deadline. Yet despite accusations from both sides about hundreds of ceasefire violations, the truce is likely to hold, analysts say. That is good news for thousands of Israeli and Lebanese families displaced by the war still waiting to return home. 'The ceasefire agreement is rather opaque and open to interpretation,' said Firas Maksad, a senior fellow with the Middle East Institute in Washington. That flexibility, he said, may give it a better chance of holding in the face of changing circumstances, including the ouster of Syria's longtime leader, Bashar Assad, just days after the ceasefire took effect. With Assad gone, Hezbollah lost a vital route for smuggling weapons from Iran. While that further weakened Hezbollah’s hand, Israel had already agreed to the U.S.-brokered ceasefire. Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel on Oct. 8, 2023 — the day after Hamas launched a deadly attack into Israel that ignited the ongoing war in Gaza. Since then, Israeli air and ground assaults have killed more than 4,000 people in Lebanon, including hundreds of civilians. At the height of the war, more than 1 million Lebanese people were displaced. Hezbollah rockets forced some 60,000 from their homes in northern Israel, and killed 76 people in Israel, including 31 soldiers. Almost 50 Israeli soldiers were killed during operations inside Lebanon. Here’s a look at the terms of the ceasefire and its prospects for ending hostilities over the long-term. What does the ceasefire agreement say? The agreement says that both Hezbollah and Israel will halt 'offensive' military actions, but that they can act in self-defense, although it is not entirely clear how that term may be interpreted. The Lebanese army is tasked with preventing Hezbollah and other militant groups from launching attacks into Israel. It is also required to dismantle Hezbollah facilities and weapons in southern Lebanon — activities that might eventually be expanded to the rest of Lebanon, although it is not explicit in the ceasefire agreement. The United States, France, Israel, Lebanon and the U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, are responsible for overseeing implementation of the agreement. 'The key question is not whether the deal will hold, but what version of it will be implemented,' Maksad, the analyst, said. Is the ceasefire being implemented? Hezbollah has for the most part halted its rocket and drone fire into Israel, and Israel has stopped attacking Hezbollah in most areas of Lebanon. But Israel has launched regular airstrikes on what it says are militant sites in southern Lebanon and in the Bekaa Valley. Israeli forces have so far withdrawn from two towns in southern Lebanon - Khiam and Shamaa. They remain in some 60 others, according to the International Organization for Migration, and around 160,000 Lebanese remain displaced. Lebanon has accused Israel of repeatedly violating the ceasefire agreement and last week submitted a complaint to the U.N. Security Council that says Israel launched some 816 'ground and air attacks' between the start of the ceasefire and Dec. 22, 2023. The complaint said the attacks have hindered the Lebanese army's efforts to deploy in the south and uphold its end of the ceasefire agreement. Israel says Hezbollah has violated the ceasefire hundreds of times and has also complained to the Security Council. It accused Hezbollah militants of moving ammunition, attempting to attack Israeli soldiers, and preparing and launching rockets towards northern Israel, among other things. Until it hands over control of more towns to the Lebanese army, Israeli troops have been destroying Hezbollah infrastructure, including weapons warehouses and underground tunnels. Lebanese authorities say Israel has also destroyed civilian houses and infrastructure. What happens after the ceasefire has been in place for 60 days? Israel's withdrawal from Lebanese towns has been slower than anticipated because of a lack of Lebanese army troops ready to take over, according to Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, a military spokesman. Lebanon disputes this, and says it is waiting for Israel to withdraw before entering the towns. Shoshani said Israel is satisfied with the Lebanese army's control of the areas it has already withdrawn from, and that while it would prefer a faster transfer of power, security is its most important objective. Israel does not consider the 60-day timetable for withdrawal to be 'sacred,' said Harel Chorev, an expert on Israel-Lebanon relations at Tel Aviv University who estimates that Lebanon will need to recruit and deploy thousands more troops before Israel will be ready to hand over control. Hezbollah officials have said that if Israeli forces remain in Lebanon 60 days past the start of the ceasefire, the militant group might return to attacking them. But Hezbollah Secretary General Naim Kassem said Wednesday that, for now, the group is holding off to give the Lebanese state a chance to 'take responsibility' for enforcing the agreement. Over the final two months of the war, Hezbollah suffered major blows to its leadership, weapons and forces from a barrage of Israeli airstrikes, and a ground invasion that led to fierce battles in southern Lebanon. The fall of Assad was another big setback. 'The power imbalance suggests Israel may want to ensure greater freedom of action after the 60-day period,' Maksad, the analyst, said. And Hezbollah, in its weakened position, now has a 'strong interest' in making sure the deal doesn't fall apart altogether 'despite Israeli violations,' he said. While Hezbollah may not be in a position to return to open war with Israel, it or other groups could mount guerilla attacks using light weaponry if Israeli troops remain in southern Lebanon, said former Lebanese army Gen. Hassan Jouni. And even if Israel does withdraw all of its ground forces, Jouni said, the Israeli military could could continue to carry out sporadic airstrikes in Lebanon, much as it has done in Syria for years.	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-hezbollah-israel-ceasefire-7d8e3ecced6305ef0ec922d04d571fb4	2025-01-03T20:03:56-08:00	
Myanmar to release prisoners to mark Independence Day	BANGKOK (AP) — Myanmar’s military government will release more than 6,000 prisoners and has reduced other inmates’ sentences as part of a mass amnesty on Saturday marking the 77th anniversary of independence from Britain. It wasn’t immediately clear if those released would include any of the thousands of political detainees locked up for opposing army rule since the military seized power in February 2021 from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi. That takeover was met with massive nonviolent resistance, which has since become a widespread armed struggle. State-run MRTV television reported that Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, the head of the military government, granted amnesties covering 5,864 prisoners from Myanmar, as well as 180 foreigners who will be deported. Mass prisoner releases are common on holidays and other significant occasions in Myanmar. The foreigners to be released could include four Thai fishermen who were arrested by Myanmar’s navy in late November after patrol boats opened fire on Thai fishing vessels in waters close to their maritime border in the Andaman Sea. Thailand's prime minister has said she expects the four to be released on Independence Day. The terms of release warn that if the freed detainees violate the law again, they will have to serve the remainder of their original sentences in addition to any new sentence. In a separate report, it said Min Aung Hlaing had commuted the life sentences of 144 prisoners to 15 years imprisonment. The report provided no details about them. The report also said that all other prisoners will have their sentences reduced by one sixth, except those convicted under the Explosive Substances Act, the Unlawful Associations Act, the Arms Act and the Counter-terrorism Law, all laws which are often used against opponent military rule. Myanmar did not release many details of the prisoners being freed, but many were held on charges related to protests, including Section 505(A) of Myanmar’s penal code, which makes it a crime to spread comments that create public unrest or fear or spread false news. Prisoner releases began on Saturday but can take a few days to be completed. At Insein Prison in the country’s biggest city of Yangon, which is notorious for decades for housing political detainees, relatives of prisoners gathered at the gates from early morning. There was no sign that the prisoner release would include Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been held virtually incommunicado by the military since its seizer of power. The 79-year-old Suu Kyi is serving a 27-year sentence after being convicted of a series of politically tinged prosecutions brought by the military. Her supporters and independent analysts say the cases against her are an attempt to discredit her and legitimize the military’s seizure of power while keeping her from taking part in the military’s promised election, for which no date has yet been set. According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, a rights monitoring organization, 28,096 people have been arrested on political charges since the army takeover. Of those arrested, 21,499 people were still in detention as of Friday, the AAPP reported. At least 6,106 civilians have been killed by security forces in the same period, the group says. Its tally does not include all casualties from combat. Myanmar became a British colony in the late 19th century and regained its independence on Jan. 4, 1948. In the capital Naypyitaw, Myanmar’s military government celebrated the anniversary with a flag-raising ceremony at City Hall.	https://apnews.com/article/myanmar-amnesty-independence-day-ce67ab619ce4d3ca5d734c5275c8a3c2	2025-01-03T19:41:52-08:00	
Taiwan says China is redoubling efforts to undermine democracy with disinformation	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Taiwan ’s government says China is redoubling efforts to undermine confidence in the self-governing island’s democracy and close ties with the United States through the spread of disinformation, especially online. The National Security Bureau said the number of pieces of false or biased information distributed by China increased 60% last year, to 2.16 million from 1.33 million in 2023. The brief report issued Friday tallied 'pieces of controversial information,' but did not further define the term. Facebook and X, formerly known as Twitter, were the main conduits for disinformation, along with platforms that explicitly target young people such as TikTok, the report said. China created 'inauthentic accounts' to distribute its propaganda on Youtube, used technology such as AI to create fake videos and flooded comments sections with pro-China statements, the report said. China has for years used global social media platforms to spread both official messages and misinformation even while banning them inside the country. Beijing already has considerable influence with Taiwanese newspapers and other traditional media through their owners' business interests in mainland China. China claims Taiwan as its own territory to be brought under its control by force if necessary, with Chinese leader Xi Jinping renewing a declaration in his New Year's address that unification with Taiwan was inevitable and could not be blocked by outside forces, a likely reference to the U.S., Taiwan’s most important ally. China regularly sends warplanes, ships and balloons into areas controlled by Taiwan and holds military drills to simulate a blockade or invasion of the island. Beijing has also been building up its navy and missile forces to hit key targets and fend off American military support. Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te said in his own New Year's address that the island would continue to strengthen its defenses in the face of escalating Chinese threats. Taiwan, he said, was a crucial part of the global 'line of defense of democracy' against authoritarian states such as China, Russia, North Korea and Iran.	https://apnews.com/article/taiwan-china-disinformation-3f05dac36399bf672a702100147bf8fa	2025-01-03T18:28:08-08:00	
Blinken heads to Asia, Europe on last expected trip as top US diplomat	WASHINGTON (AP) — Secretary of State Antony Blinken will embark on what is expected to be his final overseas trip in office this weekend, traveling to South Korea, Japan and France. The State Department announced Friday that Blinken would visit Seoul, Tokyo and Paris beginning Sunday. In South Korea, which is in the midst of political turmoil following the impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol, and Japan, Blinken intends to highlight the expansion of U.S. cooperation with both nations as part of the Biden administration’s Indo-Pacific strategy. That strategy is primarily intended to blunt Chinese ambitions in the region but also to deter the nuclear threat from North Korea. Political developments in South Korea, however, after Yoon declared martial law and was later impeached, have raised questions about the stability of Washington-Seoul relations. The U.S. has taken a cautious approach to the uncertainty, insisting that the U.S.-South Korea alliance remains intact and iron-clad. Blinken will speak with South Korean officials about how 'to build on our critical cooperation on challenges around the world based on our shared values,' the State Department said in a statement. In Tokyo, Blinken will 'review the tremendous progress the U.S.-Japan alliance has made over the past few years,' the statement said. That includes a major arms sales approval announced on Friday under which the U.S. will deliver some $3.64 billion dollars in medium-range missiles, related equipment and training to Japan. China has repeatedly complained about the potential sale, saying it will affect stability and security in the region, allegations that both Japan and the U.S. reject. Blinken will wrap up his trip in Paris in meetings with French officials to discuss developments in the Middle East and European security, particularly in Ukraine.	https://apnews.com/article/us-blinken-south-korea-japan-france-2b2b419a4bfd9253938e1c75d73f422e	2025-01-03T15:37:27-08:00	
The last high-profile trip to India by the Biden administration will focus on technology	WASHINGTON (AP) — National security adviser Jake Sullivan will travel to India for a visit focusing on cooperation on strategic technology, including in defense, space and artificial intelligence. The Biden administration said Sullivan's visit on Sunday and Monday will include a speech at the Indian Institute of Technology in New Delhi in which he will stress that the outgoing administration sees the U.S. partnership with India as central to its regional and global priorities, and one with support from both major political parties. It's expected to be the last high-profile visit to India by the Biden administration. Sullivan is expected to meet with Indian National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar. India and the U.S. launched a technology initiative in 2022 outlining collaboration on semiconductor production and developing artificial intelligence. The accord was critical in sealing a deal to allow U.S.-based General Electric to partner with India’s Hindustan Aeronautics to produce jet engines in India. India and the U.S. have grown closer recently, in part in response to China’s growing assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific region. Biden threw Prime Minister Narendra Modi a state dinner last year. But ties have also been strained by U.S. prosecutors' accusation in 2023 that an official in Modi's government was involved in a foiled assassination plot against an activist of India's Sikh minority in New York, and the killing of another Sikh activist in Canada.	https://apnews.com/article/india-sullivan-technology-biden-72b6594dd30819268ec47a1a3c7ce52b	2025-01-03T14:24:44-08:00	
Who is Luke Littler? Things to know about the darts sensation who is world champion at age 17	Luke Littler has won the world darts championship at the age of 17 after beating Michael van Gerwen 7-3 in the final in London on Friday. He became the youngest ever world champion in darts. Here are some things to know about Britain's latest sporting sensation: Starting young Littler threw his first dart — onto a magnetic board — at 18 months old, with a video showing him doing so while wearing a diaper. Littler started throwing steel tip darts at the age of 4 or 5, and he says he was throwing them from competition length — from an oche, or throwing line — at age 6 or 7. He won his first title at senior level when he was age 14, at the Irish Open in 2021. Global phenomenon Littler burst into global consciousness — and brought a new wave of followers to darts — by reaching the final of last year's world championship at the age of 16, in his first appearance at the tournament. To the backdrop of chants of 'You’ve got school in the morning' from a boisterous crowd, Littler became the youngest player to win a match on the sport’s highest stage and then beat two former world champions to get to the title match, where he lost to top-ranked Luke Humphries. He celebrated his victories with kebabs and filled his down-time by playing video games. Money, money, money Being a world championship runner-up earned Littler 200,000 pounds ($255,000) and he finished 2024 with total prize money topping 1 million pounds ($1.28 million) after winning 10 tournaments around the world, including in Bahrain and Amsterdam and climbing to No. 4 in the world. More searched than King Charles Last month, Google announced that Littler was Britain’s most-searched athlete in 2024 and the third most-searched person, behind Kate Middleton and President-elect Donald Trump and just ahead of recently elected U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and King Charles. He has 1.5 million followers on Instagram, up from 4,000 before last year’s worlds. The Littler Effect Steve Brown, chairman of the Junior Darts Corporation, told the BBC the Littler effect has seen the number of academies for children under the age of 16 double to 115 in the last year and they can be found in places like Bulgaria and Mongolia. Brown said his corporation has more than 3,000 members, up from 1,600 12 months ago. Home life Littler — nicknamed 'Luke the Nuke' — still lives at home with his parents, Lisa Littler and Anthony Buckley, in Warrington in northwest England. He is a Manchester United fan and received a message from David Beckham during the 2024 worlds. ___ AP sports: https://apnews.com/sports	https://apnews.com/article/who-is-luke-littler-darts-258a2b4fb14676885516dcd3e807db11	2025-01-03T13:01:59-08:00	
Luke Littler becomes the youngest world darts champion at 17	Luke Littler became the youngest world champion in darts history on Friday when the 17-year-old Englishman lived up to his billing as Britain’s latest sporting superstar. Littler beat three-time champion Michael van Gerwen 7-3 in the final at a boisterous Alexandra Palace in London. 'Everyone dreams of lifting this trophy,' said Littler, who also took the winner's check of 500,000 pounds ($620,000). 'I can't believe it.' It completes the remarkable rise of Littler, a prodigy from Warrington in northwest England who first threw a dart as an 18-month-old toddler, was junior world champion in 2023 and reached the world final last year — at age 16 — before losing to top-ranked Luke Humphries. That catapulted him to stardom, making him famous far beyond darts while lifting the sport into the mainstream like in its heyday in the 1980s. Littler handled the huge pressure and expectation on him to return to the final 12 months later and powered 4-0 up in sets against Van Gerwen, a darts phenom himself as a youngster and with world titles in 2014, ‘17 and ’19. The Dutchman made it 4-1, 5-2 and 6-3, but Littler could not be stopped and he was reduced to tears after he made the winning double. 'Wow, wow, wow,' he could be seen saying. 'At 2-0 up, I started getting nervous,' Littler said later, 'but I said to myself, ‘Relax.’ To get it over and done with is special.' Van Gerwen was previously the youngest world champion in the elite Professional Darts Corporation competition, winning the 2014 final at age 24. Jelle Klaasen won the now-defunct British Darts Organisation world title in 2006 at age 21. Van Gerwen said losing his record 'hurt' but was full of praise for Littler. 'Every 17 years a star gets born,' Van Gerwen said, 'and he is one of them.' Many were already wondering if Littler can reach Phil Taylor’s remarkable record of 16 world titles. Claiming a first title at age 17 will now super-charge that conversation.

The French Quarter's metal barriers were gone on New Year's, leaving a critical security gap	After an Islamic State sympathizer rammed a truck into crowds celebrating Bastille Day in 2016, horrified New Orleans leaders were eager to protect their city's famed French Quarter, where crowds of revelers pack the cobblestone streets, especially during big events like Mardi Gras. By the next year, steel columns known as bollards were installed to restrict vehicle access to Bourbon Street. The posts retracted to allow for deliveries to its bars and restaurants, until — gummed up by Mardi Gras beads, beer and other detritus — their tracks stopped working reliably. So when New Year’s Eve arrived, the bollards were gone. They were being replaced ahead of the Super Bowl, which New Orleans will host on Feb. 9. That left a critical security gap as thousands of New Year’s revelers crowded Bourbon Street. Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a U.S. Army veteran inspired by the Islamic State group, exploited that gap when he drove a truck onto a sidewalk early Wednesday and sped around a police car stationed as a temporary barricade, killing 14 people. It was the attack New Orleans had feared since the deadly 2016 rampage in the French Riviera city of Nice that killed 86 people — and one that could have been prevented or limited with temporary or permanent vehicle barriers, said Rob Reiter, an expert on protecting retail stores and crowds from accelerating vehicles for the Security Industry Association. 'This was foreseeable and predictable and preventable,' Reiter said. 'It’s clearly a failure of safety and security.' The terrorism threat to New Orleans was long apparent. Five years ago, a New York-based firm was hired to conduct a 'discreet, confidential physical security and vulnerability assessment' of the city's French Quarter. A confidential portion of the firm's report addressed concerns about the threat of a vehicular ramming attack, The New York Times reported. It also warned the city's Bourbon Street bollards did 'not appear to work' and recommended fixing them immediately. A public version of the firm’s report for the French Quarter Management District — a political subdivision of the state of Louisiana — merely called for imposing more vehicle restrictions on Bourbon Street. It mentioned the threat of terrorism only in passing. 'It’s very troubling that this problem was identified in 2019 and the incoming City Council was not made aware of this recommendation, nor were we made aware of what steps were being taken to resolve this significant issue,' New Orleans Councilman JP Morrell told The Associated Press on Friday. Former New Orleans Police Superintendent Michael Harrison, who led the department from 2014 until 2019, said the bollards were reinforced by large public service vehicles such as dump and trash trucks, placed to prevent other vehicles from entering. Harrison said he and then-Mayor Mitch Landrieu wanted to further 'fortify' the bollards. 'It was a lesson learned from Nice,' Harrison said Thursday. 'I remember vividly the mayor saying, ‘We have to learn the lesson now. Let’s do it now.’' But Reiter, whose association represents companies that manufacture and install bollards, said the city failed to adequately maintain the tracks the bollards moved on. The tracks got 'gummed up' by everything from beer to Mardi Gras beads and stopped working reliably, he said. Concentric Security, an Alabama-based firm that provided oversight for the installation of the bollards, said the system functioned as envisioned at the time. 'But we did observe Mardi Gras beads and other debris inside the bollard wells after a routine examination' later, a company spokesperson said. The company declined to release additional details, citing confidentiality concerns. Heald LTD, the United Kingdom-based company that designed the bollards installed in 2017, said 'basic maintenance and cleaning is all that is required' for upkeep. City officials were removing the Heald-designed barriers and replacing them with a different system of stainless steel bollards before the upcoming Super Bowl. Reiter questioned why the city did not deploy temporary physical barriers that it owns for New Year’s Eve. 'Had they taken the usual measures and done them in the usual proximity to where he made his turn, they absolutely stop this thing,' Reiter said. 'If they put the measures further back, it’s possible that he would have had enough speed to get past the first set of barriers but he would have disabled the vehicle. So the amount of penetration would have been much smaller and the casualties would have been much fewer,' Reiter added. Harrison, the former police commissioner, said the bollards alone may not have prevented the bloodshed. 'He had explosive devices in the truck. He had guns. He had other things that he could have gotten out of the truck and done as much damage outside of the truck,' said Harrison, who now runs a New Orleans-based consulting company. Michael Rodriguez, vice president at California-based 1-800-Bollards, said his company recently shipped 106 stainless steel bollards to New Orleans for its Bourbon Street project. He said the city requested part of the shipment be expedited so installation could be completed before the Super Bowl, and the company put the order on a fast track. But, Rodriguez said, the public will never know what impact they could have had on the attack. 'They weren’t installed. That’s the obstacle,' he said. 'Bollards are great for a visual and an actual barrier. But if they aren’t installed or deployed or engaged, then they’re really not going to do anything.' ___ Kunzelman reported from Washington.

US sanctions Beijing-based cyber group for its alleged role in hacking incidents	WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Treasury on Friday sanctioned a Beijing-based cybersecurity company for its alleged role in multiple hacking incidents targeting critical U.S. infrastructure. The Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control hit Integrity Technology Group, Inc. with sanctions Friday morning, for conducting multiple hacks against U.S. victims, including incidents attributed to Flax Typhoon, a Chinese state-sponsored campaign that targets U.S. critical infrastructure. The sanctions come a few days after Treasury reported that Chinese hackers remotely accessed several U.S. Treasury Department workstations and unclassified documents in a major cybersecurity incident. The Treasury Department said it learned of the problem on Dec. 8, when a third-party software service provider, BeyondTrust, flagged that hackers had stolen a key 'used by the vendor to secure a cloud-based service used to remotely provide technical support' to workers. Friday's sanctions do not appear to be related to the Dec. 8 Treasury hack. Treasury Acting Under Secretary Bradley Smith said the U.S. will disrupt cyber threats 'as we continue working collaboratively to harden public and private sector cyber defenses.' The sanctions block access to U.S. property and bank accounts and prevent the targeted people and companies from doing business with Americans. U.S. officials are continuing to grapple with the fallout of a massive Chinese cyberespionage campaign known as Salt Typhoon that gave officials in Beijing access to private texts and phone conversations of an unknown number of Americans. __ Associated Press reporter Eric Tucker contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/treasury-sanctions-china-cyber-668371e717bea3ae7c7eb8a20fa81a99	2025-01-03T07:37:25-08:00	
Algerian social media influencer detained in France accused of calling for attacks	PARIS (AP) — French police on Friday detained a social media influencer from Algeria who is accused of calling on his followers to carry out attacks in France, Interior Minster Bruno Retailleau said. The arrest in the Brittany port city of Brest on France's western coast comes as the country is preparing to mark the 10th anniversary next week of deadly January 2015 attacks in Paris against the satirical Charlie Hebdo newspaper and a kosher supermarket. On Jan. 7, 2015, two French-born al-Qaida extremists stormed Charlie Hebdo's newsroom and killed 12 people, including the chief editor, cartoonists and a policeman in a nearby street. Over the next two days, an associate invoking the Islamic State group shot a policewoman to death, then stormed the supermarket in eastern Paris, killing four hostages. All three gunmen died in shootouts with police. In a post on X, Retailleau said the Algerian influencer arrested in Brest used the pseudonym 'Zazouyoussef' and 'called on his community to commit attacks in France.' The suspect 'will have to answer for his actions before the courts,' the minister posted. French police said the 25-year-old Algeria-born influencer was detained on suspicion of expressing sympathy for terrorism. Police said he had been ordered last year to leave France after his residency papers expired. Another man, with Algerian residency papers, was detained along with the influencer, also on suspicion of expressing sympathy for terrorism, police said. French media said Zazouyoussef had more than 400,000 followers on a TikTok account that has been closed down. They said he posted video threatening violence against opponents of the Algerian government.	https://apnews.com/article/france-algeria-tiktok-terror-arrest-8401d12ec0bd79140acbcb8cac543637	2025-01-03T07:12:03-08:00

British author David Lodge, twice nominated for Booker Prize, dies at 89	LONDON (AP) — David Lodge, a witty and prolific British novelist and critic who gently satirized academia, religion and even his own loss of hearing in such highly praised narratives as the Booker Prize finalists 'Small World' and 'Nice Work,' has died. He was 89. Lodge's death was announced by Vintage Books UK, which said in a statement that he died Wednesday with his family by his side. Lodge’s wife, Mary, died in January 2022. He is survived by three children, Stephen, Christopher and Julia. 'His contribution to literary culture was immense, both in his criticism and through his masterful and iconic novels which have already become classics,' publisher Liz Foley said in a statement. 'He was also a very kind, modest and funny person and I feel incredibly lucky to have worked with him and had the pleasure of enjoying his wit and company.' Lodge was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1998 for services to literature. Author of more than 20 books and a longtime English professor at the University of Birmingham, Lodge was best known for his trilogy of works — 'Changing Places,' 'Small World' and 'Nice Work' — set in a fictional university in the fictional city of Rummidge, which, the author once noted, just happened to occupy 'the space where Birmingham is to be found on maps in the so-called real world.' In a 1990 interview with The Associated Press, Lodge observed that he didn't hold strong opinions on many subjects and liked to 'put forth novels of contrasting views.' His work ranged from 'Deaf Sentence,' which touched upon mortality and his struggles with hearing, to comic explorations of Catholicism in 'How Far Can You Go?' and 'The British Museum is Falling Down.' Lodge, a self-described 'agnostic' Catholic influenced by Graham Greene among others, would write about the unexpected challenges in the 1960s to such church doctrines as the ban against artificial contraception. 'It was conceivable that, not being able to obey it (the contraception ban), one might leave the Church; inconceivable that one might in good faith remain a full member of the Church while disobeying, or that the church itself might change its views,' Lodge wrote in the introduction to the paperback edition of 'The British Museum Is Falling Down,' in which a Catholic graduate student fears his wife may become pregnant with their fourth child. 'But in the early 1960s, these last two possibilities did at last become thinkable, and came to be thought.' Lodge, born in 1935 and raised in southeast London, also held vivid memories of England during and after World War II and would say that his humor was shaped in part by air raid drills and the scarcity of goods. Although he published a well regarded book of criticism, 'The Art of Fiction,' he considered novels the best way to express his ideas and shape his thoughts. 'We learn how to negotiate our loves through novels,' he told the AP in 1990. 'We learn about experiences beyond our own. A novel is not the only form that does that, but I still think it's the most versatile of all forms.'	https://apnews.com/article/british-author-david-lodge-dies-small-world-28ecd0077725d7610a193731363f2e25	2025-01-03T06:52:22-08:00	
Montenegro to tackle gun control after mass killing left 12 dead	PODGORICA, Montenegro (AP) — A top-level meeting in Montenegro on Friday promised tough measures to curb illegal weapons after a gunman fatally shot 12 people in a second such tragedy in less than three years in the small Balkan country. An emergency session of Montenegro's National Security Council announced a new, strict gun law and urgent actions to confiscate what are believed to be abundant illegal weapons in possession of Montenegro's 620,000 citizens. Prime Minister Milojko Spajić said that holders of registered guns will undergo new security and psychological checks while 'draconian' punishment is planned for those who hold weapons illegally. 'There will be no mercy for these people,' Spajić said at a news conference after the council session. 'They will end up in prison.' Spajić specified that authorities would give people a period of two months to surrender illegal weapons without facing any consequences. After that, he said, 'the law will be explicit and even minimal sentences handed by judges will be drastic.' The Adriatic Sea nation has a deeply-rooted gun culture. State television broadcaster RTCG reported that Montenegro is sixth in the world when it comes to the number of illegal weapons per capita. The gunman who killed a dozen people in a shooting rampage in the western town of Cetinje on Wednesday did so with an illegal 9 mm gun. Police have said they found 37 casings at the shooting locations, and more than 80 additional pieces of ammunition in the gunman's possession. The 45-year-old man, identified as Aco Martinović, eventually shot himself in the head and died shortly after. He is believed to have snapped after a bar brawl, and went home to get his weapon before launching a bloody rampage at several locations late Wednesday afternoon. Martinović's victims included seven men, three women — among them his sister — and two children, born in 2011 and 2016. Four more people were seriously wounded and remain hospitalized. Police Commissioner Lazar Šćepanović has described Wednesday’s shooting as 'one of the biggest tragedies in the history of Montenegro.' The shooting has fueled concerns about the level of violence in Montenegrin society, which is politically divided. It also raised questions about the readiness of state institutions to tackle the problems, including gun ownership. Hundreds of people throughout Montenegro lit candles in silence on Thursday evening in memory of the victims, while also calling for answers as to why the shooting happened. Many were angry at the authorities for not doing more to prevent such tragedies. About 200 people protested outside government headquarters in Podgorica on Friday, demanding the resignations of top security officials over the tragedy and chanting 'murderers.' Mira Škorić, a retiree from Podgorica, said that 'I can’t believe that we failed so much as a society. We failed as people too.' In a separate massacre in August 2022, an attacker killed 10 people, including two children, before he was shot and killed by a passerby in Cetinje, which is Montenegro’s historic capital located about 30 kilometers (20 miles) northwest of the capital, Podgorica. The shootings 'require a serious examination of the responsibility and preparedness of the security system,' the Human Rights Action and Women’s Rights Center groups said in a statement. 'What has changed in the security system in Cetinje since 2022?' Police have said that Martinović’s actions weren't planned and were impossible to predict and prevent, though he had been convicted in the past for violent behavior and illegal weapons possession, and had received psychiatric treatment. Vesna Pejović, a Cetinje resident who lost her daughter and two grandchildren in the shooting back in 2022, said police had to do more to protect the citizens after the first killing. 'What kind of state and system is this where children are getting killed? Are we at war?' she asked. 'Where were the police?' ___ Jovana Gec and Dušan Stojanović contributed to this report from Belgrade, Serbia.	https://apnews.com/article/montenegro-shooting-weapons-ban-government-fdffebbf53d52b3a74c6026389e2bdb5	2025-01-03T06:25:32-08:00	
London Zoo's residents are counted in their annual stocktake, including 2 baby gorillas	LONDON (AP) — From alpacas to zebras — and lots of birds, reptiles and invertebrates in between — London Zoo on Friday is taking stock of what it possesses. The annual census of the zoo's 10,000-plus occupants is a requirement of its license, and the information gleaned will be shared with zoos around the world to help manage breeding programs of endangered species. Glynn Hennessy, the zoo's lead primate keeper, said that zoos are 'really good now' at sharing information. 'We can sort of see the genetic pathway of every individual,' he said. 'We can see who their grandparents were, how they're overrepresented, if they are underrepresented, so it gives us so much information to make sure that we're breeding responsibly.' Hennessy said that 2024 was a 'massive' year for the zoo with two baby gorillas — Juno and Venus — and three Asiatic lion cubs — Mali, Syanii and Shanti — born. There were also 11 penguin chicks, always a fan favorite. And for those who like their frogs, there are 53 new ones to admire. And not just any frog. The new residents are named after Charles Darwin, no less, and arrived in the fall from Chile as part of an effort to save the species from a deadly fungus. While recording large mammals is relatively simple, it's not so easy to identify the diverse array of invertebrates, which now includes a new thriving hive of honeybees, which luckily for the number crunchers will only be counted as one.	https://apnews.com/article/zoo-london-stocktake-annual-8df03d9c0e18d35bed5eee10900dde64	2025-01-03T06:06:16-08:00	
Investigators meet in Brazil to extract data from black box of crashed Azerbaijani airliner	RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Several of Brazilian air force investigators are working with colleagues from three other nations to analyze data from the Azerbaijani airliner that crashed in Kazakhstan on Dec. 25, killing 38 people. Azerbaijan claims the jet was unintentionally shot down by Russia. The Embraer 190 aircraft, made in Brazil, was en route from the Azerbaijani capital, Baku, to Grozny in the North Caucasus when it was diverted. It crashed while trying to land near the city of Aktau after flying hundreds of kilometers (miles) east across the Caspian Sea. Brazil's air force said in a statement late Thursday that nine foreign investigators have gathered with its own experts at its center for investigation and prevention of air accidents in capital Brasilia to work on data extracted from the airplane's black box and other tools. Kazakhstan has three investigators in that group, while six others come from Azerbaijan and Russia. Investigators in Brasilia are working on recordings, cockpit voice and flight data recorders of the aircraft, the Brazilian air force added. There's no deadline for investigators to publicize their conclusions, which will ultimately come from Kazakh authorities. 'The extraction, obtention and validation of the data of the flight recorders will take place in the shortest possible time,' Brazil's air force said. Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev has said that that the aircraft was hit by fire from the ground over Russia and was rendered uncontrollable by electronic warfare. He accused Russia of trying to 'hush up' the issue for several days. Russian President Vladimir Putin apologized to his counterpart for what he called a 'tragic incident', but stopped short of acknowledging that Moscow was responsible. Putin’s apology to President Ilham Aliyev came as allegations mounted that the plane had been shot down by Russian air defense systems attempting to fend off a Ukrainian drone strike near Grozny, the regional capital of the Russian republic of Chechnya, where the plane was heading.	https://apnews.com/article/azerbaijan-embraer-russia-plane-crash-brazil-2d850fac4c2817ea77e3f8b9ace75c9c	2025-01-03T05:40:27-08:00

Rugby star Ilona Maher eyes Bristol debut as ticket sales break club record	BRISTOL, England (AP) — Ticket sales have broken a record ahead of U.S. rugby star Ilona Maher making her debut for the Bristol Bears women's team. The Olympic bronze medalist won't be in the starting lineup, however, when the Bears face defending champion Gloucester-Hartpury on Sunday in a Premiership Women’s Rugby match switched from a smaller venue to Ashton Gate to satisfy demand for seats. Bristol's matchday lineup announced on Friday includes the 28-year-old Maher on the bench — the American only returned to England on New Year's Day. 'I don’t care if it’s freezing cold, come out and support some great rugby,' Maher wrote on Instagram before the lineup was released. Maher, who helped lead the U.S. to the bronze medal in rugby sevens at the Paris Games, signed a three-month contract that started this week. She had begun training with Bristol in December when the team announced the signing before going back to the United States for the holidays. The signing of Maher, the ' most followed rugby player on the planet,' immediately boosted Bristol's ticket sales. Close to 8,000 fans are expected Sunday, blowing away the previous attendance record for a Bristol women's home match of 4,101 against Harlequins in May 2022. Maher has more than 8 million followers combined on Instagram and TikTok. She was a runner-up on the 'Dancing With The Stars' TV show. The Vermont native is returning to the 15-a-side game in hopes of boosting her chances of making the U.S. team for the 2025 Rugby World Cup in England. She can play at wing or center. Bristol, currently in fifth place, lost to Gloucester-Hartpury 36-24 in last season's title match. A record crowd on Sunday will be a 'huge' help, Bears coach Dave Ward said. 'For the (players) to run out to that many people, I think it could be great,' he said. 'The noise, it could be creative and drive us forward when we're on the front foot and also on the back foot as well in terms of our defensive effort.' League-leading Harlequins said they set a women's club rugby record for attendance on Dec. 28 when 18,055 fans watched the team beat Leicester Tigers 42-17 at Twickenham Stadium. That was not a stand-alone match; it was part of a doubleheader with the Harlequins men's team. ___ AP rugby: https://apnews.com/hub/rugby	https://apnews.com/article/ilona-maher-rugby-bristol-1034280242b592ed2d5e35f58c282e4b	2025-01-03T03:37:33-08:00	
Trump's strength and unpredictability can help end the war with Russia, Ukraine's president says	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is 'strong and unpredictable,' and those qualities can be a decisive factor in his policy approach to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. However, Zelenskyy said it won’t be possible to end the almost three years of war in one day, as Trump claimed during his election campaign he could do. 'The ‘hot’ stage of the war can end quite quickly, if Trump is strong in his position,' Zelensky said in a Ukrainian television interview late Thursday, referring to fighting on the battlefield. 'I believe (Trump) is strong and unpredictable. I would very much like President Trump’s unpredictability to be directed primarily toward the Russian Federation,' Zelenskyy said. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, hasn’t publicly fleshed out his policy on Ukraine but his previous comments have put a question mark over whether the United States will continue to be Ukraine’s biggest — and most important — military backer. Zelenskyy is eager to guarantee that Washington’s support keeps coming, and he met with Trump in New York even before last November’s U.S. presidential election. With the war about to enter its fourth year next month, and with Trump coming to power, the question of how and when Europe’s biggest conflict since World War II might end has come to the fore. Russia controls about one-fifth of Ukraine and last year capitalized on weaknesses in Ukraine’s defenses to slowly advance in eastern areas despite high losses of troops and equipment. The war’s trajectory is not in Ukraine’s favor. The country is short-handed on the front line and needs continued support from its Western partners. Trump responded favorably to the possibility raised by French President Emmanuel Macron of Western peacekeepers being deployed in Ukraine to oversee an agreement that stops the fighting, Zelenskyy said. He met with Trump and Macron in Paris last month. 'But I raised an issue, saying we didn’t hear what specific countries will join this initiative, and whether the U.S. will be there,' Zelenskyy said. The Ukrainian leader is determined for his country to become a NATO member. The alliance’s 32 member countries say Ukraine will join one day, but not until the war ends. 'The deployment of European troops (to keep the peace in Ukraine) should not rule out Ukraine’s future in NATO,' Zelenskyy said in the television interview. Zelenskyy described the incursion by Ukrainian forces into Russia’s Kursk border region as a 'very strong trump card' in any future peace negotiations. In a bid to counter glum news from the front line, Ukraine seized part of Kursk last August in what was the first occupation of Russian territory since World War II. But the incursion didn’t significantly change the dynamic of the war, and military analysts say Ukraine has lost some 40% of the land it initially captured. Nevertheless, Zelenskyy said the achievement impressed countries in Asia, South America and Africa and tarnished Russia’s military reputation. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-trump-zelenskyy-a80e4d3498692218f40a42bc3718c7c9	2025-01-03T01:58:21-08:00	
At least 30 people killed by Israeli strikes in Gaza as stalled ceasefire talks set to resume	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — At least 30 people, including children, were killed in Gaza by Israeli strikes overnight and into Friday morning, hospital staff said, as sirens also sounded across Israel and stalled ceasefire talks were set to resume. Staff at the Al Aqsa Martyrs hospital said more than a dozen women and children were killed in strikes that hit various places in Central Gaza, including Nuseirat, Zawaida, Maghazi and Deir al Balah. Dozens of people were also killed across the enclave the previous day, bringing the total of people killed in the past 24 hours to 56. The Israeli army did not comment on the latest strikes. However, in a statement Friday, it said during the past day it had struck dozens of Hamas gathering points and command and control centers throughout Gaza, areas where Hamas had planned and executed attacks. The army said measures were taken to mitigate civilian harm, such as using precise munitions and aerial surveillance. Strikes Thursday hit Hamas security officers and an Israeli-declared humanitarian zone. Among those killed early Friday was Omar al-Derawi, a freelance journalist. Associated Press reporters saw friends and colleagues mourning over his body at the hospital, with a press vest laid on top of his shroud. Israelis also woke up to attacks early Friday morning. Israel said missiles were fired into the country from Yemen, which set off air raid sirens in Jerusalem and central Israel and sent people scrambling to shelters. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage, though a faint explosion, likely either from the missile or from interceptors, could be heard in Jerusalem. Israel's army said a missile was intercepted. As the attacks were underway, efforts at ceasefire negotiations were expected to resume Friday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said he had authorized a delegation from the Mossad intelligence agency, the Shin Bet internal security agency and the military to continue negotiations in Qatar. The delegation is leaving for Qatar on Friday. The U.S.-led talks have repeatedly stalled during 15 months of war, which was sparked by Hamas-led militants’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack into Israel. The militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third believed to be dead. Israel’s offensive in retaliation has killed over 45,500 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the territory's Health Ministry, which says women and children make up more than half the dead. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its tally. Israel's military says it only targets militants and blames Hamas for civilian deaths because its fighters operate in dense residential areas. The army says it has killed 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. The war has caused widespread destruction and displaced some 90% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million, many of them multiple times. —— Mednick reported from Jerusalem —— Follow AP coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-03-01-2025-1eb622d4d4dac17b9f10494107b9e136	2025-01-03T00:58:00-08:00	
South Korean fire fighters tackle blaze in commercial building in Seongnam	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Hundreds of people were rescued or evacuated after a fire broke out at a large commercial building in the South Korean city of Seongnam on Friday, fire officials said. More than 260 firefighters and 80 vehicles were deployed to the scene of the blaze, which was extinguished about an hour and a half after it was first reported at around 4:30 p.m., according to the Gyeonggi provincial fire department. The department said emergency workers have so far rescued 240 people, while another 70 managed to exit the eight-story building unaided. About 28 people sustained light injuries, including smoke inhalation, but there were no reports of serious injuries. The department said emergency workers were still searching the site to ensure no one was trapped inside. The department said the fire started at a restaurant on the first floor.

Come home, Ghana told the African diaspora. Now some Black Americans take its citizenship	ACCRA, Ghana (AP) — Flipping through a family album, Keachia Bowers paused on a photo of her as a baby on her father’s lap as he held the 1978 album 'Africa Stand Alone' by the Jamaican reggae band Culture. 'When I was 10 years old, I was supposed to come to Ghana with him,' she said. A day earlier, she had marked 10 years since her father’s death. Though he was a Pan-Africanist who dreamed of visiting Ghana, he never made it here. Bowers and her husband, Damon Smith, however, are among the 524 diaspora members, mostly Black Americans, who were granted Ghanaian citizenship in a ceremony in November. Bowers and Smith moved to Ghana from Florida in 2023 after visiting the region several times between them since the ’90s. They now run a tour business that caters to Black people who want to visit Ghana or elsewhere in West Africa, or like them have come to consider a permanent move. The November group was the largest one granted citizenship since Ghana launched the 'Year of the Return' program, aimed at attracting the Black diaspora, in 2019. It marked 400 years since the first African slaves arrived in Virginia in 1619. Ghana’s Tourism Authority and the Office of Diaspora Affairs have extended the program into 'Beyond the Return,' which fosters the relationship with diasporans. Hundreds have been granted citizenship, including people from Canada, the U.K. and Jamaica. Bowers said moving to Ghana gave her family a certain feeling of ease they didn’t have in the U.S. 'When we see Trayvon Martin, Sandra Bland, all these stories of people being murdered just in their home, living in their home and being murdered at the hands of police brutality, hearing about it creates trauma,' she said. She also worried about her son Tsadik, 14. Tsadik towers over loved ones in the way that lanky teenage boys often do. He is shy but opens up around his younger sister Tselah, 11, and the family’s dog, Apollo. 'In America, being a Black male with locs who’s very tall for his age, he is treated like a threat,' Bowers said. Americans face few obstacles to living in Ghana, with most people paying an annual residency fee. But Bowers said getting citizenship signified more than simply living in Ghana. 'I didn’t need (citizenship) to tell me that I’m African. Anywhere that I go in the world and someone looks at me, I’m melanated,' she said. 'But my ancestors who wanted to return and come back home, those ancestors who never made it back,' she said, 'that passport, for me, is for them.' Between 10 to 15 million people were forcibly taken from Africa to the Americas during the trans-Atlantic slave trade, the majority from West and Central Africa. Ghana, then a British colony known as the Gold Coast, was a main point of departure. As memorials to the slave trade become tourist destinations across West Africa, painful reminders of its brutality are easily accessible. From Ghana to Senegal to Benin, one can visit variations of the 'Door of No Return,' haunting doorways that open to the Atlantic Ocean where slaves left Africa, and their families, for the last time. The joy that people feel in finding connections that were broken long ago is palpable. Videos of the recent citizenship ceremony show men and women of all ages waving Ghanaian flags and cheering. Deijha Gordon, 33, was one of them. 'I first visited Ghana in 2015. From then on, I knew this is a place that I wanted to be and a place where I wanted to show other diasporans, African-Americans, that we have a place where we belong,' she said. She moved from Brooklyn to Ghana in 2019 and opened a food truck, Deijha Vu’s Jerk Hut, selling Jamaican food. Between bagging to-go orders and speaking to a Black American tourist couple, she explained how she built the business from scratch. Gordon was giddy while recalling the moment she got citizenship. 'It just feels good to have a connection to an African country as an African-American, as a Black American. Because back in America we don’t have anything to trace our roots to but Africa. To have that connection here, I feel like I’ve done something right,' she said. Like Bowers, Gordon has had a stream of people reaching out and asking about the citizenship process. The path is not clearly defined. Citizenship must come from a concession from Ghana's presidency, a process made legal under the 2000 Citizenship Act. It's granted to those residing in Ghana who have told the Office of Diaspora Affairs that they are interested in citizenship. Ghana's government in part describes the program as a benefit to the economy and focuses on investment opportunities for those wishing to relocate. Festus Owooson with the local nonprofit Migration Advocacy Center said that though the government emphasizes the economic angle, the real benefits of citizenship are intangible. 'I don’t think (recipients) were crying because they have landed a gold mine, or they’ve found oil or some kind of business opportunity. But it’s something so relieving, which you cannot put value or a price on,' he said. President Nana Akufo-Addo’s administration, which launched the 'Year of the Return,' is on its way out. Ghana’s main opposition party won the presidential election on Dec. 7. But Owooson said Black Americans and other diaspora citizens are likely to continue receiving citizenship by presidential concession. Citizenship also can pass to the next generation. The children of Bowers and Smith received it automatically after their parents' ceremony. Bowers’ father, like her husband and children, was a follower of the Rastafari faith. 'Part of the Rastafarian tradition is to repatriate. We see repatriation as the ultimate experience that you can have on this earth,' she said. She believes that her father is proud of her. 'I really feel like he’s smiling, where he is. He wanted to experience this for himself, so he’s experiencing it through me.' ___ The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

Middle East latest: German and French foreign ministers seek 'new beginning' with Syria	The German and French foreign ministers are heading to Damascus to send what the German minister said is a clear signal that a 'political new beginning' between Europe and Syria is possible. Germany’s Annalena Baerbock and France’s Jean-Noel Barrot are expected to meet the leader of the group that toppled Bashar Assad, Ahmad al-Sharaa, and representatives of Syrian civil society on Friday. Baerbock said there can be a 'new beginning' only if the new Syrian society gives all people, regardless of ethnic or religious group, 'a place in the political process' as well as rights and protection. In Gaza, Israeli airstrikes on Thursday and Friday killed at least 50 people, including an attack on a sprawling tent camp that Israel has repeatedly bombed despite designating it a humanitarian safe zone. Israel said the strike targeted a high-ranking police officer, and blames Hamas for civilian deaths. Israel’s war in Gaza has killed over 45,500 Palestinians, according to local health officials, who say women and children make up more than half the fatalities. The officials do not distinguish between civilians and combatants in their tally. The war was sparked by Hamas-led militants' Oct. 7, 2023, attack in Israel. They killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250 that day. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. ___ Here's the latest: French foreign minister visits long-shuttered French Embassy in Syria DAMASCUS — French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot visited the long-shuttered French Embassy in Damascus on Friday as part of the first visit to Syria by top diplomats from European Union countries following the overthrow of President Bashar Assad by opposition rebels. Barrot and German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock are expected to meet with Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, the leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the Islamist former insurgent group that is now the de facto ruling party in Syria. 'It was with great emotion that I am today at the site of the French Embassy in Damascus,' Barrot said as he inspected the damage that has occurred at the embassy during 13 years of closure. 'A little less than a month ago, new hope was born thanks to the mobilization of Syrians, the hope of a sovereign, stable and peaceful Syria,' he said. 'It is a real hope, but it is a fragile hope.' Barrot earlier visited the Christian neighborhood of Bab Touma and met with Patriarch John Yaziji. Since Assad’s fall, Damascus has experienced a flurry of visits from Arab and Western countries that had cut off relations with Assad’s government during the country’s nearly 14-year civil war. Death toll rises after more airstrikes on Gaza DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip - At least 30 people, including children, were killed in Gaza by strikes overnight, hospital staff said Friday. Staff at the Al Aqsa Martyrs hospital said 10 women and seven children were among those killed in strikes on various locations in Central Gaza, including Nuseirat, Zawaida, Maghazi and Deir al Balah. The strikes come a day after dozens of people were killed across the enclave, bringing the total of fatalities since Thursday to 56. The strikes on Thursday hit Hamas security officers and an Israeli-declared humanitarian zone. The Israeli army, which did not immediately comment on the strikes, says it only targets militants and blames Hamas for civilian deaths. French and German foreign ministers visit Syria to show a ‘new beginning’ is possible between Europe and Syria DAMASCUS — The foreign ministers of France and Germany are headed to Damascus on the first official visit to Syria by top diplomats from European Union countries after the fall of former President Bashar Assad, in what the German minister said is a clear signal that a 'new beginning' between Europe and Syria is possible. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot, who began the visit Friday with a meeting with Christian religious leaders in Damascus, said in a statement on the social media platform X that the two countries 'want to promote a peaceful and urgent transition in the service of Syrians and for regional stability.' He and German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock are expected to meet with Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, the leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, the Islamist former insurgent group that is now the de facto ruling party in Syria. Baerbock said there can be a 'political new beginning between Europe and Syria' only if the new Syrian society gives all people, regardless of ethnic or religious group, 'a place in the political process' as well as rights and protection. She said those rights should not be undermined by an overly long transition to elections or by 'steps toward the Islamification of the justice or education system,' that there should be no acts of revenge against entire groups of the population, and that extremism should have no place. Since Assad’s ouster in a lightning offensive by opposition forces, Damascus has experienced a flurry of visits from Arab and Western countries that had cut off relations with Assad’s government during the country’s nearly 14-year civil war. However, Western countries have so far not lifted sanctions placed on Syria under Assad or removed the designation of HTS as a terrorist group, although the United States lifted a $10 million bounty it had previously placed on al-Sharaa. Israel says missile fired from Yemen set off air raid sirens in Jerusalem and central Israel JERUSALEM — The Israeli military says a missile fired from Yemen has set off air raid sirens in Jerusalem and central Israel. The attack early Friday woke millions of people and sent people scrambling to air raid shelters. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage, though a faint explosion, likely either from the missile or from interceptors, could be heard in Jerusalem. The Israeli Defense Forces later reported that a missile launched from Yemen into Israeli territory was intercepted. A report was received regarding shrapnel from the interception that fell in the area of Modi’in in central Israel. The details are under review. Israel has carried out a number of long-range airstrikes in Yemen, some 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles) away. But the strikes have failed to stop the attacks. The Houthis have pledged to continue striking Israel until the war in Gaza ends. A wave of Israeli strikes kills at least 24 people in Gaza DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Israeli strikes in the Maghazi and Nuseirat refugee camps in central Gaza killed at least 24 people late Thursday and early Friday. They were taken to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, bringing the day's death toll to at least 50 people. The Israeli army did not immediately comment on the strikes, but says it only targets militants and blames Hamas for civilian deaths. Earlier Israeli strikes killed dozens more people throughout central and southern Gaza, including inside a sprawling tent camp that Israel designated a humanitarian safe zone but has repeatedly targeted. Israel's military said that strike killed a high-ranking police officer who was involved in gathering intelligence used by Hamas’ armed wing in attacks on Israeli forces. WHO says Israel must let more sick and wounded people leave Gaza GENEVA — The head of the U.N. World Health Organization says Israel is still allowing only a trickle of sick and wounded people in the Gaza Strip to travel abroad for life-saving medical treatment. At least 5,383 patients have been evacuated with the WHO's help since the war broke out in October 2023, leaving more than 12,000 Palestinians still waiting to leave Gaza, WHO director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement Thursday. The rate of evacuations plunged when the Rafah border crossing shut down in May after Israeli troops took it over — since then, only 436 patients have left Gaza, Tedros said. 'At this rate, it would take 5-10 years to evacuate all these critically ill patients, including thousands of children,' Tedros said. 'In the meantime, their conditions get worse and some die.' He urged Israel to increase the approval rate for medical evacuations, including no denials of child patients, and to allow all possible corridors and border crossings to be used. Israel controls all the entry and exit points for Gaza. COGAT, the Israeli military agency in charge of humanitarian affairs for Palestinians, has said it does everything it can to approve medical evacuations, which are contingent upon a security check. It did not respond when asked for comment on the latest WHO figures.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-syria-lebanon-news-01-03-2025-42c6306a579dba0ea4f94bd29fe09760	2025-01-02T22:13:47-08:00	
Israel struggles to deter escalating attacks from Yemen's Houthi rebels as other fronts calm	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — The rockets from Gaza have mostly fallen silent. A ceasefire with Hezbollah militants in Lebanon has taken hold. But repeated fire from Yemen’s Houthi rebels, a faraway foe, is proving a stubborn threat for Israel. The Iran-backed Houthis are stepping up their missile attacks, sending hundreds of thousands of Israelis scrambling for shelter in the middle of the night, scaring away foreign airlines and keeping up what could be the last major front in the Middle East wars. 'It's like musical chairs,' said Yoni Yovel, 31, who left the northern Israeli city of Haifa late last year to avoid rocket fire from Hezbollah only to see his apartment in Tel Aviv’s Jaffa neighborhood heavily damaged by a Houthi missile. Israel has repeatedly bombarded ports, oil infrastructure and the airport in the Houthi-held capital Sanaa, some 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles) away. Israeli leaders have threatened to kill central Houthi figures and have tried to galvanize the world against the threat. But the Houthis persist. In recent weeks, missiles and drones from Yemen have struck nearly every day, including early Friday morning, setting off air raid sirens in broad swaths of Israel. In some cases, the projectiles have penetrated Israel’s sophisticated aerial defense system, most recently toppling an empty school and shattering the windows of apartments near an empty playground where one missile landed. Because most missiles are intercepted and because the fire is usually a single missile at a time, the strikes have not caused major physical damage, although a few attacks have been fatal during the 15-month war in Gaza as the Houthis attack in solidarity with Hamas. But the rocket fire is posing a threat to Israel’s economy, keeping many foreign airlines away and preventing the country from jump-starting its hard-hit tourism industry. Houthi attacks on shipping in the Red Sea have all but shuttered an Israeli port in the city of Eilat and have prompted ships destined for it to take a longer, more costly route around Africa to Israel's Mediterranean ports. The Houthi strikes are also a symbolic reminder for Israel of the Iran-backed enemies that encircle it, known as the 'Axis of Resistance,' and the last major holdout. And because Israel’s counterstrikes have yet to deter the Houthis, their persistent attacks defy Israel’s image as a regional military powerhouse. 'They are the only ones who are active now,' said Danny Citrinowicz, a research fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies, a Tel Aviv think tank. The Houthis, he said, 'are a challenge of a different kind.' Shortly after Hamas launched its attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, the Houthis began striking Israel-linked ships in the strategic Bab el-Mandeb Strait along Yemen’s coast. Those attacks expanded to include other ships with no ties to Israel, disrupting cargo and energy shipments that are critical for worldwide trade. The Houthis said it was part of their campaign aimed at pressuring Israel and the West over the war in Gaza. In response, U.S. and partner forces have launched multiple rounds of coordinated airstrikes against Houthi launch sites and weapons storage sites. Throughout the war, the Houthis have also been firing missiles and drones at Israel, at first focusing on Eilat and eventually broadening attacks to include major population centers and the seaside metropolis of Tel Aviv. The launches have intensified in recent weeks. 'There was thunder the other night and my daughter thought it was a missile. She woke up and started screaming,' said Ibrahim Sosa, 53, whose home in Jaffa is near the site of a recent missile landing. Israel has retaliated repeatedly and vowed to escalate if the attacks don't stop. 'We will hunt down all of the Houthis' leaders and we will strike them just as we have done in other places,' said Defense Minister Israel Katz, shortly after Israeli jets struck Yemen last week. The Israeli strikes have been deadly, with several people killed. Israeli military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari told The Associated Press that Israel’s strikes focused on 'military infrastructure which was used and directly contributed to Houthi terror activities, including to smuggle arms and finance their terror activities.' Hagari acknowledged the battle would be complex. And despite massive Israeli air power, the Houthis have continued their assaults. That stands in contrast to Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran — three other enemies Israel has largely neutralized over the past 15 months. 'Israel has many years of familiarity with those enemies. There is intelligence and there is the important element of a ground maneuver, and in Yemen we can't do that. The scale here is different,' said Eyal Pinko, a former Israeli defense official and senior research fellow at the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies, an Israeli think tank. Yemen does not border Israel, and Israel cannot easily stage a ground invasion as it has in Gaza and Lebanon to dismantle enemies’ infrastructure. Israel has to orchestrate complex air missions to fly to Yemen, which are costly and limited in what they can achieve. Pinko also said the Houthis have learned over years of fighting against a Saudi-led coalition how to bounce back from airstrikes. While the Houthis have been active as an insurgent force for years, Israel hasn’t seen them as a priority or invested as much in gathering intelligence against them. Against Hamas, yearslong intelligence helped target and erode the group's forces. With Hezbollah, Israel penetrated deep into the organization, allowing it to unleash an offensive last year that detonated the pagers of rank-and-file members and decimated its senior ranks in secret bunkers. In Iran, Israel struck Hamas’ top leader in an apartment in Tehran and knocked out many of its air defenses in an October strike that left parts of the capital exposed. But the Houthis' hideouts, weapons and infrastructure are less known to Israel, making its counterstrikes somewhat less effective. Hagari recognized that Israel’s intelligence in Yemen was 'an issue' and said the military was working to improve. Until then, some in Israel are steeling themselves for a war of attrition with the distant enemy. 'There's no quick fix,' Citrinowicz said. 'Even if the war in Gaza ends, this is a threat that will not disappear.'	https://apnews.com/article/israel-houthis-yemen-gaza-war-1435d3ac2f16e2faed608fdb5a100e71	2025-01-02T22:01:09-08:00	
New Orleans inches toward normalcy while mourning victims of deadly New Year’s rampage	NEW ORLEANS (AP) — A mix of law enforcement, street performers and football fans has filled New Orleans’ blocks as the city inches back to normalcy while mourning victims of the deadly New Year's rampage in which an Army veteran plowed a truck into revelers. The attack along Bourbon Street killed 14 people, along with the driver, Shamsud-Din Jabbar, who officials said was inspired by the Islamic State militant group. Jabbar was fatally shot in a firefight with police after steering his speeding truck around a barricade and plowing into the crowd. About 30 people were injured. Authorities finished processing the scene Thursday morning, removing the last of the bodies. Bourbon Street — famous worldwide for music, open-air drinking and festive vibes — reopened for business by early afternoon. On the same block where the attack took place, trombone player and lifelong New Orleanian Jonas Green said it was important for his band to be out there the day after the violence. 'I know with this music, it heals, it transforms the feelings that we’re going through into something better,' Green said. 'Got to keep on going.' The Sugar Bowl college football game between Notre Dame and Georgia, which was postponed by a day in the interest of national security, was played Thursday evening. The Joan of Arc parade in the French Quarter is still scheduled to take place Monday to kick off carnival season ahead of Mardi Gras, said Antoinette de Alteriis, one of the organizers. She said they expect close to its typical crowd of around 30,000 participants The FBI has continued to hunt for clues about Jabbar but, a day into its investigation, the agency said it was confident he was not aided by anyone else in the attack, which killed an 18-year-old aspiring nurse, a single mother, a father of two and a former Princeton University football star, among others. The FBI said that hours before the attack, Jabbar, a 42-year-old American citizen from Texas, posted five videos on his Facebook account in which he proclaimed his support for the Islamic State group and previewed the violence that he would soon unleash in the famed French Quarter district. It was the deadliest IS-inspired assault on U.S. soil in years, laying bare what federal officials have warned is a resurgent international terrorism threat. It also comes as the FBI and other agencies brace for dramatic leadership upheaval, and likely policy changes, after President-elect Donald Trump’s administration takes office. Christopher Raia, the deputy assistant director of the FBI’s counterterrorism division, stressed there was no indication of a connection between the New Orleans attack and the explosion Wednesday of a Tesla Cybertruck filled with explosives outside Trump’s Las Vegas hotel. The New Orleans attack plans also included the placement of crude bombs in the neighborhood in an apparent attempt to cause more carnage, officials said. Two improvised explosive devices left in coolers several blocks apart were rendered safe at the scene. Other devices were determined to be nonfunctional. Investigators also were trying to understand more about Jabbar's path to radicalization, which they say culminated with him picking up a rented truck in Houston on Dec. 30 and driving it to New Orleans the following night. The FBI recovered a black IS flag from Jabbar's rented pickup and reviewed five videos posted to Facebook, including one in which he said he originally planned to harm his family and friends but was concerned news headlines would not focus on the 'war between the believers and the disbelievers,' Raia said. Jabbar also stated he joined IS before last summer and provided a last will and testament, the FBI said. Jabbar joined the Army in 2007, serving on active duty in human resources and information technology and deploying to Afghanistan from 2009 to 2010, the service said. He transferred to the Army Reserve in 2015 and left in 2020 with the rank of staff sergeant. A U.S. government official, speaking on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to speak publicly, said Jabbar traveled to Egypt in 2023, staying in Cairo for a week, before returning to the U.S. and then traveling to Toronto for three days. It was not immediately clear what he did during those travels. Abdur-Rahim Jabbar, Jabbar's younger brother, told The Associated Press on Thursday it 'doesn’t feel real' that his brother could have done this. 'I never would have thought it’d be him,' he said. 'It’s completely unlike him.' He said his brother had been isolated in the last few years but also had been in touch with him recently and did not see any signs of radicalization. On Bourbon Street, flowers and candles were arranged as memorials to the victims, while yellow posts were set up on the surrounding blocks. By Thursday night, bouncers danced to music blasting from clubs, tourists posed for photos and a group of street performers preparing to flip over a line of people had no trouble attracting a massive audience. Mark Tabor, the manager of a Willie’s Chicken Shack on Bourbon Street, said it was strange to feel the disconnect between the normal hustle of the French Quarter outside and the violence he had witnessed less than 48 hours earlier. 'I’m glad they cleaned up the streets, but it’s like everything’s forgotten,' he said. 'It’s sad.' ___ Tucker reported from Washington, and Mustian reported from Black Mountain, North Carolina.

Stock market today: Asian stocks gain after Wall Street opens 2025 with modest losses	Asian markets rose on Friday after U.S. stock indexes slipped as Wall Street’s weak end to last year carried into 2025. U.S. futures and oil prices rose. Japan's market is closed for the New Year holiday. The dollar remained steady on Friday, trading at 157.29 Japanese yen, down from 157.51 yen. In early December, it had been hovering around 150 yen. Hong Kong stocks rallied from Thursday's slump amid worries that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump might raise tariffs from China and other Asian countries once he takes office this month. The Hang Seng added 1% to 19,814.78, while the Shanghai Composite index dropped 0.4% to 3,249.04. China has placed 28 U.S. entities, including General Dynamics, on its export control list to 'safeguard national security and interests,' according to a statement from the Commerce Ministry on Thursday. The ministry also announced it was adding export restrictions on specific technologies used in manufacturing battery components and processing critical minerals such as lithium and gallium. The Kospi jumped 1.9% to 2,445.06, with the giant SK Hynix Inc. up 5.6% and Samsung Electronics Co. rose 2%. As the political crisis in South Korea entered a new phase, investigators arrived at the presidential residence with a warrant to detain impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol. Australia’s S&amp;P/ASX 200 climbed 0.6% to 8,252.00. On Thursday, the S&amp;P 500 fell 0.2% to 5,868.55, extending the four-day losing streak that dimmed the close of its stellar 2024. The index pinballed through the day between an early gain of 0.9% and a later loss of 0.9% before locking in its longest losing streak since April. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4% to 43,392.27, after an early gain of 360 points disappeared, and the Nasdaq composite lost 0.2% to 19,280.79. Tesla helped drag the market lower after disclosing it delivered fewer vehicles in the last three months of 2024 than analysts expected. The electric-vehicle company’s stock slumped 6.1%. Tesla was one of the big winners of 2024, particularly after Donald Trump’s Election Day victory raised speculation that Elon Musk’s close relationship with the president-elect could help the company. But critics have been warning that prices all across the stock market have run too high, too quickly and are at risk of a pullback. Constellation Energy jumped 8.4% for the one of the biggest gains in the S&amp;P 500 after announcing it won more than $1 billion in combined contracts with the U.S. General Services Administration to supply power and perform energy savings and conservation measures. Some Big Tech stocks also helped limit the market’s losses. Nvidia, whose chips are powering the world’s move into artificial-intelligence technology, rose 3% after following up its nearly 240% surge in 2023 with a better than 170% jump last year. Some investors and analysts are counting on the AI rush to continue, even though critics say it’s made stock prices too expensive. As the calendar flips to a new year, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives says it’s the 'same tech playbook in year 3 of this tech AI driven bull market,' for example. Some pages of the playbook do seem to be changing. Investors have ratcheted back expectations for how many cuts to interest rates the Federal Reserve may deliver in 2025, for example. Inflation has remained stubbornly above the Fed’s 2% target, and Trump’s pushing for tariffs and other policies has raised worries about potentially more upward pressure on prices that U.S. consumers have to pay. That drove the Fed to say recently it will likely deliver fewer of the economy-juicing cuts to interest rates in 2025 than it had earlier thought.

South Korea's impeached president defies warrant in hourslong standoff	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korean investigators spent hours waiting outside the official residence of impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol as the presidential security service blocked them from executing a warrant to detain him, in the latest confrontation of a political crisis that has paralyzed South Korean politics and seen two heads of state impeached in under a month. Yoon, a former prosecutor, has defied investigators' attempts to question him for weeks. The last time he is known to have left the residence was on Dec. 12, when he went to the nearby presidential office to make a televised statement to the nation, making a defiant statement that he will fight efforts to oust him. Investigators from the country's anti-corruption agency are weighing charges of rebellion after Yoon, apparently frustrated that his policies were blocked by an opposition-dominated parliament, declared martial law on Dec. 3 and dispatched troops to surround the National Assembly. Parliament overturned the declaration within hours in an unanimous vote and impeached Yoon on Dec. 14, accusing him of rebellion, while South Korean anti-corruption authorities and public prosecutors opened separate investigations into the events. A Seoul court issued a warrant for Yoon’s detention on Tuesday, but enforcing it is complicated as long as he remains in his official residence. Yoon's lawyers, who filed a challenge to the warrant on Thursday, say it cannot be enforced at his residence due to a law that protects locations potentially linked to military secrets from search without the consent of the person in charge. The warrant is valid for one week. They've also argued that the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials, which is leading a joint investigation with police and military investigators, lacks the authority to investigate rebellion charges. They said that police officers don't have the legal authority to assist in detaining Yoon, and could face arrest by either the 'presidential security service or any citizens.' They didn’t elaborate further on the claim. If investigators manage to detain Yoon, they will likely ask a court for permission to make a formal arrest. Otherwise, he will be released after 48 hours. Thousands of police officers gathered at Yoon’s residence on Friday, forming a perimeter around a growing group of pro-Yoon protesters who braved subfreezing temperatures for hours, waving South Korean and American flags while chanting slogans in his support. There were no immediate reports of major clashes outside the residence. Nearly five hours after dozens of investigators and police officers were seen entering the gate of the residence in Seoul to execute a warrant for Yoon’s detention, the dramatic scene appeared to have developed into a standoff. Two of Yoon’s lawyers, Yoon Kap-keun and Kim Hong-il, were seen entering the gate of the presidential residence around noon. Seok Dong-hyeon, one of several lawyers on Yoon’s legal team, confirmed that the investigators arrived at the building but said it was unlikely that they would be able to detain the president on Friday. He said the agency’s efforts to detain Yoon were 'reckless' and showed an 'outrageous discard for law.' The anti-corruption agency didn’t immediately reply to questions about whether investigators successfully entered Yoon’s residential building, but South Korea’s YTN television reported scuffles as investigators and police confronted the presidential security forces. South Korea’s Defense Ministry confirmed that the investigators and police officers got past a military unit guarding the residence’s grounds before arriving at the building. The presidential security service, which controls the residence itself, refused to comment on whether its members were confronting investigators and whether they planned to block the detention attempt. The liberal opposition Democratic Party called on the country’s acting leader, Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok, to order the presidential security service to stand down. Choi didn’t immediately comment on the situation. 'Do not drag the upright staff of the presidential security service and other public officials into the depths of crime,' said Jo Seung-lae, a Democratic lawmaker. Choi must 'remember that swiftly addressing the rebellion and preventing further chaos is your responsibility,' Jo said. Yoon’s defense minister, police chief and several top military commanders have already been arrested over their roles in the period of martial law. Yoon’s presidential powers have been suspended since the National Assembly voted to impeach him on Dec. 14. Yoon’s fate now lies with the Constitutional Court, which has begun deliberations on whether to uphold the impeachment and formally remove Yoon from office or reinstate him. At least six justices on the nine-member Constitutional Court must vote in favor to remove him from office. The National Assembly voted last week to impeach Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, who became acting president after Yoon’s powers were suspended, over his reluctance to fill three Constitutional Court vacancies ahead of the court’s review of Yoon’s case. Facing growing pressure, the new acting president, Choi, appointed two new justices on Tuesday, which could increase the chances of the court upholding Yoon’s impeachment.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-yoon-martial-law-impeachment-detention-c8dc1758647979455dbf0d56e70369a4	2025-01-02T18:51:55-08:00

A missing surfer in Australia is believed dead in a shark attack, police say	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — A surfer missing in Australia is believed to have died in a shark attack, authorities said Friday, as they searched the waters where the man disappeared. The 28-year-old was in the sea at a popular surf beach in South Australia where another man was killed by a white shark in 2023. A witness who saw the shark attack on Thursday evening at Granites Beach, near the coastal town of Streaky Bay, rode into the sea on a jet ski and retrieved the man’s surfboard, Senior Constable Rebecca Stokes told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. 'But there was just no sign of this young man, there’s just been no sign of him,' Stokes told the ABC. 'From witnesses’ descriptions we’re pretty confident that sadly he’s been killed by this shark.' The beach was known to be frequented by sharks, Stokes said. She did not specify what species of shark was believed to be involved. Emergency responders and volunteers were searching offshore on Friday for the local man and the beach was closed to the public. Police were preparing a coroner’s report, a statement said. Shark attacks in Australia are rare, with 255 fatal bites recorded since 1791 in the country of 27 million people, according to the Australian Shark Incident Database. But the state of South Australia has registered more episodes in the past two years than usual. There were five shark attacks of the state’s coast in 2023, three of them fatal and one at the same beach as Thursday’s incident. Scientists at the time said they did not know the reason for the cluster. There was one non-fatal shark bite off South Australia’s coast in 2024.	https://apnews.com/article/shark-attack-south-australia-surfer-granites-beach-5717972ccb78bab84a9949d41ef6ab27	2025-01-02T15:38:06-08:00	
Jill Biden gets the priciest gift from a foreign leader in 2023 — a $20,000 diamond	WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden and his family were given tens of thousands of dollars in gifts from foreign leaders in 2023, according to an annual accounting published by the State Department on Thursday, with first lady Jill Biden receiving the single most expensive present: a $20,000 diamond from India’s leader. The 7.5-carat diamond from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was easily the most costly gift presented to any member of the first family in 2023, although she also received a brooch valued at $14,063 from the Ukrainian ambassador to the United States and a bracelet, brooch and photograph album worth $4,510 from the president and first lady of Egypt. The U.S. president himself received a number of expensive presents, including a commemorative photo album valued at $7,100 from South Korea’s recently impeached President Suk Yeol Yoon, a $3,495 statue of Mongolian warriors from the Mongolian prime minister, a $3,300 silver bowl from the sultan of Brunei, a $3,160 sterling silver tray from the president of Israel, and a collage worth $2,400 from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Federal law requires executive branch officials to declare gifts they receive from foreign leaders and counterparts that have an estimated value of more than $480. Many of the gifts that meet that threshold are relatively modest, and the more expensive ones are typically — but not always — transferred to the National Archives or put on official displays. The $20,000 diamond was retained for official use in the White House East Wing, according to a State Department document, while the other gifts to the president and first lady were sent to the archives. Vanessa Valdivia, a spokesperson for Jill Biden, said the diamond will be turned over to the archives after they leave office. She did not say what it was being used for. Recipients also have the option to purchase the gift from the U.S. government at its market value, although that is rare, particularly with high-end items. According to the State Department’s Office of Protocol, which compiles the list that will be published in Friday’s edition of the Federal Register, several employees of the CIA reported receiving lavish gifts of watches, perfume and jewelry, nearly all of which were destroyed. Of the gifts destroyed, they were worth more than $132,000 combined. CIA Director William Burns received a $18,000 astrograph, which is a telescope and astrological camera, from an foreign source whose identity is classified. That is being transferred to the General Services Administration. But Burns reported receiving and destroying an $11,000 Omega watch, while numerous others did the same with luxury timepieces. Below the rank of director, the CIA employees who reported gifts are not identified, but one of them logged an Omega Seamaster Aqua Terra watch, a ladies Omega Constellation watch, a diamond necklace, earring bracelet, and a ring that were valued together at $65,100. All of those were destroyed, according to the report, as was a $30,000 women’s jewelry set from the Libyan jeweler Al Grew consisting of a necklace, bracelet, ring and earrings received by another CIA employee. Another CIA employee reported receiving a men’s Yacht Master II Rolex Oyster Perpetual watch worth $18,700, another reported getting a lady’s Rolex Oyster Datejust watch valued at $12,500, and one other got a $7,450 Rolex Air King watch. All three of the watches were destroyed, according to the list. Another employee reported receiving a collection of pricey Amouage Perfume worth $10,670, the destruction of which is pending, the report says. ___ AP reporter Darlene Superville in Washington contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/biden-gifts-foreign-leaders-diamond-45517bc782000329a1ae75e181f9c2ce	2025-01-02T11:25:00-08:00	
Europol dismantles network of illegal streaming of sports and other pirated content	MADRID (AP) — A Europol operation during last summer's European Championship and Paris Olympics dismantled a network of several hundred providers of illegal streaming of sports and other pirated content, Spain's top soccer league said Thursday. The European Union's law enforcement agency identified more than 560 resellers of pirated content that included streaming of movies, series and TV channels. La Liga, which cooperated in the investigation, said more than 100 suspects were identified and 11 were arrested. 'The operation was carried out in the context of major sporting events this summer such as UEFA EURO 2024 and the Olympic Games, with the main objective of combating digital piracy in the form of the publication, distribution and broadcasting of digital content subject to copyright and related rights,' the league said. More than 100 searches took place, with the seizure of nearly 30 servers and 270 IPTV devices, as well as 100 domains linked to illegal activities. Drugs and weapons were also seized, and cryptocurrency worth about 1.6 million euros ($1.64 million) was confiscated, along with 40,000 euros in cash. The network distributed more than 2,500 TV channels and reached over 22 million users worldwide without the consent of the copyright holders, the Spanish league said. The operation involved 15 countries, including Bulgaria, Croatia, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Romania, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK. 'Operation Kratos,' took place from June to September and brought together law enforcement authorities from EU and non-EU members, as well as EU agencies and private digital content companies. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer	https://apnews.com/article/spanish-league-piracy-europol-f8024734ba5987ec17e9235b8df1ec2b	2025-01-02T09:44:01-08:00	
AP PHOTOS: Syria's new security forces conduct sweeps in Homs, looking for ousted Assad's loyalists	HOMS, Syria (AP) — Syria's new security forces deployed in tanks on Thursday in the city of Homs to search for militia members and former soldiers loyal to ousted President Bashar Assad who have refused to surrender their weapons. Over 100 people were detained. The armed fighters with the Islamist group that led Assad's ouster and now controls much of Syria, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, conducted searches in alleyways and entered homes. They said they were working in coordination with the interim Interior Ministry. The HTS fighters seized weapons and destroyed certificates linked to the Baath party, Assad’s former ruling faction. Outside, men lined up against walls for identity checks. The HTS fighters, some partially covering their faces, detained suspected Assad loyalists and loaded them onto trucks. Some residents, including children, cheered for the fighters and chanted 'God is great.' Syria’s state news agency, SANA, citing a military official, said the HTS-led authorities had established centers in Homs, Syria’s third-largest city, to allow former soldiers and militia members to surrender their weapons. This voluntary surrender and handover of weapons has occurred in other parts of the country since Assad fled to Russia in early December. Since then, Syria's new security forces save arrested officials who under Assad worked with his notorious web of intelligence and security branches. 'We received information from the residents that there are members of former regime militias here who refused to give up their weapons and were terrorizing the residents,' said Abu Muhammad, an official with the General Security Department who did not give his full name in accordance with regulations. 'Following the instructions of the leadership and the military operations administration, we followed the members, arrested them and transferred them to the relevant departments,' he said. It was not immediately clear what would happen to those arrested next. A resident of the Wadi Al-Dahab neighborhood, Nael Al-Asaad, said the HTS fighters inspected his legally licensed hunting rifles 'and returned the rifles with full respect.' ___ Associated Press writer Sally Abou AlJoud in Beirut contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-hts-homs-assad-loyalists-baath-6e914c11dc4d9e0203b210605c49935d	2025-01-02T09:25:35-08:00	
A data company has figured out which airlines fly on time most often	Mexican airline Aeromexico had the world's best record for on-time arrivals in 2024, according to an annual ranking released Thursday. Delta Air Lines scored the highest among U.S. carriers despite a computer outage that caused thousands of flight cancellations in July. Aviation-data provider Cirium said in a report that nearly 87% of Aeromexico flights arrived within 15 minutes of their scheduled arrival, a widely used measure of on-time performance among airlines. Saudia, the flagship carrier of Saudi Arabia, ranked second worldwide, with an on-time performance rate of just over 86%, according to Cirium. Cirium has rated airlines for timeliness for 16 years. CEO Jeremy Bowen said 2024 was a difficult year for airlines due to severe weather patterns and the summer technology outage. The winning airlines therefore deserved credit for getting most passengers to their destinations on time, Bowen said. Atlanta-based Delta achieved an on-time rate of more than 83%, good enough to rank third worldwide. The next-best U.S. carriers were United Airlines, at nearly 81%, and Alaska Airlines, at just over 79%, Cirium said. Canada’s WestJet, Air Canada and Denver-based budget airline Frontier finished at the bottom of the pack among U.S. and Canadian carriers, with on-time ratings below 72%. Other regional winners around the globe, according to Cirium, were Japan Airlines, low-cost Spanish carrier Iberia Express, Panama’s Copa Airlines, and South African low-cost carrier FlySafair. Cirium said the best airport for on-time departures in 2024 was King Khalid International Airport in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Nearly 87% of flights from there took off within 15 minutes of their scheduled time, Cirium said. Jorge Chavez International Airport in Lima, Peru, and Mexico City's Benito Juárez International Airport had the next-best departure records at over 84%. Delta took the top spot among U.S. airlines despite disruptions in July from an outage that followed a faulty upgrade that cybersecurity provider CrowdStrike sent to Microsoft computers around the world. Delta sued CrowdStrike, claiming the outage cost the airline $500 million. CrowdStrike has defended itself partly by arguing that other airlines recovered much more quickly from the outage.	https://apnews.com/article/airlines-ontime-flights-aeromexico-saudia-delta-b3bcc2c15ad4015902322a4b8acf90ef	2025-01-02T09:15:02-08:00	
Rosita Missoni, matriarch of Italian fashion house that made zigzag knitwear iconic, dies aged 93	ROME (AP) — Rosita Missoni, the matriarch of the iconic Italian fashion house that made colorful zigzag-patterned knitwear high fashion and helped launch Italian ready-to-wear, died Thursday, a company official said. She was 93. Missoni SpA confirmed the death and planned a statement along with the family later, said Alberto Gualeni, an international spokesperson for the company in Milan. Local officials offered condolences and recalled Missoni’s ties to the small northern city of Gallarate where the Missoni brand was born in an artisan’s shop in 1953. Born Rosita Jelmini, Missoni grew up in a family that owned a textile factory that produced shawls. When she met and married Ottavio Missoni, they founded their eponymous fashion house in Gallarate that would turn into a fashion dynasty, with the couple’s three children and their offspring involved in expanding the brand. The Missonis got their first break in 1958, when the Rinascente department store commissioned 500 colorful vertically striped shirt dresses — the first to carry the Missoni label. The Missonis first showed their collection in Milan in 1966 and the brand helped turn the city into a fashion mecca. Their signature fashions, with the trademark graphic zigzags, long had a reputation for wearability and for surviving many seasons of changing trends. Family members were often the brand's best models, wearing Missoni graphic creations in everyday life. The founders turned over the business to their children in 1997, though Rosita remained involved in the Missoni home collection. In 2013, as the company celebrated its 60th anniversary, the family endured a double tragedy. The eldest Missoni son and the company’s CEO, Vittorio Missoni, died when a plane carrying him and five others disappeared off Venezuela. It took six months to locate the plane wreckage in the seas off the South American country, during which time patriarch Ottavio Missoni died, aged 92. In 2018, the family sold a 41.2%-stake to the Italian investment fund FSI, but maintained majority control of the house. In 2021, the youngest daughter, Angela Missoni, stepped down as creative director after 24 years. There was no immediate word on funeral arrangements.	https://apnews.com/article/italy-missoni-fashion-designer-dies-b7fb84d222196ffa70cb5a495c8f01b0	2025-01-02T09:07:55-08:00	
Israeli airstrike hits a Gaza humanitarian zone as Netanyahu OKs a delegation to talks in Qatar	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli airstrikes killed at least 26 people across the Gaza Strip on Thursday, hitting Hamas security officers and an Israeli-declared humanitarian zone. As the daily bombardment continued, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said he had authorized a delegation from the Mossad intelligence agency, the Shin Bet internal security agency and the military to continue negotiations in Qatar toward a ceasefire deal. Israeli media said the delegation would depart Friday. There was no immediate Hamas comment. The U.S.-led talks have repeatedly stalled. The Israeli strike in the seaside humanitarian zone known as Muwasi occurred as hundreds of thousands of displaced people are huddling there in damp winter weather. 'Everyone was taking shelter in their tents from the cold, and suddenly we found the world turning upside down. Why, and for what?' said Ziyad Abu Jabal, displaced from Gaza City. The early morning strike killed at least 10 people, including three children and two senior Hamas police officers. Israel’s military said it targeted a senior officer in the Hamas-run police force. It said he was involved in gathering intelligence used by Hamas’ armed wing in attacks on Israeli forces. Another Israeli strike killed at least eight Palestinians in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza. The men were members of local committees that help secure aid convoys, according to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, which received the bodies. An Associated Press reporter there confirmed the toll. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military on the strike. In southern Gaza, Israel’s military killed five policemen in eastern Khan Younis. Israeli government spokesman David Mencer said the strike targeted the head of the Hamas internal security force in southern Gaza. 'Where did we find him? Where else, but of course hiding in the humanitarian zone in Khan Younis, where Gazans are sheltering from this war,' Mencer said. Israel has repeatedly targeted the police in Gaza during 15 months of war, contributing to a breakdown of law and order in the territory that has made it difficult for humanitarian groups to deliver aid. Israel accuses the militant Hamas group of hijacking aid for its own purposes. The Hamas-run government had a police force numbering in the tens of thousands that maintained a high degree of public security before the war, while also violently suppressing dissent. Now officers have largely vanished from the streets in many areas. Meanwhile, three Palestinians were killed in an Israeli strike that hit a group of people walking in the street in Maghazi in central Gaza. Their bodies were taken to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. The war was sparked by Hamas-led militants’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack into Israel. The militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third believed to be dead. Israel’s offensive in retaliation has killed over 45,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the territory's Health Ministry, which says women and children make up more than half the dead. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in their tally. Israel's military says it only targets militants and blames Hamas for civilian deaths because its fighters operate in dense residential areas. The army says it has killed 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. The war has caused widespread destruction and displaced some 90% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million, many of them multiple times. Hunger is widespread. Children, some barefoot or in sandals, waited in line with metal pails or other containers at a food distribution center in Deir al-Balah on Thursday. Netanyahu leaves the hospital after surgery Netanyahu was released from the hospital Thursday after having prostate surgery Sunday. Doctors at Hadassah Ein Kerem Hospital said Netanyahu was recuperating well, although he has a period of recovery ahead. Despite doctor’s orders to remain hospitalized, the 75-year-old leader briefly left the facility to participate in a vote in Israel’s parliament on Tuesday. Netanyahu has vowed to press ahead in Gaza until Hamas is destroyed. But the militant group, while greatly weakened, has repeatedly regrouped in parts of the territory — notably the largely isolated north — after Israeli forces withdraw. ___ Khaled reported from Cairo. ___ Follow AP coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-gaza-war-news-629fd97676ff7b07c8cc991f98244e68	2025-01-02T08:40:04-08:00

5 things we know and still don't know about COVID, 5 years after it appeared	Five years ago, a cluster of people in Wuhan, China, fell sick with a virus never before seen in the world. The germ didn't have a name, nor did the illness it would cause. It wound up setting off a pandemic that exposed deep inequities in the global health system and reshaped public opinion about how to control deadly emerging viruses. The virus is still with us, though humanity has built up immunity through vaccinations and infections. It's less deadly than it was in the pandemic's early days and it no longer tops the list of leading causes of death. But the virus is evolving, meaning scientists must track it closely. Where did the SARS-CoV-2 virus come from? We don’t know. Scientists think the most likely scenario is that it circulated in bats, like many coronaviruses. They think it then infected another species, probably racoon dogs, civet cats or bamboo rats, which in turn infected humans handling or butchering those animals at a market in Wuhan, where the first human cases appeared in late November 2019. That's a known pathway for disease transmission and likely triggered the first epidemic of a similar virus, known as SARS. But this theory has not been proven for the virus that causes COVID-19. Wuhan is home to several research labs involved in collecting and studying coronaviruses, fueling debate over whether the virus instead may have leaked from one. It's a difficult scientific puzzle to crack in the best of circumstances. The effort has been made even more challenging by political sniping around the virus' origins and by what international researchers say are moves by China to withhold evidence that could help. The true origin of the pandemic may not be known for many years — if ever. How many people died from COVID-19? Probably more than 20 million. The World Health Organization has said member countries reported more than 7 million deaths from COVID-19 but the true death toll is estimated to be at least three times higher. In the U.S., an average of about 900 people a week have died of COVID-19 over the past year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The coronavirus continues to affect older adults the most. Last winter in the U.S., people age 75 and older accounted for about half the nation’s COVID-19 hospitalizations and in-hospital deaths, according to the CDC. 'We cannot talk about COVID in the past, since it’s still with us,' WHO director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. What vaccines were made available? Scientists and vaccine-makers broke speed records developing COVID-19 vaccines that have saved tens of millions of lives worldwide – and were the critical step to getting life back to normal. Less than a year after China identified the virus, health authorities in the U.S. and Britain cleared vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna. Years of earlier research — including Nobel-winning discoveries that were key to making the new technology work — gave a head start for so-called mRNA vaccines. Today, there’s also a more traditional vaccine made by Novavax, and some countries have tried additional options. Rollout to poorer countries was slow but the WHO estimates more than 13 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered globally since 2021. The vaccines aren't perfect. They do a good job of preventing severe disease, hospitalization and death, and have proven very safe, with only rare serious side effects. But protection against milder infection begins to wane after a few months. Like flu vaccines, COVID-19 shots must be updated regularly to match the ever-evolving virus — contributing to public frustration at the need for repeated vaccinations. Efforts to develop next-generation vaccines are underway, such as nasal vaccines that researchers hope might do a better job of blocking infection. Which variant is dominating now? Genetic changes called mutations happen as viruses make copies of themselves. And this virus has proven to be no different. Scientists named these variants after Greek letters: alpha, beta, gamma, delta and omicron. Delta, which became dominant in the U.S. in June 2021, raised a lot of concerns because it was twice as likely to lead to hospitalization as the first version of the virus. Then in late November 2021, a new variant came on the scene: omicron. 'It spread very rapidly,' dominating within weeks, said Dr. Wesley Long, a pathologist at Houston Methodist in Texas. 'It drove a huge spike in cases compared to anything we had seen previously.' But on average, the WHO said, it caused less severe disease than delta. Scientists believe that may be partly because immunity had been building due to vaccination and infections. 'Ever since then, we just sort of keep seeing these different subvariants of omicron accumulating more different mutations,' Long said. 'Right now, everything seems to locked on this omicron branch of the tree.' The omicron relative now dominant in the U.S. is called XEC, which accounted for 45% of variants circulating nationally in the two-week period ending Dec. 21, the CDC said. Existing COVID-19 medications and the latest vaccine booster should be effective against it, Long said, since 'it’s really sort of a remixing of variants already circulating.' What do we know about long COVID? Millions of people remain in limbo with a sometimes disabling, often invisible, legacy of the pandemic called long COVID. It can take several weeks to bounce back after a bout of COVID-19, but some people develop more persistent problems. The symptoms that last at least three months, sometimes for years, include fatigue, cognitive trouble known as 'brain fog,' pain and cardiovascular problems, among others. Doctors don’t know why only some people get long COVID. It can happen even after a mild case and at any age, although rates have declined since the pandemic's early years. Studies show vaccination can lower the risk. It also isn't clear what causes long COVID, which complicates the search for treatments. One important clue: Increasingly researchers are discovering that remnants of the coronavirus can persist in some patients’ bodies long after their initial infection, although that can’t explain all cases. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

Italy summons Iran's ambassador to demand release of Italian journalist arrested in Tehran	ROME (AP) — Italy summoned Iran’s ambassador on Thursday to demand the immediate release of an Italian journalist detained in Tehran, as the government and opposition ramped up public pressure on the politically sensitive case. Cecilia Sala, a reporter for the Il Foglio daily newspaper, was detained in Tehran on Dec. 19, six days after she arrived on a journalist’s visa. Tehran confirmed Monday that Sala had been arrested on charges of violating the laws of the Islamic Republic of Iran, according to the state-run IRNA news agency. The Italian foreign ministry said it summoned Iran’s Ambassador Mohammad Reza Sabouri to demand her release and to ensure 'dignified detention conditions in full respect of human rights,' including consular access and visitations. Italy's opposition Democratic Party also demanded her immediate release, citing Italian media reports about a phone call Sala’s family received from her indicating she was sleeping on the floor and had not received a second package of personal items from the embassy. 'The news of her conditions of detention are alarming,' the party said in a statement. 'The inhuman treatment she is undergoing is unacceptable.' Sala’s case has dominated Italian headlines for days and even featured in President Sergio Mattarella's end-of-year speech to the nation. Complicating matters are indications that Sala's fate has become intertwined with that of an Iranian man detained in Italy on Dec. 16. Mohammad Abedini-Najafabad was arrested at Milan’s Malpensa airport on a U.S. warrant alleging he was involved in the Jan. 28, 2024, drone attack in Jordan that killed three American troops. U.S. federal prosecutors have charged Abedini and a co-defendant with export control violations after FBI specialists analyzed the drone navigation system used in the Jordan attack and traced it to them. The U.S. Justice Department declined to comment on whether there was a link between the Sala case and its drone investigation. Abedini’s Italian lawyer, Alfredo De Francesco, asked the Milan court this week to grant him house arrest, a decision that is pending, De Francesco said in an email. He declined to respond when asked to comment on the U.S. charges or possible links to the Sala case. Italian media have reported that Sala is essentially being used as a bargaining chip by Iran to secure Abedini’s release. Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani didn’t dispute that scenario when he was asked about it during a call-in to the Rete4 broadcast Sunday. Ever since the 1979 U.S. Embassy crisis in Iran, in which dozens of U.S. hostages spent 444 days in captivity in Tehran, Iran has frequently used prisoners with Western ties as bargaining chips in negotiations.	https://apnews.com/article/italy-iran-journalist-arrest-ambassador-6656e7f9df9db8b7216a180d69dde52c	2025-01-02T04:36:10-08:00	
Puerto Rico swears in new governor days after major blackout hit island	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Jenniffer González Colón was sworn in Thursday as Puerto Rico’s new governor as the island prepared for a normally ebullient ceremony overshadowed by widespread anger over a blackout that hit the U.S. territory days ago. González, a Republican who backs President-elect Donald Trump and whose pro-statehood New Progressive Party secured a historic third consecutive term after she won the Nov. 5 election, has pledged to stabilize the Caribbean island’s crumbling power grid. Before the start of a ceremony in front of Puerto Rico's seaside Capitol to celebrate her swearing in, González attended Mass surrounded by family and supporters. 'What better than to come first to thank God and to ask God to give me the wisdom, the fortitude and the tools to fulfill everything I promised the people of Puerto Rico,' she told reporters. González has promised to appoint an energy 'czar' to review potential contractual breaches while another operator is found to possibly replace Luma Energy, a private company that oversees the transmission and distribution of power in Puerto Rico. However, no contract can be canceled without prior approval from Puerto Rico’s Energy Bureau and a federal control board that oversees the island’s finances. Outages were still being reported on Thursday as crews tried to stabilize the grid following the blackout that hit early Tuesday, leaving 1.3 million customers in the dark as Puerto Ricans prepared for New Year’s Eve. While electricity had been restored to 98.9% of 1.47 million total customers, more than 600,000 were temporarily left without power on New Year’s when part of the system collapsed again, according to Luma. 'The stability of the system is fragile,' Luma said late Wednesday as it warned of more outages on Thursday given an ongoing lack of generation. 'We know and understand how frustrating it is for our clients to be without service for long periods of time.' Backup generators were put in place to ensure a smooth swearing-in ceremony on Thursday given that renowned musicians were scheduled to perform. The anticipated revelry was characteristic of González, a 48-year-old attorney and recent mother of twins who prior to the election showed up at her party’s assembly wearing a Wonder Woman tiara and cuffs. She also made the news after peeling out of one of her party’s conventions in an off-road vehicle earlier this year. González, of the pro-statehood New Progressive Party, had beat former Gov. Pedro Pierluisi during their party’s primary in June. At the time, she was Puerto Rico’s representative in Congress and had run on Pierluisi’s ticket four years ago. After beating him, she won the Nov. 5 general election with more than 526,000 votes, or 41%. Trailing her was Juan Dalmau, who represented Puerto Rico’s Independence Party and the Citizen Victory Movement. It was the first time that the Popular Democratic Party, which supports the island’s territorial status quo and is one of Puerto Rico’s two main parties, came in third in a gubernatorial race. While González’s immediate challenge is Puerto Rico’s fragile power grid, she also inherits a feeble economy that has slowly been strengthening since the U.S. territory’s government declared in 2015 that it was unable to pay its more than $70 billion public debt load. In 2017, it filed for the biggest U.S. municipal bankruptcy in history. All but one government agency has since restructured its debt, with Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority still struggling to do so. It holds more than $9 billion in debt, the largest of any government agency. Experts warn the island will keep struggling to attract investors until the debt is restructured and the power grid strengthened. González also will have to work alongside a federal control board that U.S. Congress created in 2016 to oversee Puerto Rico’s finances and supervise the ongoing reconstruction after Hurricane María slammed into the island in September 2017 as a powerful Category 4 storm, razing the electrical grid. She also faces pressure to create affordable housing, lower power bills and the general cost of living, reduce violent crime, boost Puerto Rico’s economy, with the island locked out of capital markets since 2015, and improve a limping health care system as thousands of doctors flock to the U.S. mainland. Like other governors of the pro-statehood party, González has said she would push for Puerto Rico to become the 51st state, but such a change would require approval from U.S. Congress and the U.S. president. A nonbinding referendum held during the Nov. 5 election, the seventh of its kind, asked voters to choose one of three options: statehood, independence and independence with free association, under which issues like foreign affairs, U.S. citizenship and use of the U.S. dollar would be negotiated. With 63% of voters participating, statehood earned more than 615,000 votes, or 59%, with independence coming in second for the first time with more than 309,000 votes, or 29%. Independence with free association garnered more than 128,000 votes, or 12%.	https://apnews.com/article/puerto-rico-jenniffer-gonzalez-new-governor-sworn-84afbbfa537b23f35494df0127b20c2d	2025-01-02T04:22:27-08:00	
British rapper Stormzy banned from driving for using phone behind wheel of his Rolls-Royce	LONDON (AP) — British rapper Stormzy was banned from driving for nine months on Thursday after admitting he drove his Rolls-Royce through London while using his phone. The 31-year-old whose real name is Michael Ebenazer Owuo Jr. is known for bringing the grime genre of rap into the commercial mainstream. His debut 'Gang Signs and Prayer' won album of the year at the Brit Awards in 2018, where he was named best male British solo artist — an honor he won again in 2020. His record on the road, however, isn't good, a judge said at Wimbledon Magistrates’ Court. District judge Andrew Sweet said that Stormzy’s actions were 'dangerous and irresponsible.' Stormzy previously put 'vulnerable road users at risk' when he drove a Lamborghini Urus with illegally tinted windows, prosecutor Alice Holloway said. The windows only allowed 4% light transmission — a tiny fraction of the 70% required for tinting. Stormzy, who wasn't in court for the hearing, pleaded guilty in writing to the cellphone driving charge from March. He had previously admitted the 2023 tinting offense and also had a record of speeding. Defense lawyer Peter Csemiczky said that Stormzy apologized and accepted responsibility. The artist was fined 2,010 pounds ($2,500) and penalty points were added to his license.	https://apnews.com/article/british-rapper-stormzy-driving-ban-cellphone-use-3948ce7534232193734ecb97276c1d64	2025-01-02T03:20:19-08:00	
Polish ski jumper Andrzej Stekala says he is gay and mourns loss of partner	WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Polish world-class ski jumper Andrzej Stekala began the new year with a public coming out and a message mourning his partner whom he lost in November. The 29-year-old Stekala wrote on his Facebook page that for years he was hiding the truth about being gay for fear it could be destructive for him. On Wednesday, he wrote he wanted his fans and the public to know 'who I really am.' 'For a long time I wondered if I would ever find the strength to write these words,' Stekal said in his post. 'For years I lived in the shadow of fear, in hiding, afraid that who I really was could destroy me. I want you to really get to know me. I’m gay.' Stekala added he was mourning the loss of his partner of eight years who died in November. His post drew comments of support. In 2020 and 2021 Stekala was on the Poland team that won bronze medals in world championships in ski jumping in Planica, Slovenia, and Oberstdorf, Germany. In 2021, he also won an individual bronze medal in a World Cup in Zakopane, Poland. ___ AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports	https://apnews.com/article/gay-coming-out-poland-ski-jumper-stekala-a045bd7d428f03f97a1da2ee8fc8fe9a	2025-01-02T03:03:50-08:00	
Ágnes Keleti, Holocaust survivor and the oldest living Olympic medal winner, dies at age 103	BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — Ágnes Keleti, a Holocaust survivor and the oldest living Olympic medal winner, has died. She was 103. Keleti died Thursday morning in Budapest, the Hungarian state news agency reported. She was hospitalized in critical condition with pneumonia on Dec. 25. She won a total of 10 Olympic medals in gymnastics, including five golds, for Hungary at the 1952 Helsinki Games and the 1956 Melbourne Games. She overcame the loss of her father and several relatives in the Holocaust to become one of the most successful Jewish Olympic athletes. 'These 100 years felt to me like 60,' Keleti told The Associated Press on the eve of her 100th birthday. 'I live well. And I love life. It’s great that I’m still healthy.' Born Ágnes Klein in 1921 in Budapest, her career was interrupted by World War II and the cancellation of the 1940 and 1944 Olympics. Forced off her gymnastics team in 1941 because of her Jewish ancestry, Keleti went into hiding in the Hungarian countryside, where she survived the Holocaust by assuming a false identity and working as a maid. Her mother and sister survived the war with the help of famed Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, but her father and other relatives perished at Auschwitz, among the more than half a million Hungarian Jews killed in Nazi death camps and by Hungarian Nazi collaborators. Resuming her career after the war, Keleti was set to compete at the 1948 London Olympics, but a last-minute ankle injury dashed her hopes. Four years later, she made her Olympic debut at the 1952 Helsinki Games at the age of 31, winning a gold medal in the floor exercise as well as a silver and two bronzes. In 1956, she became the most successful athlete at the Melbourne Olympics, winning four gold and two silver medals. While she was becoming the oldest gold medalist in gymnastics history at age 35 in Melbourne, the Soviet Union invaded Hungary following an unsuccessful anti-Soviet uprising. Keleti remained in Australia and sought political asylum. She then immigrated to Israel the following year and worked as a trainer and coached the Israeli Olympic gymnastics team until the 1990s.	https://apnews.com/article/keleti-obit-hungary-oldest-olympic-medal-winner-b6facb6ead67a0ec298931cb297e4579	2025-01-01T23:35:54-08:00	
AP PHOTOS: A lantern workshop in China makes snakes cute for the Lunar New Year	WEIFANG, China (AP) — The brightly lit snake lanterns are topped with oversized heads that don’t fit the usual image of the slithery reptile — they are cute. It's the year of the snake in the Chinese zodiac, and in an era when cuteness reigns supreme, a workshop in eastern China is churning out hundreds of snake lanterns with cartoony big eyes — and smiles instead of flickering tongues — for Lunar New Year displays at parks, tourist sites and shopping malls. 'When you come close, you can see they look like snakes, but with a cute feeling,' said Wang Yongxun, the owner of the workshop in Weifang city in Shandong province. The colorful lanterns stand taller than the average person and are built on wiry metal frames. They incorporate dragon elements, Wang said, as the snake is known as the 'little dragon' in Chinese culture. The Chinese zodiac is a 12-year cycle with a different animal for each year, and the year of the snake, which begins Jan. 29, follows the year of the dragon. The snake is a symbol of spirituality, reproduction and longevity in China but may also represent evil and danger. While they can give people a feeling of terror, snakes were considered a guardian of the home in ancient Chinese culture and harming them would bring bad luck, said Wang Juan, a folklore expert at Peking University. 'We have played down the aggressiveness of the snake, so it is culturalized,' she said. 'This is what we call the incorporation of nature into the sequences of human beings and a manifestation of mutual care between humans and nature.' ___ Associated Press video producer Olivia Zhang contributed to this story.	https://apnews.com/article/china-lunar-new-year-snake-lantern-db2c571947f3dc057e3541fad06adca1	2025-01-01T23:00:39-08:00	
Montenegro mourns after gunman kills at least 12 people before shooting himself	CETINJE, Montenegro (AP) — Shock and dismay prevailed in Montenegro on Thursday after a gunman fatally shot 12 people, including two children, in a western town before killing himself. At least four others were wounded in the shooting rampage in Cetinje on Wednesday that followed a bar brawl, officials said. This was the second such incident in the town in the past three years. The shooter, identified as 45-year-old Aco Martinović, killed the owner of the bar, the bar owner's children and his own family members, officials have said. The attacker, who first fled after the rampage, was later located and surrounded by police. He died after shooting himself in the head, Interior Minister Danilo Šaranović said. Residents of Cetinje were stunned and grief-stricken. Vanja Popović, whose relatives are among the victims, said that 'we are all in shock.' 'How can I feel after this?' Popović said. 'No one expected it. You can’t even ask anyone anything.' Police had dispatched a special unit to search for the attacker in the town, which is located about 30 kilometers (18 miles) northwest of Podgorica, the capital. All roads in and out of the city were blocked for hours as police swarmed the streets. Šaranović said that the shooter had died while being taken to a hospital in the capital and succumbed from the 'severity of his injuries.' Officials have said that the attacker was at the bar throughout the day with other guests when the brawl erupted. He then went home, brought back a weapon and opened fire at around 5:30 p.m. Prosecutor Andrijana Nastić said Thursday that the attacker went to six locations during the shooting rampage, including the last one, where he shot himself. Four men were killed at the bar, Nastić said. The shooter then moved on to another location where he killed four more people, and then two children at a third site. He then went on to kill two more people at two other locations before eventually shooting himself, Nastić said. 'Further investigation will determine the exact circumstances of the events,' she added. The government has declared three days of national mourning starting on Thursday, and all planned New Year's festivities have been canceled throughout the country. Prime Minister Milojko Spajić said that the government may try to impose a total ban on weapons 'because we must ask ourselves after this who should be allowed to have guns in Montenegro.' The small Adriatic Sea nation, which has a population of around 620,000 people, is known for its gun culture and many people traditionally have weapons. In August 2022 in Cetinje, which is Montenegro’s historic capital, an attacker killed 10 people, including two children, before he was shot and killed by a passerby. Police have said that the suspect in Wednesday's shooting received a suspended sentence in 2005 for violent behavior and had appealed his latest conviction for illegal weapons possession. Montenegrin media have reported that he was known for erratic and violent behavior. 'Instead of holiday joy ... we have been gripped by sadness over the loss of innocent lives,' Montenegro's President Jakov Milatović said in a post on X. ___ Jovana Gec and Dušan Stojanović contributed to this report from Belgrade, Serbia.	https://apnews.com/article/montenegro-shooting-gunman-suicide-cetinje-7ab4ac905c4d08bca357251823dd4ee6	2025-01-01T23:00:03-08:00	
Middle East latest: Israeli strikes kill at least 18 in Gaza, including 3 children, officials say	Israeli airstrikes killed at least 18 people in the Gaza Strip on Thursday, including three children and two high-ranking officers in the Hamas-run police force, according to Palestinian and hospital officials. One strike early Thursday hit a tent in an Israeli-declared humanitarian zone known as Muwasi, where hundreds of thousands of displaced people are sheltering in tents during the cold and rainy winter. Another strike killed at least eight Palestinians in the central Gaza Strip. The dead were members of local committees that help secure aid convoys, according to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, which received the bodies. An Associated Press reporter at the hospital confirmed the toll. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military on the strikes. The war was sparked by Hamas-led militants' Oct. 7, 2023 attack into Israel. They killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250 that day. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s offensive has killed over 45,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to local health officials, who say women and children make up more than half the fatalities. The officials do not distinguish between civilians and combatants in their tally. ___ Here's the latest: Israel says it targeted Hamas official in a strike that killed 9 others JERUSALEM — The Israeli military says it targeted a senior member of Hamas’ internal security apparatus in a strike in the Gaza Strip that Palestinian officials say killed nine other people, including three children. The strike early Thursday hit a tent in an Israeli-declared humanitarian zone known as Muwasi, where hundreds of thousands of displaced people are sheltering in tents during the cold and rainy winter. The military said Hossam Shahwan, a senior officer in the Hamas-run police force in Gaza, was involved in gathering intelligence used by Hamas’ armed wing in attacks on Israeli forces. Maj. Gen. Mahmoud Salah, another senior police official, was also killed in the strike. The military says Hamas militants hide among civilians and blames the group for their deaths in the nearly 15-month war, which was ignited by Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack into Israel. The Hamas-run government had a police force numbering in the tens of thousands that maintained a high degree of public security before the war while also violently suppressing dissent. The police have largely vanished from the streets in many areas after being targeted by Israel, contributing to the breakdown of law and order that has hindered the delivery of desperately needed humanitarian aid. Syrian security forces search for militants who refuse to turn in their weapons DAMASCUS, Syria — The forces together with armed vehicles were deployed in the city of Homs Thursday to look for the militants affiliated with ousted President Bashar Assad, state media reported. SANA, citing a military official, said that the new de facto authorities led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham had set up centers in Syria’s third-largest city for former soldiers and militants to hand over their weapons, similar to other parts of Syria. In early December, a lightning insurgency took out the decades-long rule of Assad in less than two weeks. HTS has since run much of war-torn Syria under the authority of its leader Ahmad al-Sharaa. Officials who were part of Assad's notorious web of intelligence and security apparatus have been arrested over the past few weeks. Israeli strike kills 8 Palestinian men in central Gaza Strip DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip: An Israeli strike has killed at least eight Palestinian men in the central Gaza Strip. The dead were members of local committees that help secure aid convoys, according to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, which received the bodies. An Associated Press reporter at the hospital confirmed the toll. Earlier on Thursday, an Israeli airstrike in southern Gaza killed at least 10 people, including three children and two senior officers in the Hamas-run police. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military on the strikes. Israel has repeatedly targeted the police, contributing to a breakdown of law and order in the territory that has made it difficult for humanitarian groups to deliver aid. Israel accuses Hamas of hijacking aid for its own purposes. Al Jazeera condemns Palestinian Authority's decision to bar it from operating in occupied West Bank DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Al Jazeera has condemned the Palestinian Authority’s decision to bar it from operating in the occupied West Bank, saying the decision was 'in line' with similar actions taken by Israel. In a statement Thursday, the Qatar-based broadcaster accused the Western-backed authority of seeking to 'hide the truth about events in the occupied territories, especially what is happening in Jenin and its camps.' The Palestinian Authority, which cooperates with Israel on security matters, launched a rare crackdown on anti-Israel militants in the urban Jenin refugee camp last month. The authority has international support but is unpopular among many Palestinians, with critics portraying it as a subcontractor of the Israeli occupation. The Palestinian Authority announced the suspension of Al Jazeera’s activities on Wednesday, accusing it of incitement and interfering in Palestinian internal affairs. The Palestinian Authority exercises limited autonomy in parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Israel banned Al Jazeera last year, accusing it of being a mouthpiece of Hamas. Israeli strikes have killed or wounded several Al Jazeera reporters in Gaza, and Israel has accused some of them of being militants. Israeli forces raided Al Jazeera’s West Bank headquarters last year, but the broadcaster has continued to operate in the territory. Al Jazeera denies the allegations and accuses Israel of trying to silence its coverage. Its 24-hour reporting from Gaza has focused on the deaths of Palestinian civilians. It has also broadcast Hamas and other militant videos in their entirety, showing attacks on Israeli forces and hostages speaking under duress.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-syria-lebanon-news-01-02-2025-80d9b9488c88664a2df0f74d05b48264	2025-01-01T22:34:53-08:00	
Bangladesh court again rejects bail for Hindu leader who led rallies	DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — A court in southeastern Bangladesh on Thursday rejected a plea for bail by a jailed Hindu leader who led large rallies in the Muslim-majority country demanding better security for minority groups. Krishna Das Prabhu, 39, faces sedition charges after he led huge rallies in the southeastern city of Chattogram. Hindu groups say there have been thousands of attacks against Hindus since early August, when the secular government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was overthrown. Prabhu didn't appear at the hearing, during which Chattogram Metropolitan Sessions Judge Saiful Islam rejected the bail plea, according to Public Prosecutor Mofizul Haque Bhuiyan. Security was tight, with police and soldiers guarding the court. 'He faces serious charges like sedition and others involving the security and sovereignty of our country,' Bhuiyan told The Associated Press by phone. 'We argued in the court that if he gets bail it could create anarchy as we saw in the past that he triggered violence on the court premises by calling thousands of his supporters to protest. 'So, we moved against his bail plea as we believed that he could misuse his bail.' Apurba Kumar Bhattacharjee, a lawyer representing Prabhu, said that they would appeal the decision. The court rejected an earlier request for bail made while Prabhu didn't have lawyers. Lawyers who sought to represent him at that hearing said they were threatened or intimidated, and many of them are facing charges related to the death of a Muslim lawyer during clashes outside the court when Prabhu appeared there shortly after being arrested in Bangladesh's capital, Dhaka, in November. For Thursday's hearing, 11 lawyers traveled from Dhaka, arriving and leaving with a security escort. Hindu groups and other minority groups in Bangladesh and abroad have criticized the interim government led by Nobel peace laureate Muhammad Yunus for undermining their security. Yunus and his supporters said that reports of attacks on Hindus and other groups since August have been exaggerated. Prabhu’s arrest came as tensions spiked following reports of the desecration of the Indian flag in Bangladesh, with some burning it and others laying it on the floor for people to step on. Protesters in India responded in kind. Prabhu is a spokesman for the Bangladesh Sammilito Sanatan Jagaran Jote group. He was also associated with the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, widely known as the Hare Krishna movement. Radharamn Das, vice president and spokesman of the group in Kolkata, the capital of India's West Bengal state, told the television station India Today that Prabhu's health is deteriorating. Das said that the jailed Hindu leader 'has become a face of minorities in Bangladesh. The minorities see him as a ray of hope. He represents their voice.'	https://apnews.com/article/bangladesh-hindu-leader-india-hasina-yunus-bail-20e3d6862554b07817222506a9c0efd3	2025-01-01T22:02:46-08:00	
Carter reflected on 1980 Olympic boycott: ‘A bad decision’	COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) — It was a decision that robbed hundreds of athletes of their once-in-a-lifetime chance at Olympic glory, and for more than four decades, it weighed heavily on the man who made it — Jimmy Carter. Carter’s passing Sunday has unearthed memories from his 1977-1981 presidency. Somewhere between his greatest foreign-policy success (the Camp David Accords between Israel and Egypt) and his greatest failure (the Iran hostage crisis) sits the U.S. boycott of the 1980 Olympics in Moscow. It was Carter who called for that boycott — a Cold War power play intended to express America’s disdain for the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. In his 1980 State of the Union Address, Carter said the invasion 'could pose the most serious threat to world peace since the second World War.' The boycott garnered more than two-thirds support from the 2,400 members of the unwieldy U.S. Olympic Committee house of delegates, the governing body that made the official move to keep the athletes out of Moscow. In short time, that move came to be seen as the textbook example of the risks, confusion and low success rate of injecting politics into sports. 'We were not allowed to go for a not-so-clear reason,' said Edwin Moses, the hurdling great who won 122 straight races between 1977 and 1987, which included the Olympic gold-medal contests in 1976 and 1984. For decades, members of the 1980 U.S. Olympic team — recognized as Olympians at home but not by the International Olympic Committee abroad — told stories about opportunities missed and dreams unfulfilled because of the trip to Moscow they never took. Of the 474 athletes who had qualified for the team in 1980, 227 would not get another chance to compete in the Olympic Games. Many athletes told stories of meeting Carter at a White House visit in the summer of 1980 that served as a tepid substitute. In Washington, the athletes received the highest honor civilians can receive from Congress: the Congressional gold medal. But those medals were only gold-plated bronze, not pure gold, and they weren’t recorded in the Congressional record until a push was made nearly three decades later. Swimmer Jesse Vassallo, a reigning world champion in multiple events at the time, told Swimming World Magazine about meeting Carter in the reception line. Carter 'reached out to shake my hand and he said ‘How would you have done in Moscow?’' Vassallo recalled. 'And I said, ‘I would have won two golds and a silver.’ And he just gave me this (pained) look. He didn’t ask anybody else that question.' Wrestler Jeff Blatnick, a champion on the 1984 Olympic team, met Carter on an airplane years later. According to an essay written by the late USOC spokesman Mike Moran, Blatnick said: 'He looks at me and says, ‘Were you on the 1980 hockey team?’ I say, ‘No sir, I’m a wrestler, on the summer team.’ He says, ‘Oh, that was a bad decision, I’m sorry.’' In his 2021 biography on the 39th President, Kai Bird writes that the boycott was a byproduct of a hard line Carter decided to take against the Soviets at the urging of his national security advisor, Zbigniew Brzezinski, who had been in a long-running struggle with the less-hawkish Secretary of State, Cyrus Vance, to influence Carter’s thinking. 'History would prove Vance correct; Brzezinski’s ‘Carter Doctrine’ never amounted to much more than a cover for wasteful arms exports,' Bird wrote. And Carter’s boycott did nothing to deter the Soviets. They stayed in Afghanistan for another nine years, while further disrupting the Olympic movement and America’s own turn as an Olympic host four years later. The Soviets and 13 other countries, mostly from the Eastern Bloc, boycotted the Los Angeles Olympics in 1984 in retaliation for what the Americans had done to Moscow four years earlier. Forty-four years after Carter’s fateful decision, the Olympics remain every bit as politicized and polarized as they were back then. And for the past several years, the world has grappled with Russia’s place in international sports in the wake of another invasion — this time, into neighboring Ukraine. How that war is resolved will help define Russia's role when the Olympics come back to Los Angeles in 2028.	https://apnews.com/article/jimmy-carter-olympics-boycott-9ba0aad38e01013bd0f40ce554317caf	2025-01-01T20:21:33-08:00	
Impeached South Korean president issues defiant message as he faces possible detention	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Impeached South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol issued a defiant statement to his conservative supporters gathered outside his residence in the capital of Seoul, vowing to 'fight to the end' against what he called 'anti-state forces,' as law enforcement prepared to detain him over last month’s martial law decree. The Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials has a week to execute its detainment warrant against Yoon, issued by a Seoul court on Tuesday. The warrant came after Yoon defied several requests to appear for questioning and blocked searches of his office, hindering an investigation into whether his short-lived power grab on Dec. 3 amounted to rebellion. Oh Dong-woon, the anti-corruption agency’s chief prosecutor, has indicated that police forces might be deployed if Yoon’s security service resists the detention attempt, which could occur as early as Thursday. But it remains unclear whether Yoon can be compelled to submit to questioning. Yoon’s legal team issued a statement on Thursday warning that any attempt by the anti-corruption agency to use police mobile units for his detention would exceed their legal authority. The lawyers further said that police officers could face arrest by either the 'presidential security service or any citizens' if they try to detain him. In a message to hundreds of supporters gathered outside his residence Wednesday evening, Yoon said he would continue to fight against anti-state forces 'violating our sovereignty' and putting the nation in 'danger.' He applauded his supporters for their efforts to protect the country’s 'liberal democracy and constitutional order' and said he was watching their protests on live YouTube broadcasts, according to a photo of the message shared by Yoon’s lawyers. The liberal opposition Democratic Party, which drove the legislative vote that impeached Yoon on Dec. 14 over the martial law imposition, accused the president of trying to mobilize his supporters to block his detention and called for law enforcement authorities to execute the warrant immediately. A growing number of Yoon’s supporters were again gathering near his residence on Thursday morning amid a heavy police presence, waving small South Korean and American flags and holding signs opposing his impeachment. Yoon’s lawyers have argued that the court’s detainment warrant is 'invalid,' claiming that the anti-corruption agency lacks legal authority to investigate rebellion charges. They also accuse the court of bypassing a law that says locations potentially linked to military secrets cannot be seized or searched without the consent of the person in charge. Some experts believe the anti-corruption agency, which is leading a joint investigation with police and military authorities, would not risk clashing with Yoon’s security service, which has said it will provide security to Yoon in accordance with the law. The office may instead issue another summons for Yoon to appear for questioning if they are not able to execute the detainment warrant by Jan. 6. Yoon’s presidential powers were suspended following the National Assembly vote to impeach him on Dec. 14 over his imposition of martial law, which lasted only hours but has triggered weeks of political turmoil, halted high-level diplomacy and rattled financial markets. Yoon’s fate now lies with the Constitutional Court, which has begun deliberations on whether to uphold the impeachment and formally remove Yoon from office or reinstate him. To formally end Yoon’s presidency, at least six justices on the nine-member Constitutional Court must vote in favor. The National Assembly voted last week to also impeach Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, who had assumed the role of acting president after Yoon’s powers were suspended, over his reluctance to fill three Constitutional Court vacancies ahead of the court’s review of Yoon’s case. In the face of growing pressure, the country’s new interim leader, Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok, appointed two new justices on Tuesday, which possibly increased the chances of the court upholding Yoon’s impeachment. Cho Han-chang, one of the newly appointed court justices, said Thursday that he begins his job with a 'heavy heart.' Jeong Gye-seon, the other new justice, expressed hope that the remaining vacancy would be filled.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korean-yoon-martial-law-impeachment-detention-1779809dc6b2c7e5a9478bac17ca7585	2025-01-01T19:02:34-08:00	
Stock market today: Asian shares mostly decline amid investor worries, and Tokyo stays closed	TOKYO (AP) — Asian shares mostly slipped Thursday, as the region's main stock market in Tokyo stayed closed for the New Year's holidays. Investors remained cautious amid worries about what President Donald Trump might mean for policy changes, while the political uncertainty in South Korea added to a wait-and-see mood. Australia's S&amp;P/ASx 200 rose 0.4% in early trading to 8,193.90. South Korea's Kospi declined nearly 0.1% to 2,397.54. Hong Kong's Hang Seng shed 1.3% to 19,807.19, while the Shanghai Composite lost 0.8% to 3,325.56. Wall Street trading was closed on Wednesday for the New Year’s Day holiday. On Thursday, investors will get an updated snapshot of U.S. construction spending for November, while U.S. manufacturing numbers for December will be released Friday. The New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq will close their equity and options markets on Jan. 9 in observance of a National Day of Mourning for former President Jimmy Carter, continuing a longtime Wall Street tradition of mourning the nation’s leaders. The 39th U.S. president and global humanitarian died on Sunday at his home in Plains, Georgia. He was 100 years old. U.S. stock indexes closed mostly lower Tuesday as the market delivered a downbeat finish on the final day of another milestone-shattering year on Wall Street. The S&amp;P 500 gave up an early gain to finish down 0.4%. The benchmark index, which set 57 record highs in 2024, racked up a 23.3% gain for the year. This was its second straight year with a gain of more than 20%. The last time the index had as big a back-to-back annual gain was 1998. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.1%, and the Nasdaq composite lost 0.9%. Big Tech stocks led this year’s rally, pushing the Nasdaq to a yearly gain of 28.6%. The Dow, which is far less heavily weighted with tech, rose 12.9% for the year. All told, the S&amp;P 500 fell 25.31 points to 5,881.63 on Tuesday. The Dow lost 29.51 points to close at 42,544.22, and the Nasdaq slid 175.99 points to finish at 19,310.79.

What is the Islamic State, and what attacks has it inspired by offshoots and lone wolves?	WASHINGTON (AP) — The FBI says it recovered the stark black banner of the Islamic State extremist group from the truck that an American man from Texas smashed into New Year's partygoers in New Orleans' French Quarter Wednesday, killing 15 people. The investigation is expected to look in part at any support or inspiration that driver Shamsud-Din Jabbar may have drawn from that violent Middle East-based group, or from any of at least 19 affiliated groups around the world. President Joe Biden said Wednesday evening that the FBI had told him that 'mere hours before the attack, (Jabbar) posted videos on social media indicating that he was inspired' by the Islamic State. Routed from its self-proclaimed caliphate in Syria and Iraq by a U.S. military-led coalition more than five years ago, the Islamic State has focused on seizing territory in the Middle East more than on staging massive al-Qaida-style attacks on the West. But in its home territory the Islamic State has welcomed any chance to behead Americans and other foreigners who come within its reach. And it has had success, although abated in recent years, in inspiring people around the world who are drawn to its ideology to carry out ghastly attacks on innocent civilians. Here's a look at the Islamic State, its current status, and some of the offshoot armed groups and so-called lone wolves that have killed under the Islamic State flag. What is the Islamic State? The Islamic State also is known as both IS and ISIS, or the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. It began as a breakaway group from al-Qaida. Under leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, IS had seized stunning amounts of territory in Iraq and Syria by 2014. Within territory under its control, it killed and otherwise abused members of other faiths and targeted fellow Sunni Muslims who strayed from its harsh interpretation of Islam. By 2019, a U.S.-led military intervention had driven Islamic State from the last inch of its territory. Al-Baghdadi killed himself, and two children near him, that same year, detonating an explosive vest as U.S. forces closed in on him. Currently, the central Islamic State group is a scattered and much weakened organization working to regain fighting strength and territory in Syria and Iraq. Experts warn that the group is reconstituting itself there. And that ISIS flag? Typically, it's a stark black banner with white Arabic letters expressing a central tenet of the Islamic faith. Countless Muslims around the world see the coercive violence of the group as a perversion of their religion. What’s the influence of the Islamic State today? Some experts argue the Islamic State is powerful today partly as a brand, inspiring both militant groups and individuals in attacks that the group itself may have no real role in. The Islamic State's ruthless credo and military successes have helped spur affiliated groups in Africa, Asia and Europe. It's a greatly decentralized alliance. Many offshoots have carried out lethal attacks, such as a March 2024 attack blamed on an Afghanistan-based affiliate of the Islamic State that killed some 130 people at a Moscow theater. What’s the group’s track record for inspiring attacks in the United States? The New Orleans rampage reflects the deadliest Islamic State-inspired attack on U.S. soil in several years. Other attacks over the last decade include a 2014 shooting rampage by a husband-and-wife team who killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California, and a 2016 massacre at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, by a gunman who fatally shot 49 people, pledged his allegiance on a 911 call to al-Baghdadi and raged against the 'filthy ways of the West.' Those attacks coincided with an influx of thousands of Westerners — some of them Americans — who traveled to Syria in hopes of joining the so-called caliphate. In the aftermath of those killings, the threat from radicalized followers of the group had appeared to wane in the U.S. Defense Department strikes have taken out other Islamic State members and the FBI has had significant success in disrupting plots before they come to fruition. But over the last year, FBI officials have warned about a significantly elevated threat of international terrorism following Hamas’ rampage in Israel in October 2023 and the resulting Israeli strikes in Gaza. The SITE intelligence group reported IS supporters celebrating in online chat groups Wednesday. 'If it’s a brother, he’s a legend. Allahu Akbar,' or 'God is great,' it quoted one as saying.	https://apnews.com/article/new-orleans-crash-islamic-state-lone-wolves-4bb6446c484737fbe9dd1b9c26a899a9	2025-01-01T14:53:08-08:00	
El Salvador closes 2024 with a record low number of homicides	SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) — El Salvador closed 2024 with a record low 114 homicides, continuing notable security gains under a second full year of a state of emergency that has given the government extraordinary powers and curtailed some fundamental rights. President Nayib Bukele said via the social platform X that the number announced Wednesday by the small Central American country’s Attorney General’s Office made it the safest nation in the Western Hemisphere. Not all nations had published their 2024 annual homicide totals, but the 1.9 homicides per 100,000 in population that Bukele said had been achieved would put it below what any Latin American country had reported in 2023. El Salvador’s official total does not include the killings of five suspected gang members in shootouts with security forces. In March 2022, El Salvador’s notoriously powerful street gangs killed 62 people in a matter of hours. The congress granted Bukele’s administration a requested 'state of exception' to crackdown on the gangs that included suspending some Constitutional rights and giving police more powers to arrest and hold suspects. More than 83,000 people have been arrested since, the majority jailed without due process. Bukele has said that 8,000 people who were innocent have been released. Civil rights organizations have reported 354 people who have died in government custody during the crackdown. Despite the restrictions, the improvements in security have contributed to Bukele’s extremely high popularity. For years, many Salvadorans lived in fear of the gangs that controlled swaths of the country, extorting, killing and forcibly recruiting. In 2015, El Salvador had 6,656 homicides, making it one of the world’s deadliest countries. In 2023, there were 214 homicides. The advances have inevitably raised the question of whether the state of emergency can still be justified to which Bukele and his ministers have obliquely answered that they have not yet achieved all that they wish. The congress, in which Bukele's party and allies hold a supermajority, continues to renew the special powers each month. The gangs' repressive control made it difficult and dangerous for residents to travel between neighborhoods, including for work. Now residents say they can walk their neighborhoods without fear. In February, Bukele romped to victory, winning an unprecedented second five-year term despite a constitutional ban on consecutive reelection. A friendly Supreme Court allowed it.	https://apnews.com/article/el-salvador-homicides-gangs-bukele-69384a8705267eaddd18dcd28a53465b	2025-01-01T14:12:44-08:00	
An armed man kills at least 10 people, including 2 children, in a shooting rampage in Montenegro	PODGORICA, Montenegro (AP) — At least 10 people, including two children, were killed and four others were wounded in a shooting on Wednesday that followed a bar brawl in a western Montenegrin city, officials said. The shooter was on the run. Police identified the attacker as 45-year-old Aco Martinovic. He killed the owner of the bar in the city of Cetinje, the bar owner's children and his own family members, said Interior Minister Danilo Saranovic at a news conference. 'At this moment, we are focused on arresting him,' said Saranovic. Police dispatched special troops to search for the attacker in Cetinje, located some 30 kilometers (18 miles) northwest of the capital, Podgorica. A statement said the man fled the scene armed after opening fire at the bar. President Jakov Milatovic said he was 'shocked and stunned' by the tragedy. 'Instead of holiday joy ... we have been gripped by sadness over the loss of innocent lives,' Milatovic said on the social media platform X. Prime Minister Milojko Spajic went to the hospital where the wounded were being treated and announced three days of mourning. 'This is a terrible tragedy that has affected us all,' said Spajic. 'All police teams are out.' Small Montenegro, which has some 620,000 people, is known for gun culture and many people traditionally have weapons. Wednesday's shooting was the second shooting rampage over the past three years in Cetinje, Montenegro's historic capital. An attacker also killed 10 people, including two children, in August 2022 before he was shot and killed by a passer by in Cetinje. The RTCG report, which published Martinovic's photo on its website, said he was known for erratic behavior and had been detained in the past for illegal possession of weapons. The report said he went home to get his gun and came back to the bar where he opened fire and killed and wounded several people. He then went to another site where he killed the bar owner's children and a woman, the report added. Police appealed on the residents to remain calm and stay indoors, ruling out a clash between criminal gangs.	https://apnews.com/article/montenegro-shooting-cetinje-bar-6b5bfe0a02341ef400eda318385f316b	2025-01-01T09:21:17-08:00	
Protesters in Syria demand justice for disappeared activists and accountability from all factions	DOUMA, Syria (AP) — Protesters in Syria held a sit-in Wednesday demanding justice for four activists who were forcibly disappeared in 2013 and whose fate remains one of the most haunting mysteries of the country's 13-year civil war. On Dec. 9, 2013, gunmen stormed the Violation Documentation Center in Douma, northeast of Damascus, and took Razan Zaitouneh, her husband Wael Hamadeh, Samira Khalil and Nazem Hammadi. Outspoken and defiantly secular, Zaitouneh was one of Syria’s most well-known human rights activists. Perhaps most dangerously, she was impartial. She chanted in protests against then-President Bashar Assad but was also unflinching in documenting abuses by rebels fighting to oust him. There has been no sign of life nor proof of death since she and her colleagues were abducted. Since the ouster of Assad on Dec. 8, protests have erupted across Syria demanding information about thousands of people who were forcibly disappeared under his rule. The new leadership under the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which orchestrated the offensive to oust Assad, has maintained a neutral stance regarding accusations against various armed groups for forcibly disappearing activists. At the same time, HTS has aligned with activists in their efforts to uncover the truth and seek justice. 'We are gathering here to remind the world of their case,' Yassin Haj Saleh, Khalil’s husband, said Wednesday, adding that the disappearance of activists represents 'the deepest wounds' of Syria’s conflict. 'This is the first opportunity that allows us to be in Douma, and in front of the place that they were kidnapped from, to speak up about the case, taking advantage of the political change that took place in the country.' Saleh said they had repeatedly appealed to various armed groups for cooperation in finding the four activists in the years before Assad's ouster but were met with silence. Strong clues had pointed to the Army of Islam, the most powerful rebel faction in Douma at the time, as the perpetrators. The group, made up of religious hard-liners who were pushing out other rebels and imposing strict Shariah rules, long denied involvement. An Army of Islam official, Hamza Bayraqdar, told The Associated Press in 2018 they brought Zaitouneh to Douma to protect her from the Assad government. The Army of Islam repeatedly blamed the Assad government, along with the Nusra Front — an al-Qaida-linked group originally founded by the current HTS leader — for his wife's disappearance, Saleh said. Zaitouneh was a prominent human rights lawyer and founder of the Violation Documentation Center. She also helped organize networks of activists like the Local Coordination Committees, an umbrella network made up of activists who organized protests as part of the Syrian uprising. Her work earned her international recognition, including an International Woman of Courage award presented by U.S. first lady Michelle Obama in 2013. Several of those who spoke to the AP in 2018 said the Army of Islam saw Zaitouneh documenting abuses as a threat and resented her local administration plan as an encroachment on their power. Zaitouneh received a series of threats that friends and activists said traced back to the Army of Islam. The Army of Islam was forced to move north in 2018 after the Assad government retook Douma, leading to the group's weakening and disintegration. Hopes that Zaitouneh and her colleagues would emerge among released prisoners during that time were unmet. Today, the Army of Islam remains an armed faction backed by Turkey. It did not fight alongside the other Islamist factions that led the offensive against Assad and remains excluded from the HTS-led Syrian leadership. Recently, an Army of Islam delegation met HTS leader Ahmad Sharaa to explore integration into the new Syrian system, but no agreement has been reached. Protesters on Wednesday held banners openly accusing the Army of Islam and reading 'Freedom' in English and 'Traitor who kidnaps a revolutionary' in Arabic, alongside posters of the four missing activists. Saleh described the plight of the disappeared as uniquely painful, saying, 'Those who die are mourned, but the forcibly disappeared are forbidden from both living and being mourned.' Their bodies must be found, he said, adding: 'For Syria to heal, truth and justice must prevail.' Wafa Moustafa, whose father was forcibly disappeared separately in 2013, also attended the protest. 'Justice in Syria cannot be limited to those detained by the Assad regime,' she said. 'For many years, other factions controlled parts of Syria and committed similar crimes of detention, torture and killing. If justice does not include all victims, it will remain incomplete and threaten Syria’s future.' ___ Abou AlJoud reported from Beirut, Lebanon.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-disappeared-activists-assad-hts-zaitouneh-douma-e75b4c4967b5d241831f271a19f0696a	2025-01-01T08:00:36-08:00	
New Orleans New Year's Day ramming is the latest attack to use a vehicle as a deadly weapon	NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Police say a man who drove a pickup truck at high speed into a crowd of people celebrating the new year in New Orleans early Wednesday was hell-bent on creating carnage. While a motive for the attack that killed at least 10 people has yet to be revealed, the FBI is investigating it as a terrorist act. Several such attacks have taken place over the past two decades, some inspired by extremist politics and others blamed on mental illness or misogyny. What authorities call 'vehicle as a weapon attacks' have reshaped cities around the world, with planners erecting concrete barriers around public spaces and building anti-vehicle obstacles in new developments. Here are the details of some major vehicle attacks: NEW ORLEANS, Jan. 1, 2025 — At least 10 people are killed and dozens are injured after a U.S. citizen from Texas rams a vehicle into a crowd of pedestrians in New Orleans’ bustling French Quarter district at 3:15 a.m. on New Year's Day. The FBI identifies the suspect as 42-year-old Shamsud-Din Jabbar. He is killed in a firefight with police. The FBI says several possible explosive devices were recovered and that a flag associated with the Islamic State group was found in the truck.

Former Estonian President Arnold Rüütel dies at age 96	TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — Arnold Rüütel, the last communist leader of Soviet Estonia and the Baltic country’s second president after the restoration of independence, has died. He was 96. The office of the President of Estonia, Alar Karis, announced on its website that Rüütel had died on Tuesday. A trained agriculturalist, Rüütel was almost 50 when, in 1977, he began serving in high-ranking positions within the communist party of the Soviet republic of Estonia. In 1983, he was elected chairman of the republic’s supreme council, becoming the highest-ranking communist official in Estonia. Soon, however, Rüütel was using his position to prepare for Estonia’s split from the Soviet Union, which had occupied the tiny European country on the Baltic Sea in 1940. In November 1988, Rüütel was a key figure in preparing a declaration of independence, with full sovereignty following three years later. In the newly independent Estonia, which inherited a sizable ethnic Russian minority as part of its Soviet legacy, Rüütel advocated social democratic policies and support for farmers, and in 1994 he helped form the People’s Union, a left-leaning party that took part in several ruling coalitions. Rüütel was elected president in 2001, succeeding the highly popular Lennart Meri and serving the next five years while shepherding the Baltic nation into NATO and the European Union in 2004. He sought reelection for a second five-year term but was defeated by Toomas Hendrik Ilves in 2006. Rüütel will be buried with full state honors, Estonian public broadcaster ERR reported on Wednesday. It did not give a date for the funeral.	https://apnews.com/article/estonia-ruutel-obituary-died-76fb12f73f434b508f340907d225fbc4	2025-01-01T05:46:21-08:00	
Parts of the UK are flooded by heavy rain as wild weather continues to disrupt New Year's events	LONDON (AP) — Parts of the United Kingdom were flooded Wednesday as heavy rains and powerful winds continued to disrupt New Year’s celebrations. Several communities in the Manchester area were flooded, with several homes evacuated and cars submerged up to their roofs on roads and in parking lots after nearly a month's worth of rain fell in two days. A major incident was declared and mountain rescue teams were called in to help firefighters respond to swamped properties and stranded vehicles, Greater Manchester Police said. 'There’s still probably likely to be further flooding across the course of the day,' Met Office meteorologist Tom Morgan said. 'We are potentially expecting the flood situation to get worse before it gets better.' Tom Coulthard said the rain started late Tuesday afternoon and poured all night where he lives in Didsbury, south of Manchester, topping river banks and forcing a hotel to be evacuated before dawn. Roads and highways were closed in the area. 'All the local rivers and water courses have sort of filled up and flooded around the area,' said Coulthard, a geography professor at the University of Hull. 'That’s really probably a sign of just how our weather is changing, how climate is shifting.' The deluge and gusts derailed New Year's Eve fireworks celebrations, leading to cancellations in Edinburgh and several other cities. Events planned for New Year's Day, including nippy outdoor swims and a bathtub boat race, were scrapped. London, which was able to launch its massive fireworks display on the River Thames in front of Big Ben, had to postpone the start of its New Year’s Day parade and grounded inflatable floats due to the blustery and soggy conditions. Cheerleaders and members of bands that marched through central London pulled transparent coverings over their bright costumes to take shelter from rain. Warnings that indicate flooding is expected were issued at one point to more than 150 communities across the U.K., with most being in northern England. Later in the day, dozens of those warnings had been lifted. Several trains were canceled because of high water around the tracks and some highways were closed. With temperatures dropping, there were ice warnings until late Thursday morning for Northern Ireland, parts of North Wales, England and Scotland. And a three-day snow warning was issued for the coming weekend for much of England and Scotland.	https://apnews.com/article/uk-weather-flooding-rain-new-year-64a71d687f8380f10aa3ac82901e9007	2025-01-01T05:02:15-08:00	
Driver 'hell-bent on carnage' kills 10, injures 30 on New Year's Day in New Orleans	NEW ORLEANS (AP) — A driver in a pickup truck who officials said was 'hell-bent on carnage' sped through a crowd of pedestrians in New Orleans’ bustling French Quarter district, killing 10 and injuring 30 revelers early on New Year’s Day. The attack occurred around 3:15 a.m. along Bourbon Street, known worldwide as one of the largest destinations for New Year’s Eve parties, and with crowds in the city ballooning in anticipation for the Sugar Bowl college football playoff game at the nearby Superdome later in the day. At a news conference, New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell described the killings as a 'terrorist attack' and the city’s police chief said the act was clearly intentional. But an assistant FBI agent in charge declared that is was 'not a terrorist event.' The news conference ended before authorities could reconcile the two characterizations. Alethea Duncan, an assistant special agent in charge of the FBI’s New Orleans field office, said officials were investigating the discovery of at least one suspected improvised explosive device at the scene. Police Commissioner Anne Kirkpatrick said police officers would work to ensure safety at the Sugar Bowl, indicating that the game would go on as scheduled. 'He was hell-bent on creating the carnage and the damage that he did,' Kirkpatrick said. 'It was very intentional behavior. This man was trying to run over as many people as he could.' Two police officers who were shot after the driver emerged from the truck are in stable condition, she said. Officials did not immediately provide an update on the status of the driver, whether there was an ongoing threat to the public or offer a suspected motive in the fatal incident.

Ukraine halts transit of Russian gas to Europe after a prewar deal expired	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine on Wednesday halted Russian gas supplies to European customers that pass through the country, almost three years into Moscow’s all-out invasion of its neighbor, after a prewar transit deal expired. Ukraine’s energy minister, Herman Halushchenko, confirmed on Wednesday morning that Kyiv had stopped the gas flows 'in the interest of national security.' 'This is a historic event. Russia is losing markets and will incur financial losses. Europe has already decided to phase out Russian gas, and (this) aligns with what Ukraine has done today,' Halushchenko said in an update on the Telegram messaging app. Russia’s Gazprom said in a statement on Wednesday morning that it had been 'deprived of the technical and legal ability to supply gas for transit through Ukraine,' due to Ukraine’s refusal to extend the deal. Even as Russian troops and tanks moved into Ukraine, Russian natural gas kept flowing through the country’s pipeline network — set up when Ukraine and Russia were both part of the Soviet Union — to Europe, under a five-year agreement that ran through the end of last year. Gazprom earned money from the gas and Ukraine collected transit fees. Before the war, Russia supplied nearly 40% of the European Union's pipeline natural gas. Gas flowed through four pipeline systems, one under the Baltic Sea, one through Belarus and Poland, one through Ukraine and one under the Black Sea through Turkey to Bulgaria. After the war started, Russia cut off most supplies through the Baltic and Belarus-Poland pipelines, citing disputes over a demand for payment in rubles. The Baltic pipeline was blown up in an act of sabotage, but details of the attack remain murky. The Russian cutoff caused an energy crisis in Europe. Germany had to shell out billions of euros to set up floating terminals to import liquefied natural gas that comes by ship, not by pipeline. Users cut back as prices soared. Norway and the U.S. filled the gap, becoming the two largest suppliers. Europe viewed the Russian cutoff as energy blackmail and has outlined plans to completely eliminate Russian gas imports by 2027. Russian gas currently accounts for about 8% of Europe's supply. The Ukrainian transit route served EU members Austria and Slovakia, which long got the bulk of their natural gas from Russia but have recently scrambled to diversify supplies. Gazprom halted supplies to Austria’s OMV in mid-November over a contractual dispute, but gas flows through Ukraine’s pipelines continued as other customers stepped in. Slovakia this year inked deals to begin buying natural gas from Azerbaijan, and also to import U.S. liquefied natural gas through a pipeline from Poland. Natural gas is used to generate electricity, power industrial processes, and in some cases to heat homes.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-gas-transit-supplies-gazprom-7775fea34a7be9723b991d835a7ebd6f	2025-01-01T01:16:12-08:00	
Israeli strikes kill 12 in Gaza as war grinds into the new year with no end in sight	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli strikes killed at least 12 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, mostly women and children, officials said Wednesday, as the nearly 15-month war ground on into the new year with no end in sight. One strike hit a home in the Jabaliya area of northern Gaza, the most isolated and heavily destroyed part of the territory, where Israel has been waging a major operation since early October. Gaza’s Health Ministry said seven people were killed, including a woman and four children, and at least a dozen other people were wounded. Another strike overnight in the built-up Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza killed a woman and a child, according to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, which received the bodies. The military ordered people to evacuate an area near Bureij overnight, saying it would strike there in response to recent rocket fire by Palestinian militants. A third strike early Wednesday in the southern city of Khan Younis killed three people, according to the nearby Nasser Hospital and the European Hospital, which received the bodies. The war began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and abducting around 250. About 100 hostages are still held in Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s air and ground offensive has killed over 45,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. It says women and children make up more than half the fatalities but does not say how many of those killed were militants. The Israeli military says it only targets militants and blames Hamas for civilian deaths because its fighters operate in dense residential areas. The army says it has killed 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. The war has caused widespread destruction and displaced some 90% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million, many of them multiple times. Hundreds of thousands are living in tents on the coast as winter brings frequent rainstorms and temperatures drop below 10 degrees Celsius (50 F) at night. At least six infants and another person have died of hypothermia, according to the Health Ministry. American and Arab mediators have spent nearly a year trying to broker a ceasefire and hostage release, but those efforts have repeatedly stalled. Hamas has demanded a lasting truce, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanayhu has vowed to keep fighting until 'total victory' over the militants. Israel sees net departure of citizens for a second year More than 82,000 Israelis moved abroad in 2024 and only 33,000 people immigrated to the country, Israel’s Central Bureau of Statistics said. Another 23,000 Israelis returned after long periods abroad. It was the second year in a row of net departures, a rare occurrence in the history of the country, which was founded by immigrants from Europe and actively encourages Jewish immigration. Many Israelis, looking for a break from the war, have moved abroad, leading to concern about whether it will drive a 'brain drain' in sectors like medicine and technology. Last year, 15,000 fewer people immigrated to Israel than in 2023. The Bureau of Statistics changed its reporting methods in mid-2022 to better track the number of Israelis moving abroad. Military blames ‘weakening of discipline’ in death of archaeologist who entered Lebanon with troops In a separate development, the Israeli military blamed 'operational burnout' and a 'weakening of discipline and safety' in the death of a 70-year-old archaeologist who was killed in southern Lebanon in November along with a soldier while visiting a combat zone. According to Israeli media reports, Zeev Erlich was not on active duty when he was shot, but was wearing a military uniform and had a weapon. The army said he was a reservist with the rank of major and identified him as a 'fallen soldier' when it announced his death. Erlich was a well-known West Bank settler and researcher of Jewish history. Media reports at the time of his death said he entered Lebanon to explore an archaeological site. The family of the soldier who was killed with him has expressed anger over the circumstances of his death. The military launched an investigation after the two were killed in a Hezbollah ambush. A separate probe is looking into who allowed Erlich to enter. The military said the entry of civilians who are not military contractors or journalists into combat zones is not widespread. Still, there have been multiple reports of Israeli civilians who support a permanent Israeli presence in Gaza or Lebanon entering those areas. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

South Korea air crash investigators extract black box data as grieving families mourn the victims	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Grieving relatives of the victims of the South Korea plane crash gathered at the site to pay respects to their loved ones on New Year’s Day, as officials said they've extracted data from one of the retrieved black boxes to find the exact cause of the crash. All but two of the 181 passengers and crew on board the Boeing 737-800 operated by Jeju Air died when it crashed at Muan International Airport, in southern South Korea, on Sunday. Video showed the aircraft without its landing gear deployed landing on its belly at high speed and then skidding off the end of the runaway into a concrete fence and bursting into flames. The footage showed the plane was experiencing an apparent engine problem in addition to the landing gear malfunction. Investigators say the pilot received a warning from air traffic controllers of possible bird strikes and the plane issued a distress signal before the crash. The Transport Ministry said in a statement Wednesday that it has completed works to extract data from the cockpit voice recorder — one of the two black boxes recovered from the wreckage. It said the data would be converted into audio files. A damaged flight data recorder will be sent to the United States for an analysis, the ministry added. All of the victims were South Korean, except for two Thais nationals, with many returning from Bangkok after Christmas holidays. The bereaved families visited the site on Wednesday for the first time since the crash for an emotional memorial service. They were bused to the site where they took turns laying white flowers. Many knelt and bowed deeply before a memorial table laid with food, including 'ddeokguk,' a Korean rice cake soup eaten on New Year's Day. The Transport Ministry said authorities have completed the complicated process of identifying all 179 victims. It said the government has so far handed over 11 bodies to relatives. The country is observing seven days of national mourning following the deadliest disaster in South Korea’s aviation history in decades. The government has begun safety inspections of all 101 Boeing 737-800s operated by the country's domestic airlines. On Tuesday, a team of U.S. investigators, including representatives from Boeing, examined the crash site. Officials have said they will consider whether the airport’s localizer — a set of antennas housed in a concrete fence at the end of the runway designed to guide aircraft during landings — should have been constructed with lighter materials that would break more easily upon impact.	https://apnews.com/article/korea-plane-crash-bereaved-families-boeing-904b15ec24a543c99e3c8e416af3a0a7	2024-12-31T21:51:58-08:00	
West Ham forward Michail Antonio out of hospital and 'grateful for being alive' after car crash	LONDON (AP) — West Ham forward Michail Antonio sent a message to the Premier League club's fans on Tuesday after being discharged from the hospital as he continues his recovery following a car crash in early December. 'Happy New Year – and I’ll be back on that pitch soon,' Antonio wrote in a message posted by the club on its official website. Antonio, a 34-year-old Jamaica international, needed surgery on a lower limb fracture after a one-car incident outside London on Dec. 7, and is expected to face a lengthy spell of rehabilitation. 'Every year around this time, I’m asked what I’m grateful for, and every year I’ve struggled to find the right words,' Antonio said in his message. 'But this year, I know exactly what I’m grateful for: being alive.' West Ham manager Julen Lopetegui previously called the outcome of the crash a 'miracle.' Antonio thanked everyone who had helped him, including emergency services, the air ambulance 'and everyone from top to bottom at West Ham United FC.' He has made more than 300 appearances for West Ham since joining from Nottingham Forest in 2015, and played in all 14 games this season before the incident. In the first game after the accident, West Ham players wore 'Antonio 9' shirts ahead of kickoff against Wolverhampton at the London Stadium, with the kit signed by the players — including Antonio — then auctioned off with around $75,000 going to the NHS and Air Ambulances UK. 'Everyone at the club would like to reiterate their heartfelt thanks to the first responders, emergency services, air ambulance staff and the NHS for the incredible support given to Michail in the wake of the accident,' West Ham said in an earlier statement on Tuesday. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer	https://apnews.com/article/michail-antonio-message-west-ham-1de4aab80736c24c43e2a20da72578d6	2024-12-31T11:09:03-08:00	
US imposes sanctions on Russian and Iranian groups over disinformation targeting American voters	WASHINGTON (AP) — The United States has imposed sanctions on two groups linked to Iranian and Russian efforts to target American voters with disinformation ahead of this year's election. Treasury officials announced the sanctions Tuesday, alleging that the two organizations sought to stoke divisions among Americans before November's vote. U.S. intelligence has accused both governments of spreading disinformation, including fake videos, news stories and social media posts, designed to manipulate voters and undermine trust in U.S. elections. 'The governments of Iran and Russia have targeted our election processes and institutions and sought to divide the American people through targeted disinformation campaigns,' Bradley T. Smith, Treasury's acting undersecretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, said in a statement. Authorities said the Russian group, the Moscow-based Center for Geopolitical Expertise, oversaw the creation, financing and dissemination of disinformation about American candidates, including deepfake videos created using artificial intelligence. In addition to the group itself, the new sanctions apply to its director, who authorities say worked closely with Russian military intelligence agents also overseeing cyberattacks and sabotage against the West. Authorities say the center used AI to quickly manufacture fake videos about American candidates created scores of fake news websites designed to look legitimate and even paid U.S. web companies to create pro-Russian content. The Iranian group, the Cognitive Design Production Center, is a subsidiary of Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, U.S. officials said, which the United States has designated a foreign terrorist organization. Officials say the center worked since at least 2023 to incite political tensions in the United States. U.S. intelligence agencies have blamed the Iranian government for seeking to encourage protests in the U.S. over Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza. Iran also has been accused of hacking into the accounts of several top current and former U.S. officials, including senior members of Donald Trump’s campaign. In the months ahead of the election, U.S. intelligence officials said Russia, Iran and China all sought to undermine confidence in U.S. democracy. They also concluded that Russia sought to prop up the ultimate victor Trump, who has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, suggested cutting funds to Ukraine and repeatedly criticized the NATO military alliance. Iran, meanwhile, sought to oppose Trump's candidacy, officials said. The president-elect's first administration ended a nuclear deal with Iran, reimposed sanctions and ordered the killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, an act prompting Iran’s leaders to vow revenge. Russian and Iranian officials have repeatedly rejected claims that they sought to influence the outcome of the 2024 election. Messages left with officials from both countries were not immediately returned Tuesday.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-iran-trump-disinformation-election-959d3f36ffc81f3e5d07386122076e7e	2024-12-31T10:35:11-08:00	
Thief swipes $13 million in jewels, handbags and cash from a London mansion	LONDON (AP) — Police in London are searching for a burglar who broke into an occupied mansion and stole more than 10.5 million pounds ($13.2 million) worth of jewelry, designer handbags and cash. The owners of the estate, identified in British media as an Instagram influencer and her developer husband, were not home at the time on Dec. 7. But employees were there and a housekeeper had a near run-in with the armed intruder, according to surveillance footage. 'This is a brazen offense where the suspect has entered the property while armed with an unknown weapon,' Det. Constable Paulo Roberts of the Metropolitan Police said on Monday, when the theft was announced. Among the stolen items were a 10.73-carat diamond ring, diamond earrings and a clip studded with gold, diamonds and sapphires. The haul also included 150,000 pounds ($189,000) worth of handbags. The homeowners have offered a 500,000 pound ($628,000) reward for information that leads to the arrest and conviction of the suspect, and an additional reward of 10% of the value of recovered items. Police said the suspect broke in by climbing through a second-floor window. Surveillance footage obtained by the MailOnline showed the man walking down a corridor a minute before a maid stepped off an elevator in the same place.

Wimbledon finalist Gabriela Dabrowski reveals she played through 2024 after breast cancer diagnosis	Former U.S. Open women's doubles champion Gabriela Dabrowski revealed on Tuesday she had played through 2024 after undergoing treatment for breast cancer. She delayed part of that treatment so she could compete at Wimbledon where she reached the doubles final. 'I know this will come as a shock to many, but I am OK and I will be OK,' the 32-year-old Canadian said on social media. 'Early detection saves lives. I can wholeheartedly agree with this.' Dabrowski, ranked third in women's doubles, said in an Instagram post that she received the diagnosis in April. She did not play that month and in May because of surgery, but returned to the courts in June. Dabrowski said there was 'a slight delay in further treatment' so she could compete at Wimbledon — where she and New Zealand's Erin Routliffe lost the final in July to Katerina Siniakova and Taylor Townsend — and the Paris Olympics, where she won the bronze medal in mixed doubles with Felix Auger-Aliassime. Dabrowski said she had found a first lump in the second half of 2023 and was initially told not to worry about it. 'It all seems surreal,' Dabrowski wrote, saying she now has a 'better grasp' of her treatment and side effects. 'For a long time I wasn’t ready to expose myself to the possible attention and questions I’d have gotten before. I wanted to figure everything out and handle things privately with only those closest to me in the loop.' Dabrowski and Routliffe won the WTA Finals at the end of this season. The pair also won the U.S. women's doubles title in 2023. 'My mindset shifted from ‘I have to do this (play tennis and not waste my skills)’ to ‘I get to do this.’ Through this lens I find it so much easier to find joy in areas of my life I previously viewed as a heavy weight,' she said. Dabrowski ended her post by aiming an expletive at cancer, while adding 'but also, thank you.' ___ AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis	https://apnews.com/article/dabrowski-breast-cancer-canada-wimbledon-acc3d00d863b9285f191882e6509da0a	2024-12-31T09:07:16-08:00	
A new year dawns on a Middle East torn by conflict and change	DAMASCUS (AP) — In Damascus, the streets were buzzing with excitement Tuesday as Syrians welcomed in a new year that seemed to many to bring a promise of a brighter future after the unexpected fall of Bashar Assad’s government weeks earlier. While Syrians in the capital looked forward to a new beginning after the ousting of Assad, the mood was more somber along Beirut’s Mediterranean promenade, where residents shared cautious hopes for the new year, reflecting on a country still reeling from war and ongoing crises. War-weary Palestinians in Gaza who lost their homes and loved ones in 2024 saw little hope that 2025 would bring an end to their suffering. The last year was a dramatic one in the Middle East, bringing calamity to some and hope to others. Across the region, it felt foolish to many to attempt to predict what the next year might bring. In Damascus, Abir Homsi said she is optimistic about a future for her country that would include peace, security and freedom of expression and would bring Syrian communities previously divided by battle lines back together. 'We will return to how we once were, when people loved each other, celebrated together whether it is Ramadan or Christmas or any other holiday — no restricted areas for anyone,' she said. But for many, the new year and new reality carried with it reminders of the painful years that came before. Abdulrahman al-Habib, from the eastern Syrian city of Deir el-Zour, had come to Damascus in hopes of finding relatives who disappeared after being arrested under Assad’s rule. He was at the capital’s Marjeh Square, where relatives of the missing have taken to posting photos of their loved ones in search of any clue to their whereabouts. 'We hope that in the new year, our status will be better ... and peace will prevail in the whole Arab world,' he said. In Lebanon, a tenuous ceasefire brought a halt to fighting between Israel and the Hezbollah militant group a little over a month ago. The country battered by years of economic collapse, political instability and a series of calamities since 2019, continues to grapple with uncertainty, but the truce has brought at least a temporary return to normal life. Some families flocked to the Mzaar Ski Resort in the mountains northeast of Beirut on Tuesday to enjoy the day in the snow even though the resort had not officially opened. 'What happened and what’s still happening in the region, especially in Lebanon recently, has been very painful,' said Youssef Haddad, who came to ski with his family. 'We have great hope that everything will get better.' On Beirut's seaside corniche, Mohammad Mohammad from the village of Marwahin in southern Lebanon was strolling with his three children. 'I hope peace and love prevail next year, but it feels like more (challenges) await us,' he said. Mohammad was among the tens of thousands displaced during more than a year of conflict between Hezbollah and Israel. Now living in Jadra, a town that was also bombarded during the conflict, he awaits the end of a 60-day period, after which the Israeli army is required to withdraw under the conditions of a French and U.S.-brokered ceasefire. 'Our village was completely destroyed,' Mohammad said. His family would spend a quiet evening at home, he said. This year 'was very hard on us. I hope 2025 is better than all the years that passed.' In Gaza, where the war between Hamas and Israel has killed more than 45,500 Palestinians, brought massive destruction and displaced most of the enclave's population, few saw cause for optimism in the new year. 'The year 2024 was one of the worst years for all Palestinian people. It was a year of hunger, displacement, suffering and poverty,' said Nour Abu Obaid, a displaced woman from northern Gaza. Obaid, whose 10-year-old child was killed in a strike in the so-called 'humanitarian zone' in Muwasi, said she didn’t expect anything good in 2025. 'The world is dead,' she said. 'We do not expect anything, we expect the worst.' The war was sparked by the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas-led attack on southern Israel in which militants killed around 1,200 people and abducted some 250 others. Ismail Salih, who lost his home and livelihood, expressed hopes for an end to the war in 2025 so that Gaza's people can start rebuilding their lives. The year that passed 'was all war and all destruction,' he said. 'Our homes are gone, our trees are gone, our livelihood is lost.' In the coming year, Salih said he hopes that Palestinians can 'live like the rest of the people of the world, in security, reassurance and peace.' ___ Shurafa reported from Muwasi, Gaza and Jo from Beirut.

Germany, France and Poland condemn violence in Georgia, stress support for pro-democracy movement	BERLIN (AP) — The foreign ministers of Germany, France and Poland on Tuesday expressed concern about 'the political crisis' in Georgia, two days after former soccer player Mikheil Kavelashvili was formally inaugurated as president of the South Caucasus nation, cementing the ruling party’s grip in what the opposition calls a blow to the country’s European Union aspirations and a victory for former imperial ruler Russia. 'We strongly condemn last week’s violence against peaceful protesters, media and opposition leaders and recall Georgian authorities’ responsibility to respect human rights and protect fundamental freedoms, including the freedom to assembly and media freedom,' the three ministers wrote in a joint statement. In reaction to the Russia-friendly course of the ruling Georgian Dream party, the three countries said they would 'implement the EU decision on ending visa-free travel for Georgian diplomatic and service passport holders and consider additional measures on EU and national level.' They also stressed that 'the political course of repression and democratic backsliding by the Georgian Dream has in reaction led to a downgrading of our relationship at European and national level and a reduction of our assistance to and cooperation with Georgia’s authorities.' The Georgian Dream party retained control of Parliament in the South Caucasus nation in the Oct. 26 election that the opposition alleges was rigged with Moscow’s help. The party has vowed to continue pushing toward accession to the European Union but also wants to 'reset' ties with Russia. Georgia’s outgoing president and main pro-Western parties have boycotted the post-election parliamentary sessions and demanded a rerun of the ballot. Critics have accused the Georgian Dream — established by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia — of becoming increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow, accusations the ruling party has denied. The party recently pushed through laws similar to those used by the Kremlin to crack down on freedom of speech and LGBTQ+ rights. Georgian Dream’s decision last month to suspend talks on their country’s bid to join the EU added to the opposition’s outrage and galvanized protests. 'We reiterate our determination to support the democratic and European aspirations of the Georgian people,' Germany, France and Poland stressed in their joint statement. Thousands of demonstrators have converged on the parliament building for weeks every night after the government announced the suspension of EU accession talks on Nov. 28. Riot police used water cannons and tear gas almost daily to disperse and beat scores of protesters, some of whom threw fireworks at police officers and built barricades on the capital’s central boulevard. Hundreds were detained and over 100 were treated for injuries. Several journalists, who were beaten by police, accused authorities of using thugs to deter people from attending anti-government rallies, a charge the Georgian Dream party denies. The crackdown has drawn strong condemnation from the United States and EU officials.	https://apnews.com/article/europe-georgia-politics-concern-democracy-ea1a94819ebc274c22a39341c4116b8b	2024-12-31T06:31:50-08:00	
Berlin police say they have detained a man who attacked 2 people with a knife	BERLIN (AP) — Berlin police said they detained a man Tuesday who attacked and injured two people in the city's Charlottenburg neighborhood, further jolting Germany days after a deadly Christmas market attack elsewhere in the country. Police said the attacker was a Syrian citizen with residency in Sweden. 'Initial findings indicate that the suspect may have signs of mental illness and that there is not indication for a terrorist motivation,' police spokeswoman Jane Berndt told The Associated Press, adding that the investigation is still ongoing. A police statement called it an 'attempted murder.' It said the man attacked two men in a supermarket and on a sidewalk in front of a nearby hotel shortly before noon, allegedly stabbing them with a knife he had stolen from the supermarket. Both were taken to a hospital, and police said one was released after outpatient treatment. Berlin media outlets earlier reported that the man appeared to be randomly attacking. They reported that several passersby pounced on the attacker and overpowered him until police arrived. Charlottenburg is a normally quiet district of the German capital. Germany is still reeling from the deadly Christmas market attack this month in which five people were killed and more than 200 were injured in the eastern city of Magdeburg. A Saudi doctor was arrested on murder charges. In a separate incident Tuesday in southwestern Germany, police shot and killed a man after he stole an excavator in the town of Grünsfeld, drove it into the front of a hardware store and slightly injured three officers who chased him, German news agency dpa reported. The attacker was identified as a 38-year-old German.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-berlin-attack-injuries-58032bd38dad258d2159b3ec3128abdb	2024-12-31T06:11:31-08:00

Running a marathon a day in 2024, she has a world record within her grasp	GHENT, Belgium (AP) — Finally coming to a halt on Tuesday — the last day of 2024 — Belgian ultra runner Hilde Dosogne felt she had done all to take the world record as the first woman to run a marathon every single day of the year. Weary but seemingly far from exhausted from the weight of relentless marathon running, Dosogne emerged from the cold, grey light to cross the line as a throng of fellow runners celebrated an extraordinary feat. 'I'm glad it's over,' she said after crossing the line on the last day, leaving the last crash of many behind her when she collided with a spectator during her final run. On top of the reward for her perseverance in running at least 15,444 kilometers in a single year, the 55-year-old also raised some 60,000 euros ($62, 438) in funds for breast cancer research. Now comes the filing of GPS data, photo and video evidence and independent witness reports she had to collect daily to meet the requirements of the Guinness World Records organization. If approved, the record should be officially hers in about three months. The 55-year-old would join Hugo Farias, the Brazilian who holds the male record of 366 days, which he achieved in São Paulo, Brazil, on Aug. 28, 2023. In the female category, Dosogne would be in a league all her own, since the current record by Erchana Murray-Bartlett of Australia stands at 150 days since Jan. 16, 2023. One thing is sure: she doesn't want her feat to become a shining example of healthy living — more one of personal persistence, as she had to fight off the flu, COVID-19, a dozen-plus crashes, blisters and even bursitis. Overall though, the brain took the toughest beating. 'The mental strain is harder than the physical. Of course, physically, everything has to be okay. Otherwise, you can’t run for four hours every day. But it was more mental to be there at the start-line every day,' she told The Associated Press. Dosogne was able to do the majority of her marathons on a flat loop around a stretch of water, just outside the university town of Ghent, where a strong headwind could be her toughest competitor. Even there, she said, she would not take any statistical risks and instead of the 42.195 kilometers (26.2 miles) a day, she made sure her run stood at 42.5 km — just for safe measure with the Guinness administrators. Dosogne wishes she could have stretched her days the same way. As a bio-engineer at a chemical firm, she starts especially early so she could squeeze in a marathon every afternoon. And because she could not run at top speed every single day, she stuck to an easy 10 kph (6.2 mph), which also allowed friends and witnesses to run along. The only time when her daughter Lucie felt she might not make it was the day she crashed after 27 kilometers, had to be taken to the emergency ward with a dislocated finger, and spent far too much time there to be allowed to finish the marathon by the regulation. The solution? 'She started from scratch again,' said Lucie. 'It's still a little bit crooked,' said Dosogne.	https://apnews.com/article/belgium-marathon-woman-record-endurance-95838c15e8292a3f6ed28c99696c319f	2024-12-31T04:24:26-08:00	
Wind, rain and the threat of floods play the spoiler for New Year's festivities in the UK	LONDON (AP) — Revelers in the U.K. may have to wring themselves out as they ring in the New Year. A storm system bringing high winds, heavy rain, the possibility of snow and the threat of flooding washed out plans Tuesday for several fireworks displays — in some cases more than 24 hours before the stroke of midnight. Edinburgh's famous Hogmanay street party, garden concert and pyrotechnics show from the city's famous castle were snuffed out before festivities got underway Monday. The Met Office is forecasting gusts up to 60 mph across England and Wales on New Year's Day, with gusts up to 75 mph on hilltops and coastal areas. 'It will be a tricky couple of days and a wet and windy spell for many up into the new year,' said Met Office meteorologist Craig Snell. Heavy rain and strong winds lashed parts of Scotland and the north of England, disrupting some journeys by train and car and playing spoiler to many public parties. Fireworks celebrations in Blackpool in the northwest of England, and Newcastle’s Quayside, a Ripon in North Yorkshire, both in the northeast, and at the Sandown Carnival on the Isle of Wight off the south coast were canceled or postponed because of weather. 'Safety always comes first, and the forecast has made it clear that continuing would pose risks to those attending, as well as our event teams,' Newcastle City Council said. People were urged to stay away from the coast in Scarborough, in northeast England, as a combination of winds and a high tide were expected to pound the shore with large waves. Organizers of London events were keeping a close eye on winds as they prepared to welcome 2025 with a blitz of fireworks along the River Thames and a parade Wednesday afternoon through the center of the city featuring 75 acts and 10,000 performers. The fireworks were planned to be launched against the backdrop of the London Eye, the massive Ferris wheel across the river from Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament. Darryl Fleming, the fireworks display director for London, told SkyNews that the direction of the wind forecast was unlikely to disrupt the display. Among the celebrations canceled Wednesday were an annual bathtub boat race in Poole, Dorset, on the south coast and a dip in the sea in Lyme Regis in the southwest.	https://apnews.com/article/storm-wind-rain-cancel-fireworks-new-years-eve-287ecd42f65b601d774afaef8075e52b	2024-12-31T03:51:40-08:00	
Nearly all of Puerto Rico is without power on New Year's Eve	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — A blackout hit nearly all of Puerto Rico early Tuesday as the U.S. territory prepared to celebrate New Year’s, leaving more than 1.3 million clients in the dark. Officials said it could take up to two days to restore power. The outage hit at dawn, plunging the island into an eerie silence as electrical appliances and air conditioners shut down before those who could afford generators turned them on. 'It had to be on the 31st of December!' exclaimed one man, who only gave his name as Manuel, as he stood outside a grocery store in the capital of San Juan, grumbling about the outage that coincided with his birthday. 'There is no happiness.' Nearly 90% of 1.47 million clients across Puerto Rico were left in the dark, according to Luma Energy, a private company that oversees electricity transmission and distribution. Luma said in a statement that it appears the outage was caused by a failure of an underground power line, saying it is restoring power 'in the quickest and safest way possible.' A Luma spokesman told The Associated Press that the incident was under investigation. The blackout fanned simmering anger against Luma and Genera PR, which oversees the generation of power in Puerto Rico, as a growing number of people call for their ouster. Governor-elect Jenniffer González Colón, who is set to be sworn in on Jan. 2, has called for the creation of an 'energy czar' to review potential Luma contractual breaches while another operator is found. 'We can’t keep relying on an energy system that fails our people,' she wrote on X, adding that stabilizing Puerto Rico’s energy grid would be her top priority in office. Meanwhile, Gov. Pedro Pierluisi said he was in touch with Luma and Genera PR, adding on X that 'we are demanding answers and solutions.' The outage forced businesses, parks and several malls to close, and the government announced limited schedules for some of its agencies. Workers checked on hundreds of bedridden patients. Other Puerto Ricans began to plan ahead. 'I'll go to my balcony. That's where I'll sleep,' Raúl Pacheco said with a shrug, as the 63-year-old diabetic sat on a walker nursing an injured foot. Julio Córdova, a municipal worker, said he got dressed by the light of his cellphone and planned to buy candles. 'This affects me because I had plans. It couldn't have been yesterday or tomorrow?' he said, shaking his head as he raked leaves. While blackouts are rare in Puerto Rico, the island struggles with chronic power outages blamed on a crumbling power grid that was razed by Hurricane Maria, a Category 4 storm in September 2017. The system, however, was already in decline after years of lack of maintenance and investment. Only recently did crews start making permanent repairs to Puerto Rico’s power grid following Hurricane Maria. The island continues to depend on generators provided by the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency to help stabilize the grid. In November, Puerto Rico’s government asked U.S. officials for permission to keep using more than a dozen portable generators for two additional years. Some Puerto Ricans took the latest outage in stride. 'They're part of my everyday life,' said Enid Núñez, 49, who said she ate breakfast before work thanks to a small gas stove she bought for such events.

US and Boeing investigators examine the site of a deadly South Korean plane crash	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — A team of U.S. investigators including representatives from Boeing on Tuesday examined the site of a plane crash that killed 179 people in South Korea while authorities were conducting safety inspections on all Boeing 737-800 aircraft operated by the country’s airlines. All but two of the 181 people aboard the Boeing 737-800 operated by South Korean budget airline Jeju Air died in Sunday's crash. Video showed the aircraft, without its landing gear deployed, crash-landed on its belly and overshoot a runaway at South Korea’s southern Muan International Airport before it slammed into concrete fence and burst into a flame. The plane was seen having an engine trouble, and preliminary examinations also say the pilots received a bird strike warning from the ground control center and issued a distress signal as well. But many experts say the landing gear issue was likely the main cause of the crash. The South Korean government has launched safety inspections on all the 101 Boeing 737-800s in the country. The Transport Ministry said authorities are looking at maintenance and operation records during five days of safety checks that are to run until Friday. The ministry said that a delegation of eight U.S. investigators — one from the Federal Aviation Administration, three from National Transportation Safety Board and four from Boeing — made an on-site visit to the crash site on Tuesday. The results of their examination weren’t immediately available. Kim E-bae, Jeju Air’s president, told reporters Tuesday that his company will add more maintenance workers and reduce flight operations by 10-15% until March as part of efforts to enhance the safety of aircraft operations. John Hansman, an aviation expert at MIT, said the crash was most likely the result of a problem with the plane’s hydraulic control systems. He said that would be consistent with the landing gear and wing flaps not being deployed 'and might indicate a control issue which would explain the rush to get on the ground.' The Boeing 737-800 -- an earlier version of 737 than the Max -- is a widely used plane with a good safety record, according to Najmedin Meshkati, an engineering professor at the University of Southern California who has studied aviation safety. He said the failure of the plane’s system for broadcasting location, operating its landing gear and extending the wing flaps to slow down indicate a widespread problem that affected electrical and hydraulic systems. He is confident that investigators will learn what went wrong by analyzing information from the flight data and cockpit voice recorders. 'These are really the two pillars for accident analysis and accident reconstruction,' Meshkati said. Like other aviation experts, Meshkati also questioned the location of a solid wall just a few hundred feet (meters) past the end of the runway, given that planes occasionally do overshoot runways. 'Having such a big concrete barrier over there was really very bad luck for this particular airplane,' he said. South Korean officials have said they will look into whether the Muan airport’s localizer — a concrete fence housing a set of antennas designed to guide aircraft safely during landings — should have been made with lighter materials that would break more easily upon impact. The crash was the deadliest disaster in South Korea’s aviation history in decades. A seven-day national mourning has been declared until Jan. 4. The Transport Ministry said Tuesday that authorities have identified 175 bodies and are conducting DNA tests to identify the remaining five. Bereaved families said that officials told them that the bodies were so badly damaged that officials need time before returning them to relatives. On Tuesday, Park Han Shin, a representative of the families, accused the government of failing to provide freezers on time as promised and said there are worries that the bodies could decompose. 'The last dignities of the victims are seriously hurt. We strongly criticize authorities for failing to keep its promise,' Park said. __ Associated Press writer David Koenig in Dallas contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/plane-crash-korea-boeing-jeju-cd5c5dcc45b046dcc94744f2bfd2e3c4	2024-12-31T01:11:30-08:00	
Middle East latest: 45 patients and wounded people evacuated from Gaza for treatment, officials say	Palestinian health authorities say 45 patients and wounded people have been evacuated for treatment outside the war-ravaged Gaza Strip. They left the European Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis early Tuesday and traveled through the Kerem Shalom Crossing into Israel. They will receive treatment in the United Arab Emirates. The patients are accompanied by over 100 of their relatives, according to the hospital. Among them was a 10-year-old boy, Abdullah Abu Yousef, suffering from kidney failure. The child was accompanied by his sister after the Israeli authorities rejected his mother’s application to join him. Israel says it screens escorts for security. 'The boy is sick,' said his mother, Abeer Abu Yousef. 'He requires hemodialysis three to four days a week.' The Health Ministry says several thousand Palestinians in Gaza need medical treatment abroad. Israel has controlled all entry and exit points since capturing the southern city of Rafah in May. Israel’s offensive, launched after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack, has gutted the territory’s health care system and forced most of its hospitals to close. Those that remain open are only partially functioning.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-syria-lebanon-news-31-12-2024-ff8c99b001f07fd1b4d2e3ba43171034	2024-12-30T23:43:05-08:00	
Cities across the globe prepare to welcome the New Year in celebrations tinged with local traditions	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Cities around the world are readying to ring in the New Year with celebrations highlighting local cultures and traditions, after a year roiled by ongoing conflict and political instability. Countries in the South Pacific Ocean will be the first to welcome 2025, with midnight in New Zealand striking 18 hours before the ball drop in Times Square in New York. In New Zealand's largest city, Auckland, thousands were expected to throng the downtown or climb the city’s ring of volcanic peaks for a fireworks vantage point — and a light display recognizing Auckland's Indigenous tribes. It follows a year marked by protests over Māori rights in the nation of 5 million. Two hours later in Australia, more than 1 million people are expected at Sydney Harbor for the traditional fireworks. British pop star Robbie Williams will lead a singalong and Indigenous ceremonies and performances will acknowledge the land's first people. Asia gets ready for the Year of the Snake Much of Japan has shut down ahead of the nation’s biggest holiday, as temples and homes underwent a thorough cleaning, including swatting floor mats called 'tatami' with big sticks. The upcoming Year of the Snake in the Asian zodiac is heralded as one of rebirth — alluding to the reptile’s shedding skin. Stores in Japan, which observes the zodiac cycle from Jan. 1, have been selling tiny figures of smiling snakes and other snake-themed products. Other places in Asia will start marking the Year of the Snake later, with the Lunar New Year. In South Korea, celebrations were cut back or canceled as the country observes a period of national mourning following the Sunday crash of a Jeju Air flight at Muan that killed 179 people. New Year celebrations in Jakarta will feature a dazzling fireworks display, including a drone show featuring 800 drones, followed by countdowns to midnight at the city's iconic Hotel Indonesia Roundabout. West's rivals exchange goodwill Chinese state media covered an exchange of New Year’s greetings between leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin in a reminder of growing closeness between two leaders who face tensions with the West. Xi told Putin that their countries will 'always move forward hand in hand,' the official Xinhua News Agency said Tuesday. China has maintained ties and robust trade with Russia since the latter invaded Ukraine in 2022, helping to offset Western sanctions and attempts to isolate Putin. Conflicts cast a shadow in Middle East New Year’s celebrations are likely to be subdued in Israel as its war with Hamas in Gaza grinds through a 15th month and scores of hostages remain in captivity. Lebanon is in the grip of a severe economic crisis, and many areas were heavily damaged during the war between Israel and Hezbollah, which ended with a shaky ceasefire. Syrians are meanwhile expressing hope and uncertainty for the coming year after the overthrow of President Bashar Assad. In Dubai, thousands are expected to attend an annual fireworks show at the Burj Khalifa, the world’s tallest skyscraper. Midnight Mass, with bubbles Rome’s traditional New Year’s Eve festivities have an additional draw: the start of Pope Francis’ Holy Year, the once-every-quarter-century celebration projected to bring some 32 million pilgrims to the Eternal City in 2025. On Tuesday, Francis will celebrate a vespers at St. Peter’s Basilica, followed by Mass on Wednesday, when he is expected to once again appeal for peace amid wars raging in Ukraine and the Middle East. Meanwhile, in the United States, the Cathedral of Saint Paul in Minnesota will host an 11 p.m. Mass followed by a champagne reception with toasts. Jan. 1 is a day of obligation for Catholics, marking the Solemnity of Mary, and many churches will hold vigil Masses on Tuesday afternoon and evening. Paris recaptures the Olympic spirit Paris will cap a momentous 2024 with its traditional festive countdown and fireworks extravaganza on the famed Champs-Elysées. The Summer Olympics and Paralympic Games hosted in the French capital from July to September transformed the city into a site of joy, fraternity and astonishing sporting achievements, and marked another major milestone in its recovery from deadly extremist attacks in 2015 by al-Qaida and the Islamic State group. Britons will brave wintry weather London is due to ring in the New Year with a pyrotechnic display along the River Thames and a parade through the city center on Wednesday featuring 10,000 performers. The fireworks will explode against the backdrop of the London Eye, the massive Ferris wheel across the river from Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament. With a storm bringing bitter weather to other parts of the United Kingdom, however, festivities in Edinburgh, Scotland — including the Hogmanay Street party, garden concert and castle pyrotechnics show — were already canceled. Rio to see 2 million revelers Rio de Janeiro will throw Brazil’s main New Year’s Eve bash on Copacabana Beach, with 10 ferries offshore bearing 12 straight minutes of fireworks. Thousands of tourists in six cruise ships will witness the show up close. Rio’s City Hall was closely guarding its plans for a display of lights and sounds. More than 2 million people are expected at the Copacabana, hoping to squeeze into concerts by superstar Brazilian artists such as pop singer Anitta and Grammy-award winner Caetano Veloso. American traditions old and new In New York City, the organization managing Times Square has tested its famous ball drop, and inspected 2025 numerals, lights and thousands of crystals, as part of a tradition going back to 1907. This year’s celebration will include musical performances by TLC, Jonas Brothers, Rita Ora, and Sophie Ellis-Bextor. The party, covering multiple blocks around the city’s main tourism and theater hub, is expected to draw large crowds despite rain and chilly weather. Meanwhile, Las Vegas will bid farewell to 2024 with old — and some new — traditions. Its annual eight-minute pyrotechnic show will be on in the Las Vegas Strip, with 340,000 people anticipated as fireworks are launched from the rooftops of nine casinos. Nearby, the massive Sphere venue will display for the first time countdowns to midnight in different time zones. Country music, football and a midnight race In Pasadena, enthusiastic Rose Parade spectators were to camp out on the cold streets and ring in the New Year hoping for prime spots for the iconic Southern California tradition. The parade precedes the Rose Bowl football game between the Ohio State Buckeyes and the Oregon Ducks on Jan. 1. Thousands are to participate in a midnight 5K race following the parade route. Some 200,000 people will flock to a party in Nashville, Tennessee, featuring a five-hour show by some of country music’s biggest stars. At midnight — an hour after New York's — a 16-feet tall music note weighing 400 pounds will drop as fireworks light the sky. Celebrations will echo around the globe as the New Year arrives in different time zones, with American Samoa among the last to welcome 2025 a full 24 hours after New Zealand. ___ Associated Press writers around the world contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/new-years-eve-times-square-midnight-d272e3c02dd0a0c39be1ef06634ff3f3	2024-12-30T21:04:09-08:00	
AP WAS THERE: Carter announces Middle East peace agreement	WASHINGTON (AP) — ___ EDITORS: As part of its coverage of the death of former President Jimmy Carter, The Associated Press is looking back at major events in his life. Carter's success at Camp David negotiating a Mideast Peace agreement between Egypt and Israel was one of his crowning achievements. AP Diplomatic Writer Barry Schweid covered Carter's announcement in this Sept. 17, 1978, story. —- President Carter announced to the world Sunday night that a 'framework for peace' in the Middle East had been reached at his summit meeting with Egypt’s Anwar Sadat and Israel’s Menachem Begin. Flanked by President Sadat and Prime Minister Begin, he said documents signed by the two leaders 'will provide that Israel may live in peace within secure borders.' The far-reaching accord commits Egypt and Israel to work to conclude a peace treaty within three months. The treaty would be the first formal recognition of the Jewish state by any of its Arab neighbors since the creation of Israel in 1948. Begin, in a friendly challenge to Sadat, urged that the treaty be concluded before three months elapse. Sadat applauded the overture and nodded in agreement. Carter said Israel would withdraw its forces from the West Bank of the Jordan River. The agreement allows the Israelis to maintain a security presence in specified bases while ending its military rule of the territory, taken in the Six-Day War of 1967. Administration officials, who declined to be identified, said no American troops would be involved in the security arrangements negotiated at the summit, although they did not rule out American involvement sometime in the future. The 1.1 million Palestinian Arabs living on the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip on the Sinai 'will have the right to participate in the determination of their own future,' Carter said. On the Sinai front, Carter said, Israel would withdraw its forces quickly, with the result being establishment of diplomatic relations between the two old foes in a 30-year conflict. Carter’s appearance with Sadat and Begin at the White House was nationally televised. Flags of the United States, Israel and Egypt stood behind them. The U.S. president, looking back on 13 days of 'long negotiation,' acknowledged that at times the talks faltered and it seemed that the patience of Sadat and Begin would run out. But Carter said results exceeded all expectations. Sadat, speaking next at a ceremony in the White House East Room, thanked Carter for fulfilling his commitment to serving as a 'full partner' in the talks. Sadat expressed gratitude to Carter for his 'spirit and dedication' and concluded with a prayer that the 'spirit of Camp David' would mark a new chapter in Middle East history. Begin, in a tribute to Carter, said 'he worked harder than our forefathers did in building the pyramids of Egypt.' The gentle reference to the Biblical period of Jewish slavery drew appreciative chuckles from the dignitaries on hand. 'The president of the United States won the day,' Begin said. 'Peace now celebrates a great victory for the nations of Egypt and Israel and for all mankind.' But before there is peace, Begin noted, Israel and Egypt have three months of negotiations ahead to conclude a peace treaty. 'Mr. President,' Begin said to Carter, 'you inscribed your name forever in the history of two ancient people, the people of Egypt and the people of Israel.' Turning to Sadat, the Israeli prime minister said there was no point in recounting the 'saga' of their differences during the negotiations. 'Everything belongs to the past,' Begin said. Now, once again, Begin said, he could refer to Sadat as 'my friend.' Begin and saluted Sadat as a friend after the Egyptian leader’s historic visit to Jerusalem last November. But when the differences deepened after their talk at Ismailia, Egypt, in December, Begin no longer used the phrase. When Begin concluded his remarks, he embraced Carter and then Sadat. The three leaders then signed the 'framework for peace.' Carter said the framework can be used later by Israel to negotiate peace treaties with her other Arab neighbors, Syria, Jordan and Lebanon. After signing the documents, the three leaders shook hands. Although differences remain, the prospect of peace between Egypt and Israel by Christmas was a stunning surprise, made even more dramatic by the deep secrecy imposed during the negotiations. One question mark remaining was whether the concessions offered by Israel to the Palestinian Arabs living on the West Bank of the Jordan into the peace process. Carter said he hoped 'the foresight and wisdom' demonstrated by Sadat and Begin will guide all nations 'as they continue to strive toward peace.' The three leaders smiled and waved as they boarded a jet helicopter to depart Camp David for Washington. Carter climbed in first. Begin deferred to Sadat and urged the Egyptian leader to board second. The three men and the helicopter were lit by the glare of floodlights. When the helicopter touched down on the White House south lawn, the three leaders were greeted by some 50 dignitaries and members of the White House staff. Each of the three got a kiss from the president’s wife, Rosalynn. Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd said Carter asked to explain the agreements to a joint session of Congress at 8 p.m. EDT on Monday. The administration officials, who declined to be identified, said the documents 'provide a framework for continuing negotiations' and not a completed agreement. Forty issues remain unresolved after the 12-day summit, including the ultimate fate of Israeli settlements in the Sinai and the nature of the final arrangement for the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The agreement on the Sinai comes closer to being a final settlement, the officials said. It provides that Israel eventually restore Egyptian sovereignty 'throughout the Sinai' and that Egypt will make peace and establish normal relations with Israel. The Sinai agreement calls for phased withdrawal of Israeli troops, starting as soon as six months from Sunday night and the return of Sinai airfields to Egyptian civilian control. It commits both Israel and Egypt to agreeing to a treaty within three months, with a major Israeli withdrawal three to nine months after the treaty is signed. After the first Israeli withdrawal, the two countries agreed to establish normal diplomatic relations, the administration officials said. The final Israeli withdrawal is to take place two to three years after the signing of the peace treaty. The treaty also is designed to provide security zones for Israel in the Sinai as well as a program of arms reduction in the area. The major disagreement on the Sinai is the fate of Israeli settlements in captured territory. The officials said Egypt demands that Israel remove the settlements. Israeli negotiators wanted the issue to be decided during the negotiations, the officials said. But they added that the Israel is agreed to let their parliament decide within two weeks on how the question should be resolved. The agreement on the West Bank and Gaza Strip is much less specific, reflecting the difficulties in that area. In that agreement, the officials said, Egypt and Israel agree to a five year transition period during which 'the inhabitants will attain full autonomy,' but Israel will be able to station troops in specified bases in both the West Bank and Gaza areas. The framework leaves unsettled the issues of the final borders between Israel and the new Palestinian entity and whether that entity will be a state, an affiliate of Jordan or something else. The countries involved will invite Jordan to join their negotiations along with representatives of the Palestinians living in the two territories. Jordan also will be invited to play a 'security role' during the period. Israel committed itself to establishing no new settlements in those territories during the negotiations, the officials said. If and when a final agreement is reached, elected representatives of West Bank and Gaza inhabitants, predominately Palestinians, will have an opportunity to pass judgment on it, the officials said. They said Israel and Egypt could agree only to exchanging letters on the emotional issue of the fate of Jerusalem. The officials would not disclose what was to be said in those letters. The fact that Carter was meeting side-by-side with Sadat and Begin suggested that the summit had not ended in failure. The White House appearance was arranged after Carter had mounted an all-out, 11th hour effort to narrow differences between Egypt and Israel on a peace formula. As Carter drove for an agreement, facing a Sunday night deadline concurred in by all three leaders, officials of Egypt, Israel and the United States privately indicated he was making progress. George Sherman, a State Department spokesman, disclosed the arrangement for the joint appearance after a day of negotiating at all levels in the summit delegations. Declining to say whether the Camp David summit had concluded, Sherman declared he had been authorized to make only a 'procedural announcement.' In his final effort, Carter shuttled between Sadat and Begin and back again. But no three-way meeting was reported before the leaders appeared together for their wrapup announcement. Carter went to Sadat’s quarters at Camp David for a 45-minute meeting Sunday morning. Then, the White House said, Carter spent six minutes - from 3:27 p.m. to 3:33 p.m. EDT - with Begin. That session was followed by a second Carter-Sadat meeting. It lasted an hour and 50 minutes. Israeli sources said, meanwhile, that Sadat also met with Israeli Defense Minister Ezer Weizman. A White House announcement said 'intensive consultations within and among the three delegations continued.' No plans for a Carter-Begin-Sadat meeting were announced, however. They last met formally on Sept. 7. In Washington, the president’s wife, Rosalynn, told a White House meeting of Hispanic leaders that Carter 'says today Sunday is the last day. It might go to midnight. He just doesn’t know . . . He needs your prayers in these last hours of the summit meeting at Camp David.' However, in Atlantic City, N.J., President Lloyd McBride of the United Steelworkers Union told a news conference that Carter had put off speaking to the union’s convention from Tuesday to Wednesday. A White House aide, Robert Neuman, said the delay is 'due to the summit.' At Camp David, a White House official confirmed that Carter had postponed his speech one day. The official, who asked that his name not be used, said Carter would be involved in post-summit details even if the summit was concluded by Tuesday. Asked how Carter would report summit results to the nation, the official said the president had not yet decided. Congressional sources have said the White House has considered a presidential address to Congress or a nationally televised news conference. Begin declined an invitation to speak, in person or by telephone, to a Sunday afternoon meeting of an Israel Bonds leadership conference in Washington. A spokesman for the group, Gunther Lawrence, said Begin wanted to maintain a news blackout at the summit as long as the talks were in progress. While there was no word on specifics, Israeli sources expressed 'cautious optimism' after Carter and Begin ended a 45-hour session past midnight Saturday. One source, who declined to be identified, said 'a good atmosphere' characterized the session. An Egyptian editor, Moussa Sabry of Al Akhbar, reported -- without offering any details -- that an earlier, 2 1/2-hour session between Carter and Sadat had produced a 'dramatic development.' Those upbeat outlooks contrasted with pessimism reflected by the Egyptian press when summit spokesman Jody Powell first announced the 12-day conference would end by Sunday night. Powell said the leaders were likely to meet again in a three-way session — the first in 10 days -- before the end of the summit. Among items under discussion in the final hours was a wrapup communique. Powell indicated there might be more than one. As the final countdown began, Carter attended Sunday services conducted at Camp David by Cecil Reed, a Protestant chaplain from nearby Ft. Ritchie, Md. When Carter set up his separate meetings with Sadat and Begin, sources close to all three delegations reported the negotiations were at a delicate and critical stage. At that point, Powell said, there was still no agreement on a 'framework' for future negotiations between Egypt and Israel. That was Carter’s minimal goal when he invited Sadat and Begin to his secluded retreat in Maryland’s Catoctin Mountains. Apart from procedural disputes, the two sides apparently had not settled any of the key issues. These center on whether Begin was willing to commit Israel to a withdrawal from the West Bank of the Jordan River and on how Israel’s security would be protected. Sen. Henry M. Jackson, D-Wash., chairman of the arms control subcommittee, told the Israeli Bonds conference that efforts to include a West Bank settlement in an overall Middle East agreement was a mistake and doomed to failure. 'I am convinced that the Israelis are prepared to return the Sinai to Egypt in exchange for peace,' Jackson said. Carter proposed the Sunday night deadline and Sadat and Begin concurred, according to Powell, spokesman for all three governments. He said the decision grew out a shared conclusion that the issue in dispute 'had been certainly aired.' Sadat and Begin have not had a face-to-face negotiating session since Sept. 7. Since then, Carter has shuttled between them. Sadat has met with Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan and Defense Minister Ezer Weizman. American officials have tried to minimize the long time since the last formal meeting between Sadat and Begin. Still, there were persistent rumors of personal differences between the two leaders. Powell has not denied the rumors directly. 'I simply have not tried to keep a running tab on the personal feelings of these two men,' he said on Friday.	https://apnews.com/article/jimmy-carter-camp-david-israel-egypt-6cc9a593003f717df4eb8f7576d37398	2024-12-30T20:04:33-08:00	
No heating, no light': Moldovans fear looming energy shortage as Russia halts gas supplies	CHISINAU, Moldova (AP) — On a frigid morning in Moldova’s capital, 39-year-old postal worker Petru Murzin braces for a difficult winter as he fears a looming energy shortage could leave many Moldovans with 'no heating, no light.' His concerns aren’t unfounded. On Jan. 1, Russia’s state-owned energy giant Gazprom is set to halt gas supplies to the European Union candidate country over an alleged $709 million debt for past supplies, a figure fiercely disputed by Moldova’s pro-Western government, that has accused Moscow of weaponizing energy as a political tool to destabilize the country. 'I feel that we’ve entered a crisis that is quite difficult to resolve … which worries me greatly,' Murzin told The Associated Press in Chisinau. 'Price increases are one thing, but when there is no gas at all, that’s something entirely different.' The cessation will stop gas flowing to the Kuciurgan power plant, the country’s largest, which is situated in the separatist pro-Russian Transnistria region. The gas-operated plant generates electricity that powers a significant portion of Moldova proper. 'There will be no heating, no light,' Murzin added. 'We are entering a very difficult year.' Transnistria, which broke away after a short war in 1992 and is not recognized by most countries, also declared its own state of emergency earlier this month, fearing the region will not receive gas supplies. A large majority of Transnistria’s 470,000 people speak Russian as their first language and some 200,000 are Russian citizens. On Dec. 13, Moldova’s parliament voted in favor of imposing a state of emergency in the energy sector, as the looming crisis threatened to leave the former Soviet republic without sufficient energy this winter, sparking fears it could trigger a humanitarian crisis in Transnistria, where the impact of the gas cutoff could be immediately felt. Many observers have predicted that the looming energy shortage could force residents in Transnistria to travel to Moldova to seek basic amenities to get through winter, a season in which temperatures throughout the country regularly drop below subzero degrees Celsius. Cristian Cantir, a Moldovan associate professor of international relations at Oakland University, says that Moscow is likely trying to exploit a 'potential humanitarian crisis in Transnistria to overwhelm Moldova’s already-strained resources' to amplify tensions between Chisinau and the region's de facto capital, Tiraspol. 'It could stoke fears among the Moldovan electorate of a violent conflict, and give fodder to pro-Russian parties who will accuse Chisinau of being responsible for increased prices for gas and electricity, which will be a major campaign issue' ahead of the country's parliamentary elections in 2025, he said. The unprecedented situation prompted Chisinau last week to implement a series of energy-saving measures beginning Jan. 1, which include reducing lighting in public and commercial buildings by at least 30%, and energy-intensive businesses operating during off-peak hours. 'We’ll probably have to save power till we have a solution,' said Nicoleta Neagu, who is from Moldova but works in Germany. 'I hope we’ll look at this seriously and not waste power on not-so-useful things.' After Gazprom announced it would halt gas flows, Moldovan Prime Minister Dorin Recean accused Moscow of using energy 'as a political weapon' and said his government does not recognize the debt cited by the Russian energy giant, which he said has been 'invalidated by an international audit.' 'This decision confirms once again the intention of the Kremlin to leave the inhabitants of the Transnistrian region without light and heat in the middle of the winter,' he said. For 30-year-old Chisinau resident Iuliana, who did not want to give her surname, power outages would prevent her from doing her online job, which could also be untenable if the heating goes off in the middle of winter in the country of about 2.5 million people. 'We’re afraid, but we’re happy that there’s no snow and the temperatures aren’t that low and we can turn on the heating maybe only in the evening if we work at an office,' she said. 'But I work from home and I’ll be directly affected.' She also noted that Moldova has faced multiple crises in recent years, 'But regarding power and gas, it’s the first time we face this,' she said. Moldovan President Maia Sandu criticized Russia on Monday for Gazprom’s decision and said that the country has gas supplies 'for the heating season' and measures will be taken 'to ensure uninterrupted electricity supply,' adding that plans are also in place to provide humanitarian aid to residents in Transnistria. 'The Kremlin is again using energy blackmail in an attempt to destabilize the situation, to influence the 2025 parliamentary elections and to undermine our European journey,' she said. 'It is important to remain united, show solidarity, and trust in Moldova and its people. And to use energy rationally.' Moldova has repeatedly claimed Russia is conducting a vast 'hybrid war' against the country by meddling in elections, funding anti-government protests, and running vast disinformation campaigns to try to topple the government and derail the country's EU aspirations. The Kuciurgan plant was privatized in 2004 by Transnistrian officials and later sold to a Russian state-owned company, but Chisinau doesn’t recognize the privatization. On Monday, Recean asked the justice minister to review nationalization legislation, to potentially recover 'strategic assets that were forcefully taken over.' Citing findings by British and Norwegian audit firms, Moldova claims its debt stands close to $8.6 million, a fraction of that claimed by the Russian energy giant. Gazprom said in a statement Saturday that it reserved the right to take further action, including terminating its contract with Moldovagaz, Moldova’s main gas operator, in which the Russian company owns a majority stake. In late 2022, months after Russia fully invaded neighboring Ukraine, Moldova suffered major power outages following Russian strikes on Ukraine, which is interconnected to the Kuciurgan plant. When the war next door started, Moldova was entirely dependent on Moscow for natural gas but has since pushed to diversify and expand its energy sources, and now relies on obtaining gas from other European markets. Murzin, the postal worker, is expecting to see large inflows of people from Transnistria crossing the border once the shortage hits. 'I think cars will line up for several kilometers at the border,' he said. 'Many people will come here, hoping for warmth.' ___ Associated Press writer Stephen McGrath contributed from Warwick, England.	https://apnews.com/article/moldova-energy-crisis-russia-transnistria-gas-europe-3cb90f12ad5274bda67f99a1c4619abf	2024-12-30T20:03:51-08:00	
Jimmy Carter sought to expand democracy worldwide long after he left the White House	HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) — Amid everything else on his desk — the Iran hostage crisis, domestic economic turmoil, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and a grueling 1980 reelection fight — President Jimmy Carter elevated the independence of a country in southern Africa as a top agenda item. Carter hosted then-Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe at the White House soon after his country achieved independence and later described Zimbabwe's adoption of democracy as 'our greatest single success.' Three decades later, Carter, who was long out of office, found the door slammed shut when he and other dignitaries sought to visit Zimbabwe on a humanitarian mission to observe reported human rights abuses after a violent disputed election in 2008. He had become a critic of Mugabe’s regime and was denied a visa. Carter didn’t give up. From neighboring South Africa, he relied on emissaries from Zimbabwe for testimony on violence and allegations of electoral fraud. The effort reflected the former president's long commitment to promoting democracy worldwide. This 'more than anything else cemented Carter’s legacy' as an advocate for free and fair elections across Africa, said Eldred Masunungure, a former political science lecturer at the University of Zimbabwe. 'Carter didn’t change. Zimbabwe did. Mugabe swayed from the democratic ideals that Carter held so dear,' he said. 'The incident demonstrates Carter’s consistency, the steadfastness.' Zimbabwe’s evolution toward autocracy turned out to be the kind of scenario that the Carter Center has long sought to prevent by deploying observers and developing voting standards in countries struggling to form democracies. Established in 1982, two years after Carter lost his bid for a second term, the center has been Carter's signature effort to promote fair elections as a vehicle for peace. It has sent observers to monitor some 125 elections in 40 countries and three tribal nations, and has been credited with helping expand democracy across the globe. Carter’s 'moral authority, the trust people put in him and the credibility of someone who had both won and lost an election' contributed to these successes, David Carroll, head of the center’s democracy program, told The Associated Press. Carter, who died Sunday at 100, was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 for the center’s work supporting elections, promoting human rights and helping developing countries cultivate economic, social and public health institutions. Its elections work began in Panama, where Carter became concerned about the 1989 elections after reports of armed militia members in civilian clothes confiscating voting records during the night. The Carter Center had just decided to expand its mission of conflict resolution and human rights to include vote monitoring, concluding that democratic elections were essential to resolving political disputes. 'In my fumbling Spanish, I stood up on a table, and I denounced the election as fraudulent,' Carter recalled in a 2015 video marking the center’s 100th election observer mission. 'There was later another election, which was honest and fair, and that was the birth of real democracy in Panama.' The center also helped rescue a peace process in Nepal, then oversaw the country’s twice-postponed elections in 2008 to elect an assembly that would be tasked with writing a constitution. Carter made several trips to the South Asian nation, holding marathon negotiations with former rebels and top politicians to keep the peace process on track. 'There was deadlock in the country. Political parties were not sitting together, and there was no way out on how the process will move on,' said Bhojraj Pokharel, Nepal’s chief election commissioner in 2008, who later worked with Carter in Congo and Myanmar. On Nepal's election day, Carter traveled to dozens of polling stations talking to voters. Polling was peaceful despite earlier fears of violence. 'His presence itself was a message to the Nepalese population and voters about the integrity of the election,' Pokharel said. The Carter Center often works in countries with little or no experience in representative government and where trust has all but evaporated because of violence. After Bolivia held elections in 2019 that the Organization of American States said were marred by fraud, the country’s electoral tribunal invited the Carter Center to observe elections the following year. The center deployed a team to Bolivia and later commended the country for elections it called impartial and transparent. The Carter Center’s 'evaluation was important not only for how the international community viewed us but also for how Bolivian society evaluated the electoral process,' said Salvador Romero, the tribunal’s president at the time. Similar results have been difficult to obtain recently in Africa, where many countries emerging from decades of colonialism have seen forceful takeovers and disputed elections. In Nigeria, Tunisia, Zambia and Ivory Coast, Carter Center observers noted violence, killings, vote-buying, uneven playing fields for political parties and candidates, and a general lack of trust in elections. In Tunisia, frustration has replaced the wave of hope brought by the 2010 Arab Spring uprising. A new parliament was convened in March 2023, two years after President Kais Saied suspended parliament and started legislating by decree. The 11% turnout for parliamentary elections marked 'a low point' for the country's democracy, The Carter Center said, and some election observer groups were denied accreditation for the October 2024 presidential contest. At times, Carter personally intervened to keep African peace processes on track by trying to persuade warlords and rebels to support elections, rather than the use of force, in their quests for power. In recent years, the Carter Center’s elections work turned toward the U.S. Its teams deployed to Oklahoma in 2017 at the request of the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes following elections plagued with problems. In 2013, ballots had been moved from office to office and stored without proper security, eroding confidence in the integrity of the vote. A recount then overturned the results, tribal Gov. Reggie Wassana said. The Carter Center’s presence in the later election made 'a huge difference, and it restored some faith among tribal members,' Wassana said. Until 2020, the center tried to stay away from broader political issues in the United States, according to Carroll. But the center noticed threats to American democracy were increasing, which prompted a decision to expand programs within the U.S. 'If we saw the same conditions in another country that we were seeing in the U.S. — the lack of trust in election institutions, polarization and growing concern of political violence — it is exactly the kind of country we would prioritize to see if we could play a constructive role,' Carroll said. Faith in U.S. elections, most notably among a large segment of Republican voters, eroded after the 2020 election amid former President Donald Trump's false claims that Democrats had rigged the vote. There was no evidence of widespread fraud or manipulation of voting machines in that election. In the 2024 presidential election, which Trump won, the center did some limited observation in New Mexico, Montana and Fulton County, Georgia. In many U.S. states, election observers are limited to political party representatives, with no provisions for nonpartisan, independent groups. The center is working to change that. Carter's leadership on democracy issues remains a north star for the center, Carroll said. 'You can help strong systems be in place, but they need to be watched continually. You can never rest on your record on democracy and elections. You always have to be vigilant and keep an eye on the process,' he said. ___ Cassidy reported from Atlanta.

Zimbabwe's new currency woes hit traditional stores while illegal night bazaars flourish	HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) — Batsirai Pabwe picked detergents, toothpaste, snacks and some pasta among several grocery items spread on the tarmac of a car parking space — an unorthodox night bazaar lit by cellphone flashlights and fluorescent lamps in Zimbabwe’s capital, Harare. Traditional stores are struggling to survive as the volatility of Zimbabwe's new currency pushes prices up. Many like Pabwe now shun them for much cheaper informal markets that pop up at night to avoid the glare of authorities. From dusk, sidewalks, store or office verandahs and car parking spaces burst into unorthodox open air bazaars, offering anything from groceries to fresh meat, electronics, clothes, medicines, fashion accessories and stationery. Unfettered by expenses such as rising energy costs, taxes and laws that force formal retailers to accept the local currency at artificially low official exchange rates, informal traders, including children, offer better bargains. A box of juice that sells for $3 in a supermarket costs half of that on the street. 'It’s my first time shopping here. My friend told me that it’s much cheaper than the supermarkets,' 30-year-old Pabwe said, visibly relieved as he filled up a plastic bag with items for just $20. 'I decided to give it a try and I really enjoyed it.' For the same amount in a supermarket a week ago, Pabwe said he only managed to get 'meat and spices and they were not even that much.' The once-prosperous southern African nation of 15 million people in April introduced a new gold-backed currency called ZiG, short for Zimbabwe Gold, to replace one that had been battered by depreciation and often outright rejection by the people. It is the country’s sixth attempt at a new currency since the spectacular 2009 collapse of the Zimbabwe dollar and adoption of the U.S. dollar as legal tender amid hyperinflation of 5 billion percent, one of the world’s worst currency crashes to date. The U.S. dollar has since remained legal tender alongside successive local currencies. The latest currency, the world’s newest, came with pomp and fanfare — promotional catchy jingles and songs played repeatedly on public radio, television and online. Seven months on, the ZiG seems to be tanking, like its predecessors. The gap between official and black market exchange rates continues to widen, with many people and informal traders who dominate the economy again preferring the more stable dollar. Traditional stores, forced by authorities to charge using the local currency, are increasing prices to make ends meet. But they have also become uncompetitive against unregulated informal markets, the Retailers Association of Zimbabwe, an industry representative group, said in September. It warned of store closures, saying the situation is 'clearly untenable.' In October, Pick n Pay, one of Africa’s biggest grocery chains that operates more than 70 stores jointly with a local partner in Zimbabwe, said that it had ‘impaired' its investment in Zimbabwe 'to a book value of zero' because of the 'deteriorating economic conditions.' 'In every transaction business is doing in the formal setup, it’s making an exchange rate loss that cannot be compensated. The major issue here is a currency crisis,' said Gift Mugano, an economics professor. Huge overheads worsen the retailers’ situation. 'Everything is against their survival. The informal sector works at night, (if there is) no electricity they use their phones, they don’t care. They are there for survival,' Mugano said. The contrast is palpable in Harare’s Central Business District, where only a few shoppers solemnly scanned prices in a supermarket on a recent day. Soothing music played from speakers inside but was drowned out by the buzz created outside by hordes of street vendors shouting out bargains to a sea of shoppers. 'Business is booming,' said Oswald Gari, a vendor, adding that he only works at night when the police leave. Gari, 51, said he's fending for his six children and four nephews under his care from the night trade. He harbors no hope of finding formal employment in a country where once roaring industrial sites are being turned into giant warehouses for imported goods, many which end up on the streets, and rail tracks are now overgrown with weeds. More than 80% of Zimbabwe’s employable population ekes out a living in the informal sector, according to official figures and the International Labor Organization. For Pabwe, shopping from the informal night markets means less headaches. 'It’s quite confusing, especially for people like me who really don’t understand the value of the ZiG. I always get confused when I get into supermarkets,' he said. He was satisfied with his shopping at night bazaar. 'I got everything I was looking for and the pricing is really affordable. I actually managed to buy a handful for just $20. I even got my washing powder and dishwashing liquid,' he said. 'I think I will do this more often.'	https://apnews.com/article/zimbabwe-night-markets-zig-currency-gold-19b531d624d3e20a97cfe5f5ac529a78	2024-12-30T19:05:15-08:00	
China's manufacturing activity slows in December as trade risks grow	HONG KONG (AP) — China's factory activity expanded at a slower pace in December, official data showed on Tuesday, despite recent stimulus measures and in the face of increasing trade risks. The Purchasing Managers’ Index, based on a survey of factory managers, slipped to 50.1 in December from 50.3 the previous month, the National Bureau of Statistics said Tuesday. It was the third straight monthly reading above 50, a level that indicates an expansion of manufacturing activity. A parallel purchasing managers’ index for the non-manufacturing sector, which covers construction and services, rose to 52.2 points up from 50 points in November.	https://apnews.com/article/china-manufacturing-economy-tariff-2e4786d0686b57891c8a73d0717e0323	2024-12-30T18:52:29-08:00	
Stock market today: Asian shares trade mixed, as Tokyo and Seoul are shuttered for New Year holidays	TOKYO (AP) — Asian markets shares were mixed on Tuesday, with trading closed in Tokyo and Seoul for New Year holidays. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 in Sydney skidded 0.6% to 8,182.80 in early trading. Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 0.5% to 20,140.91, while the Shanghai Composite lost 0.2% to 3,399.74 after Chinese manufacturing data seemed to show that Beijing's stimulus measures have not done enough to boost the nation's sluggish economy. On Monday, U.S. stocks closed broadly lower, with the S&amp;P 500 falling 1.1% to 5,906.94, its third straight decline. Roughly 90% of stocks within the index lost ground. On the second-to-last day of 2024, the benchmark index was still on track for its second straight yearly gain of more than 20%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1% to 42,573.73, and the Nasdaq composite ended 1.2% lower, at 19,486.78. Big Tech companies were the heaviest weights on the market, worsening the slump. Apple and Microsoft fell 1.3%. Their pricey valuations tend to have an outsized impact on the broader market. Elsewhere among tech stocks, Meta Platforms dropped 1.4%, Netflix slipped 0.8% and Amazon fell 1.1%. The S&amp;P 500's technology and communication services sectors have been the market's high flyers, notching gains of 37.1% and 39.9%, respectively, so far this year. Boeing fell 2.3% after one of its jets skidded off a runway in South Korea, killing 179 of the 181 people aboard. South Korea is inspecting all 737-800 aircraft operated by airlines in the country. The disaster was yet another blow for Boeing following a machinists strike, further safety problems with its troubled top-selling aircraft and a plunging stock price. Its shares have declined more than 30% this year. Airlines that fly Boeing jets wavered in the wake of the crash. United Airlines fell 1.4% and Delta Air Lines dropped 0.9%. Markets are nearing the close of a stellar year driven by a growing economy, solid consumer spending and a strong jobs market. Wall Street expects companies within the S&amp;P 500 to report broad earnings growth of more than 9% for the year, according to FactSet. The final figures will be tallied following fourth-quarter reports that start in a few weeks. Investors were encouraged by inflation cooling throughout the year to close to the Federal Reserve's 2% target. That raised hopes that the central bank would deliver a steady stream of interest rate cuts, which would ease borrowing costs and fuel more economic growth. The Fed cut interest rates three times in 2024, but has signaled a more cautious approach heading into 2025 as inflation shows signs of reheating. The latest report on consumer prices showed that inflation edged slightly higher, to 2.7%, in November. President-elect Donald Trump's threats to hike tariffs have added to worries about the potential for inflation to reignite. Companies typically pass along the higher costs from tariffs on goods and raw materials to consumers. Investors have very little corporate and economic news to review this week, which is shortened by the New Year holiday. U.S. markets will be closed on Wednesday. On Thursday, investors will get an updated snapshot of U.S. construction spending for the month of November. On Friday, Wall Street will receive an update on manufacturing for December. In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude rose 39 cents to $71.38 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, added 22 cents to $74.39 a barrel. In currency trading, the U.S. dollar fell to 156.41 Japanese yen from 156.90 yen. The euro cost $1.0411, little changed from $1.0410. ___ AP Business Writers Damian J.

South Korean adoptees and families rocked by fraud allegations	Her greatest fear, dormant for decades, came rushing back in an instant: had she adopted and raised a kidnapped child? Peg Reif’s daughter, adopted from South Korea in the 1980s, had sent her a link to a documentary detailing how the system that made their family was rife with fraud: documents falsified, babies switched, children snatched off the street and sent abroad. Reif wept. She was among more than 120 who contacted The Associated Press this fall, after a series of stories and a documentary made with Frontline exposed how Korea created a baby pipeline, designed to ship children abroad as quickly as possible to meet Western demand. The reporting shook adoption communities around the world with details about how agencies competed for babies — pressuring mothers, bribing hospitals, fabricating documents. Most who wrote were adoptees, but some were adoptive parents like Reif, horrified to learn they had supported this system. 'I can’t stand the thought that somebody lost their child,' Reif said. 'I can’t stop thinking about it. I don’t know how to make it right. I don’t know if I can.' Forty years ago, she was struggling with infertility. She and her husband pinned their dreams for a family on adopting a baby from Mexico, paid an agency thousands of dollars and waited for months. Then the agency’s directors were arrested, and they learned that those Mexican babies had been taken from their families against their will. Reif was heartbroken, but recalls even now looking at her husband and saying: 'thank God we don’t have a child who was stolen.' But now she isn’t sure of that. Because then they adopted two Korean children, and brought them to their home in rural Wisconsin, first a son and then a daughter. The two were not biological siblings, but both arrived with strangely similar stories in their files: their young unmarried mothers worked in factories with fathers who disappeared after they got pregnant. Back then, Reif still believed the common narrative about foreign adoption: it saved children who might otherwise live the rest of their lives in an orphanage, die or be damned to poverty. 'I don’t believe that anymore,' Reif said. 'I don’t know what to believe.' Cameron Lee Small, a therapist in Minneapolis whose practice caters to adoptees and their families, said many are feeling an intense sense of betrayal. Individual adoptees had long shared stories of falsified identities. But the revelations this year pointed to systemwide practices that routinely changed babies’ origin stories to process adoptions quickly, including listing them as 'abandoned' even when they had known parents. Small, who was also adopted from Korea in the 1980s, summarized what he’s been hearing from adoptees: 'I’m kind of back to nothing. What do I believe now? Who can I believe?' Reif’s daughter, Jenn Hamilton, spent her life thinking she was unwanted, often quipping: 'that’s what happens when you’re found in a dumpster as a baby.' It has taken a toll on her all her life: She’s been happily married for 9 years, she said, but she has this insatiable insecurity: 'I constantly find myself asking my husband, ‘are you mad at me? Did I do something wrong?’ Do you want to leave me?’' She has no idea anymore if abandonment was ever really her story, with revelations of abuses so systemic that even the Korean government likened it to 'trafficking.' 'You can’t make that many mistakes. It has to be intentional. It was this huge tree of deception,' she said. 'I feel disgusted.' Holt International, the US-based agency that pioneered adoptions from Korea, did not respond to repeated requests for comment for this story. Reform is sweeping across Europe — countries have launched investigations, halted foreign adoptions and apologized to adoptees for failing to protect them. But the United States, which has taken in the most adopted children by far, has not done a review of its own history or culpability. The U.S. State Department told AP this summer that it would work with its historian to piece together its history, and detailed initial findings that some documents might have been falsified. But it said there was no evidence that U.S. officials were aware of it. The State Department has since said that it has 'been unable to identify any records that could provide insight into the U.S. government role in adoptions from South Korea in the 1970s and 1980s.' Korea’s National Police Agency confirmed an increase in adoptees registering their DNA for family searches — both at domestic police stations and diplomatic offices across North America and Europe — in the weeks following the release of the AP stories and documentary in September. More than 120 adoptees registered their DNA in October and November, compared to an average of less than 30 a month from January to August. Korea’s government has maintained that adoptions were a necessary tool to care for needy children, including babies of unwed mothers or other children deemed as abandoned. However, Korea’s Ministry of Health and Welfare acknowledged to AP that the adoption boom in the 1970s and 80s was possibly fueled by a desire to reduce welfare costs. Korea’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission has been investigating government accountability over foreign adoption problems since 2022, prompted by complaints filed by hundreds of adoptees, and is expected to release an interim report in February. The Commission has posted the AP stories on its website. A law passed in 2023 mandates that all adoption records be transferred from private agencies to a government department called the National Center for the Rights of the Child by July, to centralize the handling of family search requests. The center has confirmed that private agencies hold about 170,000 adoption files, but director Chung Ick-Joong doubts it will acquire a space to store and manage all these records in time, due to financial constraints and other challenges. The agency expects family search requests to increase dramatically – 'possibly by 10-fold,' according to Chung — yet has funding to add only five staff members to its team of six searchers. Chung acknowledged that flaws in adoption laws had persisted for decades, and Korea only required adoptions to go through courts and birth records to be preserved after 2012. 'It’s difficult to determine who was responsible for the inaccuracies in records before then,' he said. 'The adoption agency might have been at fault, the biological parents may have lied, or something might have gone wrong at the orphanage…..no one truly knows what the truth is.' Korean adoption agencies have mostly declined AP’s requests for comment in recent months, often citing privacy concerns. Advocates insist that most adoptive families thrive, with both the parents and children happily living their lives without questioning the industry as Reif and Hamilton have. Hamilton grew up in a rural, almost exclusively white community in Wisconsin, and back then all she wanted was to be accepted. But having children of her own changed that. When her first child was born, she looked at him, and it took her breath away. 'It can’t explain it, like this is the first person I know in my life that I’m biologically related to,' she said. She wanted to learn her own history, so her children could know theirs. She wrote a letter to her adoption agency, which within weeks connected her with a woman they said was her mother. It was emotional, shocking. But soon she felt like she had more questions than answers. The woman’s name didn’t match the one listed on paperwork, and the name she gave for the father was also different. Birthdates didn’t match, the birthplace didn’t either. They had not met in a factory, she said, they had been pen pals. Hamilton asked the woman to take a DNA test, but she said she didn’t know how to access one. Hamilton came to believe this woman was not her birth mother. The AP’s reporting found numerous cases where agencies connected adoptees with supposed birth families, only for them to later discover after emotional meetings that they weren’t related at all. Hamilton has been trying to untangle the DNA results on her father’s side, contacting people distantly related, cousins once removed, half great aunts. 'It becomes an obsession,' Hamilton said. 'It’s like a puzzle that you start, and you have to find the missing pieces.' Lynelle Long, the founder of InterCountry Adoptee Voices, the largest organization of adoptees in the world, said governments at the very least need to legally mandate that agencies provide adoptees with their full and redacted documents, without the payment now often required. Long said parents like Reif have an important role, because in Western countries, laws always favored the desires of adoptive parents — designed to make adoptions quicker and easier. Many clung to the narrative that they saved needy orphans who should be grateful, she said, especially in the U.S., where the reckoning rocking Europe has not taken hold. 'We really need adoptive parents in the United States, if they have any inkling of guilt or shame or loss, to step up, take responsibility and demand that legislation be put in place to criminalize these practices and prevent it from ever happening again,' Long said. Hamilton is close to her parents; she just renovated the basement to accommodate their visits. She’s sad for herself, she said, but she’s sadder for her mother, who is desperate to learn if her children actually had parents somewhere, searching for them. 'And I’m like, ’why, so you can send us back?' Hamilton said. 'I don’t want to be a victim.' She said she’s glad she was adopted, and does not long for that different, alternative life in Korea. Reif loves her children profoundly, she said. But she doesn’t think she would adopt from abroad again, if she’d known then what she knows now. 'I’d rather be childless than think I have somebody else’s child that didn’t want to give them up,' she said. 'I think of somebody taking my child. Those poor families, I just can’t imagine it.'	https://apnews.com/article/south-korean-adoptions-investigation-united-states-europe-fa035f2b7b57358f71e0b7cca4c20f85	2024-12-30T18:01:09-08:00	
South Korean court issues warrants to detain impeached President Yoon and search his office	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea's anti-corruption agency said Tuesday that a court has issued warrants to detain impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol and search his office. The Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials said in a statement that the Seoul Western District Court issued warrants to detain Yoon over his stunning yet short-lived martial law decree earlier this month and to search the presidential office in central Seoul. The agency said it is investigating whether his declaration of martial law amounted to rebellion. Yoon's powers have been suspended since the opposition-controlled National Assembly voted to impeach him on Dec. 14. The Constitutional Court is to determine whether to dismiss Yoon as president or reinstate him. But he has since ignored repeated requests by investigative authorities to appear for questioning and allow them to search his office. Yoon has the presidential privilege of immunity from criminal prosecution, but it does not extend to allegations of rebellion or treason. The anti-corruption agency said it has no immediate plans on how to proceed with the court-issued warrants. A lawyer for Yoon denounced the agency’s request for the warrants on Monday, arguing it lacked the legal authority to investigate rebellion charges. Many observers earlier doubted that authorities would forcefully detain him because of the potential for clashes with the presidential security service. The security service has blocked attempts by investigators to search Yoon’s office, citing a law that prohibits searches on sites with state secrets without approval from those in charge of those areas. Yoon's imposition of martial law lasted only six hours but triggered huge political turmoil, halting high-level diplomacy and rattling financial markets. Yoon sent hundreds of soldiers and police officers to the National Assembly to block a vote on his decree, but enough lawmakers managed to enter the assembly chamber to overturn it unanimously. Yoon has argued his decree was a legitimate act of governance, calling it a warning to the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, which he has called 'a monster' and 'anti-state forces' that has used its legislative majority to impeach top officials, undermine the government’s budget, and which he claims sympathizes with North Korea. The country's political crisis deepened last Friday, when the Democratic Party and other small opposition parties voted to impeach acting President Han Duck-soo as well over wrangling over his refusal to fill in three justice seats at the Constitutional Court. Observers say adding more justices could affect the court's ruling on Yoon's impeachment. The deputy prime minister and finance minister, Choi Sang-mok, has become South Korea’s new interim leader.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-president-martial-law-yoon-warrant-4cf80153a9bd333147afb746adb49433	2024-12-30T15:51:35-08:00	
Army National Guard soldier from Indiana dies in non-combat incident in Iraq	WASHINGTON (AP) — A 34-year-old soldier serving with the Indiana National Guard in Iraq has died in a non-combat incident, the Army said Monday. Capt. Eric Richard Hart, 34, of Indianapolis, Indiana, died Saturday in Iraq, the Army National Guard said in a statement. Hart was assigned to the Headquarters and Headquarters Battalion of Indiana’s 38th Infantry Division in Iraq. His death is under investigation. While all combat operations have ceased for U.S. forces in Iraq, the U.S. maintains a presence of 2,500 troops to assist the Iraqi military in counter-Islamic State operations and training. Those forces have repeatedly come under attack in the 14 months since Hamas attacked Israel, spurring a wider, deadly response from Tel Aviv. During the last year, Iranian-backed forces have launched one-way attack drones, rockets and missiles at U.S. facilities in Iraq in response to Israel's military operations in Gaza and Lebanon. In September, the U.S. announced an agreement with the Iraqi government to wrap up the American-led coalition's military mission against the Islamic State group in Iraq by 2025. U.S. troops have departed some bases that they have long occupied during a two-decade-long military presence in the country. Washington has had a continuous presence in Iraq since its 2003 invasion. Although all U.S. combat forces left in 2011, thousands of troops returned in 2014 to help the Iraqi government defeat IS. Since the extremist group lost its hold on the territory it once seized, Iraqi officials have periodically called for a withdrawal of coalition forces, particularly in the wake of a U.S. airstrike in January 2020 that killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani and Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis outside the Baghdad airport. Before Monday's announcement, a total of 4,419 troops had died in Iraq since the beginning of the 2003 Operation Iraqi Freedom military campaign, including 3,482 combat deaths and 937 non-combat deaths, according to the latest Defense Department data. A total of 31,993 troops were wounded in action in Iraq. The Defense Department's summary does not include all of the forces who returned from war with wounds that surfaced later, such as post-traumatic stress disorder or toxic exposure.	https://apnews.com/article/us-soldier-death-noncombat-iraq-4add5ddbe19c49b27831508d7eebec47	2024-12-30T13:23:47-08:00	
South Korea plane crash is the deadliest in a year marked by several fatal aviation accidents	South Korea's worst aviation disaster in decades also was the year's deadliest plane crash worldwide, and time is running out on 2024. A Boeing 737-800 plane operated by South Korean budget airline Jeju Air came down with its front landing gear closed and struck a concrete fence Sunday at Muan International Airport in southern South Korea, killing 179 people. The deadliest accident in aviation history occurred in 1977, when two Boeing 747 jumbo jets collided on a foggy runway on the Spanish island of Tenerife, killing 583 of the 644 people on board the planes. Spanish investigators blamed the captain of the KLM 747 for taking off without clearance from air traffic controllers. In an act of terrorism, nearly 3,000 people died when al-Qaida hijackers crashed four jetliners into the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York, the Pentagon outside Washington, D.C., and a field in southwest Pennsylvania on Sept. 11, 2001. These are some of the significant aviation accidents that happened in 2024: Jan. 2: A large passenger plane and a Japanese coast guard aircraft collided on a Tokyo runway. All five people in the coast guard plane died, but all 379 on the Japan Airlines escaped before the jet became engulfed in flames. June 10: A military plane carrying Vice President Saulos Chilima of Malawi and former first lady Shanil Dzimbiri crashes in bad weather in the southern African nation's mountainous north. They and the eight other people on board are killed. July 24: In Nepal, a Saurya Airlines plane crashed shortly after taking off from the capital of Kathmandu, killing 18 people; one of the pilots survived. The Bombardier CRJ 200 plane was flying to a maintenance shop, and most of the passengers were mechanics or airline employees. Aug. 11: A turboprop operated by Brazil’s Voepass crashes, killing all 62 people on board. A preliminary report indicated that pilots saw ice building up on the outside of the plane, indicating a possible problem with the deicing system. Dec. 22: A small plane crashed in a mostly residential area of a Brazilian town popular with tourists, killing all 10 people on board and injuring more than a dozen on the ground. The cause was not immediately clear. Dec. 25: An Azerbaijan Airlines plane crashes in Kazakhstan, killing 39 people; 29 survive. Azerbaijan’s president said the plane was shot down accidentally by Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin apologized for the 'tragic incident,' but stopped short of accepting responsibility. Dec. 28: A Jeju Air Boeing 737-800 jetliner crashes in Seoul, killing 179 people. After an initial failed landing attempt, the plane received a bird strike warning from the ground control center. The pilot issued a distress signal before the plane came down, overshot the runway, slammed into a concrete fence and burst into flames. Two crew members survive after being pulled from the rear of the plane.	https://apnews.com/article/korea-deadliest-plane-crash-2024-a83c12c323c453d5b6d066950750e5a6	2024-12-30T10:46:20-08:00	
Losing your kids to doom scrolling? Greece is building a government app for that	ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Greece announced plans on Monday to enhance parental oversight of mobile devices in 2025 through a government-operated app, that will help get digital age verification and browsing controls. Dimitris Papastergiou, the minister of digital governance, said the Kids Wallet app, due to launch in March, was aimed at safeguarding children under the age of 15 from the risks of excessive and inappropriate internet use. The app will be run by a widely used government services platform and operate in conjunction with an existing smartphone app for adults to carry digital identification documents. 'It’s a big change,' Papastergiou told reporters, adding that the app would integrate advanced algorithms to monitor usage and apply strict authentication processes. 'The Kids Wallet application will do two main things: It will make parental control much easier, and it will be our official national tool for verifying the age of users,' he said. A survey published this month by a Greek research organization KMOP found that 76.6% of children aged 9-12 have access to the internet via personal devices, 58.6% use social media daily, and 22.8% have encountered inappropriate content. Many lack awareness of basic safety tools, such as the block and report buttons, authors of the study said. Papastergiou said the government was hoping to have the children’s app pre-installed on smartphones sold in Greece by the end of 2025. While facing criticism from some digital rights and religious groups, government-controlled apps and online services – many introduced during the pandemic – are generally popular in Greece, as they are seen as a way of bypassing historically slow bureaucratic procedures. The planned online child protection measures would go further than regulations already in place in several European countries by introducing more direct government involvement. They will also help hold social media platforms more accountable for enforcing age controls, Papastergiou said. 'What’s the elephant in the room? Clearly, it’s how we define and verify a person’s age,' he said. 'When you have an (online) age check, you might have a 14-year-old claiming they are 18. Or you could have someone who actually is a genuine 20-year-old … Now we can address that.'	https://apnews.com/article/athens-greece-internet-safety-apps-government-3cf566a0dea4076c1a6ef68944789257	2024-12-30T10:15:40-08:00	
Border arrests are little changed in December, ending Biden's term at lowest level	SAN DIEGO (AP) — Arrests for illegally crossing the border from Mexico in December are little changed from a month earlier, a U.S. official said Monday, hovering near the lowest levels since July 2020 and indicating that an anticipated surge ahead of Donald Trump’s inauguration as president hasn't happened. There were about 44,000 arrests during December as of Monday morning, suggesting the month will end close to the 46,612 arrests made in November, according to a senior U.S. Customs and Border Protection official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the count is preliminary and has not made public. December will mark the sixth straight month that arrests for illegal crossings were less than the monthly average in 2019, the official said. It also signals that final full month of President Joe Biden’s presidency will be at or near the lowest during his four years in office. Asked to comment on the latest numbers, the Homeland Security Department released a statement by Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, that said 'swift and effective implementation' of asylum restrictions in June resulted in another month below the 2019 average. 'This sustained success is the result of strong border enforcement, extensive engagement with our foreign partners, and the delivery of safe and lawful pathways that continue to provide humanitarian relief under our laws,' Mayorkas said. Arrests fell by about half from all-time high of 250,000 in December 2023 after Mexican officials increased enforcement within their own borders and by about half again after Biden introduced severe asylum limits. Texas' Rio Grande Valley was the second-busiest corridor for illegal crossings in December, up from fifth in November, likely a reflection of tactical decisions by smuggling organizations and Mexican law enforcement, the official said. San Diego remained the busiest corridor for illegal crossings. El Paso, Texas, was third and Tucson, Arizona was fourth. For the second straight month, those allowed to enter the country through official border crossings are expected to exceed arrests for illegal crossings, reflecting the Biden administration’s approach to create and expand legal pathways while severely restricting asylum for those who cross the border illegally. The vast majority of legal entries are done through an online appointment system called CBP One, which grants 1,450 slots a day. Trump has focused on launching mass deportations after taking office Jan. 20 but he and his aides have also emphasized border measures, touting a possible return of a policy to make asylum-seekers wait in Mexico for court hearings in U.S. immigration courts. Trump said in September that he planned to end CBP One appointments.	https://apnews.com/article/biden-trump-border-crossings-arrests-december-7a918fff6cfb5647e524598e92a48db0	2024-12-30T09:55:11-08:00	
Trinidad and Tobago enact a state of emergency in the face of gang violence	PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad and Tobago (AP) — A spike in deadly gang violence prompted the Caribbean islands of Trinidad and Tobago to implement a country-wide state of emergency Monday. The declaration followed a weekend marred by a spate of gang-related violence that resulted in multiple deaths, including five men believed to be victims of reprisal shootings. 'There is no doubt in my mind that we are dealing with an epidemic,' National Security Minister Fitzgerald Hinds told reporters at a press conference. While the state of emergency will not see a curfew being implemented, residents were told to expect an increased police and military presence. Law enforcement will also have the ability to conduct searches, detain suspects for 48 hours and conduct arrests without a warrant. Schools, business and other activities, including upcoming New Year’s celebrations are expected to proceed as scheduled. Acting Attorney General Stuart Young stressed that while there was general concern about the increased violence, there was particular unease about 'increased and heightened brazen acts of criminal activity' by gangs carrying illegal weapons. 'The criminal gangs via the use of the high-powered assault weapons and other illegal firearms in areas of Trinidad and possibly Tobago are likely to immediately increase their brazen acts of violence in reprisal shootings on a scale so extensive that it threatens persons and will endanger public safety,' Young said. The twin island republic has recorded an unprecedented 623 homicides for the year to date and, according to Hinds, gang-related activities have accounted for 263 of them. Trinidad and Tobago residents are not strangers to states of emergency. In 2021 the Keith Rowley administration implemented one to restrict movements and limit the spread of the COVID-19 virus during the pandemic. Ten years earlier, his predecessor Kamla Persad-Bissessar instituted a limited state of emergency and curfew in areas that were declared crime 'hotspots.'	https://apnews.com/article/trinidad-gang-violence-killings-state-of-emergency-f7b61d5697bf1316c7ae035250bb3cfb	2024-12-30T09:36:25-08:00	
Hundreds of soldiers freed in the latest prisoner exchange between Russia and Ukraine	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia and Ukraine have exchanged prisoners of war in the latest such swap that saw the release of hundreds of captives and was brokered with the help of the United Arab Emirates, officials said Monday. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said 189 Ukrainian prisoners, including military personnel, border guards and national guards — along with two civilians — were freed. He thanked the UAE for helping negotiate the exchange. Russia’s Defense Ministry said that 150 Russian soldiers were freed from captivity as part of the exchange in which each side released 150 people. The reason for the discrepancy in numbers wasn’t immediately clear. 'We are working to free everyone from Russian captivity,' Zelenskyy said in a statement. 'We do not forget anyone.' He posted pictures of Ukrainian soldiers sitting on a bus, some holding the country's blue-and-yellow flags. Zelenskyy said that those freed from Russian captivity included defenders of the Snake Island off the Black Sea port of Odesa, which was seized by Russia in the opening days of its invasion, as well as troops who defended the city of Mariupol, that was captured by Moscow's forces early in the war after a nearly three-month siege. 'The return of our people from Russian captivity is always very good news for each of us,' Zelenskyy said. 'And today is one of those days: our team managed to return 189 Ukrainians home.' In Moscow, the Defense Ministry said that Russian servicemen were first taken to the territory of Russia's neighbor and ally Belarus, where they received 'psychological and medical assistance' before moving to Russia. Russia and Ukraine have conducted dozens of such prisoner exchanges during the nearly three-year war. The prisoner exchange came as President Joe Biden announced Monday that the United States will send nearly $2.5 billion more in weapons to Ukraine as his administration works quickly to spend all the money it has available to help Kyiv fight off Russia before President-elect Donald Trump takes office.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-prisoners-exchange-77e9cc4418772e446c5f14e15b48c98a	2024-12-30T09:00:00-08:00	
Jimmy Carter made eradicating Guinea worm disease a top mission	JARWENG, South Sudan (AP) — Nobel Prize-winning peacemaker Jimmy Carter spent nearly four decades waging war to eliminate an ancient parasite plaguing the world’s poorest people. Rarely fatal but searingly painful and debilitating, Guinea worm disease infects people who drink water tainted with larvae that grow inside the body into worms as much as 3-feet-long. The noodle-thin parasites then burrow their way out, breaking through the skin in burning blisters. Carter made eradicating Guinea worm a top mission of The Carter Center, the nonprofit he and his wife, Rosalynn Carter, founded after leaving the White House. The former president rallied public health experts, billionaire donors, African heads of state and thousands of volunteer villagers to work toward eliminating a human disease for only the second time in history. 'It’d be the most exciting and gratifying accomplishment of my life,' Carter told The Associated Press in 2016. Even after entering home hospice care in February 2023, aides said Carter kept asking for Guinea worm updates. Carter died Sunday at age 100. Thanks to the Carters' efforts, the worms that afflicted an estimated 3.5 million people in 20 African and Asian countries when the center launched its campaign in 1986 are on the brink of extinction. Only 14 human cases were reported across four African nations in 2023, according to The Carter Center. The World Health Organization’s target for eradication is 2030. Carter Center leaders hope to achieve it sooner. That meant recently returning to Jarweng, in a remote area of South Sudan in northeastern Africa. The village of 500 people hadn’t seen Guinea worm infections since 2014, until Nyingong Aguek and her two sons drank swampy water while traveling in 2022. A fourth person also got infected. 'Having the worm pulled out is more painful than giving birth,' said Aguek, pointing to scars where four worms emerged from her left leg. The center's staff and volunteers walked house-to-house distributing water filters and teaching people to inspect dogs, which can also carry the parasite. 'If someone’s hurt, The Carter Center will help,' said villager Mathew Manyiel, listening to a training session while checking his dog for symptoms. An audacious plan In the mid-1980s, global health agencies were otherwise occupied and heads of state largely overlooked the illness afflicting millions of their citizens. Carter was still defining the center's mission when public health experts who had served in his administration approached him with a plan to eliminate the disease. Only a few years had passed since the WHO declared in 1979 that smallpox was the first human disease to be eradicated worldwide. Guinea worm, the experts told Carter, could become the second. 'President Carter, with a political background, was able to do far more in global health than we could do alone,' said Dr. William Foege, who led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control’s smallpox eradication program and the CDC itself before becoming The Carter Center’s first executive director. Those who worked closely with Carter suspect Guinea worm’s toll on poor African farmers resonated with the former president, who lived as a boy in a Georgia farmhouse without electricity or running water. 'Nobody was doing anything about it, and it was such a spectacularly awful disease,' said Dr. Donald Hopkins, an architect of the campaign who led the center’s health programs until 2015. 'He could sympathize with all of these farmers being too crippled from Guinea worm disease to work.' Eliminating other diseases There’s no vaccine that prevents Guinea worm infections or medicine that gets rid of the parasites. Treatment has changed little since ancient Greece. Emerging worms are gently wound around a stick as they’re slowly pulled through the skin. Removing an entire worm without breaking it can take weeks. So instead of scientific breakthroughs, this campaign has relied on persuading millions of people to change basic behaviors. Workers from the center and host governments trained volunteers to teach neighbors to filter water through cloth screens, removing tiny fleas that carry the larvae. Villagers learned to watch for and report new cases — often for rewards of $100 or more. Infected people and dogs had to be prevented from tainting water sources. The goal was to break the worm’s life cycle — and therefore eliminate the parasite itself — in each endemic community, eventually exterminating Guinea worm altogether. The campaign became a model for confronting a broader range of neglected tropical diseases afflicting impoverished people with limited access to clean water, sanitation and health care. Expanding its public health mission, the center has supplied training, equipment and medicines that helped 22 countries eliminate at least one disease within their borders. Mali became the latest in May 2023 when the WHO confirmed it had ended trachoma, a blinding eye infection. Haiti and the Dominican Republic are working to eliminate malaria and mosquito-borne lymphatic filariasis by 2030. Countries in Africa and the Americas are pursuing an end to river blindness by 2035. A personal mission Having a former U.S. president lead the charge brought big advantages to a nonprofit that relied on private donors to fund its initiatives. Carter’s fundraising enabled the center to pour $500 million into fighting Guinea worm. He persuaded manufacturers to donate larvicide as well as nylon cloth and specially made drinking straws to filter water. His visits to afflicted villages often attracted news coverage, raising awareness globally. 'He went to so many of the localities where people were afflicted,' said Dr. William Brieger, a professor of international health at Johns Hopkins University who spent 25 years in Africa. 'The kind of attention that was drawn to him for getting on the ground and highlighting the plight of individual people who were suffering, I think that made an important difference.' Carter first saw the disease up close in 1988 while visiting a village in Ghana where nearly 350 people had worms poking through their skin. He approached a young woman who appeared to be cradling a baby in her arm. 'But there was no baby,' Carter wrote in his 2014 book 'A Call to Action.' 'Instead she was holding her right breast, which was almost a foot long and had a worm emerging from the nipple.' Carter used his status to sway other leaders to play larger roles. Some heads of state got competitive, spurred by the center's charts and newsletters that showed which countries were making progress and which lagged behind. Worms in a war zone In 1995, Carter intervened when a civil war in southern Sudan made it too dangerous for workers to reach hundreds of hotspots. The ceasefire he negotiated enabled the center and others to distribute 200,000 water filters and discover more endemic villages. Carter’s efforts not only stopped transmissions in much of what became South Sudan, but also built trust across communities that resulted in a 'significant peace dividend,' said Makoy Samuel Yibi, the young nation's Guinea worm eradication director. Pakistan in 1993 became the first endemic country to eliminate human cases. India soon followed. By 1997, the disease was no longer found in Asia. By 2003, cases reported worldwide were down to 32,000 — a 99% decline in less than two decades. Some setbacks frustrated Carter. Visiting a hospital packed with suffering children and adults amid a 2007 resurgence in Ghana, Carter suggested publicly that the disease should perhaps be renamed 'Ghana worm.' 'Ghana was deeply embarrassed,' Hopkins said. Ghana ended transmission within three more years. Even more inspiring: Nigeria, which once had the most cases in the world, reached zero infections in 2009. 'That was a thunderclap,' Hopkins said. 'It was important throughout Africa, throughout the global campaign.' To the last worm Even after being diagnosed with brain cancer, Carter remained focused: 'I’d like the last Guinea worm to die before I do,' he told reporters in 2015. Despite dwindling cases, total success has proven elusive. Historic flooding and years of civil war have displaced millions of people who lack clean drinking water across central Africa. Of the 13 total cases reported in 2023, nine occurred in Chad, where infections in dogs have made the worms harder to eliminate. 'These are the most challenging places on planet Earth to operate in,' said Adam Weiss, who has directed the campaign since 2018. 'You need eyes and ears on the ground every single day.' The campaign still relies on about 30,000 volunteers spread among roughly 9,000 villages. Staying vigilant can be difficult now that cases are so rare, Weiss said. 'I would still like to think we will beat the timeline,' Weiss said of the 2030 eradication goal. 'The Carter Center is committed to this, obviously, no matter what.' ___ This story has been updated to show there were 14 human Guinea worm cases reported across four African nations in 2023, according to The Carter Center. —- Bynum reported from Savannah, Georgia.	https://apnews.com/article/jimmy-carter-guinea-worm-parasite-16fcaed9fa09b7fbdccfeeba765ed20f	2024-12-30T08:40:14-08:00	
The world population will be 8.09 billion on New Year's Day after a 71 million increase in 2024	The world population increased by more than 71 million people in 2024 and will be 8.09 billion people on New Year's Day, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates released Monday. The 0.9% increase in 2024 was a slight slowdown from 2023, when the world population grew by 75 million people. In January 2025, 4.2 births and 2.0 deaths were expected worldwide every second, according to the estimates. The United States grew by 2.6 million people in 2024, and the U.S. population on New Year's Day will be 341 million people, according to the Census Bureau. The United States was expected to have one birth every 9 seconds and one death every 9.4 seconds in January 2025. International migration was expected to add one person to the U.S. population every 23.2 seconds. The combination of births, deaths and net international migration will increase the U.S. population by one person every 21.2 seconds, the Census Bureau said. So far in the 2020s, the U.S. population has grown by almost 9.7 million people, a 2.9% growth rate. In the 2010s, the U.S. grew by 7.4%, which was the lowest rate since the 1930s. ___ Follow Mike Schneider on the social platform X: @MikeSchneiderAP.	https://apnews.com/article/world-population-census-bureau-fcc8cc23d572ddf91be31a6ec651e0d0	2024-12-30T06:42:16-08:00	
Biden announces nearly $2.5 billion more in military aid for Ukraine	WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden said Monday that the United States will send nearly $2.5 billion more in weapons to Ukraine as his administration works quickly to spend all the money it has available to help Kyiv fight off Russia before President-elect Donald Trump takes office. The package includes $1.25 billion in presidential drawdown authority, which allows the military to pull existing stock from its shelves and gets weapons to the battlefield faster. It also has $1.22 billion in longer-term weapons packages to be put on contract through the separate Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, or USAI. Biden said all longer-term USAI funds have now been spent and that he seeks to fully use all the remaining drawdown money before leaving office. 'I’ve directed my administration to continue surging as much assistance to Ukraine as quickly as possible,' Biden said in a statement. 'At my direction, the United States will continue to work relentlessly to strengthen Ukraine’s position in this war over the remainder of my time in office.' In addition to the weapons support, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen announced Monday that the U.S. is also providing $3.4 billion in economic assistance to Ukraine to help pay for critical government services during its ongoing fight against Russia. The money will pay salaries for civilian government and school employees, healthcare workers and first responders. The new military aid comes as Russia has launched a barrage of attacks against Ukraine’s power facilities in recent days, although Ukraine has said it intercepted a significant number of the missiles and drones. Russian and Ukrainian forces are also still in a bitter battle around the Russian border region of Kursk, where Moscow has sent thousands of North Korean troops to help reclaim territory taken by Ukraine. The Biden administration is pushing to get weapons into Ukraine to give Kyiv the strongest negotiating position possible before Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20. Trump has talked about getting some type of negotiated settlement between Ukraine and Russia and has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin. Many U.S. and European leaders are concerned that Trump's talk of a settlement might result in a poor deal for Ukraine, and they worry that he won’t provide Ukraine with all the weapons funding approved by Congress. The weapons systems being pulled from existing stockpiles through this latest weapons package include counter-unmanned aerial systems munitions, air defense munitions, ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), 155mm and 105mm artillery ammunition, air-to-ground munitions, anti-armor systems, tube-launched missiles, fragmentation grenades, and other items and spare parts. Including Monday's announcement, the U.S. has provided more than $65 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since Russia invaded its neighbor in February 2022.	https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-russia-biden-military-weapons-a34bc2204def6c9f5f17cf2ebfcb6bd8	2024-12-30T06:28:41-08:00	
Hotel fire near monastic sanctuary in Greece leaves 1 dead, 11 hospitalized	THESSALONIKI, Greece (AP) — A fire at a hotel Monday left its owner dead and 11 people hospitalized near the centuries-old monasteries at Meteora in central Greece. The three-story hotel in Kalambaka, a town just outside Meteora, suffered extensive damage, according to fire service officials. Emergency crews rescued 26 people, including those hospitalized, with several lifted off balconies using crane equipment. The hotel’s 55-year-old owner died from injuries sustained after falling from a balcony before firefighters arrived. Costas Papapoulios, the head of the region’s hoteliers association, said the survivors were being taken to other nearby hotels at the expense of the association and the local government. 'The owner was trying to help guests and he must have got trapped,' Papapoulios told The Associated Press. 'It's not clear whether he jumped from the balcony to escape from the flames or was overwhelmed by the smoke and fell.' The hotel is used mostly by people visiting Meteora, a UNESCO World Heritage site featuring 24 Orthodox Christian monasteries built some 600 years ago on top of sheer rock formations reaching up to 550 meters (1,800 feet) from the ground. Some 350 kilometers (220 miles) north of Athens, the site is a popular short-break destination. Witnesses of the fire described chaotic scenes that occurred shortly after dawn on Monday, with some residents trying to use bed sheets to climb down from balconies. The fire gutted much of the hotel's interior and blackened the walls and ceilings of rooms, and hallways of the building, where firefighters entered during the rescue. Four children were among those injured who were all taken to a hospital in the nearby city of Trikala. The Fire Service said 34 firefighters with 12 vehicles responded to the blaze, the cause of which was not immediately clear.	https://apnews.com/article/greece-fire-hotel-meteora-92443283e35c94fe0dd2ba235297f633	2024-12-30T06:26:15-08:00	
Serbian court convicts the parents of a teenage boy who shot dead 10 people in a school in Belgrade	BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — A court in Serbia on Monday convicted the parents of a teenage boy who last year shot dead nine pupils and a school guard and wounded six more people in a school in central Belgrade. The Higher Court in Belgrade sentenced Vladimir Kecmanovic, father of the boy, to 14 years and six months in prison for 'grave acts against public safety' and for child neglect. The mother, Miljana Kecmanovic was sentenced to three years in prison for child neglect but was acquitted on charges of illegal possession of weapons. The shooter, identified as Kosta Kecmanovic, was 13 years old when he committed the crime and therefore too young to face a trial, according to Serbian law. His parents were detained soon after the shooting and charged for failing to keep the weapons out of reach of their son. The massacre at the Vladislav Ribnikar primary school in central Belgrade on May 3, 2023, shocked the Balkan nation which was used to crises but where mass school shootings had never happened before. The couple's lawyer, Irina Borovic, said the verdict came as no surprise 'because public pressure was enormous and the expectations were huge.' Borovic said she will appeal the verdicts. Ninela Radicevic, who lost her daughter in the shooting, said 'we are not satisfied because no one was held responsible for the murder of nine children' and the school guard. The boy used his father's guns to open fire on his fellow pupils and others. He walked into the school and first opened fire in the hall before heading into a classroom where he continued shooting. Elementary schools in Serbia cater for children 7-15 years old. Police have said that the teenager called them after the shooting and calmly said what he had done. He has been held in a specialized institution since the shooting and testified at his parents' trial. The proceedings were closed to the public except for the reading of the verdicts. Also convicted and sentenced to 15 months in prison for a false testimony was a shooting instructor who worked at a shooting ground where the boy practiced shooting. The school shooting was followed the next day by another mass killing in villages outside the capital. Uros Blazic, 21, took an automatic rifle and opened fire at multiple locations, killing nine people and wounding 12. He was sentenced earlier this month to 20 years in prison. The back-to-back shootings triggered a wave of street protests and a crackdown on widespread illegal gun ownership.	https://apnews.com/article/serbia-school-shooting-parents-trial-b74c4c3c057854501529511e28dbd6bb	2024-12-30T05:29:03-08:00	
Politician among protesters arrested in Kenya while calling for an end to alleged abductions	NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — An opposition politician and several other protesters were arrested in Kenya on Monday during street demonstrations calling for an end to alleged abductions, that recently targeted young government critics. Senator Okiya Omtatah had joined hundreds of protesters who sat down on the streets of the capital, Nairobi while chanting that police should free seven people abducted this month. Police hurled tear gas canisters at the protesters and when Omtatah and several others did not disperse and held on to a long chain, they were arrested. The Kenya National Commission on Human Rights on Thursday raised concern over a growing number of alleged kidnappings of government critics, saying that the total number of such cases stands at 82 since the anti-government protests in June. President William Ruto on Saturday said the government would stop the abductions so that young people live in peace. Rights groups allege the country’s police force is behind such kidnappings, but police have denied involvement and have said that they are investigating the disappearances. Senator Omtatah on Monday filed a case at the High Court in Nairobi seeking to compel the government to free seven youths, accusing the police of abducting them. 'If they have committed a crime, let them be prosecuted and presented in court to defend themselves,' he said. Young protesters said they were in solidarity with those abducted while going about their daily lives. 'We are existing at a time where we have to live in fear,' a protester, Orpah Thabiti said. Four social media users went missing after they shared AI-generated images of President Ruto that were deemed offensive by government supporters. The rights commission had warned that Kenya was heading back to the 'dark days' of the disappearance of government critics. The abduction and torture of the opposition were common under the administration of the late President Daniel Moi.	https://apnews.com/article/kenya-protests-abductions-c40aa2d72cb430f9cc42b78c480a493d	2024-12-30T04:41:10-08:00	
German government seeks to downplay Musk's backing of far-right party ahead of general election	BERLIN (AP) — The German government on Monday sought to downplay efforts by tech entrepreneur Elon Musk to get involved in the country's general election campaign by again endorsing the far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, party. Musk caused uproar over the weekend after backing the AfD in an opinion piece in a major newspaper, leading to the resignation of the paper’s opinion editor in protest. 'Freedom of expression also includes the greatest nonsense,' government spokesperson Christiane Hoffmann said, adding that should wouldn't comment further on Musk's statements. She did, however, say that 'it is indeed the case that Elon Musk is trying to influence the federal election through his statement.' In that context, Hoffmann also pointed out that the AfD is being monitored by Germany's domestic intelligence service on suspicion of being right-wing extremist and that it has already been recognized as such in some individual German states. Germany is to vote in an early election on Feb. 23 after Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s three-party governing coalition collapsed last month in a dispute over how to revitalize the country’s stagnant economy. Musk’s guest opinion piece for Welt am Sonntag published in German over the weekend, was the second time this month he had supported Alternative for Germany, or AfD. 'The Alternative for Germany (AfD) is the last spark of hope for this country,' Musk wrote in his translated commentary. He went on to say the far-right party 'can lead the country into a future where economic prosperity, cultural integrity and technological innovation are not just wishes, but reality.' The Tesla Motors CEO also wrote that his investment in Germany gave him the right to comment on the country’s condition. The AfD is polling strongly, but its candidate for the top job, Alice Weidel, has no realistic chance of becoming chancellor because other parties refuse to work with the far-right party. An ally of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, the technology billionaire challenged in his opinion piece the party’s public image. 'The portrayal of the AfD as right-wing extremist is clearly false, considering that Alice Weidel, the party’s leader, has a same-sex partner from Sri Lanka! Does that sound like Hitler to you? Please!' Musk’s commentary has led to a debate in German media over the boundaries of free speech, with the paper’s own opinion editor announcing her resignation, pointedly on Musk’s social media platform, X. 'I always enjoyed leading the opinion section of WELT and WAMS. Today an article by Elon Musk appeared in Welt am Sonntag. I handed in my resignation yesterday after it went to print,' Eva Marie Kogel wrote. The newspaper was attacked by politicians and other media for offering Musk, a foreigner, a platform.

At least 66 people die after a truck plunges into a river in southern Ethiopia	ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) — At least 66 people have died after a truck plunged into a river in southern Ethiopia, a hospital director said Monday. The accident took place Sunday when an old, overcrowded truck that was contracted by wedding guests fell off the Gelan Bridge, where villagers said traffic crashes have happened before. The medical director at Bona General Hospital in the southern Sidama region, Lemma Lagide, told The Associated Press on Monday that 64 people died on site and two others at the hospital. He said those patients in need of more sophisticated critical care were transferred to a bigger hospital in Hawassa. Delays in rescue efforts in the remote village were blamed for the high number of casualties. Villagers said they tried to save people from the raging river only with sticks. A villager, Serak Boko, told AP that moments before the accident, music was blasting out of the truck and people dressed in suits were dancing and waving. It is common for people in rural Ethiopia to hire trucks instead of buses to transport them to social events like weddings because they are more affordable and carry many people. Most of those on the truck were men because they are culturally required to escort the bride from her home to the groom's house. 'The area always has regular accidents around the river as it is poorly constructed,' said resident Fasil Atara, referring to the road lacking bumps and warnings. With desolate infrastructure and overcrowded public transportation, Ethiopia has had similar accidents in the past. In August, 38 people died after a bus rolled over in Amhara region.	https://apnews.com/article/ethiopia-road-accident-truck-river-14695884cfacd7d0a79424ce7b54746e	2024-12-30T03:25:40-08:00	
Finnish investigators find an anchor drag mark on the Baltic seabed after suspicious cable damage	HELSINKI, Finland (AP) — Finnish investigators probing the damage to a Baltic Sea power cable and several data cables said they found an anchor drag mark on the seabed, apparently from a Russia-linked vessel that has already been seized. The discovery heightened concerns about suspected sabotage by Russia's 'shadow fleet' of fuel tankers — aging vessels with obscure ownership acquired to evade Western sanctions amid the war in Ukraine and operating without Western-regulated insurance. The Estlink-2 power cable, which transmits energy from Finland to Estonia across the Baltic Sea, went down on Dec. 25 after a rupture. It had little impact on services but followed damage to two data cables and the Nord Stream gas pipelines, both of which have been termed sabotage. Finnish police chief investigator, Sami Paila, said late Sunday the anchor drag trail continued for 'dozens of kilometers (miles) ... if not almost 100 kilometers (62 miles).' Paila added to Finnish national TV broadcaster Yle: 'Our current understanding is that the drag mark in question is that of the anchor of the (seized) Eagle S vessel. We have been able to clarify this matter through underwater research.' Without giving further details, Paila said authorities have 'a preliminary understanding of what happened at sea, how the anchor mark was created there,' and stressed that the 'question of intent is a completely essential issue to be clarified in the preliminary investigation.' On Saturday, the seized vessel was escorted to anchorage in the vicinity of the port of Porvoo to facilitate the investigation, officials said. It is being probed under criminal charges of aggravated interference with telecommunications, aggravated vandalism and aggravated regulatory offense. The Eagle S is flagged in the Cook Islands but was described by Finnish customs officials and the European Union executive commission as part of Russia’s shadow fleet of fuel tankers. Russia’s use of the vessels has raised environmental concerns about accidents given their age and uncertain insurance coverage. In the wake of the cable rupture, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said last week that the military alliance, which Finland joined last year, will step up patrols in the Baltic Sea region. The Finnish Coast Guard said Monday that another tanker ship headed for a Russian port has engine failure and drifted, then anchored in the Gulf of Finland south of the Hanko Paninsula. The guard said it was notified Sunday night. Registered in Panama, the M/T Jazz was en route to Primorsk, Russia, from Sudan, with apparently no oil cargo. Finnish authorities have dispatched a tugboat and a patrol ship to ensure that the vessel does not drift and to prevent any damage to the environment. Regional director of the Coast Guard, Janne Ryönänkoski, said there was no immediate risk to the seabed infrastructure. Earlier Monday, EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said that 'sabotage in Europe has increased' since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Kallas told the German newspaper Welt that the recent 'sabotage attempts in the Baltic Sea are not isolated incidents' but 'part of a pattern of deliberate and coordinated actions to damage our digital and energy infrastructure.' She vowed that the EU would 'take stronger measures to counter the risks posed' by vessels of Russia's shadow fleet. Finland, which shares a 1,340-kilometer (832-mile) border with Russia, abandoned its decades-long policy of neutrality and joined NATO in 2023, amid Russia's war against Ukraine.	https://apnews.com/article/finland-estonia-russia-cable-undersea-sabotage-nato-c676c2ddb89db3dba60c96cfea4a0679	2024-12-30T03:01:19-08:00

Gisèle Pelicot's ex-husband won't appeal his 20-year prison sentence for orchestrating mass rapes	PARIS (AP) — The ex-husband of Gisèle Pelicot won't appeal his 20-year prison sentence for drugging and raping her and allowing dozens of other men to rape her while she was unconscious, in a case that revolted France, his lawyer said Monday. Dominique Pelicot wants to spare his ex-wife a 'new ordeal' of another trial, lawyer Béatrice Zavarro said in an interview with broadcaster France Info. She said 17 of the 50 other men also found guilty this month have decided to appeal their sentences after a more than three-month trial that turned 72-year-old Gisèle Pelicot into an icon against sexual violence. The court in the southern French city of Avignon handed down sentences ranging from three to 15 years' imprisonment for the 50 men found guilty of rape, attempted rape and sexual assault on Gisèle Pelicot over nearly a decade of shocking abuse orchestrated by her then-husband and inflicted on her unwittingly. The court found Dominique Pelicot guilty of rape and all other charges against him and sentenced him to 20 years in prison, the maximum possible. At age 72, he could spend the rest of his life behind bars. He won’t be eligible to request early release until he’s served at least two-thirds of the sentence. Zavarro, his lawyer, said: 'He believes that the judicial page should be turned and that this chapter should be considered closed.' The appeals trial is expected to be in the last third of 2025, the appeals court in the southern city of Nimes said in a statement. It confirmed that 17 of those found guilty filed appeals ahead of a Monday night deadline. The trial spurred a national reckoning about the blight of rape culture. Dominique Pelicot laced his wife's food and drink with tranquilizers to render her unconscious. He then invited strangers he met online to take part in sordid rape and abuse fantasies that he acted out with them and filmed in the couple’s retirement home in the small Provence town of Mazan and elsewhere. Gisèle Pelicot’s courage during the bruising trial and her appalling ordeal, inflicted on the retired power company worker in what she had thought was a loving marriage, galvanized campaigners and triggered calls for tougher measures to stamp out rape culture. She waived her right to anonymity as a survivor of sexual abuse and successfully pushed for the hearings and evidence — including her ex-husband’s homemade videos — to be heard in open court, insisting that shame should fall on her abusers, not her.	https://apnews.com/article/france-rape-trial-gisele-pelicot-119441ad9081a92426e0dcb8d513fada	2024-12-29T23:39:23-08:00	
South Korea struggles to determine cause of plane crash that killed 179 people	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korean officials are struggling to determine what caused a deadly plane crash that killed 179 people, with the nation saddened, shocked and ashamed over the country's worst aviation disaster in decades. Many observers also worry how effectively the South Korean government will handle the aftermath of Sunday's crash as it grapples with a leadership vacuum following the recent successive impeachments of President Yoon Suk Yeol and Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, the country’s top two officials, amid political tumult caused by Yoon’s brief martial law introduction earlier this month. New Acting President Choi Sang-mok on Monday presided over a task force meeting on the crash and instructed the Transport Ministry and police to launch investigations into its cause. He also ordered the ministry to implement an emergency review of the country’s overall aircraft operation systems. 'The essence of a responsible response would be renovating the aviation safety systems on the whole to prevent recurrences of similar incidents and building a safer Republic of South Korea,' said Choi, who is also deputy prime minister and finance minister. The Boeing 737-800 plane operated by South Korea’s budget airline Jeju Air skidded off a runway at Muan International Airport in the country’s south, slammed into a concrete fence and burst into a fireball. The incident killed all but two of the 181 people aboard. The two survivors are both crew members, and they were pulled from the plane's tail section — the only part that was still recognizable after the crash. Joo Jong-wan, the Transport Ministry’s director of aviation policy, said authorities have so far identified 141 of the bodies, and are conducting DNA tests on the other 38. Alan Price, a former chief pilot at Delta Air Lines and now a consultant, said the Boeing 737-800 is a 'proven airplane' that belongs to a different class of aircraft than the Boeing 737 Max jetliner that was linked to fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019. But the Transport Ministry said Monday the government plans to conduct safety inspections on all Boeing 737-800 jetliners operated by the country’s airlines. Ministry officials said they will also look into whether the Muan airport’s localizer — a concrete fence housing a set of antennas designed to guide aircraft safely during landings — should have been made with lighter materials that would break more easily upon impact. Video of the crash indicated that the pilots did not deploy flaps or slats to slow the aircraft, suggesting a possible hydraulic failure, and they did not manually lower the landing gear, suggesting they did not have time, said John Cox, a retired airline pilot and CEO of Safety Operating Systems in St. Petersburg, Florida. Despite that, the jetliner was under control and traveling in a straight line, and damage and injuries likely would have been minimized if not for a barrier being so close to the runway, Cox said. Other observers say the videos showed the plane suffering suspected engine trouble but the landing gear malfunction was likely a direct reason for the crash. They say there wouldn't likely be a link between the landing gear problems and the suspected engine problem. The Transport Ministry said Sunday the control tower issued a warning about birds to the Jeju Air plane shortly before it intended to land and gave the crew permission to land in a different area. It said the plane’s pilot sent out a distress signal shortly before the crash. Investigators retrieved the jet’s flight data and cockpit voice recorders, but it may take months to complete the probe into the crash, Joo, the Transport Ministry official, told reporters. The Muan crash is South Korea's deadliest aviation disaster since 1997, when a Korean Airlines plane crashed in Guam, killing 228 people on board. Sunday's crash caused an outpouring of public sympathy for the dead, with the government issuing a seven-day national mourning period. Some questioned if the crash involved safety or regulatory issues, like the 2022 Halloween crush that killed 160 people and the 2014 ferry sinking that killed 304 people. The crash was yet more big news for South Koreans as they reel from a festering political crisis set off by Yoon's martial law decree, which brought hundreds of troops into Seoul streets and revived traumatic memories of past military rule in the 1970-80s. The political tumult resulted in the opposition-controlled National Assembly impeaching Yoon and Han. The safety minister stepped down and the police chief was arrested over their roles in the martial law enhancement. The absence of top officials responsible for managing disasters has also led to concerns. 'We are deeply worried if the Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasures Headquarters really can handle the disaster,' the mass-circulation JoongAng Ilbo newspaper said in an editorial on Monday.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-muan-jeju-air-crash-investigation-37561308a8157f6afe2eb507ac5131d5	2024-12-29T20:45:14-08:00	
Now Syria's long-ruling Baath party is collapsing, too	DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — A few days after insurgents in Syria overthrew President Bashar Assad, his ruling Baath party announced it was freezing its activities, marking a stunning change in fortunes for the political group that had ruled for more than six decades. Many members of the party's leadership have gone into hiding and some have fled the country. In a symbolic move, Syria's new rulers have turned the former party headquarters in Damascus into a center where former members of the army and security forces line up to register their names and hand over their weapons. Calls are on the rise to officially dissolve the Arab Socialist Baath Party that had ruled Syria since 1963. Many Syrians — including former party members — say its rule damaged relations with other Arab countries and aided in the spread of corruption that brought the war-torn nation to its knees. 'The party should not only be dissolved, it should go to hell,' said Mohammed Hussein Ali, 64, who worked for a state oil company and was a party member for decades until he quit at the start of Syria’s anti-government uprising in 2011 that turned into civil war. He never left the country and said he is happy the Baath rule is over. An official with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, the group that led the insurgent offensive that overthrew Assad, said no official decision has been made on what to do with the Baath party. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, noted that HTS leader Ahmad al-Sharaa has said that officials who committed crimes against the Syrian people over the past decades will be brought to justice and hinted that they include party members. The Baath party, whose aim was to unify Arab states in one nation, was founded by two Syrian Arab nationalists, Michel Aflaq and Salaheddine Bitar, in 1947 and at one point ruled two Arab countries, Iraq and Syria. A rivalry developed between the Syrian branch under Assad and his late father, Hafez, and the one in Iraq under Saddam Hussein, who was removed from power by a U.S.-led invasion in 2003. In Syria, the Baath party became inextricably associated with the Assad family, which took power in 1970. For decades, the family used the party and its pan-Arab ideology to control the country. Many senior military jobs were held by members of the family’s minority Alawite sect, and party membership was used as a cover to give it a nationalist rather than a sectarian nature. A former soldier and decades-long Baath party member who came to party headquarters to cut his military ties, Abdul-Rahman Ali, said he had no idea it was founded by Aflaq and Bitar. He had always thought that Hafez Assad was the founder. 'I am happy. We have been liberated from fear,' said Ali, 43. 'Even the walls had ears. We didn't dare express opinions with anyone.' He was referring to the dreaded security and intelligence agencies that detained and tortured people who expressed criticism of Assad or government officials. Many Syrians were required to join the Baath Vanguards, the party's youth branch, while in elementary school, where Arab nationalist and socialist ideology was emphasized. It was difficult for people who were not party members to get government jobs or join the army or the security and intelligence services. In 2012, a year after Syria's uprising began, a paragraph of the constitution stating that the Baath party was the leader of the nation and society was abolished, in a move aimed to appease the public's demand for political reforms. In practice, however, the party remained in control, with members holding majority seats in parliament and government. Another former soldier, who gave only his first name, Ghadir, out of fear of reprisals as a member of the Alawite sect, said he came from a poor family and joined the party so he could enter the military for a stable income. 'You could not take any job if you were not a Baathist,' he said. While few are mourning the party's fall in Syria, some are concerned that the Sunni majority that now controls the country could carry out a purge similar to the one in Iraq after Saddam’s fall. A de-Baathification committee was formed in Iraq and its main job was purging Saddam loyalists from government and military institutions. The Sunni minority considered it a means of sectarian score-settling by Iraq’s Shiite majority. The Sunni resentment and disenfranchisement that followed helped to drive the rise of extremist groups in the country including al-Qaida and the Islamic State in Iraq. In Syria, a Baath party statement issued three days after Assad’s fall called on all members to hand their weapons and public cars to the new authorities. On Dec. 24, party member and former army colonel Mohammed Merhi was among hundreds who lined up at the former party headquarters and handed over weapons. Merhi said the Baath party should be given another opportunity because its principles are good but were exploited over decades. But he said he might want to join another party if Syria becomes a multiparty democracy in the future. He handed over his Soviet Makarov pistol and received a document saying he can now move freely in the country after reconciling with the new authorities. 'I want to become again a normal Syrian citizen and work to build a new Syria,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-baath-party-hafez-bashar-assad-f541e2d3eb3c8471ddecffcb7d4e3d91	2024-12-29T20:10:08-08:00	
Brace for turbulence: Lessons from a bumpy 'super year' of global elections	LONDON (AP) — When voters around the globe had their say in 2024, their message was often: 'You’re fired.' Some 70 countries that are home to half the world’s population held elections this year, and in many incumbents were punished. From India and the United States to Japan, France and Britain, voters tired of economic disruption and global instability rejected sitting governments — and sometimes turned to disruptive outsiders. The rocky democratic landscape just seemed to get bumpier as a dramatic year careened toward its end, with mass protests in Mozambique and Georgia, an election annulled in Romania and an attempt to impose martial law in South Korea. Cas Mudde, a professor of international affairs at the University of Georgia who studies extremism and democracy, summed up 2024 in Prospect magazine as 'a great year for the far right, a terrible year for incumbents and a troublesome year for democracy around the world.' Incumbents battered One message sent by voters in 2024: They’re fed up. University of Manchester political scientist Rob Ford has attributed the anti-incumbent mood to 'electoral long COVID' -– lingering pandemic-related health, education, social and economic disruptions that have made millions of people unhappier and worse off. High inflation, fueled by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and mass displacement from that war and conflicts in the Middle East and Africa have added to the global unease. In South Africa, high unemployment and inequality helped drive a dramatic loss of support for the African National Congress, which had governed for three decades since the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule. The party once led by Nelson Mandela lost its political dominance in May’s election and was forced to go into coalition with opposition parties. Incumbents also were defeated in Senegal, Ghana and Botswana, where voters ousted the party that had been in power for 58 years since independence from Britain. Namibia’s ruling SWAPO party extended its 34 years in power in December -– but only by a whisker. Uruguay’s leftist opposition candidate, Yamandú Orsi, became the country’s new president in a November runoff that delivered another rebuke to incumbents. In India, the world’s largest democracy, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party lost its parliamentary majority in a shock election result in June after a decade of dominance. It was forced to govern in coalition as the opposition doubled its strength in Parliament. Japanese politics entered a new era of uncertainty after Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba’s governing Liberal Democratic Party, which has ruled almost without interruption since 1955, suffered a major loss in October amid voter anger at party financial scandals. It now leads a minority government. The U.K.’s July election saw the right-of-center Conservatives ousted after 14 years in office as the center-left Labour Party swept to power in a landslide. But the results also revealed growing fragmentation: Support for the two big parties that have dominated British politics for a century shrank as voters turned to smaller parties, including the hard-right party Reform U.K. led by Nigel Farage. Authoritarians advance Britain is not alone in seeing a rise for the right. Elections in June for the parliament of the 27-nation European Union saw conservative populists and the far right rock ruling parties in France and Germany, the EU’s biggest and most powerful members. The anti-immigration National Rally party won the first round of France’s parliamentary election in June, but alliances and tactical voting by the center and left knocked it down to third place in the second round, producing a divided legislature and a fragile government that collapsed in a Dec. 4 no-confidence vote. In Austria, the conservative governing People’s Party was beaten by the far-right, pro-Russia Freedom Party in September, though other parties allied to keep it out of a coalition government. Nepotism and political dynasties continued to exert influence -– and to be challenged. After messy elections in February, Pakistan elected Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, younger brother of three-time leader Nawaz Sharif. Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s largest democracy, elected President Prabowo Subianto, son-in-law of the late dictator Suharto. Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, the world’s longest-serving female leader, won a fourth successive term in a January election that opposition parties boycotted. Months later, her 15-year rule came to a tumultuous end: After mass student-led protests in which hundreds were killed, Hasina was ousted in August and fled to India. In Sri Lanka, voters also rejected a discredited old guard. Voters elected the Marxist Anura Kumara Dissanayake as president in September, two years after an island-wide public movement by an engaged middle class removed the long-ruling Rajapaksa clan. Interference allegations Covert meddling and online disinformation were growing concerns in 2024. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, said that this year it took down 20 election-related 'covert influence operations around the world, including in the Middle East, Asia, Europe and the U.S.' It said Russia was the top source of such meddling, followed by Iran and China. In Romania, far-right candidate Călin Georgescu came from nowhere to win the first round of the presidential election in November, aided in part by a flood of TikTok videos promoting his campaign. Amid allegations of Russian meddling, Romania’s Constitutional Court canceled the presidential election runoff two days before it was due to take place after a trove of declassified intelligence alleged Russia organized a sprawling campaign across social media to promote Georgescu. No date has yet been set for a rerun. Moldova’s pro-Western President Maia Sandu won a November runoff against her Moscow-friendly rival in an election seen as pivotal to the future of one of Europe’s poorest nations. Georgia has seen huge protests since an election in October was won by the pro-Moscow Georgian Dream party, which suspended negotiations on joining the European Union. The opposition and the pro-Western president, Salome Zourabichvili, have accused the governing party of rigging the vote with Russia’s help. Uncertainty reigns Possibly the year’s most seismic result, Donald Trump’s victory in November’s U.S. presidential election, has America’s allies and opponents bracing for what the unpredictable 'America-first' leader will do with his second term. And instability already reigns on several continents as the year ends. Venezuela has been in political crisis since a July election marred by serious fraud allegations which both President Nicolás Maduro and the opposition claim to have won. Amid opposition protests and a harsh crackdown, opposition candidate Edmundo González went into exile in Spain. In Mozambique, the Frelimo party that has ruled for half a century was declared the winner of an October election that the opposition called rigged. Weeks of ongoing street protests across the country have left more than 100 dead. South Korea’s conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol — weakened after the liberal opposition retained control in an April election -– astonished the country by declaring martial law in a late-night announcement on Dec. 3. Parliament voted to overturn the decision six hours later, and within days voted to impeach Yoon. The crisis in the deeply divided country is far from over. Democracy’s bumpy ride looks likely to continue in 2025, with embattled incumbents facing challenge in countries including Germany, where Chancellor Olaf Scholz lost a confidence vote on Dec. 16, triggering an early election likely in February. Canada will also vote in 2025, with the governing Liberals widely unpopular and increasingly divided after almost a decade in power. Seema Shah, head of democracy assessment at the Stockholm-based International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, said global surveys suggest support for the concept of democracy remains strong, but the numbers plummet 'when you ask people how satisfied they are with their own democracy.' 'People want democracy. They like the theory of it,' she said. 'But when they see it actually play out, it’s not living up to their expectations.' ___ Sheikh Saaliq in New Delhi, Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo and Gerald Imray in Cape Town, South Africa, contributed to this story.	https://apnews.com/article/global-elections-2024-yearend-incumbents-c777b658661e61e2533091e1d625c0b8	2024-12-29T19:24:27-08:00	
Stock market today: Asian shares are mixed after Wall Street slips, weighed down by tech giants	Asian shares were mixed on Monday after stocks fell broadly on Friday as Wall Street closed out a holiday-shortened week on a down note. U.S. futures were lower while oil prices were little changed. Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 index lost 1% to 39,894.62. The dollar gained against the Japanese yen, trading at 157.93 yen, up from 157.75 yen. The Tokyo market wrapped up trading for 2024 with a yearend ceremony as Japan began its New Year holidays, the biggest festival of the year. South Korea’s Kospi added 0.2% to 2,409.91. But shares of Jeju Air Co. lost 9% after one of the company’s jets skidded off a runway, slammed into a concrete wall and burst into flames Sunday in South Korea as its landing gear failed to deploy. 179 people died in the crash. The disaster was yet another blow for Boeing in a dispiriting year, following a machinists strike, further safety problems with its troubled top-selling aircraft and a plunging stock price. Political turmoil persisted in South Korea as law enforcement officials requested a court warrant Monday to detain impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol. They are investigating whether his martial law decree on Dec. 3 amounted to rebellion. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong was flat at 20,090.30 while the Shanghai Composite index gained 0.2% to 3,407.33. Australia’s S&amp;P/ASX 200 dipped 0.3% to 8,235.00. On Friday, the S&amp;P 500 fell 1.1% to 5,970.84. Roughly 90% of stocks in the benchmark index lost ground, but it managed to hold onto a modest gain of 0.7% for the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.8% to 42,992.21. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite fell 1.5%, to 19,722.03. The losses were made worse by sharp declines for the Big Tech stocks known as the 'Magnificent 7', which can heavily influence the direction of the market because of their large size. A wide range of retailers also fell. Amazon fell 1.5% and Best Buy slipped 1.5%. The sector is being closely watched for clues on how it performed during the holiday shopping season. The S&amp;P 500 gained nearly 3% over a 3-day stretch before breaking for the Christmas holiday. On Thursday, the index posted a small decline. Despite Friday's drop, the market is moving closer to another standout annual finish. The S&amp;P 500 is on track for a gain of around 25% in 2024. That would mark a second consecutive yearly gain of more than 20%, the first time that has happened since 1997-1998. The gains have been driven partly by upbeat economic data showing that consumers continued spending and the labor market remained strong. Inflation, while still high, has also been steadily easing. A report on Friday showed that sales and inventory estimates for the wholesales trade industry fell 0.2% in November, following a slight gain in October. That weaker-than-expected report follows an update on the labor market Thursday that showed unemployment benefits held steady last week. The stream of upbeat economic data and easing inflation helped prompt a reversal in the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy this year. Expectations for interest rate cuts also helped drive market gains. The central bank recently delivered its third cut to interest rates in 2024. Even though inflation has come closer to the central bank's target of 2%, it remains stubbornly above that mark and worries about it heating up again have tempered the forecast for more interest rate cuts. Inflation concerns have added to uncertainties heading into 2025, which include the labor market’s path ahead and shifting economic policies under incoming President Donald Trump. Worries have risen that Trump’s preference for tariffs and other policies could lead to higher inflation, a bigger U.S. government debt and difficulties for global trade.

South Korean authorities seek warrant to detain impeached President Yoon in martial law probe	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korean law enforcement officials on Monday requested a court warrant to detain impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol as they investigate whether his short-lived martial law decree on Dec. 3 amounted to rebellion. The Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials, which is leading a joint investigation with police and military authorities into the power grab that lasted only a few hours, confirmed it requested the warrant from the Seoul Western District Court. They plan to question Yoon on charges of abuse of authority and orchestrating a rebellion. The warrant request came after Yoon dodged several requests by the joint investigation team and public prosecutors to appear for questioning and also blocked searches of his offices. While Yoon has the presidential privilege of immunity from criminal prosecution, such protections don’t extend to allegations of rebellion or treason. It’s not clear whether the court will grant the warrant or whether Yoon can be compelled to appear for questioning. Under the country’s laws, locations potentially linked to military secrets cannot be seized or searched without the consent of the person in charge, and it’s unlikely that Yoon will voluntarily leave his residence if he faces detention. There are also concerns about possible clashes with Yoon’s presidential security service if authorities attempt to forcibly detain him. Yoon’s presidential powers were suspended after the National Assembly voted to impeach him on Dec. 14 over his imposition of martial law, which lasted only hours but has triggered weeks of political turmoil, halted high-level diplomacy and rattled financial markets. Yoon’s fate now lies with the Constitutional Court, which has begun deliberations on whether to uphold the impeachment and formally remove Yoon from office or reinstate him. The National Assembly voted last week to also impeach Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, who had assumed the role of acting president after Yoon’s powers were suspended, over his reluctance to fill three Constitutional Court vacancies ahead of the court’s review of Yoon’s case. The country’s new interim leader is Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok, who is also finance minister. To formally end Yoon’s presidency, at least six justices on the nine-member Constitutional Court must vote in favor. Three seats are currently vacant following retirements and a full bench could make conviction more likely. Choi, who has been handling the government’s response to a plane crash on Sunday that killed 179 people, has yet to say whether he intends to appoint the Constitutional Court justices. In a separate criminal investigation of Yoon, authorities have already arrested his defense minister, police chief and several other military commanders involved in the attempt to enforce the martial law decree, which harkened back to the days of authoritarian leaders the country hasn’t seen since the 1980s. Yoon and his military leadership have been accused of attempting to block the National Assembly from voting to end martial law by sending hundreds of heavily armed troops to encircle the building. Lawmakers who managed to get in voted unanimously 190-0 to lift martial law, hours after Yoon declared it in a late-night television address. Yoon has also been accused of ordering defense counterintelligence officials to detain key politicians, including opposition leader Lee Jae-myung, National Assembly Speaker Woo Won Shik and the ex-leader of his own conservative party, Han Dong-hun, a reformist who supported investigations into corruption allegations against first lady Kim Keon Hee. Yoon has defended the martial law decree as a necessary act of governance, portraying it as a temporary warning against the liberal opposition Democratic Party, which he has described as an 'anti-state' force obstructing his agenda with its majority in the National Assembly. Yoon has claimed he had no intention to paralyze the functioning of the assembly, saying that the troops were sent to maintain order, and also denied planning to arrest politicians. Yoon’s claims have been denied by Kwak Jong-keun, the now-arrested commander of the Army Special Warfare Command, who testified in the National Assembly that Yoon called for troops to 'quickly destroy the door and drag out the lawmakers who are inside' the assembly’s main chamber where the vote occurred. Kwak said he did not carry out Yoon’s orders. The joint investigation team has also questioned Maj. Gen. Moon Sang-ho, commander of the Defense Intelligence Command, who has also been arrested over suspicions that he sent troops to the National Election Commission in Gwacheon city after Yoon declared martial law. Yoon has defended the troop deployment to the election commission, which happened at the same time as the military operation at the National Assembly, saying it was necessary to investigate supposed vulnerabilities in the commission’s computer systems potentially affecting the credibility of election results. Yoon’s failure to offer any evidence in support of his claims has raised concerns that he was endorsing conspiracy theories on right-wing YouTube channels that April’s parliamentary elections were rigged. The Democratic Party won those elections by a landslide. The election commission rejected Yoon’s allegations, stating there was no basis to suspect election fraud.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-yoon-martial-law-detain-rebellion-d00aa71be342df39b9775e49f90f5756	2024-12-29T16:57:33-08:00	
South Korean families pray for relatives who vanished into North Korean prisons a decade ago	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — In the past year, Choi Jin-young has done everything he can to bring attention to his father, a missionary who's serving a life sentence in North Korea. He’s met senior U.N., U.S. and other human rights officials, testified at public events, and accepted many media interviews. But as he marks 10 years since his father’s arrest this week, Choi doesn't know where his father is, or even if he's still alive. 'I have some good memories of my dad. I’m his son so I must fight hard to get him returned,' Choi, a 34-year-old beer company official in South Korea, told The Associated Press. 'I can only assume he’s been in an extremely bad situation.' His father Choi Chun-kil, 65, is one of at least six South Koreans who have all but disappeared since being arrested and convicted in North Korea in the past decade or so. Three, including Choi, are Christian missionaries who spent time in Chinese border towns, and the other three are North Korean-born defectors who resettled in the South. Arrested in unclear circumstances The three missionaries were involved in covert efforts to spread Christianity in the North by providing North Korean visitors room and board and teaching them the Bible. All three were arrested in 2013 or 2014, and then convicted of plotting to overthrow the North Korean government and spying for South Korea and sentenced to hard labor for life. Little is known about the defectors, except that North Korea accused one of trying to kidnap North Korean children. Seoul has not released their names, citing requests from family members. But observers say they have little hope of their repatriations to the South as Pyongyang likely views them as its own citizens. It's less clear why the North has held the three South Korean-born missionaries for such a long time. North Korea has released or deported American missionaries and other foreign detainees after a maximum of two to three years in prison. North Korea maintains a virtual ban on religion and considers foreign evangelism a threat to its ruling Kim family's cult of personality. Experts say North Korea likely lured the South Korean missionaries onto its territory to make the arrests, and fabricated or exaggerated their crimes. The three missionaries have been denied consular services and opportunities to communicate with their loved ones in South Korea. They haven't been seen since the initial months of their detention, when they were shown to the outside world at press conferences in Pyongyang to confess to crimes and apologize. Experts say their statements were likely coached or coerced by North Korean officials. Conditions could be harsh, but better than those facing North Korean prisoners Kim Jeong-sam, brother of another jailed missionary Kim Jung Wook, said he prays for his 60-year-old sibling three times a day and misses him whenever he uses hot water. 'Especially when I take shower with hot water on a cold winter’s day, I miss him more because I wonder if he can also use hot water there,' Kim, 63, said. It’s not known where in North Korea the South Koreans are held. Experts say they're likely kept apart from North Korean inmates to prevent them from spreading hostile thoughts. In responses to questions from the AP, South Korea’s Unification Ministry said North Korea hasn’t responded its repeated public calls to confirm whether the detainees are still alive. But it said the North has likely not mistreated the prisoners since South Korea’s appeals to the international community have likely been conveyed to it. Hyeon Soo Lim, a Canadian pastor who was jailed in North Korea from 2015-2017, believes his foreigners-only prison was in Phyongsong city, about an hour’s drive from Pyongyang, the capital. He said he was mostly the only inmate, except his final months in prison when he encountered American detainee Kim Tong Chol. Lim said he didn’t see the three South Korean missionaries at his prison. Lim, 69, said he was required to do eight hours of work like harvesting potatoes or digging six days a week. But Lim said he was given a Bible and allowed to exchange letters and a phone call with his family in Canada. He said he was sent to hospital three times. Kenneth Bae, a former American detainee, described similar conditions in his memoir. Like Lim, he said he didn’t suffer beatings or torture. But in one exceptional case, American university student Otto Warmbier died in 2017 days after he was released by North Korea in a coma after 17 months in captivity. Experts say the South Korean missionaries likely won't have received the same treatment, but their conditions would still be better than those of North Korean prisoners. Gwon Hyojin, a defector who spent several years at a North Korean prison in the 2000s, said that five to six inmates died every day as a result of malnutrition, beatings by fellow inmates and accidents at work. Choi Min-kyung, who was imprisoned in North Korea before her 2012 defection, said that dozens of people shared a cell and that outbreaks of infectious diseases were also a major cause of deaths. Can Seoul do more to get its citizens back? Some experts say North Korea has returned American captives while holding onto South Koreans because it cares more about relations with the U.S. and is deeply hostile to its neighbor. But others argue that Seoul hasn’t tried hard enough to secure the return of its nationals, due to a lack of public pressure and prioritizing other issues like the North Korean nuclear program or inter-Korean reconciliation. 'I think our media and public haven’t showed much interest in them, and our governments and parliaments haven’t dealt with this issue enthusiastically either,' said Ethan Hee-Seok Shin, a legal analyst at the Transitional Justice Working Group, a Seoul-based human rights NGO. Shin said attention to the detainees could lead North Korea to view them as valuable bargaining chips, incentivizing it to keep them alive and improve their treatment. In a departure from Seoul's longtime stance, the conservative government of President Yoon Suk Yeol has openly criticized North Korean human rights abuses at international events, raised the issue of detainees more and given more support to their relatives. But that effort could be derailed as Yoon faces removal from office after being impeached over his short-lived imposition of martial law earlier this month. All communication channels between the Koreas have been dormant for several years, with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un branding South Korea a hostile foreign power last year. Lee Kyu-Chang, a senior research fellow at Seoul’s Korea Institute for National Unification, said that would make it more difficult to secure the release of the missionaries. But Peter Jung, a pastor who specializes in evangelizing North Koreans, said that South Korea shouldn’t give up hope for talks. 'Only when we try to maintain momentum for talks and raise our voices for the detainees, we’ll have a chance to get them back when we sit down for critical talks with North Korea one day,' Jung said.	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-south-missionaries-prison-1373a5711447af5633af66301b8c2867	2024-12-29T16:04:30-08:00	
Jet crash disaster in South Korea marks another setback for Boeing	WASHINGTON (AP) — A machinists strike. Another safety problem involving its troubled top-selling airliner. A plunging stock price. 2024 was already a dispiriting year for Boeing, the American aviation giant. But when one of the company's jets crash-landed in South Korea on Sunday, killing all but two of the 181 people on board, it brought to a close an especially unfortunate year for Boeing. The cause of the crash remains under investigation, and aviation experts were quick to distinguish Sunday's incident from the company’s earlier safety problems. Alan Price, a former chief pilot at Delta Air Lines who is now a consultant, said it would be inappropriate to link the incident Sunday to two fatal crashes involving Boeing’s troubled 737 Max jetliner in 2018 and 2019. In January this year, a door plug blew off a 737 Max while it was in flight, raising more questions about the plane. The Boeing 737-800 that crash-landed in Korea, Price noted, is 'a very proven airplane. 'It’s different from the Max ...It’s a very safe airplane.’’ For decades, Boeing has maintained a role as one of the giants of American manufacturing. But the the past year's repeated troubles have been damaging. The company's stock price is down more than 30% in 2024. The company's reputation for safety was especially tarnished by the 737 Max crashes, which occurred off the coast of Indonesia and in Ethiopia less than five months apart in 2018 and 2019 and left a combined 346 people dead. In the five years since then, Boeing has lost more than $23 billion. And it has fallen behind its European rival, Airbus, in selling and delivering new planes. Last fall, 33,000 Boeing machinists went on strike, crippling the production of the 737 Max, the company's bestseller, the 777 airliner and 767 cargo plane. The walkout lasted seven weeks, until members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers agreed to an offer that included 38% pay raises over four years. In January, a door plug blew off a 737 Max during an Alaska Airlines flight. Federal regulators responded by imposing limits on Boeing aircraft production that they said would remain in place until they felt confident about manufacturing safety at the company. In July, Boeing agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud for deceiving the Federal Aviation Administration regulators who approved the 737 Max. Acting on Boeing’s incomplete disclosures, the FAA approved minimal, computer-based training instead of more intensive training in flight simulators. Simulator training would have increased the cost for airlines to operate the Max and might have pushed some to buy planes from Airbus instead. (Prosecutors said they lacked evidence to argue that Boeing’s deception had played a role in the crashes.) But the plea deal was rejected this month by a federal judge in Texas, Reed O’Connor, who decided that diversity, inclusion and equity or DEI policies in the government and at Boeing could result in race being a factor in choosing an official to oversee Boeing’s compliance with the agreement. Boeing has sought to change its culture. Under intense pressure over safety issues, David Calhoun departed as CEO in August. Since January, 70,000 Boeing employees have participated in meetings to discuss ways to improve safety.	https://apnews.com/article/korea-plane-crash-boeing-51abcf86c1a4d01b94ad17b30f5fc774	2024-12-29T14:26:36-08:00

Jimmy Carter, 39th US president, Nobel winner, dies at 100	ATLANTA (AP) — Jimmy Carter, the peanut farmer who tried to restore virtue to the White House after the Watergate scandal and Vietnam War, then rebounded from a landslide defeat to become a global advocate of human rights and democracy, has died. He was 100 years old. The Carter Center said the 39th president died Sunday afternoon, more than a year after entering hospice care, at his home in Plains, Georgia, where he and his wife, Rosalynn, who died in November 2023, lived most of their lives. The center said he died peacefully, surrounded by his family. As reaction poured in from around the world, President Joe Biden mourned Carter’s death, saying the world lost an 'extraordinary leader, statesman and humanitarian' and he lost a dear friend. Biden cited Carter’s compassion and moral clarity, his work to eradicate disease, forge peace, advance civil and human rights, promote free and fair elections, house the homeless and advocacy for the disadvantaged as an example for others. 'To all of the young people in this nation and for anyone in search of what it means to live a life of purpose and meaning – the good life – study Jimmy Carter, a man of principle, faith, and humility,' Biden said in a statement. 'He showed that we are a great nation because we are a good people – decent and honorable, courageous and compassionate, humble and strong.' Biden said he is ordering a state funeral for Carter in Washington. A moderate Democrat, Carter ran for president in 1976 as a little-known Georgia governor with a broad grin, effusive Baptist faith and technocratic plans for efficient government. His promise to never deceive the American people resonated after Richard Nixon’s disgrace and U.S. defeat in southeast Asia. 'If I ever lie to you, if I ever make a misleading statement, don’t vote for me. I would not deserve to be your president,' Carter said. Carter’s victory over Republican Gerald Ford, whose fortunes fell after pardoning Nixon, came amid Cold War pressures, turbulent oil markets and social upheaval over race, women’s rights and America’s role in the world. His achievements included brokering Mideast peace by keeping Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin at Camp David for 13 days in 1978. But his coalition splintered under double-digit inflation and the 444-day hostage crisis in Iran. His negotiations ultimately brought all the hostages home alive, but in a final insult, Iran didn’t release them until the inauguration of Ronald Reagan, who had trounced him in the 1980 election. Humbled and back home in Georgia, Carter said his faith demanded that he keep doing whatever he could, for as long as he could, to try to make a difference. He and Rosalynn co-founded The Carter Center in 1982 and spent the next 40 years traveling the world as peacemakers, human rights advocates and champions of democracy and public health. Awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002, Carter helped ease nuclear tensions in North and South Korea, avert a U.S. invasion of Haiti and negotiate cease-fires in Bosnia and Sudan. By 2022, the center had monitored at least 113 elections around the world. Carter was determined to eradicate guinea worm infections as one of many health initiatives. Swinging hammers into their 90s, the Carters built homes with Habitat for Humanity. The common observation that he was better as an ex-president rankled Carter. His allies were pleased that he lived long enough to see biographers and historians revisit his presidency and declare it more impactful than many understood at the time. Propelled in 1976 by voters in Iowa and then across the South, Carter ran a no-frills campaign. Americans were captivated by the earnest engineer, and while an election-year Playboy interview drew snickers when he said he 'had looked on many women with lust. I’ve committed adultery in my heart many times,' voters tired of political cynicism found it endearing. The first family set an informal tone in the White House, carrying their own luggage, trying to silence the Marine Band’s traditional 'Hail to the Chief' and enrolling daughter, Amy, in public schools. Carter was lampooned for wearing a cardigan and urging Americans to turn down their thermostats. But Carter set the stage for an economic revival and sharply reduced America's dependence on foreign oil by deregulating the energy industry along with airlines, trains and trucking. He established the departments of Energy and Education, appointed record numbers of women and nonwhites to federal posts, preserved millions of acres of Alaskan wilderness and pardoned most Vietnam draft evaders. Emphasizing human rights, he ended most support for military dictators and took on bribery by multinational corporations by signing the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. He persuaded the Senate to ratify the Panama Canal treaties and normalized relations with China, an outgrowth of Nixon’s outreach to Beijing. But crippling turns in foreign affairs took their toll. When OPEC hiked crude prices, making drivers line up for gasoline as inflation spiked to 11%, Carter tried to encourage Americans to overcome 'a crisis of confidence.' Many voters lost confidence in Carter instead after the infamous address that media dubbed his 'malaise' speech, even though he never used that word. After Carter reluctantly agreed to admit the exiled Shah of Iran to the U.S. for medical treatment, the American Embassy in Tehran was overrun in 1979. Negotiations to quickly free the hostages broke down, and then eight Americans died when a top-secret military rescue attempt failed. Carter also had to reverse course on the SALT II nuclear arms treaty after the Soviets invaded Afghanistan in 1979. Though historians would later credit Carter's diplomatic efforts for hastening the end of the Cold war, Republicans labeled his soft power weak. Reagan’s 'make America great again' appeals resonated, and he beat Carter in all but six states. Born Oct. 1, 1924, James Earl Carter Jr. married fellow Plains native Rosalynn Smith in 1946, the year he graduated from the Naval Academy. He brought his young family back to Plains after his father died, abandoning his Navy career, and they soon turned their ambitions to politics. Carter reached the state Senate in 1962. After rural white and Black voters elected him governor in 1970, he drew national attention by declaring that 'the time for racial discrimination is over.' Carter published more than 30 books and remained influential as his center turned its democracy advocacy onto U.S. politics, monitoring an audit of Georgia’s 2020 presidential election results. After a 2015 cancer diagnosis, Carter said he felt 'perfectly at ease with whatever comes.' 'I’ve had a wonderful life,' he said. 'I’ve had thousands of friends, I’ve had an exciting, adventurous and gratifying existence.' ___ Sanz is a former Associated Press reporter.	https://apnews.com/article/jimmy-carter-dies-f8540b521fdd019c5daea7572e4aa728	2024-12-29T12:30:34-08:00	
Jimmy Carter, the 39th US president, has died at 100	ATLANTA (AP) — Jimmy Carter, the peanut farmer who won the presidency in the wake of the Watergate scandal and Vietnam War, endured humbling defeat after one tumultuous term and then redefined life after the White House as a global humanitarian, has died. He was 100 years old. The longest-lived American president died on Sunday, more than a year after entering hospice care, at his home in the small town of Plains, Georgia, where he and his wife, Rosalynn, who died at 96 in November 2023, spent most of their lives, The Carter Center said. 'Our founder, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, passed away this afternoon in Plains, Georgia,' the center said in posting about his death on the social media platform X. It added in a statement that he died peacefully, surrounded by his family. As reaction poured in from around the world, President Joe Biden mourned Carter’s death, saying the world lost an 'extraordinary leader, statesman and humanitarian' and he lost a dear friend. Biden cited Carter’s compassion and moral clarity, his work to eradicate disease, forge peace, advance civil and human rights, promote free and fair elections, house the homeless and advocacy for the disadvantaged as an example for others. 'To all of the young people in this nation and for anyone in search of what it means to live a life of purpose and meaning – the good life – study Jimmy Carter, a man of principle, faith, and humility,' Biden said in a statement. 'He showed that we are a great nation because we are a good people – decent and honorable, courageous and compassionate, humble and strong.' Biden said he is ordering a state funeral for Carter in Washington. Businessman, Navy officer, evangelist, politician, negotiator, author, woodworker, citizen of the world — Carter forged a path that still challenges political assumptions and stands out among the 45 men who reached the nation’s highest office. The 39th president leveraged his ambition with a keen intellect, deep religious faith and prodigious work ethic, conducting diplomatic missions into his 80s and building houses for the poor well into his 90s. 'My faith demands — this is not optional — my faith demands that I do whatever I can, wherever I am, whenever I can, for as long as I can, with whatever I have to try to make a difference,' Carter once said. A president from Plains A moderate Democrat, Carter entered the 1976 presidential race as a little-known Georgia governor with a broad smile, outspoken Baptist mores and technocratic plans reflecting his education as an engineer. His no-frills campaign depended on public financing, and his promise not to deceive the American people resonated after Richard Nixon’s disgrace and U.S. defeat in southeast Asia. 'If I ever lie to you, if I ever make a misleading statement, don’t vote for me. I would not deserve to be your president,' Carter repeated before narrowly beating Republican incumbent Gerald Ford, who had lost popularity pardoning Nixon. Carter governed amid Cold War pressures, turbulent oil markets and social upheaval over racism, women’s rights and America’s global role. His most acclaimed achievement in office was a Mideast peace deal that he brokered by keeping Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin at the bargaining table for 13 days in 1978. That Camp David experience inspired the post-presidential center where Carter would establish so much of his legacy. Yet Carter’s electoral coalition splintered under double-digit inflation, gasoline lines and the 444-day hostage crisis in Iran. His bleakest hour came when eight Americans died in a failed hostage rescue in April 1980, helping to ensure his landslide defeat to Republican Ronald Reagan. Carter acknowledged in his 2020 'White House Diary' that he could be 'micromanaging' and 'excessively autocratic,' complicating dealings with Congress and the federal bureaucracy. He also turned a cold shoulder to Washington’s news media and lobbyists, not fully appreciating their influence on his political fortunes. 'It didn’t take us long to realize that the underestimation existed, but by that time we were not able to repair the mistake,' Carter told historians in 1982, suggesting that he had 'an inherent incompatibility' with Washington insiders. Carter insisted his overall approach was sound and that he achieved his primary objectives — to 'protect our nation’s security and interests peacefully' and 'enhance human rights here and abroad' — even if he fell spectacularly short of a second term. And then, the world Ignominious defeat, though, allowed for renewal. The Carters founded The Carter Center in 1982 as a first-of-its-kind base of operations, asserting themselves as international peacemakers and champions of democracy, public health and human rights. 'I was not interested in just building a museum or storing my White House records and memorabilia,' Carter wrote in a memoir published after his 90th birthday. 'I wanted a place where we could work.' That work included easing nuclear tensions in North and South Korea, helping to avert a U.S. invasion of Haiti and negotiating cease-fires in Bosnia and Sudan. By 2022, The Carter Center had declared at least 113 elections in Latin America, Asia and Africa to be free or fraudulent. Recently, the center began monitoring U.S. elections as well. Carter’s stubborn self-assuredness and even self-righteousness proved effective once he was unencumbered by the Washington order, sometimes to the point of frustrating his successors. He went 'where others are not treading,' he said, to places like Ethiopia, Liberia and North Korea, where he secured the release of an American who had wandered across the border in 2010. 'I can say what I like. I can meet whom I want. I can take on projects that please me and reject the ones that don’t,' Carter said. He announced an arms-reduction-for-aid deal with North Korea without clearing the details with Bill Clinton’s White House. He openly criticized President George W. Bush for the 2003 invasion of Iraq. He also criticized America’s approach to Israel with his 2006 book 'Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid.' And he repeatedly countered U.S. administrations by insisting North Korea should be included in international affairs, a position that most aligned Carter with Republican President Donald Trump. Among the center’s many public health initiatives, Carter vowed to eradicate the guinea worm parasite during his lifetime, and nearly achieved it: Cases dropped from millions in the 1980s to nearly a handful. With hardhats and hammers, the Carters also built homes with Habitat for Humanity. The Nobel committee’s 2002 Peace Prize cites his 'untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development.' Carter should have won it alongside Sadat and Begin in 1978, the chairman added. Carter accepted the recognition saying there was more work to be done. 'The world is now, in many ways, a more dangerous place,' he said. 'The greater ease of travel and communication has not been matched by equal understanding and mutual respect.' ‘An epic American life’ Carter’s globetrotting took him to remote villages where he met little 'Jimmy Carters,' so named by admiring parents. But he spent most of his days in the same one-story Plains house — expanded and guarded by Secret Service agents — where they lived before he became governor. He regularly taught Sunday School lessons at Maranatha Baptist Church until his mobility declined and the coronavirus pandemic raged. Those sessions drew visitors from around the world to the small sanctuary where Carter will receive his final send-off after a state funeral at Washington’s National Cathedral. The common assessment that he was a better ex-president than president rankled Carter and his allies. His prolific post-presidency gave him a brand above politics, particularly for Americans too young to witness him in office. But Carter also lived long enough to see biographers and historians reassess his White House years more generously. His record includes the deregulation of key industries, reduction of U.S. dependence on foreign oil, cautious management of the national debt and notable legislation on the environment, education and mental health. He focused on human rights in foreign policy, pressuring dictators to release thousands of political prisoners. He acknowledged America’s historical imperialism, pardoned Vietnam War draft evaders and relinquished control of the Panama Canal. He normalized relations with China. 'I am not nominating Jimmy Carter for a place on Mount Rushmore,' Stuart Eizenstat, Carter’s domestic policy director, wrote in a 2018 book. 'He was not a great president' but also not the 'hapless and weak' caricature voters rejected in 1980, Eizenstat said. Rather, Carter was 'good and productive' and 'delivered results, many of which were realized only after he left office.' Madeleine Albright, a national security staffer for Carter and Clinton’s secretary of state, wrote in Eizenstat’s forward that Carter was 'consequential and successful' and expressed hope that 'perceptions will continue to evolve' about his presidency. 'Our country was lucky to have him as our leader,' said Albright, who died in 2022. Jonathan Alter, who penned a comprehensive Carter biography published in 2020, said in an interview that Carter should be remembered for 'an epic American life' spanning from a humble start in a home with no electricity or indoor plumbing through decades on the world stage across two centuries. 'He will likely go down as one of the most misunderstood and underestimated figures in American history,' Alter told The Associated Press. A small-town start James Earl Carter Jr. was born Oct. 1, 1924, in Plains and spent his early years in nearby Archery. His family was a minority in the mostly Black community, decades before the civil rights movement played out at the dawn of Carter’s political career. Carter, who campaigned as a moderate on race relations but governed more progressively, talked often of the influence of his Black caregivers and playmates but also noted his advantages: His land-owning father sat atop Archery’s tenant-farming system and owned a main street grocery. His mother, Lillian, would become a staple of his political campaigns. Seeking to broaden his world beyond Plains and its population of fewer than 1,000 — then and now — Carter won an appointment to the U.S. Naval Academy, graduating in 1946. That same year he married Rosalynn Smith, another Plains native, a decision he considered more important than any he made as head of state. She shared his desire to see the world, sacrificing college to support his Navy career. Carter climbed in rank to lieutenant, but then his father was diagnosed with cancer, so the submarine officer set aside his ambitions of admiralty and moved the family back to Plains. His decision angered Rosalynn, even as she dived into the peanut business alongside her husband. Carter again failed to talk with his wife before his first run for office — he later called it 'inconceivable' not to have consulted her on such major life decisions — but this time, she was on board. 'My wife is much more political,' Carter told the AP in 2021. He won a state Senate seat in 1962 but wasn’t long for the General Assembly and its back-slapping, deal-cutting ways. He ran for governor in 1966 — losing to arch-segregationist Lester Maddox — and then immediately focused on the next campaign. Carter had spoken out against church segregation as a Baptist deacon and opposed racist 'Dixiecrats' as a state senator. Yet as a local school board leader in the 1950s he had not pushed to end school segregation even after the Supreme Court's Brown v. Board of Education decision, despite his private support for integration. And in 1970, Carter ran for governor again as the more conservative Democrat against Carl Sanders, a wealthy businessman Carter mocked as 'Cufflinks Carl.' Sanders never forgave him for anonymous, race-baiting flyers, which Carter disavowed. Ultimately, Carter won his races by attracting both Black voters and culturally conservative whites. Once in office, he was more direct. 'I say to you quite frankly that the time for racial discrimination is over,' he declared in his 1971 inaugural address, setting a new standard for Southern governors that landed him on the cover of Time magazine. 'Jimmy Who?' His statehouse initiatives included environmental protection, boosting rural education and overhauling antiquated executive branch structures. He proclaimed Martin Luther King Jr. Day in the slain civil rights leader’s home state. And he decided, as he received presidential candidates in 1972, that they were no more talented than he was. In 1974, he ran Democrats’ national campaign arm. Then he declared his own candidacy for 1976. An Atlanta newspaper responded with the headline: 'Jimmy Who?' The Carters and a 'Peanut Brigade' of family members and Georgia supporters camped out in Iowa and New Hampshire, establishing both states as presidential proving grounds. His first Senate endorsement: a young first-termer from Delaware named Joe Biden. Yet it was Carter’s ability to navigate America’s complex racial and rural politics that cemented the nomination. He swept the Deep South that November, the last Democrat to do so, as many white Southerners shifted to Republicans in response to civil rights initiatives. A self-declared 'born-again Christian,' Carter drew snickers by referring to Scripture in a Playboy magazine interview, saying he 'had looked on many women with lust. I’ve committed adultery in my heart many times.' The remarks gave Ford a new foothold and television comedians pounced — including NBC’s new 'Saturday Night Live' show. But voters weary of cynicism in politics found it endearing. Carter chose Minnesota Sen. Walter 'Fritz' Mondale as his running mate on a 'Grits and Fritz' ticket. In office, he elevated the vice presidency and the first lady’s office. Mondale’s governing partnership was a model for influential successors Al Gore, Dick Cheney and Biden. Rosalynn Carter was one of the most involved presidential spouses in history, welcomed into Cabinet meetings and huddles with lawmakers and top aides. The Carters presided with uncommon informality: He used his nickname 'Jimmy' even when taking the oath of office, carried his own luggage and tried to silence the Marine Band’s 'Hail to the Chief.' They bought their clothes off the rack. Carter wore a cardigan for a White House address, urging Americans to conserve energy by turning down their thermostats. Amy, the youngest of four children, attended District of Columbia public school. Washington’s social and media elite scorned their style. But the larger concern was that 'he hated politics,' according to Eizenstat, leaving him nowhere to turn politically once economic turmoil and foreign policy challenges took their toll. Accomplishments, and ‘malaise’ Carter partially deregulated the airline, railroad and trucking industries and established the departments of Education and Energy, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. He designated millions of acres of Alaska as national parks or wildlife refuges. He appointed a then-record number of women and nonwhite people to federal posts. He never had a Supreme Court nomination, but he elevated civil rights attorney Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the nation’s second highest court, positioning her for a promotion in 1993. He appointed Paul Volker, the Federal Reserve chairman whose policies would help the economy boom in the 1980s — after Carter left office. He built on Nixon’s opening with China, and though he tolerated autocrats in Asia, pushed Latin America from dictatorships to democracy. But he couldn’t immediately tame inflation or the related energy crisis. And then came Iran. After he admitted the exiled Shah of Iran to the U.S. for medical treatment, the American Embassy in Tehran was overrun in 1979 by followers of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Negotiations to free the hostages broke down repeatedly ahead of the failed rescue attempt. The same year, Carter signed SALT II, the new strategic arms treaty with Leonid Brezhnev of the Soviet Union, only to pull it back, impose trade sanctions and order a U.S. boycott of the Moscow Olympics after the Soviets invaded Afghanistan. Hoping to instill optimism, he delivered what the media dubbed his 'malaise' speech, although he didn’t use that word. He declared the nation was suffering 'a crisis of confidence.' By then, many Americans had lost confidence in the president, not themselves. Carter campaigned sparingly for reelection because of the hostage crisis, instead sending Rosalynn as Sen. Edward M. Kennedy challenged him for the Democratic nomination. Carter famously said he’d 'kick his ass,' but was hobbled by Kennedy as Reagan rallied a broad coalition with 'make America great again' appeals and asking voters whether they were 'better off than you were four years ago.' Reagan further capitalized on Carter’s lecturing tone, eviscerating him in their lone fall debate with the quip: 'There you go again.' Carter lost all but six states and Republicans rolled to a new Senate majority. Carter successfully negotiated the hostages’ freedom after the election, but in one final, bitter turn of events, Tehran waited until hours after Carter left office to let them walk free. 'A wonderful life' At 56, Carter returned to Georgia with 'no idea what I would do with the rest of my life.' Four decades after launching The Carter Center, he still talked of unfinished business. 'I thought when we got into politics we would have resolved everything,' Carter told the AP in 2021. 'But it’s turned out to be much more long-lasting and insidious than I had thought it was. I think in general, the world itself is much more divided than in previous years.' Still, he affirmed what he said when he underwent treatment for a cancer diagnosis in his 10th decade of life. 'I’m perfectly at ease with whatever comes,' he said in 2015. 'I’ve had a wonderful life. I’ve had thousands of friends, I’ve had an exciting, adventurous and gratifying existence.' ___ Sanz is a former Associated Press reporter.	https://apnews.com/article/jimmy-carter-dies-18c198c20352c835bca3eec276020dd7	2024-12-29T12:22:20-08:00	
What we know about the deadly passenger jet crash in South Korea	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — A passenger jet burst into flames while landing at an airport in South Korea on Sunday, killing 179 people in one of the deadliest air disasters in that nation's history. There were only two survivors, officials said. Video showed the plane skidding across the airstrip, overrunning the runway and crashing into a barrier at the airport about 290 kilometers (180 miles) south of Seoul on Sunday. Its front landing gear apparently was not deployed. Here are some things to know about crash: What preceded the deadly fire? The pilot sent out a distress signal shortly before the plane overshot the end of the runway, officials said. Footage aired by South Korean television channels showed the plane skidding — and apparently without its landing gear deployed. The jet overran the runway and hit a barrier, trigging a fiery explosion. Footage showed thick plumes of smoke billowing from the plane, which was engulfed in flames. The 15-year-old Boeing 737-800 jet was arriving from Bangkok when the crash happened at 9:03 a.m. Sunday in the town of Muan. Workers have retrieved the flight data and cockpit voice recorders of the plane’s black box, which will be examined by government experts investigating the cause of the crash and fire, Senior Transport Ministry official Joo Jong-wan said. What do we know about casualities? The jet operated by Jeju Air had 181 passengers and crew. Of those, a total of 179 people perished in the crash and ensuing fire; only two crew members survived, officials said. Family members wailed as officials announced the names of some victims at a lounge in the Muan airport. Kim E-bae, Jeju Air’s president, bowed deeply with other senior company officials as he apologized to bereaved families and said he feels 'full responsibility' for the incident. Boeing also extended condolences and said in a statement on X that it is ready to support the company in dealing with the crash. The government declared Muan a special disaster zone. What about reports of a bird strike? It will take months to determine the cause. But there are some possible clues. Lee Jeong-hyeon, chief of the Muan fire station, said workers were looking into various possibilities about what caused the crash, including whether the aircraft was struck by birds. Transport Ministry officials said the airport control tower issued a bird strike warning to the plane shortly before it intended to land and gave its pilot permission to land in a different area. The plane was destroyed with the tail assembly being the only recognizable part among the wreckage, the fire chief told a televised briefing. What is the reaction from around the world? The incident came as South Korea is embroiled in a political crisis triggered by President Yoon Suk Yeol’s stunning imposition of martial law and ensuing impeachment. Last Friday, South Korean lawmakers impeached acting President Han Duck-soo, leading Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok to take over. Choi, who traveled to the crash site, called for officials to employ all available resources to find the missing and identify the victims as soon as possible. The government designated a weeklong national mourning period through Saturday. Yoon’s office said his chief secretary, Chung Jin-suk, presided over an emergency meeting between senior presidential staff to discuss the crash and reported the details to Choi. Yoon also expressed condolences to the victims. World leaders expressed their sympathies as South Korea dealt with the tragedy. Thailand’s prime minister, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, expressed deep condolences to the families and ordered the country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs to provide assistance immediately. Pope Francis offered condolences from St. Peter's Square. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said he was 'deeply saddened by the loss of many precious lives.' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also extended condolences. —— Associated Press journalists Bobby Caina Calvan in New York, Chalida Ekvitthayavechnukul and Jintamas Saksornchai in Bangkok, Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo, Giada Zampano in Rome and David Sharp in Portland, Maine, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korean-jet-crash-fire-bird-strike-d417d443f4b59930a107493e480a0fb3	2024-12-29T07:25:34-08:00	
Syria's de facto leader says it could take up to 4 years to hold elections	BEIRUT (AP) — Syria's de facto leader said Sunday it could take up to four years to hold elections in Syria, and that he plans to dissolve his Islamist group that led the country's insurgency at an anticipated national dialogue summit for the country. Ahmad al-Sharaa, who leads Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the group leading the new authority in Syria, made the remarks in an interview with Saudi television network Al-Arabiyya. It comes almost a month after a lightning insurgency led by HTS overthrew President Bashar Assad's decades-long rule, ending the country's uprising-turned civil war that started back in 2011. Al-Sharaa said it would take time to hold elections because of the need for Syria's different forces to hold political dialogue and rewrite the country's constitution following five decades of the Assad dynasty's dictatorial rule. Also, the war-torn country's battered infrastructure needs to be reconstructed, he said. 'The chance we have today doesn’t come every 5 or 10 years,' said al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani. 'We want the constitution to last for the longest time possible.' Al-Sharaa is Syria's de facto leader until March 1, when Syria's different factions are set to hold a political dialogue to determine the country's political future and establish a transitional government that brings the divided country together. There, he said, HTS will dissolve after years of being the country's most dominant rebel group that held a strategic enclave in the country's northwest. Earlier, an Israeli airstrike in the outskirts of Damascus on Sunday killed 11 people, according to a war monitor, as Israel continues to target Syrian weapons and military infrastructure even after the ouster of Assad. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the airstrike targeted a weapons depot that belonged to Assad’s forces near the industrial town of Adra, northeast of the capital. The observatory said at least 11 people, mostly civilians, were killed. The Israeli military did not comment on the airstrike Sunday. Israel, which has launched hundreds of airstrikes over Syria since the country's uprising turned-civil war broke out in 2011, rarely acknowledges them. It says its targets are Iran-backed groups that backed Assad. Unlike his criticism of key Assad ally Iran, al-Sharaa hoped to maintain 'strategic relations' with Russia, whose air force played a critical role in keeping Assad in power for over a decade during the conflict. Moscow has a strategic airbase in Syria. The HTS leader also said negotiations are ongoing with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in northeastern Syria, and hopes that their armed forces will integrate with the Syrian security agencies. The Kurdish-led group is Washington’s key ally in Syria, where it is heavily involved in targeting sleeper cells belonging to the extremist Islamic State group. Turkish-backed Syrian rebels have been clashing with the SDF even after the insurgency, taking the key city of Manbij, as Ankara hopes to create a buffer zone near its border in northern Syria. The rebels attacked near the strategic northern border town of Kobani, while the SDF shared a video of a rocket attack that destroyed what it said was a radar system south of the city of Manbij. In other developments: — Syrian state-run media said a mass grave was found near the third largest city of Homs. SANA said civil defense workers were sent to to the site in al-Kabo, one of many suspected mass graves where tens of thousands of Syrians are believed to have been buried during a brutal crackdown under Assad and his network of security agencies. — An Egyptian activist wanted by Cairo on charges of incitement to violence and terrorism, Abdulrahman al-Qardawi, was detained by Lebanese security forces after crossing the porous border from Syria, according to two judicial and one security officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to to talk to the press. Al-Qardawi is an Egyptian activist residing in Turkey and an outspoken critic of Egypt's government. He had reportedly visited Syria to join celebrations after Assad's downfall. His late father, Youssef al-Qaradawi, was a top and controversial Egyptian cleric revered by the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood. He had lived in exile in Qatar for decades. — Lebanese security forces apprehended an armed group in the northern city of Tripoli that kidnapped a group of 26 Syrians who were recently smuggled into Lebanon, two Lebanese security officials said on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to share the information with the media. The Syrians included five women and seven children, and security officials are working to return them to Syria.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-damascus-israel-airstrike-assad-dcf827005877ab76e3fd075252fd3544	2024-12-29T07:16:21-08:00	
Flights temporarily suspended at Halifax airport after airplane landing incident	HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) — An aircraft incident at the Halifax Stanfield International Airport caused temporary delays to all flight operations Saturday night. Airport spokesperson Tiffany Chase said that at approximately 9:30 p.m. Saturday, an Air Canada Express flight operated by Pal Airlines arriving from St. John’s, Newfoundland., experienced an incident upon landing. Air Canada spokesperson Peter Fitzpatrick said the plane experienced a 'suspected landing gear issue' after arrival Saturday night, adding that the aircraft couldn't reach the terminal and the crew and 73 passengers were off-loaded by bus. Fitzpatrick said that nobody on board was injured, but a spokesperson from the Nova Scotia Royal Canadian Mounted Police, who responded to the incident alongside paramedics, said minor injuries were reported. Chase said flight operations were suspended after the incident while waiting for clearance that airfield operations could continue, and one of the airport’s runways has since resumed regular operations. The cause of the incident is unknown and pending investigation.	https://apnews.com/article/canada-halifax-landing-gear-0568df951c8fe7ebfdf4e4fa7f2de9eb	2024-12-29T05:59:54-08:00	
Azerbaijan's president says crashed jetliner was shot down by Russia unintentionally	Azerbaijan’s President Ilham Aliyev said Sunday that the Azerbaijani airliner that crashed last week was shot down by Russia, albeit unintentionally, and criticized Moscow for trying to 'hush up' the issue for days. 'We can say with complete clarity that the plane was shot down by Russia. (...) We are not saying that it was done intentionally, but it was done,' he told Azerbaijani state television. Aliyev said that the airliner, which crashed Wednesday in Kazakhstan, was hit by fire from the ground over Russia and 'rendered uncontrollable by electronic warfare.' Aliyev accused Russia of trying to 'hush up' the issue for several days, saying he was 'upset and surprised' by versions of events put forward by Russian officials. 'Unfortunately, for the first three days we heard nothing from Russia except delirious versions,' he said. The crash killed 38 of 67 people on board. The Kremlin said that air defense systems were firing near Grozny, the regional capital of the Russian republic of Chechnya, where the plane attempted to land, to deflect a Ukrainian drone strike. Aliyev said Azerbaijan made three demands to Russia in connection with the crash. 'First, the Russian side must apologize to Azerbaijan. Second, it must admit its guilt. Third, punish the guilty, bring them to criminal responsibility and pay compensation to the Azerbaijani state, the injured passengers and crew members,' he said. Aliyev noted that the first demand was 'already fulfilled' when Russian President Vladimir Putin apologized to him on Saturday. Putin called the crash a 'tragic incident' though stopped short of acknowledging Moscow’s responsibility. He said that an investigation into the crash was ongoing, and that 'the final version (of events) will be known after the black boxes are opened.' He noted that Azerbaijan was always 'in favor of a group of international experts' investigating the crash, and had 'categorically refused' Russia’s suggestion that the Interstate Aviation Committee, which oversees civil aviation in the Commonwealth of Independent States, investigate it. 'It is no secret that this organization consists mostly of Russian officials and is headed by Russian citizens. The factors of objectivity could not be fully ensured here,' Aliyev said. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian state media on Sunday that Putin had spoken to Aliyev over the phone again, but did not provide details of the conversation. The Kremlin also said a joint investigation by Russia, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan was underway at the crash site near the city of Aktau in Kazakhstan. The plane was flying from Azerbaijan’s capital, Baku, to Grozny when it turned toward Kazakhstan, hundreds of kilometers (miles) across the Caspian Sea from its intended destination, and crashed while making an attempt to land. Passengers and crew who survived the crash told Azerbaijani media that they heard loud noises on the aircraft as it was circling over Grozny. Dmitry Yadrov, head of Russia’s civil aviation authority Rosaviatsia, said Friday that as the plane was preparing to land in Grozny in deep fog, Ukrainian drones were targeting the city, prompting authorities to close the area to air traffic. The crash is the second deadly civil aviation accident linked to fighting in Ukraine. Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was downed with a Russian surface-to-air missile, killing all 298 people aboard, as it flew over the area in eastern Ukraine controlled by Moscow-backed separatists in 2014. Russia has denied responsibility, but a Dutch court in 2022 convicted two Russians and a pro-Russia Ukrainian man for their role in downing the plane with an air defense system brought into Ukraine from a Russian military base. ___ Associated Press writer Aida Sultanova in London contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/azerbaijan-russia-plane-crash-e6c1002284a900fa635eecf5573214ea	2024-12-29T03:28:36-08:00	
Syria's dwindling Jewish community can visit one of the world's oldest synagogues again	JOBAR, Syria (AP) — In this Damascus suburb, the handful of remaining Jews in Syria can again make pilgrimages to one of the world’s oldest synagogues where people from throughout the region once came to pray. Syria’s 13-year civil war left the synagogue partially destroyed. Walls and roofs have collapsed. Some artifacts are missing. A marble sign in Arabic at the gate says it was first built 720 years before Christ. Since insurgents overthrew President Bashar Assad in early December, people have been able to safely visit the widely destroyed Jobar suburb that was pounded for years by government forces while in the hands of opposition fighters. Syria was once home to one of the world's largest Jewish communities. Those numbers have shrunk dramatically, especially after the state of Israel was created in 1948. Today, only nine Jews live in Syria, according to the head of the community, almost all older men and women. The community believes that no Syrian Jews will remain in the country in a few years. One of the people visiting the Jobar Synagogue, also known as Eliyahu Hanavi synagogue, on Thursday was gray-haired Bakhour Chamntoub, the head of the community in Syria. 'This synagogue means a lot to us,' the 74-year-old told The Associated Press during his first visit in 15 years. Chamntoub had heard the synagogue was damaged, but he did not expect to see that part of it had been reduced to a pile of debris. 'I am frankly disturbed,' he said. Chamntoub said Jewish people from around the world have been calling him to say they are ready to help rebuild. He had refused to leave Syria during the war, while all 12 of his siblings left. He said he was happy in Syria and surrounded by people who respect him. Chamntoub said he had been one of the few Jews who openly spoke about his faith, adding that he never faced discrimination. He said other Jews preferred not to speak openly for safety reasons amid the animosity in Syria toward archenemy Israel and fears of being labeled spies or collaborators. The Jewish community in Syria dates back to the prophet Elijah’s Damascus sojourn nearly 3,000 years ago. After 1099, when Christian armies conquered Jerusalem in the First Crusade and massacred the city’s Muslim and Jewish inhabitants, some 50,000 Jews reportedly fled to Damascus, making up nearly a third of residents. Another wave of Jews later arrived from Europe, fleeing the Spanish Inquisition that began in 1492. The community in Syria numbered about 100,000 at the start of the 20th century. In the years surrounding Israel's creation, Syrian Jews faced increased tensions and restrictions. Many emigrated to Israel, the United States and other countries. Under the Assad family's 54-year dynasty, Jews in Syria enjoyed freedom in performing religious duties, but community members were prevented from traveling outside the country to prevent them from going to Israel until the early 1990s. Once travel restrictions were lifted after Arab-Israeli peace talks started, many more left. Before Syria’s conflict began in 2011, Chamntoub and other remaining community members came on Saturdays to Jobar for prayers. He recalled Torahs written on gazelle leather, chandeliers, tapestries and carpets. All are gone, likely stolen by looters. Barakat Hazroumi, a Muslim born and raised near the synagogue, recounted how worshipers on Saturdays asked him to turn on the lights or light a candle since Jews are not allowed to do physical labor on the Sabbath. 'It was a beautiful religious place,' Hazroumi said of the synagogue, which at some point during the war was protected by rebels. It and the whole destroyed suburb 'needs to be reconstructed from scratch.' Assad’s forces recaptured Jobar from rebels in 2018 but imposed tight security, preventing many people from reaching the area. The new rulers of Syria, led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, have said they will allow members of all religions to perform their religious duties freely. There have been some sectarian attacks but mostly against members of Assad's minority Alawite sect. After visiting the synagogue, Chamntoub returned to his home in old Damascus, close to the private Jewish school known as Maimonides that was founded in 1944 but has been closed for decades. Posters in Hebrew remain on the walls. The area is known as the Jewish quarter. Many old homes have doors and windows closed with pieces of metal and a sign in Arabic saying: 'The real estate is closed by the state's Higher Committee for the Affairs of Jews.' As the Jewish community has shrunk, it has also struggled to find kosher food. Chamntoub receives packages of meat from siblings in the U.S. at least once a year via people traveling to Syria. In the past, he went to the chicken market with a Jewish friend who would slaughter them, but the man now can hardly walk. Chamntoub mostly eats vegetarian dishes. Almost every morning, he cooks for himself and a Jewish woman in the area with no remaining relatives in Syria. The woman, 88-year-old Firdos Mallakh, sat on a couch Thursday under two blankets. When asked to greet an AP journalist with 'Shabbat Shalom,' she replied it was not yet time. 'Today is Thursday and tomorrow is Friday,' she said. Chamntoub, who makes a living as a landlord, asked Mallakh why she had not turned on the gas heater. Mallakh said she did not want to waste gas. Chamntoub hopes that with the fall of Assad, Syrians will enjoy more freedoms, economic and otherwise. In the past, he said, authorities prevented him from giving interviews without permission from the security agencies. 'I am a Jew and I am proud of it,' he said. But with so few remaining in Damascus, the city's synagogues see no services. Chamntoub is marking the eight-day Jewish holiday of Hanukkah, which began on Wednesday, alone at home.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-jews-jobar-synagogue-assad-damascus-5ce2e3900c62792072836274b3aaf75e	2024-12-29T02:33:32-08:00	
3 die off northern France coast in a Channel crossing attempt	PARIS (AP) — At least three migrants died early Sunday while attempting to cross the English Channel to Britain from northern France, authorities said. The deaths were confirmed after an early morning rescue operation involving French emergency services and the navy’s 'Dauphin' helicopter. Around 50 people were stranded in the water and on the beach near Sangatte at around 6 a.m., according to the regional prefecture. Rescuers assisted 45 individuals, including four who were transported to hospitals. Three unconscious people were pulled from the water but could not be revived, despite efforts by medical teams. An investigation has been opened by prosecutors in Boulogne-sur-Mer. Jacques Billant, the prefect of Pas-de-Calais, said an overcrowded boat may have contributed to the tragedy. 'There were more people attempting to board than the boat could hold,' he said during a press conference Sunday. Angela Eagle, the U.K. border security and asylum minister, said the boats were operated by smugglers the government has vowed to stop. 'This morning, lives have been lost at sea because ruthless criminals running the small boat trade are overloading people into unseaworthy vessels,' Eagle said. 'This government is committed to smashing these gangs.' Sunday’s tragedy comes during a spike in Channel crossing attempts as 2024 draws to a close. Officials have noted a significant increase in attempted crossings over the past few days. 'Since Dec. 24, 23 maritime incidents have been thwarted by internal security forces, saving over 1,000 lives,' said Billant. 'But crossing attempts continue, despite extremely dangerous sea conditions. The water is icy, so survival time in the water is very short.' This year has been one of the deadliest for migrants attempting the perilous journey between France and England, one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes, with at least 76 deaths reported by officials. More than 36,000 migrants have made the perilous Channel crossing so far this year, more than in 2023, though fewer than in 2022. Billant also blamed human traffickers for putting lives at risk. 'These are low-quality boats put into the water solely for profit by these criminal networks, which have no regard for the lives of these children, women and men,' he said. In November, a French court convicted 18 people in a migrant-smuggling trial that shed light on the lucrative but often deadly clandestine business of transporting people across the English Channel. Despite French and British efforts to stop it, the route remains a major smuggling corridor for people fleeing conflict or poverty. Migrants favor the U.K. for reasons of language, family ties or perceived easier access to asylum and work. __ Associated Press writer Brian Melley contributed to this story —— Follow AP’s coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/migration	https://apnews.com/article/france-migrants-die-channel-uk-bf7161771b61116a726d2209066ac192	2024-12-29T02:06:17-08:00	
Netanyahu is getting his prostate removed as he faces crises on multiple fronts	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is having his prostate removed on Sunday, his office said, a procedure that comes as he manages multiple crises at once, including the ongoing war in Gaza and his own trial for alleged corruption. Netanyahu, 75, is among a cohort of older world leaders, including U.S. President Joe Biden, 82, and President-elect Donald Trump, 78, whose health and physical fitness are under deep scrutiny both at home and abroad because of their advanced age and the effect that could have on their leadership. Netanyahu, who has had a string of health issues in recent years, has gone to great lengths to bolster a public image of himself as a fully healthy, energetic leader. During his trial this month he boasted about working 18-hour days, even if those long hours are accompanied by a cigar. But as Israel's longest-serving leader, such a grueling workload over a total of 17 years in power could also take a toll on his well-being. The procedure has already had a fallout: Netanyahu’s lawyer Amit Hadad said in a letter to the court the Israeli prime minister would be fully sedated for the procedure and would be hospitalized for 'a number of days,' asking that his three days of testimony this week be canceled. The court agreed. An acting prime minister will take over for Netanyahu while he is undergoing the procedure, according to an official familiar with the arrangements, although it wasn’t immediately clear who will step in. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to discuss the details behind the procedure with the media. With so much at stake in the turbulent region, Netanyahu’s health in wartime is a concern for both Israelis and the wider world. Prostate issues are common for older men, and recovery can be quick According to Netanyahu’s office, the Israeli leader was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection on Wednesday stemming from a benign enlargement of his prostate. The infection was treated successfully with antibiotics but a procedure on Sunday will remove his prostate. Complications from prostate enlargement are common in men in their 70s and 80s, Dr. Shay Golan, head of the oncology urology service at Israel’s Rabin Medical Center, told Israeli Army Radio. Golan spoke in general terms about the procedure and was not involved in Netanyahu's care or treatment. He said that an enlarged prostate can block proper emptying of the bladder, leading to a build-up of urine that can then lead to an infection or other complications. After medicinal treatment, doctors can recommend a procedure to remove the prostate to prevent future blockages, Golan said. In Netanyahu’s case, because the prostate is not cancerous, Golan said doctors will likely perform an endoscopic surgery, which is carried out by inserting small instruments into a body cavity, rather than making any surgical cuts in the abdomen to reach the prostate. The procedure lasts about an hour, Golan said, and recovery is quick. Golan also said that aside from catheter use for one to three days after the procedure, patients can return to normal activity without any significant limitations. Netanyahu has had some health issues before, including a heart condition Netanyahu insists he is in excellent health and his office has worked to craft a public image that backs that up. It releases footage of him touring war zones in full protective gear flanked by gruff military officers, or meeting with defense officials on windswept hilltops in youthful dark shades and puffer jackets. But that image was shattered last year when Netanyahu’s doctors revealed that he had a heart condition, a problem that he had apparently long known about but concealed from the public. A week after a fainting spell, Netanyahu was urgently fitted with a pacemaker to control his heartbeat. Only then did staff at the Sheba Medical Center reveal that Netanyahu has for years experienced a condition that can cause irregular heartbeats. That revelation came at a time when Netanyahu was dealing with massive anti-government protests. The news about a chronic heart problem stoked further anger and distrust at a time of extreme political polarization in Israel. Last year, Netanyahu was rushed to the hospital for what doctors said likely was dehydration, where he stayed overnight, prompting his weekly Cabinet meeting to be delayed. Earlier this year, Netanyahu underwent hernia surgery, during which he was under full anesthesia and unconscious. His close confidant, Justice Minister Yariv Levin, served as acting prime minister during the operation. The prostate removal comes at a turbulent time in the region As Israel’s leader, Netanyahu is at the center of major global events that are shifting the Middle East. With the dizzying pace of the past 14 months, being incapacitated for even a few hours can be risky in the current regional maelstrom. Netanyahu will be in hospital at a time when international mediators are pushing Israel and Hamas to reach a ceasefire in Gaza as violence there rages on and fighting between Israel and Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels intensifies. The health issue also shines a new light on Netanyahu’s age. Prostate issues are common and in many cases easily treatable. But they are prominent, especially among older men. The procedure puts a dent in Netanyahu’s image of vigor at a time when would want to project strength more than ever, both to an Israeli audience navigating constant threats as well as to Israel's enemies looking to expose Israel's weaknesses.	https://apnews.com/article/netanyahu-israel-health-prostate-war-ffa0430d621307d34a673a0428ece945	2024-12-29T01:19:51-08:00	
Kavelashvili is inaugurated as Georgia's president, complicating its path toward EU	TBILISI, Goergia (AP) — Former soccer player Mikheil Kavelashvili was formally inaugurated as president of Georgia on Sunday, cementing the ruling party's grip in what the opposition calls a blow to the country’s EU aspirations and a victory for former imperial ruler Russia. Outgoing pro-Western Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili said Sunday morning that she would vacate her residence at the Orbeliani Palace in Tbilisi, but insisted she was still the legitimate office holder. 'I will come out of here, come out to you and be with you. ... This presidential residence was a symbol as long as there was a president here who was legitimate. I bring legitimacy with me,' Zourabichvili told a crowd of supporters outside the palace. She called Kavelashvili's inauguration a 'parody.' Kavelashvili, 53, who was the only candidate on the ballot, easily won the vote earlier in December given the Georgian Dream party’s control of a 300-seat electoral college that replaced direct presidential elections in 2017. It is made up of members of Parliament, municipal councils and regional legislatures. In his speech Sunday, Kavelashvili promised to be 'everyone’s president, regardless of whether they like me or not.' He called for the nation to unite behind him around 'shared values, the principles of mutual respect, and the future we should build together.' Georgian Dream retained control of Parliament in the South Caucasus nation in an Oct. 26 election that the opposition alleges was rigged with Moscow’s help. The party has vowed to continue pushing toward accession in the European Union but also wants to 'reset' ties with Russia. Georgia’s outgoing president and main pro-Western parties have boycotted the post-election parliamentary sessions and demanded a rerun of the ballot. In 2008 Russia fought a brief war with Georgia, which led to Moscow’s recognition of two breakaway regions as independent, and an increase in the Russian military presence in South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Critics have accused Georgian Dream — established by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia — of becoming increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow, accusations the ruling party has denied. The party recently pushed through laws similar to those used by the Kremlin to crack down on freedom of speech and LGBTQ+ rights. Georgian Dream’s decision last month to suspend talks on their country’s bid to join the EU added to the opposition’s outrage and galvanized protests. Protesters in front of the parliament building on Sunday held red cards, in reference to Kavelashvili’s career in soccer. 'Because today our president is a footballer, we are showing him a red card. The next step will be sending him off the pitch. The Georgian people will definitely do this, because it was a circus that they have held today in the parliament,' protester Sofia Shamanidi told The Associated Press. The outgoing president demands new elections Zourabichvili, 72, was born in France to parents with Georgian roots and had a successful career with the French Foreign Ministry before President Mikheil Saakashvili named her Georgia’s top diplomat in 2004. Constitutional changes made the president’s job largely ceremonial before Zourabichvili was elected by popular vote with Georgian Dream’s support in 2018. She became sharply critical of the ruling party, accusing it of pro-Russia policies, and Georgian Dream unsuccessfully tried to impeach her. Zourabichvili has rejected government claims that the opposition was fomenting violence. 'We are not demanding a revolution,' she told The Associated Press. 'We are asking for new elections, but in conditions that will ensure that the will of the people will not be misrepresented or stolen again. Who is the new president? Georgia's opposition has mocked Kavelashvili for lacking higher education. He was a striker in the English Premier League for Manchester City and played for several clubs in the Swiss Super League. He was elected to Parliament in 2016 on the Georgian Dream ticket, and in 2022 co-founded the People’s Power political movement, which was allied with Georgian Dream and become known for its strong anti-Western rhetoric. Kavelashvili was one of the authors of a controversial law requiring organizations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as 'pursuing the interest of a foreign power,' similar to a Russian law used to discredit critical organizations. The EU, which granted Georgia candidate status in December 2023 on condition that the country meets the bloc’s recommendations, put its accession on hold and cut financial support in June following approval of the 'foreign influence' law. How did protests unfold? Thousands of demonstrators converged on the parliament building every night after the government announced the suspension of EU accession talks on Nov. 28. Riot police used water cannons and tear gas almost daily to disperse and beat scores of protesters, some of whom threw fireworks at police officers and built barricades on the capital’s central boulevard. Hundreds were detained and over 100 treated for injuries. Several journalists were beaten by police and media workers accused authorities of using thugs to deter people from attending anti-government rallies, which Georgian Dream denies. The crackdown has drawn strong condemnation from the United States and EU officials.	https://apnews.com/article/georgia-president-zourabichvili-russia-kavelashvili-215020983cefb6ce1eb2ecad184a9c1e	2024-12-29T01:07:32-08:00	
North Korea's Kim vows the toughest anti-US policy before Trump takes office	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un vowed to implement the 'toughest' anti-U.S. policy, state media reported Sunday, less than a month before Donald Trump takes office as U.S. president. Trump’s return to the White House raises prospects for high-profile diplomacy with North Korea. During his first term, Trump met Kim three times for talks on the North's nuclear program. Many experts however say a quick resumption of Kim-Trump summitry is unlikely as Trump would first focus on conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. North Korea's support for Russia's war against Ukraine also poses a challenge to efforts to revive diplomacy, experts say. During a five-day plenary meeting of the ruling Workers’ Party that ended Friday, Kim called the U.S. 'the most reactionary state that regards anti-communism as its invariable state policy.' Kim said that the U.S.-South Korea-Japan security partnership is expanding into 'a nuclear military bloc for aggression.' 'This reality clearly shows to which direction we should advance and what we should do and how,' Kim said, according to the official Korean Central News Agency. It said Kim's speech 'clarified the strategy for the toughest anti-U.S. counteraction to be launched aggressively' by North Korea for its long-term national interests and security. KCNA didn't elaborate on the anti-U.S. strategy. But it said Kim set forth tasks to bolster military capability through defense technology advancements and stressed the need to improve the mental toughness of North Korean soldiers. The previous meetings between Trump and Kim had not only put an end to their exchanges of fiery rhetoric and threats of destruction, but they developed personal connections. Trump once famously said he and Kim 'fell in love.' But their talks eventually collapsed in 2019, as they wrangled over U.S.-led sanctions on the North. North Korea has since sharply increased the pace of its weapons testing activities to build more reliable nuclear missiles targeting the U.S. and its allies. The U.S. and South Korea have responded by expanding their military bilateral drills and also trilateral ones involving Japan, drawing strong rebukes from the North, which views such U.S.-led exercises as invasion rehearsals. Further complicating efforts to convince North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons in return for economic and political benefits is its deepening military cooperation with Russia. According to U.S., Ukrainian and South Korean assessments, North Korea has sent more than 10,000 troops and conventional weapons systems to support Moscow's war against Ukraine. There are concerns that Russia could give North Korea advanced weapons technology in return, including help to build more powerful nuclear missiles. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said last week that 3,000 North Korean troops have been killed and wounded in the fighting in Russia's Kursk region. It was the first significant estimate by Ukraine of North Korean casualties since the North Korean troop deployment to Russia began in October. Russia and China, locked in separate disputes with the U.S., have repeatedly blocked U.S.-led pushes to levy more U.N. sanctions on North Korea despite its repeated missile tests in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions. Last month, Kim said that his past negotiations with the United States only confirmed Washington’s 'unchangeable' hostility toward his country and described his nuclear buildup as the only way to counter external threats.	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-kim-us-trump-nuclear-966025c8f264422ad6b5d5b46dafd317	2024-12-29T00:47:12-08:00	
Croatia holds a presidential election with the incumbent NATO and EU critic considered favorite	ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) — Croatia’s left-leaning president, an outspoken critic of Western military support for Ukraine in its war against Russia, is running for reelection in the Adriatic Sea state, but is unlikely to get an outright majority in the first round of voting on Sunday. President Zoran Milanović, who is often compared to Donald Trump for his combative style of communication with political opponents, faces seven other contenders, including Dragan Primorac, the candidate of the ruling Croatian Democratic Union. The two are expected to face off in the second round on Jan. 12 if no contender gets more than 50% of the vote, according to pre-election polls. The most popular politician in Croatia, 58-year-old Milanović had served as prime minister in the past. Populist in style, Milanovic has been a fierce critic of current Prime Minister Andrej Plenković and continuous sparring between the two has lately marked Croatia’s political scene. 'Since the election silence is still on, I just want to call on people to get out and vote. To support me,' Milanović said after he voted on Sunday. He predicted there would be a second round in two weeks. Plenković, the prime minister, has sought to portray the vote as one about Croatia’s future in the EU and NATO. He has labeled Milanović 'pro-Russian' and a threat to Croatia’s international standing. 'The difference between him and Milanović is quite simple: Milanović is leading us East, Primorac is leading us West,' he said. Though the presidency is largely ceremonial in Croatia, an elected president holds political authority and acts as the supreme commander of the military. Milanović has criticized the NATO and European Union support for Ukraine and has often insisted that Croatia should not take sides. He has said Croatia should stay away from global disputes, thought it is a member of both NATO and the EU. Milanović has also blocked Croatia’s participation in a NATO-led training mission for Ukraine, declaring that 'no Croatian soldier will take part in somebody else’s war.' His main rival in the election, Primorac, has stated that 'Croatia’s place is in the West, not the East.' His presidency bid, however, has been marred by a high-level corruption case that landed Croatia’s health minister in jail last month and which featured prominently in pre-election debates. During the election campaign, Primorac has sought to portray himself as a unifier and Milanović as divisive. 'Today is an extremely important day,' Primorac said after casting his ballot. 'Croatia is going forward into the future. Croatia needs unity, Croatia needs its global positioning, and above all Croatia needs peaceful life.' Trailing a distant third in the pre-election polls is Marija Selak Raspudić, a conservative independent candidate. She has focused her election campaign on the economic troubles of ordinary citizens, corruption and issues such as population decline in the country of some 3.8 million. Sunday’s presidential election is Croatia’s third vote this year, following a snap parliamentary election in April and the European Parliament balloting in June.	https://apnews.com/article/croatia-election-presidential-milanovic-de56eda2458bcffc86055c2e3471a7b8	2024-12-28T22:45:25-08:00	
A suicide bomber kills a police officer and wounds another in southern Iran	TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — A suicide bomber killed a local police officer and wounded another in a southern Iranian port city, home to a large Sunni Muslim community, local media said Sunday. The hard-line Javan Daily, a newspaper close to the country's powerful Revolutionary Guard, said the attacker stopped Capt. Mojtaba Shahid’s car Saturday evening in Bandar Lengeh in the province of Hormozgan before detonating his vest. Shahid’s deputy, who was also in the car, has been hospitalized in critical condition, the paper reported, describing the attack as an act of terrorism. The city, some 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) south of the capital Tehran, has no recent history of militancy. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, but some local news outlets claimed Ansar al-Furqan, an Al-Qaeda-linked Sunni militant group, was behind it.	https://apnews.com/article/iran-sunni-suicide-bomber-attack-2f2b55b517eaefd14ff35291f96e28ec	2024-12-28T22:40:00-08:00	
A Palestinian was shot dead in her West Bank home. Her family blames Palestinian security forces	JENIN, West Bank (AP) — A Palestinian woman was shot and killed in her home in the volatile northern West Bank town of Jenin, where the Palestinian Authority is carrying out a rare campaign against militants. The family of Shatha al-Sabbagh, a 22-year-old journalism student, said she was killed by a sniper with the Palestinian security forces late Saturday while she was with her mother and two small children. They said there were no militants in the area at the time. A statement from the Palestinian security forces said she was shot by 'outlaws' — the term it has been using for local militants who have been battling Israeli forces in recent years. The security forces condemned the shooting and vowed to investigate it. Separately, a fourth infant has died of hypothermia in the Gaza Strip, where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians displaced by nearly 15 months of war are huddled in tents along the rainy, windswept coast, while an Israeli strike on a hospital that the army said was being used by militants killed seven people. The Western-backed Palestinian Authority exercises limited self-rule in parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. It is deeply unpopular among Palestinians, largely because it cooperates with Israel on security matters, even as Israel accuses it of incitement and of generally turning a blind eye to militancy. In a statement, the al-Sabbagh family accused the Palestinian security forces of having become 'repressive tools that practice terrorism against their own people instead of protecting their dignity and standing up to the (Israeli) occupation.' The Hamas militant group also blamed the security forces and condemned the shooting. It noted that al-Sabbagh was the sister of one of its fighters who was killed in a battle with Israeli troops last year. Later on Sunday, hundreds of people took part in a demonstration in Jenin in support of the Palestinian security forces. The rally was organized by President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah party, which dominates the Palestinian Authority and its security forces. Palestinian security forces launched a rare operation earlier this month in Jenin that they said was aimed at restoring law and order, while critics accuse the authority of aiding the occupation. Violence has flared in the West Bank since Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack out of Gaza triggered the war there. Israel captured the West Bank, along with Gaza and east Jerusalem, in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want all three territories for a future state. An infant dies from cold and his twin is hospitalized in Gaza In the Gaza Strip, 20-day-old Jomaa al-Batran died from hypothermia and his twin brother Ali was in the intensive care unit of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. Their father, Yehia, said the twins were born one month premature and were only able to spend a day in the nursery at the hospital, which like other health centers in Gaza has been overwhelmed by the war and is only partially functioning. He said medics told their mother to keep the newborns warm, but it was impossible because they live in a tent and temperatures regularly drop below 10 degrees Celsius (50 F) at night. 'We are eight people, and we only have four blankets,' al-Batran said as he cradled his son's body. He said he woke up early Sunday and found that the baby's head was 'cold as ice.' At least three other babies have died from the cold in recent weeks, according to local health officials. Israeli report details abuse of hostages held in Gaza The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250, including women, children and older adults. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s Health Ministry released a report Sunday detailing what it said was widespread physical, psychological and sexual abuse of people who had been held in Gaza. The report, based on the findings of doctors who treated some of the more than 100 hostages released during a ceasefire last year, said the captives — including children — had been subjected to 'severe physical and sexual abuse, such as beatings, isolation, deprivation of food and water, branding, hair-pulling, and sexual assault.' The findings, which are to be sent to the United Nations, could increase pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to agree to a ceasefire and hostage release with Hamas. Families of the hostages and their supporters have held weekly mass demonstrations for months, and diplomats have reported recent progress in the long-running indirect talks. Strike on a hospital in Gaza City kills 7 An Israeli strike on the upper floor of a hospital in Gaza City on Sunday killed at least seven people and wounded several others, according to the Civil Defense, first responders affiliated with the Hamas-run government. The Israeli military said it struck a Hamas control center inside the building, which it said was no longer serving as a hospital. Israel’s offensive has killed over 45,000 Palestinians and wounded more than 100,000, according to local health authorities. They say women and children make up more than half the fatalities but do not distinguish between militants and civilians in their count. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. Israel's bombardment and ground operations have displaced some 90% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million people, often multiple times. Vast areas of the territory, including entire neighborhoods, have been pounded to ruins, and critical infrastructure has been destroyed. Israeli restrictions, ongoing fighting and the breakdown of law and order have hindered the delivery of humanitarian aid, raising fears of famine, while widespread hunger has left people at greater risk of disease and death. ___ Shurafa reported from Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip.

Bolivia's former leader Evo Morales seeks a political comeback from his stronghold in the tropics	LAUCA Ñ, Bolivia (AP) — Bolivia's former leader Evo Morales has a campaign pitch for 2025 that has worked elsewhere: Other politicians of recent years have brought you nothing but misery. It's time for a return to the past. His supporters are looking to Morales for a rescue from the five tumultuous years since his 2019 resignation. The country's first Indigenous president, Morales is credited with spreading the wealth of a commodities boom and ushering in a rare stretch of social and economic stability during his nearly 14 years in office. His detractors say Morales — who built an economy uncomfortably dependent on natural gas reserves and sought to stay in power longer than Bolivia’s constitution allows — bears responsibility for much of the turmoil that followed his tenure. An ally turned rival A bitter political battle is looming between Morales, 65, and his former economy minister and once-protégé, President Luis Arce, over who will lead their long-dominant leftist Movement Toward Socialism, or MAS, into the August 2025 election. Arce has unleashed allies in the judiciary against Morales, with the Constitutional Court disqualifying Morales' candidacy and ousting him from the leadership of MAS, a party he helped found in the 1990s. Prosecutors in mid-December charged Morales with statutory rape for fathering a child with a 15-year-old girl when he was 56 and president. Morales didn't deny the relationship but accused Arce of deploying a 'dirty, odious' campaign to undermine him. Fighting from the tropics Since talk of his arrest warrant surfaced in September, Morales has been holed up in Bolivia’s coca-growing region of Chapare, ringed by loyal supporters. Here, the former coca farmer and fiery union leader — long considered one of the last of the so-called 'pink wave' of leftist leaders who once dominated Latin American politics — is planning his comeback. Few outsiders are allowed inside his stronghold in Bolivia’s steamy lowlands, but The Associated Press was invited last month for a look from behind the barricades. 'They don’t want me to be the candidate because they know I’ll win,' Morales told the AP. 'We’re in a state of total siege, morally, legally and politically.' The four-hour drive to Chapare from Bolivia’s third-biggest city of Cochabamba is steep and slick with mist. A narcotics checkpoint from the U.S.-financed war on drugs that wreaked havoc across this jungle is far less intimidating than the makeshift checkpoints manned by Morales' followers. In the ‘Land of Evo’ As the van rumbled on, Pedro Cepita, a guide tasked with accompanying the AP, pointed out Morales' accomplishments in the long-stigmatized Chapare — university buildings, cell towers, an airport, a 25,000-seat soccer stadium. Morales’ face adorns murals alongside cult heroes like Che Guevara and Fidel Castro. 'Evo 2025-2030' slogans blanket brick houses. 'We’re in la Tierra de Evo,' Cepita said — the Land of Evo. At sandbagged checkpoints, Morales' supporters — some with batons on their belts — waved the van through only after recognizing Cepita. Security forces, chased out by Morales’ followers, rarely venture here. Door-knocking census workers — even emergency rescuers responding to a deadly landslide last month — said they were harassed and kicked out by Morales’ coca union activists. Earlier this month and after 40 days of negotiations, police began trickling back. Almost divine reverence Coca farmers drying their leaves proudly recount how Morales kicked out U.S. anti-drug agents almost in the same breath as they extoll the benefits of the coca plant, cherished by Indigenous communities and maligned by the West as the raw material for cocaine. 'Brother Evo was in these fields with us,' said Jose Luis Calicho, 39, nodding toward Morales’ own plot of land. 'He knows we’re not criminals, we’re not narco-traffickers.' Since October, when gunmen opened fire at his convoy, Morales, who was unharmed, has slept inside the fortress-like compound of his coca-growing union. He says the shooting was an assassination attempt and blames Arce’s government, which denies involvement. Outside the high walls, dozens of his followers lounge on tarps blocking the street. Some rest after all-night security shifts, others keep watch, their cheeks bulging with wads of coca — a mild stimulant. 'It’s our responsibility to Evo, we can’t take chances,' said Reyna Peñaloza, 44. 'With us, he’ll return to power.' A stark disconnect Those who believe Morales’ comeback can close the door on years of political and economic paralysis are less clear about the kind of future he could bring. 'When I came to power in 2005, the nation was suffering, and I transformed it,' Morales said. 'Now our crisis is even worse. We don't have fuel, we don't have dollars.' Most Bolivians, stinging from surging inflation and waiting in long lines to fill their tanks, agree on that. But attitudes toward Morales are starkly different in his remote redoubt in Chapare and the rest of the country of 12 million — especially when it comes to the 2016 statutory rape case that indelibly tarnished his reputation. In the upscale districts of La Paz, the capital, residents say they're repulsed by his actions. Freshly painted graffiti asks: 'Would you vote for a pedophile?' 'The political damage to Evo's good image is devastating,' said Romer Alejo, a criminal lawyer in La Paz. Informal efforts to gauge public opinion in La Paz suggests that two or three out of every 10 Bolivians would vote for him. His critics condemn Morales' constitution-bending efforts to hold onto power longer than any leader in Bolivia's modern history. 'We’re at a breaking point,' said Martín Sivak, the author of a biography on Morales. 'There’s a verdict from Bolivians on this idea of staying in power for too long.' A long way to go Legal troubles aside, whether Morales can reclaim his party and the country’s top job is unclear. His supporters say he’ll find a way around the court ban — perhaps by launching a new party. But the packed crowds of 2014 are no longer there. A recent MAS congress in Chapare declared Morales was the party’s 'only legitimate candidate,' but a 'Viva, Evo!' chant faded quickly in the half-full auditorium. Still, Bolivia's right-wing opposition is fractured. Protests are mounting over Arce’s failure to halt a currency collapse. Morales’ supporters threaten to convulse the country if he’s not on the ballot. 'We’ll win through our struggle,' Morales loyalist and lawmaker Alina Canaviri Sullcani said. 'There’s no alternative.' Even if Morales has become too divisive, without him, many fear the long unstable Andean nation could veer back toward chaos. Morales' 2019 ouster elevated a right-wing interim president, Jeanine Áñez, who cracked down on her political opponents and sought to purge Morales’ legacy. On a hot, sticky morning last month, Morales emerged from his hideout with heavy security, to check on his fields. As he hunched over to cut weeds, his aides pulled out their smartphones to film him — a throwback to the early 2000s, when videos of the son of llama famers in his humble alpaca sweater were a magnet for foreign media. But Morales didn't seem to notice. When everyone had gone, he kept on working. He said he wasn’t close to finishing.	https://apnews.com/article/bolivia-evo-morales-president-arce-campaign-f60ff6a58041d01fe910c65f409d0b05	2024-12-28T21:04:50-08:00	
2024 was a year of triumphs and setbacks for Russian leader Vladimir Putin. Here's how it unfolded	In 2024, President Vladimir Putin further cemented his grip on power and sought to counter Russia's isolation from the West over the war in Ukraine. But he faced continuing challenges, with a deadly attack by gunmen in Moscow and an incursion by Kyiv's troops on his territory. As Russia's nearly 3-year-old war in Ukraine enters a new, potentially pivotal phase amid a new U.S. administration and its uncertain support for Kyiv, here's a look back at how the year unfolded for Putin: January: A presidential campaign with no real opponents Putin ran for a fifth term in office with his top opponents either jailed or exiled abroad. But in a rare show of defiance, thousands of Russians queued in the January cold to sign petitions for an unlikely challenger. Boris Nadezhdin, a 60-year-old legislator and war critic, got the 100,000 signatures needed to put him on the ballot, but election authorities eventually barred him from running. Still, the support he received reflected anti-war sentiment and public longing for political competition in an embarrassment for Putin. February: Alexei Navalny dies in prison On Feb. 16, Putin's longtime foe Alexei Navalny died in an arctic prison colony while serving a 19-year sentence on charges widely seen as politically motivated. The news of his death at age 47 shocked the world and robbed the opposition of its most charismatic leader. No exact cause of death was given, and his family and allies blamed the Kremlin, which denied involvement. Tens of thousands of mourners attended his Moscow funeral two weeks later in a show of defiance. March: A concert massacre darkens Putin's election win On March 17, Putin secured his expected election triumph, which will keep him in office until 2030, following the harshest crackdown on dissent since Soviet times. Five days later, gunmen stormed a concert hall on Moscow's outskirts, killing over 140 people and setting the venue ablaze. An affiliate of the Islamic State group claimed responsibility, although the Kremlin, without evidence, tried to blame Ukraine for the deadliest attack on Russian soil in almost two decades. The assault stunned the capital and rekindled memories of other attacks in the early years of Putin’s presidency. June: Putin visits North Korea to forge stronger ties Putin made a two-day visit to North Korea in June — his first in 24 years — as the countries deepened their ties in the face of intensifying confrontations with Washington. The pact signed by Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un envisions mutual military assistance if either country is attacked. The new agreement marked their strongest link since the end of the Cold War, adding to concerns in Washington and Seoul. July: Reporter Gershkovich convicted in a trial denounced as a sham Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, arrested in March 2023 and accused of espionage, was convicted and sentenced to 16 years in prison in a swift trial. His employers and the U.S. government denounced the process as a sham and rejected the charges as fabricated. Without presenting evidence, authorities claimed he was gathering secret information for the U.S. Gershkovich, the American-born son of Soviet immigrants, was the first Western reporter arrested on espionage charges in post-Soviet Russia, in a chilling signal to international journalists. August: Mass prisoner swap and Ukraine's push into Kursk On Aug. 1, Washington and Moscow completed the biggest East-West prisoner swap in post-Soviet history. Those released included Gershkovich and fellow American Paul Whelan, along with prominent Russian dissidents like Vladimir Kara-Murza and Ilya Yashin. The multinational deal freed two dozen people — including Vadim Krasikov, serving a life sentence in Germany for killing a former Chechen militant in Berlin. Also in August, Ukraine launched a surprise incursion into Russia’s Kursk region in the largest cross-border raid by Kyiv’s forces. It exposed Russia’s vulnerabilities and dealt an embarrassing blow to the Kremlin, with tens of thousands of civilians fleeing the region. With the bulk of the Russian army engaged in eastern Ukraine, few troops were left to protect the Kursk region. Russia forces have since regained control over part of the territory but have so far failed to completely dislodge Kyiv's troops. September: Putin visits Mongolia without fear of arrest Putin traveled to regional ally Mongolia in September in a move widely seen as an attempt to counter Western efforts to isolate him over the Ukraine war. Mongolia was among the countries that ratified a treaty establishing the International Criminal Court, which in 2023 issued an arrest warrant for Putin for alleged war crimes in Ukraine. Mongolia ignored calls to arrest the Russian leader and gave him a red-carpet welcome, with both countries signing deals on energy supplies and power plant upgrades. October: US says North Korean troops are in Russia In October, the Pentagon announced North Korea sent about 10,000 troops to Russia to join the fighting against Ukraine — a move Western leaders said will intensify the war and jolt relations in Asia. Moscow and Pyongyang have remained tight-lipped about the claims of deployment. Putin also hosted a summit of the BRICS bloc of nations, attended by leaders or representatives of 36 countries, in what many saw as an effort to highlight the failure of U.S.-led efforts to isolate Russia. November: A T rump victory and a new lethal Russian missile Former President Donald Trump won a new term in the White House in November, raising concerns that his administration would cut military support for Ukraine and force it to negotiate with Moscow. Current President Joe Biden allowed Kyiv to use U.S.-supplied longer-range weapons for deeper strikes on Russian soil. Russia responded by firing a new hypersonic intermediate-range ballistic missile — called the Oreshnik — at a city in central Ukraine. Putin boasted the missile can't be intercepted by air defenses. He warned that Moscow could use it for more strikes on Ukraine and also potentially to hit military facilities of NATO countries giving military support to Ukraine. December: An ally falls, a bomb rocks Moscow and a plane crash draws an apology The government of Syrian leader Bashar Assad crumbled after a lightning offensive by rebels. Putin granted asylum to Moscow's longtime ally Assad and his family, but the Kremlin's failure to prevent his downfall nine years after it intervened militarily to prop up his rule exposed the limits of Russia’s power and dented its international clout at a pivotal stage of its war in Ukraine. Then, an embarrassing attack again brought the war to the streets of Moscow. Lt. Gen Igor Kirillov, the chief of Russia’s Radiation, Biological and Chemical Protection Forces, was killed alongside an aide by a bomb planted outside his apartment building. Putin described Kirillov’s killing as a 'major blunder' by security agencies. On the final weekend of the year, Putin apologized for what he called a 'tragic incident' in Russian airspace involving the Dec. 25 crash of an Azerbaijani jetliner that killed 38 people in neighboring Kazakhstan. His statement came amid mounting allegations the plane was shot down by Russian air defenses trying to stop a Ukrainian drone attack near Grozny in the Russian republic of Chechnya. While Russian officials acknowledged that air defense systems were at work, Putin's apology to Azerbaijan's leader stopped short of saying Moscow took responsibility.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-putin-war-ukraine-north-korea-navalny-110be178bbeb8ca4c468969c0de935ac	2024-12-28T20:07:04-08:00	
Plane burst into flames after skidding off runway at an airport in South Korea, killing at least 62	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — A passenger plane burst into flames Sunday after it skid off a runway at a South Korean airport and slammed into a concrete fence when its front landing gear apparently failed to deploy, killing at least 62 people, officials said, in one of the country's worst aviation disasters. The National Fire Agency said the fire was almost put out but officials were still trying to pull people from the Jeju Air passenger plane carrying 181 people at the airport in the town of Muan, about 290 kilometers (180 miles) south of Seoul. At least 62 people — 37 women and 25 men — had died in the fire, the agency said. Emergency workers pulled out two people — one passenger and one crew member. It said it deployed 32 fire trucks and several helicopters to contain the fire. Footage of the crash aired by YTN television showed the Jeju Air plane skidding across the airstrip, apparently with its landing gear still closed, and colliding head-on with a concrete wall on the outskirts of the facility. The transport ministry said the incident happened at 9:03 a.m. local time. Local TV stations aired footage showing thick pillows of black smoke billowing from the plane engulfed with flame. Emergency officials in Muan said they were examining the cause of the fire. They said the plane’s landing gear appeared to have malfunctioned. The transport ministry said the plane was returning from Bangkok and its passengers include two Thai nationals. Thailand’s prime minister, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, expressed deep condolences to the families of those affected by the accident through a post on social platform X. Paetongtarn said she had ordered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to provide assistance immediately. It’s one of the deadliest disasters in South Korea’s aviation history. The last time South Korea suffered a large-scale air disaster was in 1997, when an Korean Airline plane crashed in Guam, killing 228 people on board. The incident came as South Korea is embroiled into a huge political crisis triggered by President Yoon Suk Yeol’s stunning imposition of martial law and ensuing impeachment. Last Friday, South Korean lawmakers impeached acting President Han Duck-soo and suspended his duties, making Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok to take over. Choi ordered officials to employ all available resources to rescue the passengers and crew before he headed to Muan. Yoon’s office said his chief secretary, Chung Jin-suk, will preside over an emergency meeting between senior presidential staff later on Sunday to discuss the crash.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-plane-fire-68da9b0bd5196feed6e7d2db849f461a	2024-12-28T15:56:18-08:00	
Trump appears to side with Musk, tech allies in debate over foreign workers roiling his supporters	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump appears to be siding with Elon Musk and his other backers in the tech industry as a dispute over immigration visas has divided his supporters. Trump, in an interview with the New York Post on Saturday, praised the use of visas to bring skilled foreign workers to the U.S. The topic has become a flashpoint within his conservative base. 'I’ve always liked the visas, I have always been in favor of the visas. That’s why we have them,' Trump said. In fact, Trump has in the past criticized the H-1B visas, calling them 'very bad' and 'unfair' for U.S. workers. During his first term as president, he unveiled a 'Hire American' policy that directed changes to the program to try to ensure the visas were awarded to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants. Despite his criticism of them and attempts to curb their use, he has also used the visas at his businesses in the past, something he acknowledged in his interview Saturday. 'I have many H-1B visas on my properties. I’ve been a believer in H-1B. I have used it many times. It’s a great program,' Trump told the newspaper. He did not appear to address questions about whether he would pursue any changes to the number or use of the visas once he takes office Jan. 20. Trump's hardline immigration policies, focused mostly on immigrants who are in the country illegally, were a cornerstone of his presidential campaign and a priority issue for his supporters. But in recent days, his coalition has split in a public debate largely taking place online about the tech industry's hiring of foreign workers. Hard-right members of Trump's movement have accused Musk and others in Trump's new flank of tech-world supporters of pushing policies at odds with Trump's 'America First' vision. Software engineers and others in the tech industry have used H-1B visas for skilled foreign workers and say they are a critical tool for hard-to-fill positions. But critics have said they undercut U.S. citizens who could take those jobs. Some on the right have called for the program to be eliminated.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-maga-immigration-visas-musk-91ab17e141cc9764fb18b8bc862c84dc	2024-12-28T11:27:24-08:00	
Syria's embassy in Lebanon suspends services as Lebanon hands over former Syrian army officers	BEIRUT (AP) — Syria’s embassy in Lebanon suspended consular services Saturday, a day after two relatives of deposed Syrian President Bashar Assad were arrested at the Beirut airport with allegedly forged passports. Also on Saturday, Lebanese authorities handed over dozens of Syrians — including former officers in the Syrian army under Assad — to the new Syrian authorities after they were caught illegally entering Lebanon, a war monitor and Lebanese officials said. The embassy announced on its Facebook page that consular work was suspended 'until further notice' at the order of the Syrian foreign ministry. The announcement did not give a reason for the suspension. Two Lebanese security officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, said the suspension was ordered because the passports belonging to Assad’s relatives — the wife and daughter of one of his cousins — were believed to have been forged at the embassy. Assad’s uncle, Rifaat Assad — who has been indicted in Switzerland on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity — had flown out the day before on his real passport and was not stopped, the officials said. The U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported Saturday that 70 Syrians, including former army officers, were handed over by a Lebanese security delegation to the security forces of the new Syrian government, led by the former insurgent group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS. Three Lebanese judicial officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed the report. Regional countries have been quick to establish ties with Syria’s new rulers. Delegations of Libyan and Bahraini officials arrived in Damascus on Saturday on official visits. HTS leader Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, has largely succeeded in calming fears within and outside of Syria that his group would unleash collective punishment against communities that supported Assad’s rule or attempt to impose strict Islamic law on the country’s religious minorities. However, in recent days, sporadic clashes have broken out between the HTS-led security forces and pro-Assad armed groups. The country’s new security forces have launched a series of raids targeting officials affiliated with Assad and have set up checkpoints in areas with significant populations of the Alawite religious minority to which the former president belongs to search for weapons. There have also been ongoing tensions and clashes in northeastern Syria between Kurdish-led forces and armed groups backed by Turkey. Many Kurds have viewed the new order in Damascus, which appears to have strengthened Turkey’s hand in Syria, with anxiety. Ankara sees the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces — a key U.S. ally in the fight against the Islamic State group — as an affiliate of its sworn enemy, the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, which it classifies as a terrorist organization. The U.S. State Department said Saturday that Secretary of State Antony Blinken had spoken with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan to 'discuss the latest developments in Syria.' 'Secretary Blinken emphasized the need to support a Syrian-led and Syrian-owned political process that upholds human rights and prioritizes an inclusive and representative government,' the statement said, adding that they 'also discussed the shared goal of preventing terrorism from endangering the security' of Turkey and Syria. On Saturday, hundreds of protesters convened by Kurdish women’s groups participated in a demonstration in the northeastern city of Hasaka to demand women’s rights in the new Syria. Perishan Ramadan, a participant from Hasaka, said the new government 'is worse than Bashar' and that its leaders are Islamist extremists who 'don’t accept any role for women.' While the country’s new leaders have not attempted to impose Islamic dress or other conventions, it remains to be seen what role women will have in the new order and whether they will hold political or government positions. 'Women must be present in the new constitution for Syria,' said Rihan Loqo, spokeswoman for the Kongra Star women’s organization. '... Women’s rights should not be ignored.' ___ Associated Press writers Hogir Abdo in Hasaka, Syria, and Ellen Knickmeyer in Washington contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-lebanon-embassy-officers-kurds-turkey-women-8b7271fb54898a2b0cdc52f9b931f9a7	2024-12-28T10:24:11-08:00	
Belarus' strongman leader pardons 20 more prisoners, but rights groups say repression continues	TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — Belarus’ authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko pardoned 20 more people that rights activists describe as political prisoners, a statement on the president's website said Saturday. The announcement came amid persistent oppression in the run-up to presidential elections next month that are likely to extend Lukashenko's decades-long rule. Belarusian officials did not provide the names of those released, but the statement posted on the website of the president said that all of them had been convicted of 'crimes of an extremist nature.' The statement said the group included 11 women and 14 of those pardoned suffered from chronic illnesses. 'All of those released repented for their actions and appealed to the head of state to be pardoned,' the presidential administration said in a statement, using wording familiar from a series of previous group pardons in the past six months. Saturday’s announcement marks the eighth such pardon by Lukashenko since the summer of 2024. In all, 207 political prisoners have been freed, according to Belarus’ oldest and most established human rights group, Viasna. Most were jailed following mass anti-government protests in 2020, when Lukashenko secured his sixth term in a vote widely condemned as fraudulent. According to Viasna, over 1,250 political prisoners remain behind bars. No prominent opposition figures, many of whom have not been heard from for months on end, have been released. They include Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Viasna founder Ales Bialiatski; Siarhei Tsikhanouski, who planned to challenge Lukashenko at the ballot box in 2020 but was jailed before the vote; and Viktar Babaryka, who was also imprisoned after gaining popularity before the election. The mass pardons come amid a new wave of repression, said Viasna activist Pavel Sapelka, as Minsk prepares to hold new presidential elections in January 2025 that are likely to hand Lukashenko a seventh term in office. 'Lukashenko is sending contradictory signals (to the West), pardoning some but jailing twice as many political prisoners in their place,' Sapelka said. 'Repression is intensifying and authorities are trying to root out any signs of dissent before the January elections.' Belarusian authorities engineer harsh conditions for political prisoners, denying them meetings with lawyers and relatives, and depriving them of medical care. At least seven political prisoners have died behind bars since 2020, according to Viasna. Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus with an iron fist for more than 30 years, is one of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s closest allies, allowing Russia to use his country’s territory to send troops into Ukraine in February 2022 and to deploy some of its tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus.	https://apnews.com/article/belarus-crackdown-pardon-repression-prison-lukashenko-prisoners-7e4f84408c7cdd18f33c9b5f092c5403	2024-12-28T09:37:32-08:00	
Sweden embarks on a sober search for more cemetery space in case of war	GOTHENBURG, Sweden (AP) — Burial associations in Sweden are looking to acquire enough land for something they hope they'll never have to do: bury thousands of people in the event of war. The search follows recommendations from the Church of Sweden’s national secretariat, which reflect crisis preparedness guidelines from the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB) and the Swedish Armed Forces. The preparedness guidelines have been put in a new light by Sweden's decision to join NATO and tensions with Russia in the Baltic Sea region. According to the Church of Sweden provisions, supported by legal paragraphs in Sweden’s Burial Act, burial associations are responsible for ensuring the availability of enough land to bury roughly 5 percent of the population within a parish, if needed. The Goteborg Burial Association, which operates in Sweden’s second-largest city, is currently trying to navigate the challenge of acquiring at least 10 acres (40,470 square meters) of land to ensure it can handle urgent casket burials for some 30,000 dead in case of war. That is in addition to another 15 acres (60,700 square meters) of land needed for building graveyards for regular use in Goteborg. 'The (recommendations) mean that we need more land for burial grounds and this is a phenomenon in the big cities, and a problem in the big cities, where land resources are scarce to begin with and not always sufficient to meet burial ground needs even in times of calm and peace,' said Katarina Evenseth, senior advisor at the Goteborg Burial Association. Together with the local municipality, which has a monopoly in making decisions about land usage in Goteborg, the burial association has identified a vast area appropriate for building a large-scale cemetery for the intended purpose. But a lengthy approval and building process means it could take approximately 10 years to complete, posing further challenges in uncertain times. Meanwhile, the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB) continues to stress the importance of crisis preparedness and highlights the efforts of the Church of Sweden. 'Already back in 2015 the Government assigned various authorities to once again start engaging in civil defense planning, and many organizations have started planning, with the Church of Sweden being at the forefront of that planning,' said Jan-Olof Olsson, Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) expert at MSB. 'Unfortunately it is the case that we are reminded to a greater degree that war could happen and that we simply need to be prepared for that,' Olsson said. Sweden pursued a policy of neutrality from the early 19th Century, including during World War II. But public opinion shifted sharply in 2022 after Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, leading to Sweden and Finland applying to join the transatlantic alliance out of concern about the threat from their newly aggressive Russian neighbor across the Baltic Sea. Sweden and Finland sent out updated civil preparedness guides in November with instructions on how to survive in war. The guides are similar to those in Denmark and Norway, though they don't mention Russia by name.	https://apnews.com/article/sweden-cemetery-space-russia-ukraine-war-c360d18b81adba2e2b8bb2c8aae66409	2024-12-28T06:11:23-08:00	
Drought, fires and deforestation battered Amazon rainforest in 2024	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — 2024 was a brutal year for the Amazon rainforest, with rampant wildfires and extreme drought ravaging large parts of a biome that’s a critical counterweight to climate change. A warming climate fed drought that in turn fed the worst year for fires since 2005. And those fires contributed to deforestation, with authorities suspecting some fires were set to more easily clear land to run cattle. The Amazon is twice the size of India and sprawls across eight countries and one territory, storing vast amounts of carbon dioxide that would otherwise warm the planet. It has about 20% of the world’s fresh water and astounding biodiversity, including 16,000 known tree species. But governments have historically viewed it as an area to be exploited, with little regard for sustainability or the rights of its Indigenous peoples, and experts say exploitation by individuals and organized crime is rising at alarming rates. 'The fires and drought experienced in 2024 across the Amazon rainforest could be ominous indicators that we are reaching the long-feared ecological tipping point,' said Andrew Miller, advocacy director at Amazon Watch, an organization that works to protect the rainforest. 'Humanity’s window of opportunity to reverse this trend is shrinking, but still open.' There were some bright spots. The level of Amazonian forest loss fell in both Brazil and Colombia. And nations gathered for the annual United Nations conference on biodiversity agreed to give Indigenous peoples more say in nature conservation decisions. 'If the Amazon rainforest is to avoid the tipping point, Indigenous people will have been a determinant factor,' Miller said. Wildfires and extreme drought Forest loss in Brazil’s Amazon — home to the largest swath of this rainforest — dropped 30.6% compared to the previous year, the lowest level of destruction in nine years. The improvement under leftist President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva contrasted with deforestation that hit a 15-year high under Lula's predecessor, far-right leader Jair Bolsonaro, who prioritized agribusiness expansion over forest protection and weakened environmental agencies. In July, Colombia reported historic lows in deforestation in 2023, driven by a drop in environmental destruction. The country's environment minister Susana Muhamad warned that 2024's figures may not be as promising as a significant rise in deforestation had already been recorded by July due to dry weather caused by El Nino, a weather phenomenon that warms the central Pacific. Illegal economies continue to drive deforestation in the Andean nation. 'It’s impossible to overlook the threat posed by organized crime and the economies they control to Amazon conservation,' said Bram Ebus, a consultant for Crisis Group in Latin America. 'Illegal gold mining is expanding rapidly, driven by soaring global prices, and the revenues of illicit economies often surpass state budgets allocated to combat them.' In Brazil, large swaths of the rainforest were draped in smoke in August from fires raging across the Amazon, Cerrado savannah, Pantanal wetland and the state of Sao Paulo. Fires are traditionally used for deforestation and for managing pastures, and those man-made blazes were largely responsible for igniting the wildfires. For a second year, the Amazon River fell to desperate lows, leading some countries to declare a state of emergency and distribute food and water to struggling residents. The situation was most critical in Brazil, where one of the Amazon River's main tributaries dropped to its lowest level ever recorded. Cesar Ipenza, an environmental lawyer who lives in the heart of the Peruvian Amazon, said he believes people are becoming increasingly aware of the Amazon's fundamental role 'for the survival of society as a whole.' But, like Miller, he worries about a 'point of no return of Amazon destruction.' It was the worst year for Amazon fires since 2005, according to nonprofit Rainforest Foundation US. Between January and October, an area larger than the state of Iowa — 37.42 million acres, or about 15.1 million hectares of Brazil’s Amazon — burned. Bolivia had a record number of fires in the first ten months of the year. 'Forest fires have become a constant, especially in the summer months and require particular attention from the authorities who don't how to deal with or respond to them,' Ipenza said. Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, and Guyana also saw a surge in fires this year. Indigenous voices and rights made headway in 2024 The United Nations conference on biodiversity — this year known as COP16 — was hosted by Colombia. The meetings put the Amazon in the spotlight and a historic agreement was made to give Indigenous groups more of a voice on nature conservation decisions, a development that builds on a growing movement to recognize Indigenous people's role in protecting land and combating climate change. Both Ebus and Miller saw promise in the appointment of Martin von Hildebrand as the new secretary general for the Amazon Treaty Cooperation Organization, announced during COP16. 'As an expert on Amazon communities, he will need to align governments for joint conservation efforts. If the political will is there, international backers will step forward to finance new strategies to protect the world’s largest tropical rainforest,' Ebus said. Ebus said Amazon countries need to cooperate more, whether in law enforcement, deploying joint emergency teams to combat forest fires, or providing health care in remote Amazon borderlands. But they need help from the wider world, he said. 'The well-being of the Amazon is a shared global responsibility, as consumer demand worldwide fuels the trade in commodities that finance violence and environmental destruction,' he said. Next year marks a critical moment for the Amazon, as Belém do Pará in northern Brazil hosts the first United Nations COP in the region that will focus on climate.

Italy's far-right government wins final approval for its 30-billion-euro budget	ROME (AP) — Italy’s parliament on Saturday approved the government’s 2025 budget, worth a total of 30 billion euros ($31 billion) — more than half of that in tax cuts and social security benefits for low-income citizens. The measures, pushed by the far-right cabinet headed by Premier Giorgia Meloni, won final approval in the Upper House by 108 votes to 63. The country’s center-left opposition had harshly criticized the economic package, saying it didn’t meet the premier’s pledges to slash taxes for most Italians and boost employment. Meloni has staunchly defended the budget, stressing its 'wide balance' and its aim to support low and medium-income earners and families with children, while adding resources for the country’s struggling health system. 'We used the limited resources available to strengthen the main measures approved during the past years, making them structural and widening them to include a larger audience,' the premier said after the budget’s final approval. The package includes a 1,000-euro bonus for the parents of newborns, with wealthier families excluded, as part of efforts to reverse Italy’s declining birth rate. Banks, which have enjoyed high profits in recent years thanks to falling interest rates, will be asked to contribute 3.5 billion euros to the budget, which will to go the national health system. Italy is under pressure from the European Union to slash its deficit after huge spikes in 2022 and 2023, and has pledged to bring it below the EU’s 3% of GDP ceiling in 2026.	https://apnews.com/article/italy-government-meloni-budget-tax-cuts-c2c986cc536c45beb64bce5dcadc8968	2024-12-28T04:28:59-08:00	
Putin apologizes to Azerbaijani leader for 'tragic incident' involving crashed plane	MOSCOW (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday apologized to his Azerbaijani counterpart for what he called a 'tragic incident' following the crash of an Azerbaijani airliner in Kazakhstan that killed 38 people. The Kremlin said in a statement that air defense systems were firing near Grozny, the regional capital of the Russian republic of Chechnya, due to a Ukrainian drone strike as the plane attempted to land on Wednesday. It stopped short of saying the plane was shot down by Russian air defenses. According to a Kremlin readout of the call, Putin apologized to Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev 'for the fact that the tragic incident occurred in Russian airspace.' The plane was flying from Azerbaijan’s capital of Baku to Grozny, when it turned toward Kazakhstan and crashed while making an attempt to land. There were 29 survivors. On Friday, a U.S. official and an Azerbaijani minister made separate statements blaming the crash on an external weapon. Friday’s assessments by Rashan Nabiyev and White House national security spokesman John Kirby echoed those made by outside aviation experts who blamed the crash on Russian air defense systems responding to a Ukrainian attack. Neither Kirby or the Azerbaijani minister directly addressed the statements blaming air defenses. Kirby told reporters on Friday that the U.S. 'have seen some early indications that would certainly point to the possibility that this jet was brought down by Russian air defense systems,' but refused to elaborate, citing an ongoing investigation. Nabiyev, Azerbaijan’s minister of digital development and transportation, told Azerbaijani media that 'preliminary conclusions by experts point at external impact,' as does witness testimony. Passengers and crew who survived the crash told Azerbaijani media that they heard loud noises on the aircraft as it was circling over Grozny. Dmitry Yadrov, head of Russia’s civil aviation authority Rosaviatsia, said Friday that as the plane was preparing to land in Grozny in deep fog, Ukrainian drones were targeting the city, prompting authorities to close the area to air traffic. Yadrov said that after the captain made two unsuccessful attempts to land, he was offered other airports but decided to fly to Aktau in Kazakhstan, across the Caspian Sea. He didn’t comment on statements from some aviation experts, who pointed out that holes seen in the plane’s tail section suggested that it could have come under fire from Russian air defense systems. Earlier this week, Rosaviatsia cited unspecified early evidence as showing that the pilots diverted to Aktau after a bird strike led to an emergency on board. In the days following the crash, Azerbaijan Airlines blamed 'physical and technical interference' and announced the suspension of flights to several Russian airports. It didn’t say where the interference came from or provide any further details.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-putin-plane-crash-azerbaijan-a5b0ffa3e410df53556b0cd824f32a6f	2024-12-28T04:09:49-08:00	
Thick fog disrupts some flights on one of the UK's busiest weekends for travel	LONDON (AP) — Travelers flying to or from the U.K. faced further disruptions Saturday as thick fog and low visibility restricted air traffic on one of the year's busiest weekends. Gatwick Airport in London warned that some flights may be delayed throughout Saturday and apologized for the inconvenience. Flights were delayed by up to three hours late Friday because of poor weather conditions, and at least 40 flights from the airport, mostly short-haul to Europe, were delayed Saturday morning. Heathrow Airport, one of Europe's busiest, advised passengers to check with their airlines regarding potential delays. Disruptions were also reported at other U.K. airports including Stansted Airport in London and Manchester Airport. The U.K.'s weather forecasters, the Met Office, said thick fog patches could reduce visibility to just 100 meters (328 feet) in some areas across the country. It said travelers should allow 'a little bit longer' for journeys and warned drivers to be extra careful. Kiera Quayle and her husband, who were visiting family for Christmas on the Isle of Man, were among many affected. Their return flight to London was delayed by hours and then canceled late Friday. 'It’s frustrating and stressful but I overheard a few families who are now missing holidays and work who have it worse at this point,' she said. Conditions are expected to improve Sunday, the Met Office said. The country's main air traffic control organization said the restrictions would remain in place in areas with low visibility. 'Restrictions of this sort are only ever applied to maintain safety,' it said. 'Our teams are working closely with the airports and airlines to minimize disruption.' The restrictions came at a busy time of year when many people travel following the Christmas holiday and ahead of the New Year.	https://apnews.com/article/uk-airports-fog-flights-delay-ca6b97bff33f22e6b39a162771cc7a1b	2024-12-28T03:39:19-08:00	
Afghan forces target Pakistan in retaliation for deadly airstrikes that killed dozens	Afghanistan's Defense Ministry said Saturday that its forces hit several points inside Pakistan in retaliation for deadly airstrikes last week. Pakistan last Tuesday launched an operation to destroy a training facility and kill insurgents in Afghanistan’s eastern Paktika province. The strikes killed dozens of people, mostly women and children. Comments from the Taliban Defense Ministry on Saturday, posted on X, said its forces targeted Pakistani points that 'served as centers and hideouts for malicious elements and their supporters who organized and coordinated attacks in Afghanistan.' The ministry did not say if there were any casualties or how the strikes were carried out. Pakistani officials have accused the Taliban of not doing enough to combat cross-border militant activity, a charge the Taliban government denies, saying it does not allow anyone to carry out attacks against any country from its soil. No one from Pakistan's Foreign Ministry was immediately available for comment about the retaliation.	https://apnews.com/article/afghanistan-pakistan-border-strikes-7dbd4af5dce9c2e9016d429253467312	2024-12-28T01:58:56-08:00	
Israel detains director of one of last functioning hospitals in northern Gaza, Palestinians say	DEIR AL BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israel's army detained the director of one of the last functioning hospitals in northern Gaza as overnight strikes in the enclave killed nine people including children, Palestinian medical officials said, while sirens rang out across Israel. Gaza's Health Ministry said Saturday that Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, director of Kamal Adwan Hospital, was arrested by Israeli forces. The announcement comes a day after Israeli troops stormed the hospital, forcing many staff and patients outside to strip in winter weather, according to the ministry. Israel’s army didn’t respond to questions about Dr. Abu Safiya. On Friday, it denied claims it had entered or set fire to the complex and said it was conducting operations against Hamas infrastructure and militants in the area and had ordered people out of the hospital. It repeated claims that Hamas militants operate inside Kamal Adwan Hospital but provided no evidence. Hospital officials have denied that. Kamal Adwan Hospital has been hit multiple times over the past three months by Israeli troops waging an offensive against Hamas fighters in surrounding neighborhoods. The ministry said a strike on the hospital earlier this week killed five medical personnel. Israel’s nearly 15-month-old campaign of bombardment and offensives has devastated Gaza’s health sector. The war has killed more than 45,400 Palestinians, more than half women and children, and wounded more than 108,000 others, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Its count does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. Dr. Abu Safiya was detained Friday along with dozens of other staff from the hospital and taken to an interrogation center, the ministry said. On Friday, MedGlobal, the humanitarian organization where Dr. Abu Safiya worked, said he was a lead physician for the group and was gravely concerned about him. The group said the incident follows the October detention of five other of its staff, calling it an 'alarming and egregious pattern of targeting medical personnel and spaces.' Since October, Israel’s offensive has virtually sealed off the northern Gaza areas of Jabaliya, Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya and leveled large parts of them. Tens of thousands of Palestinians were forced out but thousands are believed to remain in the area where Kamal Adwan and two other hospitals are located. Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas after the militants' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel in which they killed around 1,200 people and abducted some 250 others. Around 100 Israelis remain captive in Gaza, around a third believed to be dead. On Saturday, Israel continued attacks across Gaza. An overnight strike killed at least nine people in Maghazi, including women and children, according to an Associated Press reporter who saw the bodies and staff at Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital where they were taken. Israel said its troops had also begun operating in the northern city of Beit Hanoun, following intelligence that fighters and Hamas infrastructure were in the area. Strikes also continued into Israel. Early Saturday morning, air raid sirens once again awoke Israelis and the military said it intercepted a missile fired by Yemen's Houthi rebels. Israeli warplanes bombed key infrastructure in Yemen again on Thursday. The Iran-backed Houthi rebels have also been attacking shipping in the Red Sea and say they won't stop until Israel agrees to a ceasefire in Gaza. ___ Mednick reported from Jerusalem. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-12-28-2024-57e00c5b1e72503e02a9cfd8d8ab64f8	2024-12-28T01:53:05-08:00	
Former Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who instituted economic reforms, cremated in New Delhi	NEW DELHI (AP) — Manmohan Singh, the former Indian prime minister widely regarded as the architect of the country’s economic reform program, was cremated after a state funeral on Saturday as politicians and the public mourned his death. The veteran leader, who was also credited for a landmark nuclear deal with the United States, died late Thursday at age 92. Singh’s body was taken Saturday morning to the headquarters of his Congress party in New Delhi, where party leaders and activists paid tributes to him and chanted 'Manmohan Singh lives forever.' Abhishek Bishnoi, a party leader, said Singh's death was big loss for the country. 'He used to speak little, but his talent and his actions spoke louder than his words,' he said. Later, Singh’s body was transported to a crematorium ground for his last rites as soldiers beat drums. Government officials, politicians and family members paid their last respects to Singh, whose casket was adorned with flowers and wrapped in the Indian flag. Security personnel honored him with a ceremonial gun salute. Indian President Draupadi Murmu and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who called Singh one of the country's 'most distinguished leaders,' and several Cabinet ministers participated in the funeral ceremony. Singh’s body was then transferred to a pyre as religious hymns played and cremated. Authorities declared a seven-day mourning period and canceled all cultural and entertainment events during that time. Government buildings across India are flying the national flag at half-staff. A mild-mannered technocrat, Singh was prime minister for 10 years and leader of the Congress party in Parliament’s upper house, earning a reputation as a man of great personal integrity. He was chosen to be prime minister in 2004 by Sonia Gandhi, the widow of assassinated Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. Singh was reelected in 2009, but his second term was clouded by financial scandals and corruption charges over the organization of the 2010 Commonwealth Games. This led to the Congress party’s crushing defeat in 2014 national elections by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party under the leadership of Narendra Modi. Singh adopted a low profile after relinquishing the post of prime minister. As finance minister, Singh in 1991 instituted reforms that moved India away from a socialist-patterned economy and toward a capitalist model in the face of a huge balance of payments deficit, skirting a potential economic crisis. Singh was the first Sikh to hold the country’s top post and made a public apology in Parliament for the 1984 Sikh Massacre in which some 3,000 Sikhs were killed after then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguards. In a move hailed as one of his biggest achievements apart from economic reforms, Singh ended India’s nuclear isolation by signing a deal with the U.S. that gave India access to American nuclear technology. But the deal hurt his coalition government, with Communist allies withdrawing their support and criticism of the agreement growing within India in 2008 when it was finalized.	https://apnews.com/article/india-manmohan-singh-prime-minister-funeral-1436674a166d7a26d13002d301e019f6	2024-12-27T21:48:46-08:00	
South African retrospective exhibition honors the colorful work of artist Esther Mahlangu	JOHANNESBURG (AP) — A boldly patterned BMW stands at the entrance of the Wits Arts Museum in the vibrant Johannesburg neighborhood of Braamfontein. Its bright geometric shapes are part of 89-year-old South African artist Esther Mahlangu ’s unmistakable style. The car is the centerpiece of an exhibition honoring her and her work. The BMW, commissioned by the German manufacturer in 1991, is among Mahlangu’s most well-known works and has been returned to South Africa this year after more than 30 years abroad. Exhibition curator Nontobeko Ntombela also has included pieces that document the struggles of Nelson Mandela, who was released after almost three decades in prison and became South Africa's first Black president when the country transitioned from white minority rule to democracy in 1994. These include a letter Mahlangu wrote to Mandela thanking him for the sacrifices he made for the country. She is respected for persevering with art at a time when Black artists, especially women, were hardly acknowledged. 'Mahlangu dared to travel an uncharted path during a time when Black women artists were systemically overlooked. I hope when people see just how much she has done, they will realize the magnitude of what she has offered to the arts,' Ntombela said. The retrospective also includes a documentary about the artist, where she tells the story of her rural upbringing and her Ndebele culture. For decades, Mahlangu has used her talent to promote that culture, becoming arguably the southern African ethnic group's most recognized representative. Ntombela said much of the publicly available information about Mahlangu tends to repeat the same narratives, including her first international show in Paris in 1989. 'Some tend to overly emphasize the culture without the balance of discussing her work as an art form. The exhibition tries to complicate this and hopefully offers an opportunity of how her art moves across these different fields and disciplines,' the curator said. Some of the artworks showing umgwalo, or traditional Ndebele painting, were borrowed from collections locally and abroad. Ntombela said it took about two years to secure them. 'Numerous works are under the ownership of international collectors, so we needed a lot of funds to bring a lot of her work back to South Africa,' she said. Mahlangu is a recipient of one of South Africa's highest national awards, the Order of Ikhamanga in silver, which is awarded by the head of state. She briefly attended the launch of the exhibition last month but lives quietly in Mpumalanga province, where her colorfully decorated home remains an attraction for local and international tourists. The exhibition will run until April 17 before it embarks on an international tour starting in the United States in early 2026.	https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-art-exhibition-esther-mahlangu-be15dbfafa39ea6b58743845b436e0b2	2024-12-27T20:03:16-08:00	
Bloodied Ukrainian troops risk losing more hard-won land in Kursk to Russia	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Five months after their shock offensive into Russia, Ukrainian troops are bloodied and demoralized by the rising risk of defeat in Kursk, a region some want to hold at all costs while others question the value of having gone in at all. Battles are so intense that some Ukrainian commanders can’t evacuate the dead. Communication lags and poorly timed tactics have cost lives, and troops have little way to counterattack, seven front-line soldiers and commanders told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity so they could discuss sensitive operations. Since being caught unaware by the lightning Ukrainian incursion, Russia has amassed more than 50,000 troops in the region, including some from its ally North Korea. Precise numbers are hard to obtain, but Moscow’s counterattack has killed and wounded thousands and the overstretched Ukrainians have lost more then 40% of the 984 square kilometers (380 square miles) of Kursk they seized in August. Its full-scale invasion three years ago left Russia holding a fifth of Ukraine, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has hinted that he hopes controlling Kursk will help force Moscow to negotiate an end to the war. But five Ukrainian and Western officials in Kyiv who spoke on condition of anonymity to freely discuss sensitive military matters said they fear gambling on Kursk will weaken the whole 1000-kilometer (621-mile) front line, and Ukraine is losing precious ground in the east. 'We have, as they say, hit a hornet’s nest. We have stirred up another hot spot,' said Stepan Lutsiv, a major in the 95th Airborne Assault Brigade. The border raid that became an occupation Army chief Oleksandr Syrskyi has said that Ukraine launched the operation because officials thought Russia was about to launch a new attack on northeast Ukraine. It began on Aug. 5 with an order to leave Ukraine’s Sumy region for what they thought would be a nine-day raid to stun the enemy. It became an occupation that Ukrainians welcomed as their smaller country gained leverage and embarrassed Russian President Vladimir Putin. Gathering his men, one company commander told them: 'We’re making history; the whole world will know about us because this hasn’t been done since World War II. Privately, he was less certain. 'It seemed crazy,' he said. 'I didn’t understand why.' Shocked by success achieved largely because the Russians were caught by surprise, the Ukrainians were ordered to advance beyond the original mission to the town of Korenevo, 25 kilometers (16 miles) into Russia. That was one of the first places where Russian troops counterattacked. By early November the Russians began regaining territory rapidly. Once in awe of what they accomplished, troops’ opinions are shifting as they come to terms with losses. The company commander said half of his troops are dead or wounded. Some front-line commanders said conditions are tough, morale is low and troops are questioning command decisions, even the very purpose of occupying Kursk. Another commander said that some orders his men have received don’t reflect reality because of delays in communication. Delays occur especially when territory is lost to Russian troops, he said. 'They don’t understand where our side is, where the enemy is, what’s under our control, and what isn’t,' he said. 'They don’t understand the operational situation, we so act at our own discretion.' One platoon commander said higher ups have repeatedly turned down his requests to change his unit’s defensive position because he knows his men can't hold the line. 'Those people who stand until the end are ending up MIA,' he said. He said he also knows of at least 20 Ukrainian soldiers whose bodies had been abandoned over the last four months because the battles were too intense to evacuate them without more casualties. No option to retreat as Russia doubles down Ukrainian soldiers said they were not prepared for the aggressive Russian response in Kursk, and cannot counterattack or pull back. 'There’s no other option. We’ll fight here because if we just pull back to our borders, they won’t stop; they’ll keep advancing,' said one drone unit commander. The AP requested comment from Ukraine's General Staff but did not receive a response before publication. American longer-range weapons have slowed the Russian advance and North Korean soldiers who joined the fighting last month are easy targets for drones and artillery because they lack combat discipline and often move in large groups in the open, Ukrainian troops said. On Monday, Zelenskyy said 3,000 North Korean soldiers had been killed and wounded. But they appear to be learning from their mistakes, soldiers added, by becoming more adept at camouflaging near forested lines. One clash took place last week near Vorontsovo tract, a forested area between the settlements of Kremenne and Vorontsovo. Until last week, the area was under Ukraine's control. This week part of it has been lost to Russian forces and Ukrainian troops fear they will reach a crucial logistics route. Eyeing frontline losses in the eastern region known as the Donbas — where Russia is closing on a crucial supply hub — some soldiers are more vocal about whether Kursk has been worth it. 'All the military can think about now is that Donbas has simply been sold,' the platoon commander said. 'At what price?'	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-kursk-d297a59fb9eb7db08bd742e1dd0aa753	2024-12-27T20:01:07-08:00	
8 people killed in a collision between a bus and a truck on Mexico's Gulf coast	MEXICO CITY (AP) — A collision between a bus and a truck on Mexico’s Gulf coast Friday left eight people dead and 27 others injured. Prosecutors in Veracruz state said the accident happened before dawn on a stretch of highway near the state capital, Xalapa. Most of the victims were apparently passengers aboard the ADO-line bus. The dead included three men, four women and a girl. The 27 injured were being treated at local hospitals, but there was no immediate information on their condition. The cause of the accident was unclear, but some roads in the mountainous area are known for their pronounced curves.	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-bus-truck-crash-8-killed-4d3d847421585eeaca78256c560e727c	2024-12-27T15:42:33-08:00	
Israeli airstrikes hit a Yemen airport as a jet with hundreds onboard was landing, UN official says	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Israeli airstrikes hit Yemen’s main airport as a civilian Airbus 320 with hundreds of passengers on board was landing and a U.N. delegation was waiting to leave, the U.N.'s top humanitarian official in Yemen said Friday. Julien Harneis told U.N. reporters that the most frightening thing about the two airstrikes on Thursday wasn’t their effect on him and about 15 others in the VIP lounge at the international airport in Yemen's capital, Sanaa, including the head of the U.N. World Health Organization. Rather, it was the destruction of the airport control tower as a Yemenia Airways plane was taxiing in after touching down. 'Fortunately, that plane was able to land safely and the passengers were able to disembark, but it could have been far, far worse,' said Harneis, who was with WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus in the lounge. He said one airstrike landed approximately 300 meters (330 yards) south of the VIP lounge and another about 300 meters to the north around 4:45 p.m., while about five members of the U.N. team were outside the building. 'Not only obviously did we have zero indication of any potential airstrikes, but we cannot remember the last time there were airstrikes in Sanaa during daylight hours,' Harneis said in a video news conference from Sanaa. The U.N. said at least three people were killed and dozens injured in the strike. Among the injured was a crew member from the U.N. Humanitarian Air Service, which was about to fly the U.N. delegation of some 20 people out of Sanaa. He suffered a serious leg injury from shrapnel and lost a lot of blood, Harneis said. Immediately after the airstrikes, Harneis said, U.N. security officials moved the delegation out of the VIP building and into five armored cars where they waited for approximately 40 minutes to ascertain what happened and help the injured crew member. He was taken to a hospital in Sanaa and underwent four hours of surgery while the rest of the delegation spent the night in a U.N. compound, Harneis said. The U.N. plane with Tedros and the U.N. team, including the injured crew member, was able to depart for Jordan on Friday afternoon – without an operating control tower. The United Nations said the injured crew member was taken to a hospital in Jordan, and Tedros was heading back to Geneva, where WHO is based, Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels, who control Sanaa and much of the country’s north, have gone after Israel since it started attacking Gaza following the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks by Gaza's Hamas militants on southern Israel. The Houthis have attacked ships in the Red Sea, disrupting one of the world’s main maritime routes, and recently stepped up missile and drone attacks on Israel. Early Saturday, the Israeli Air Force reported intercepting yet another missile from Yemen, as sirens woke Israelis around Jerusalem and the Dead Sea. Israel has escalated its response. The Israeli army said it wasn’t aware that the WHO chief or U.N. delegation were at the Sanaa airport on Thursday. Israel said it bombed the airport because it is used by the Houthis and Iran. Harneis responded, stressing that the airport is civilian, not military, and is used for transporting U.N. and other humanitarian workers, and for one civilian flight — Yemenia to and from Amman, Jordan. The flight operates as a result of an international agreement, and thousands of Yemenis have used the flight to get advanced medical treatment abroad, he said. Yemen is the Arab world’s poorest nation and has been engulfed in a 10-year civil war between the Houthi rebels, who control Sanaa and much of the country's north, and the internationally recognized government forces in the south. Tedros was in the country to discuss its worsening humanitarian crisis and to seek the release of about 50 people detained by the Houthis since June from the U.N., nongovernmental organizations and civil society. Harneis said 18 million Yemenis — about half the country’s population — need humanitarian assistance this year, and the U.N. expects the number to increase to 19 million next year because of the worsening economy. In addition to airstrikes on the Sanaa airport, Israel has been attacking the country's key port of Hodeida, in western Yemen. Harneis said Yemen relies on imports through Hodeida for 80% of its food and more than 90% of its medical supplies to the north. A recent Israeli airstrike destroyed two tugboats and is estimated to have reduced the harbor's capacity by 50%, the U.N. official said, while damage from Thursday's airstrikes hasn't been assessed yet. As for the detainees, Harneis said he joined the WHO chief at meetings with the Houthi prime minister, foreign minister and a member of the group's Supreme Political Council. He said they received commitments on the detainees' possible release and a pathway to it, and on conditions under which they are being held.	https://apnews.com/article/un-yemen-airport-israel-airstrikes-who-humanitarian-17690daff9dbb47c6ef7ce77447c5fe0	2024-12-27T14:57:03-08:00	
Canadian Cabinet ministers meet with Trump's nominee for commerce secretary in bid to avoid tariffs	TORONTO (AP) — Two Canadian Cabinet ministers left a meeting at Mar-a-Lago on Friday without assurances President-elect Donald Trump will back away from threatened tariffs on all products from the major American trading partner. The Canadians called the talks 'productive' and said there would be further discussions but one official said the Americans remain fixated on the U.S. trade deficit with Canada. Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc and Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly met with Howard Lutnick, Trump’s nominee for commerce secretary, as well as North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Trump’s pick to lead the Interior Department. Trump has threatened to impose 25% tariffs on all Canadian products if Canada does not stem what he calls a flow of migrants and fentanyl into the United States — even though far fewer of each cross into the U.S. from Canada than from Mexico, which Trump has also threatened. 'Minister LeBlanc and Minister Joly had a positive, productive meeting at Mar-a-Lago with Howard Lutnick and Doug Burgum, as a follow-up to the dinner between the Prime Minister and President Trump last month,' said Jean-Sébastien Comeau, a spokesman for LeBlanc. Comeau said both ministers outlined the measures in Canada's billion-dollar plan to increase security at the border and reiterated 'the shared commitment to strengthen border security as well as combat the harm caused by fentanyl to save Canadian and American lives.' Comeau said Lutnick and Burgum agreed to relay the information to Trump. A senior Canadian official, however, said the Americans remain preoccupied on the U.S. trade deficit with Canada and want it to shrink. The official spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. Trump has made an issue of the U.S. trade deficit, erroneously calling it a subsidy. Canada’s ambassador to Washington, Kirsten Hillman, has said the U.S. had a $75 billion trade deficit with Canada last year. But she noted a third of what Canada sells into the U.S. are energy exports and said there is a deficit when oil prices are high. About 60% of U.S. crude oil imports and 85% of U.S. electricity imports are from Canada. Alberta alone sends 4.3 million barrel s of oil per day to the U.S which tends to consume about 20 million barrels a day. The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment. Further discussions are expected in the coming weeks. Joly will also have dinner with U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham on Friday. Trump has been trolling Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on social media in recent weeks by calling him the Governor of the 51st state. Trudeau has not directly responded, but did post a link Thursday to a six-minute video on YouTube from 2010 in which American NBC journalist Tom Brokaw 'explains Canada to Americans.' 'Some information about Canada for Americans' Trudeau wrote in the post on X. The video, which originally aired during the 2010 Vancouver Olympics, explains similarities between the two countries, the massive trading relationship and the actions of the Canadian military in World War 2 and Afghanistan. 'In our darkest hours Canada has been with us,' Brokaw says in the video. 'In the long history of sovereign neighbors there has never been a relationship as close, productive and peaceful as the U.S. and Canada.' Trudeau has told Trump that Americans would also suffer if the president-elect follows through on a plan to impose sweeping tariffs on Canadian products. Nearly $3.6 billion Canadian dollars ($2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border each day. Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states. Flows of migrants and seizures of drugs are vastly different at the U.S.’s two land borders. U.S. customs agents seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the Canadian border during the last fiscal year, compared with 21,100 pounds at the Mexican border. Most of the fentanyl reaching the U.S. — where it causes about 70,000 overdose deaths annually — is made by Mexican drug cartels using precursor chemicals smuggled from Asia. On immigration, the U.S. Border Patrol reported 1.53 million encounters with migrants at the southwest border with Mexico between October 2023 and September 2024. That compares to 23,721 encounters at the Canadian border during that time.	https://apnews.com/article/canada-us-trump-tariffs-3ad63bf258bb4880749a93e830482d74	2024-12-27T14:05:13-08:00	
Trump asks Supreme Court to delay TikTok ban so he can weigh in after he takes office	President-elect Donald Trump asked the Supreme Court on Friday to pause the potential TikTok ban from going into effect until his administration can pursue a 'political resolution' to the issue. The request came as TikTok and the Biden administration filed opposing briefs to the court, in which the company argued the court should strike down a law that could ban the platform by Jan. 19 while the government emphasized its position that the statute is needed to eliminate a national security risk. 'President Trump takes no position on the underlying merits of this dispute. Instead, he respectfully requests that the Court consider staying the Act’s deadline for divestment of January 19, 2025, while it considers the merits of this case,' said Trump’s amicus brief, which supported neither party in the case and was written by D. John Sauer, Trump’s choice for solicitor general. The argument submitted to the court is the latest example of Trump inserting himself in national issues before he takes office. The Republican president-elect has already begun negotiating with other countries over his plans to impose tariffs, and he intervened earlier this month in a plan to fund the federal government, calling for a bipartisan plan to be rejected and sending Republicans back to the negotiating table. He has been holding meetings with foreign leaders and business officials at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida while he assembles his administration, including a meeting last week with TikTok CEO Shou Chew. Trump has reversed his position on the popular app, having tried to ban it during his first term in office over national security concerns. He joined the TikTok during his 2024 presidential campaign and his team used it to connect with younger voters, especially male voters, by pushing content that was often macho and aimed at going viral. He said earlier this year that he still believed there were national security risks with TikTok, but that he opposed banning it. The filings Friday come ahead of oral arguments scheduled for Jan. 10 on whether the law, which requires TikTok to divest from its China-based parent company or face a ban, unlawfully restricts speech in violation of the First Amendment. The law was was signed by President Joe Biden in April after it passed Congress with broad bipartisan support. TikTok and ByteDance filed a legal challenge afterwards. Earlier this month, a panel of three federal judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit unanimously upheld the statute, leading TikTok to appeal the case to the Supreme Court. The brief from Trump said he opposes banning TikTok at this junction and 'seeks the ability to resolve the issues at hand through political means once he takes office.' In their brief to the Supreme Court on Friday, attorneys for TikTok and its parent company ByteDance argued the federal appeals court erred in its ruling and based its decision on 'alleged ‘risks’ that China could exercise control' over TikTok’s U.S. platform by pressuring its foreign affiliates. The Biden administration has argued in court that TikTok poses a national security risk due to its connections to China. Officials say Chinese authorities can compel ByteDance to hand over information on TikTok’s U.S. patrons or use the platform to spread or suppress information. But the government 'concedes that it has no evidence China has ever attempted to do so,' TikTok’s legal filing said, adding that the U.S. fears are predicated on future risks. In its filing Friday, the Biden administration said because TikTok 'is integrated with ByteDance and relies on its propriety engine developed and maintained in China,' its corporate structure carries with it risk.	https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-ban-supreme-court-trump-b96013a8447e9bdb5508ebe436aadf9a	2024-12-27T13:44:11-08:00	
US to send $1.25 billion in weapons to Ukraine, pushing to get aid out before Biden leaves office	WASHINGTON (AP) — The United States is expected to announce that it will send $1.25 billion in military assistance to Ukraine, U.S. officials said Friday, as the Biden administration pushes to get as much aid to Kyiv as possible before leaving office on Jan. 20. The large package of aid includes a significant amount of munitions, including for the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems and the HAWK air defense system. It also will provide Stinger missiles and 155 mm- and 105 mm artillery rounds, officials said. The officials, who said they expect the announcement to be made on Monday, spoke on condition of anonymity to provide details not yet made public. The new aid comes as Russia has launched a barrage of attacks against Ukraine’s power facilities in recent days, although Ukraine has said it intercepted a significant number of the missiles and drones. Russian and Ukrainian forces are also still in a bitter battle around the Russian border region of Kursk, where Moscow has sent thousands of North Korean troops to help reclaim territory taken by Ukraine. Earlier this month, senior defense officials acknowledged that that the Defense Department may not be able to send all of the remaining $5.6 billion in Pentagon weapons and equipment stocks passed by Congress for Ukraine before President-elect Donald Trump is sworn in. Trump has talked about getting some type of negotiated settlement between Ukraine and Russia, and spoken about his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Many U.S. and European leaders are concerned that it might result in a poor deal for Ukraine and they worry that he won't provide Ukraine with all the weapons funding approved by Congress. The aid in the new package is in presidential drawdown authority, which allows the Pentagon to take weapons off the shelves and send them quickly to Ukraine. This latest assistance would reduce the remaining amount to about $4.35 billion. Officials have said they hope that an influx of aid will help strengthen Ukraine’s hand, should Zelenskyy decide it’s time to negotiate. One senior defense official said that while the U.S. will continue to provide weapons to Ukraine until Jan. 20, there may well be funds remaining that will be available for the incoming Trump administration to spend. According to the Pentagon, there is also about $1.2 billion remaining in longer-term funding through the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which is used to pay for weapons contracts that would not be delivered for a year or more. Officials have said the administration anticipates releasing all of that money before the end of the calendar year. If the new package is included, the U.S. has provided more than $64 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since Russia invaded in February 2022.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-military-aid-kyiv-biden-9b926a275c235c59d591a649e2450746	2024-12-27T10:42:45-08:00	
US sanctions the founder of Georgia's ruling political party	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration has imposed sanctions on the founder of Georgia’s ruling political party, which has steered the country away from a pro-Western stance and towards Russia, U.S. officials said Friday. The State and Treasury departments said they hit Georgian Dream party founder and honorary chairman Bidzina Ivanishvili with penalties 'for undermining the democratic and Euro-Atlantic future of Georgia for the benefit of the Russian Federation,' according to a statement. The designation of Ivanishvili is the latest in a series of sanctions the U.S. has slapped on Georgian politicians, lawmakers and others this year. Those sanctions include freezes on assets and properties those targeted may have in U.S. jurisdictions or that might enter U.S. jurisdictions as well as travel bans on the targets and members of their families. 'We strongly condemn Georgian Dream’s actions under Ivanishvili’s leadership, including its ongoing and violent repression of Georgian citizens, protestors, members of the media, human rights activists, and opposition figures,' the State Department said in a statement. 'The United States is committed to promoting accountability for those undermining democracy and human rights in Georgia.' Ivanishvili is a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia and served briefly as Georgia’s prime minister. In 2012, he founded Georgian Dream, Georgia’s longtime ruling party. Critics have accused Georgian Dream of becoming increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow. The party recently pushed through laws similar to those used by the Kremlin to crack down on freedom of speech and LGBTQ+ rights, prompting the European Union to suspend Georgia’s membership application process indefinitely. In October, Georgian Dream won another term in a divisive parliamentary election that has led to more mass protests. Last month, the country’s prime minister, Irakli Kobakhidze, announced a four-year suspension of talks on Georgia's bid to join the European Union, fueling further public outrage.	https://apnews.com/article/georgia-dream-sanction-bidzina-ivanishvili-russia-d22fe108cdef72b221769a113d980c45	2024-12-27T10:12:33-08:00	
A 9th telecoms firm has been hit by a massive Chinese espionage campaign, the White House says	WASHINGTON (AP) — A ninth U.S. telecoms firm has been confirmed to have been hacked as part of a sprawling Chinese espionage campaign that gave officials in Beijing access to private texts and phone conversations of an unknown number of Americans, a top White House official said Friday. Biden administration officials said this month that at least eight telecommunications companies, as well as dozens of nations, had been affected by the Chinese hacking blitz known as Salt Typhoon. But Anne Neuberger, the deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technologies, told reporters Friday that a ninth victim had been identified after the administration released guidance to companies about how to hunt for Chinese culprits in their networks. The update from Neuberger is the latest development in a massive hacking operation that has alarmed national security officials, exposed cybersecurity vulnerabilities in the private sector and laid bare China's hacking sophistication. The hackers compromised the networks of telecommunications companies to obtain customer call records and gain access to the private communications of 'a limited number of individuals.' Though the FBI has not publicly identified any of the victims, officials believe senior U.S. government officials and prominent political figures are among those whose whose communications were accessed. Neuberger said officials did not yet have a precise sense how many Americans overall were affected by Salt Typhoon, in part because the Chinese were careful about their techniques, but a 'large number' were in the Washington-Virginia area. Officials believe the goal of the hackers was to identify who owned the phones and, if they were 'government targets of interest,' spy on their texts and phone calls, she said. The FBI said most of the people targeted by the hackers are 'primarily involved in government or political activity.' Neuberger said the episode highlighted the need for required cybersecurity practices in the telecommunications industry, something the Federal Communications Commission is to take up at a meeting next month. 'We know that voluntary cyber security practices are inadequate to protect against China, Russia and Iran hacking of our critical infrastructure,' she said. The Chinese government has denied responsibility for the hacking.	https://apnews.com/article/united-states-china-hacking-espionage-c5351ef7c2207785b76c8c62cde6c513	2024-12-27T09:00:29-08:00	
US teacher jailed in Russia is formally designated as wrongfully detained	WASHINGTON (AP) — An American schoolteacher arrested in Russia on drug charges more than four years ago has been designated by the U.S. government as wrongfully detained, the State Department said Friday. Marc Fogel, a history teacher from Pennsylvania, is serving a 14-year prison sentence after being arrested in August 2021 at a Russian airport and possessing what his family and supporters said was medically prescribed marijuana. After Fogel was omitted from a massive prisoner swap last August that resulted in the release of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and corporate security executive Paul Whelan, among others, his family's lawyers made another push for the Biden administration to secure his freedom, including by designating him as wrongfully detained. The State Department considers a range of factors in deciding whether to designate an American jailed in a foreign country as wrongfully detained, including if there's credible information that the person is innocent. The factors also include if they are being held for the primary purpose of influencing U.S. policy or securing concessions from the U.S. government. Officials confirmed Friday that Fogel had now received that designation. 'The United States has been working to secure Marc Fogel’s release for some time. We have long called for his humanitarian release and tried to include him in the August 1 deal, but were unable to. The Secretary determined Marc is wrongfully detained in October,' the department said in a statement. The designation traditionally shifts supervision of a detainee's case to the office of the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs, a State Department office focused on negotiating for the release of hostages and other Americans classified as being wrongfully detained in other countries.	https://apnews.com/article/marc-fogel-russia-state-department-prisoner-swap-pennsylvania-putin-af3906fd2692d13ca168f507ef448fda	2024-12-27T08:16:44-08:00

Montenegro approves the extradition of cryptocurrency mogul Do Kwon to the United States	PODGORICA, Montenegro (AP) — Montenegro has approved the extradition of a South Korean mogul known as 'the cryptocurrency king' to the United States, the Balkan country's Justice Ministry said on Friday. Minister Bojan Bozovic has issued a deposition allowing the handover of Do Kwon, the founder of the Singapore crypto firm Terraform Labs who was arrested in Montenegro last year, according to the ministry. It was not immediately clear when exactly Kwon would be sent to the U.S. The move follows a months-long legal saga in the case of Do Kwon. Both South Korea and the U.S. had requested Do Kwon’s extradition and various courts in Montenegro over the past months have brought and overturned multiple rulings to extradite Kwon either to the U.S. or South Korea. The Justice Ministry statement cited the latest ruling of Montenegro's Supreme Court which said that conditions have been met for Kwon to be extradited to one of the two countries, and that the final decision lies with the justice minister. The ministry said on Friday that more legal criteria were in favor of extradition the U.S. Kwon’s lawyers in Montenegro said they learned about the decision from the media and that their client cannot be extradited until they receive the ruling. 'Behind such illegal behavior of the minister is the fact that the courts, on two occasions ... made a decision to extradite Do Kwon to South Korea,' lawyers Goran Rodić i Marija Radulović said in a statement. Kwon was charged in the U.S. with fraud by federal prosecutors in New York over a $40 billion crash of Terraform Labs’ cryptocurrency, which devastated retail investors around the world. He and another South Korean were arrested in Montenegro while trying to depart for Dubai, United Arab Emirates, using fake Costa Rican passports. Kwon has served a prison term in Montenegro for using a fake passport. Kwon and five others connected to Terraform had been wanted on allegations of fraud and financial crimes in relation to the implosion of its digital currencies in May 2022. TerraUSD was designed as a 'stablecoin,' a currency which is pegged to stable assets like the dollar to prevent drastic fluctuations in prices. However, around $40 billion in market value was erased for the holders of TerraUSD and its floating sister currency, Luna, after the stablecoin plunged far below its $1 peg.	https://apnews.com/article/montenegro-cryptocurrency-do-kwon-extradition-60abd631009d8474f8ee9e3afed9146f	2024-12-27T07:28:14-08:00	
NATO will step up Baltic Sea patrols as Finland probes the possible sabotage of undersea cables	BRUSSELS (AP) — NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said Friday that the military alliance will step up patrols in the Baltic Sea region as Finnish investigators work to establish whether a ship linked to Russia sabotaged undersea cables there this week. Finnish authorities seized control of the ship, the Eagle S, on Thursday as they tried to establish whether it had damaged a power cable linking Finland and Estonia and several data cables. It was the latest in a string of incidents involving the disruption of key infrastructure in the region. In a post on X, Rutte said that he had spoken to Finland’s President Alexander Stubb 'about the ongoing Finnish-led investigation into possible sabotage of undersea cables.' Rutte said that 'NATO will enhance its military presence in the Baltic Sea.' Asked for details about what might be done and when, NATO headquarters would say only that the 32-country alliance 'remains vigilant and is working to provide further support, including by enhancing our military presence' in the region. Finland, which shares a 1,340-kilometer (832-mile) border with Russia, joined NATO in 2023, abandoning a decades-old policy of neutrality. In October 2023, in response to similar incidents, NATO and its allies deployed more maritime patrol aircraft, long-distance radar planes and drones on surveillance and reconnaissance flights, while a fleet of minehunters was also dispatched to the region. The Eagle S is flagged in the Cook Islands but has been described by Finnish customs officials and European Union officials as being part of Russia’s shadow fleet of tankers shipping oil and gas in defiance of international sanctions imposed over its war on Ukraine. The aging vessels, often with obscure ownership, routinely operate without Western-regulated insurance. Russia’s use of the vessels has raised environmental concerns about accidents given their age and uncertain insurance coverage. The Eagle S’s anchor is suspected of causing damage to the cable, Finland’s Yle state broadcaster has reported, relying on police statements. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was asked about the seizure on Friday but declined to comment. After a high-level meeting about the incident, Stubb posted on X that 'the situation is under control. We have no reason to be worried,' while adding that the investigation continues. He said that Finland and Estonia had requested extra NATO help. He said new measures could include 'inspections of the insurance certificates of vessels' in the region. Stubb added that 'we are also looking at ways, based on international maritime law, to respond more effectively to similar incidents in the future.' The Estlink-2 power cable, which takes electricity from Finland to Estonia across the Baltic Sea, went down on Wednesday but had little impact on services. The incident follows damage to two data cables and the Nord Stream gas pipelines, both of which have been termed sabotage. Those data cables — one running between Finland and Germany and the other between Lithuania and Sweden — were severed in November. Germany’s defense minister said 'sabotage' was the likely cause but he didn’t provide evidence or say who might have been responsible. The Nord Stream pipelines that once brought natural gas from Russia to Germany were damaged by underwater explosions in September 2022. Authorities have said the cause was sabotage and launched criminal investigations. NATO had already boosted patrols near undersea infrastructure after the Nord Stream pipeline was hit. Last year, it also set up a coordination cell to deepen ties between governments, armed forces, and the defense industry and better protect undersea installations.	https://apnews.com/article/finland-estonia-cable-undersea-russia-sabotage-nato-6460b68ab5236d9892551867b024b0a0	2024-12-27T07:23:07-08:00	
Customs agents seize 22,000 fake Pennsylvania vehicle inspection stickers shipped from Israel	HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — The U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency said it has seized more than 20,000 counterfeit Pennsylvania vehicle inspection stickers that were shipped from Israel to an address in Philadelphia. Customs officers found the stickers in two different shipments that arrived on two different days, Nov. 26 and Dec. 9, and confirmed with Pennsylvania authorities that the stickers were counterfeit, the agency said. The agency did not say in a Thursday statement who sent the stickers, who was to receive them or what purpose the stickers were going to serve. The agency said it made no arrests. Had they been real, the 22,000 stickers would have a value of $1.4 million, the agency said. Selling fake vehicle inspection stickers is illegal and a persistent problem for law enforcement, although at a much smaller scale. Pennsylvania requires that motor vehicles be inspected annually to ensure they meet minimum mechanical, safety and emissions standards. Punishment for using a counterfeit inspection sticker can mean a penalty of up to $500 and jail time, the agency said.	https://apnews.com/article/customs-border-protection-counterfeit-pennsylvania-inspection-stickers-0312bdc96137305d85d5c80708ff6d7c	2024-12-27T07:21:45-08:00	
Student marches, traffic blockades in Serbia as protests persist over concrete canopy fall	BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Serbian university students left piles of old school books outside the education ministry building on Friday as part of almost daily street protests demanding accountability over the collapse nearly two months ago of a concrete canopy that killed 15 people in the country's north. Scattered traffic blockades were also held on various locations throughout Serbia at 11:52 a.m. — the exact time that the concrete construction on the front of the railway station building in Novi Sad crashed onto the people below. The traffic blockades have been held every Friday since the Nov. 1 crash, lasting 15 minutes for the 15 victims. Many in Serbia blame the collapse on widespread corruption and sloppy work on the railway station building in the city of Novi Sad that was twice renovated in recent years as part of questionable mega projects involving Chinese state companies. Persistent protests in Serbia reflect widespread anger at the accident but also wider discontent with the rule of populist President Aleksandar Vucic and his government. Tens of thousands joined a big rally last Sunday in Belgrade led by the university students. Prosecutors have arrested 13 people over the Novi Sad tragedy, including a government minister whose release later fueled public skepticism about the honesty of the investigation. Striking university students have garnered support from various walks of life, challenging the tight grip on power of Vucic's government. The movement's symbol — a red handprint telling authorities they have blood on their hands — has been used by actors, farmers and others backing the protests. In Belgrade, more than 2,000 students marched to the education ministry. A speaker told the crowd that 'we are sick of being called political mercenaries and attacked in the streets.' In Novi Sad, a student rally criticized the way the state-run RT Vojvodina reports about the protests and the canopy collapse. Populist officials and the pro-government mainstream media have described the protests as a ‘hybrid war’ against Vucic under the orders of foreign intelligence services. Though Serbia is formally seeking European Union membership, Vucic has faced accusations of curbing democratic freedoms rather than advancing them. University students in neighboring Bosnia’s capital, Sarajevo, and the northwestern town of Banja Luka on Friday gathered in support of their Serbian colleagues and to draw attention to problems in their own country.	https://apnews.com/article/serbia-protest-students-roof-collapse-b4661370906d314c909daad8d5feb2ae	2024-12-27T05:13:52-08:00	
Israeli troops burn northern Gaza hospital after forcibly removing staff and patients, officials say	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli troops stormed one of the last hospitals operating in northern Gaza on Friday, igniting fires and forcing many staff and patients outside to strip in winter weather, the territory’s health ministry said. Kamal Adwan Hospital has been hit multiple times over the past three months by Israeli troops waging an offensive against Hamas fighters in surrounding neighborhoods, according to staff. The ministry said a strike on the hospital a day earlier killed five medical staff. Israel's military said it was conducting operations against Hamas infrastructure and militants in the area of the hospital, without details. It repeated claims that Hamas fighters operate inside Kamal Adwan but provided no evidence. Hospital officials have denied that. The Health Ministry said troops forced medical personnel and patients to assemble in the yard and remove their clothes. Some were led to an unknown location, while some patients were sent to the nearby Indonesian Hospital, which was knocked out of operation after an Israel raid this week. Israeli troops during raids frequently carry out mass detentions, stripping men to their underwear for questioning in what the military says is a security measure as they search for Hamas fighters. The Associated Press doesn’t have access to Kamal Adwan, but armed plainclothes members of the Hamas-led police forces — tasked with keeping security and officially separate from the group’s armed wing — have been seen in other hospitals. The Health Ministry said Israeli troops also set fires in several parts of Kamal Adwan, including the lab and surgery department. It said 25 patients and 60 health workers remained in the hospital out of 75 patients and 180 staff who had been there. The account could not be independently confirmed, and attempts to reach hospital staff were unsuccessful. 'Fire is ablaze everywhere in the hospital,' an unidentified member of the staff said in an audio message posted on the social media accounts of hospital director Hossam Abu Safiya. The staffer said some evacuated patients had been unhooked from oxygen. 'There are currently patients who could die at any moment,' she said. A largely isolated north Since October, Israel’s offensive has virtually sealed off the northern Gaza areas of Jabaliya, Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya and leveled large parts of them. Tens of thousands of Palestinians were forced out but thousands are believed to remain in the area, where Kamal Adwan and two other hospitals are located. Troops raided Kamal Adwan in October, and on Tuesday troops stormed and evacuated the Indonesian Hospital. The area has been cut off from food and other aid for months , raising fears of famine. The U.N. says Israeli troops allowed just four humanitarian deliveries to the area from Dec. 1 to Dec. 23. The Israeli rights group Physicians for Human Rights-Israel this week petitioned Israel’s High Court of Justice seeking a halt to military attacks on Kamal Adwan. It warned that forcibly evacuating the hospital would 'abandon thousands of residents in northern Gaza.' Before the latest deaths Thursday, the group documented five other staffers killed by Israeli fire since October. Israel launched its campaign in Gaza vowing to destroy Hamas after the group’s Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel in which militants killed around 1,200 people and abducted some 250 others. Around 100 Israelis remain captive in Gaza, around a third believed to be dead. Israel’s nearly 15-month-old campaign of bombardment and offensives has devastated the territory’s health sector. A year ago, it carried out raids on hospitals in northern Gaza, including Kamal Adwan, Indonesian and al-Awda Hospital, saying they served as bases for Hamas, though it presented little evidence. Israel’s campaign has killed more than 45,400 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, and wounded more than 108,000 others, according to the Health Ministry. Its count does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. Deaths from the cold in Gaza More than 90% of Gaza’s 2.3 million Palestinians have been driven from their homes, most of them now sheltering in sprawling, squalid tent camps in south and central Gaza. Children and adults, many barefoot, huddled Friday on the cold sand in tents whose plastic and cloth sheets whipped in the wind. Overnight temperatures can dip into the 40s Fahrenheit (below 10 Celsius), and sea spray from the Mediterranean can dampen tents just steps away. 'I swear to God, their mother and I cover ourselves with one blanket and we cover (their five children) with three blankets that we got from neighbors. Sea waters drowned everything that was ours,' said Muhammad al-Sous, displaced from Beit Lahiya in the north. The children collect plastic bottles to make fires, and pile under the blankets when their only set of clothes is washed and dried in the wind. At least three babies in Gaza have died from exposure to cold in recent days, doctors there have said. ___ Khaled and Keath reported from Cairo.	https://apnews.com/article/gaza-hospital-israel-troops-patients-fire-5bfab932afc29ce2205765ce1416a808	2024-12-27T04:40:45-08:00

Two climbers found dead on Italy's Gran Sasso massif five days after falling into ravine	ROME (AP) — The bodies of two Italian climbers have been found on Italy's Gran Sasso massif five days after they disappeared during an excursion, rescuers said. Rescue teams supported by a helicopter managed to reach the location on Friday where the two men went missing in the central Abruzzo region. The area is a stretch of rocks and snow and the rescue operation was hampered by adverse weather conditions, with strong winds and a high risk of avalanches. The mountaineers were climbing the Gran Sasso on Sunday when they slipped into a ravine and lost visual contact with each other, Italian media reported. Despite the difficult circumstances, one of them was able to make an emergency call. According to media reports, they were about 20 meters (66 feet) apart and could hear each other. Rescuers battled a violent storm and had to spend two nights in a shelter at an altitude of 2,100 meters due to the strong winds and snowfall.	https://apnews.com/article/italy-climbers-gran-sasso-bodies-ravine-1052c3f5eab831269b4bac1a4453146c	2024-12-27T03:37:12-08:00	
Nearly 70 migrants died when their boat sank en route to Spain, a Malian minister says	BAMAKO, Mali (AP) — Nearly 70 migrants died when their boat sank as they tried to reach Spain earlier this month, Mali’s Minister for Malians Living Abroad said. In a press release on Thursday, Mossa Ag Attaher announced that a migrant boat bound for Spain sank on Dec. 19. The migrants in this boat 'numbered 80 at the start, with only 11 survivors,' according to the Ministry. The Malian authorities have identified nine Malians among the survivors, and '25 young Malians have unfortunately been formally identified among the victims,' the minister added. The Atlantic route for migrants from West Africa to the Canary Islands is one of the deadliest in the world. Located nearer to Africa than mainland Spain, the archipelago is seen by most as a step toward continental Europe. Many of those making the journey come from Mali, Senegal, Mauritania, and other West African countries, seeking better job opportunities abroad or fleeing violence and political instability. Several of the Malian victims are from the Kayes region in the west of the country, according to Doulaye Keita, adviser to the ministry, in a statement to the AP on Friday. 'Among the 25 Malians dead, there are 8 Malians from my commune,' Mamadou Siby, the mayor of the commune of Marena in the Kayes region, told The Associated Press. 'These dead young men left my commune seven months ago to work in the construction industry in Mauritania. Unfortunately, they were in contact with their friends in Europe and America, who encouraged them to come to these countries, and in most cases, they took the perilous journey without even informing their families back home.'	https://apnews.com/article/mali-migrants-spain-aee72e17c46d6993fd887643627928bd	2024-12-27T03:36:27-08:00	
China sanctions 7 companies over US military assistance to Taiwan	BEIJING (AP) — The Chinese government placed sanctions on seven companies on Friday in response to recent U.S. announcements of military sales and aid to Taiwan, the self-governing island that China claims as part of its territory. The sanctions also come in response to the recent approval of the U.S. government's annual defense spending bill, which a Chinese Foreign Ministry statement said 'includes multiple negative sections on China.' China objects to American military assistance for Taiwan and often imposes sanctions on related companies after a sale or aid package is announced. The sanctions generally have a limited impact, because American defense companies don't sell arms or other military goods to China. The U.S. is the main supplier of weapons to Taiwan for its defense. The seven companies being sanctioned are Insitu Inc., Hudson Technologies Co., Saronic Technologies, Inc., Raytheon Canada, Raytheon Australia, Aerkomm Inc. and Oceaneering International Inc., the Foreign Ministry statement said. It said that 'relevant senior executives' of the companies are also sanctioned, without naming any. Any assets they have in China will be frozen, and organizations and individuals in China are prohibited from engaging in any activity with them, it said. U.S. President Joe Biden last week authorized up to $571 million in Defense Department material and services and military education and training for Taiwan. Separately, the Defense Department announced that $295 million in military sales had been approved. The U.S. defense bill boosts military spending to $895 billion and directs resources toward a more confrontational approach to China. It establishes a fund that could be used to send military resources to Taiwan in much the same way that the U.S. has backed Ukraine. It also expands a ban on U.S. military purchases of Chinese products ranging from drone technology to garlic for military commissaries. Zhang Xiaogang, a Chinese Defense Ministry spokesperson, said earlier this week that the U.S. is hyping up the 'so-called' threat from China to justify increased military spending. 'U.S. military spending has topped the world and keeps increasing every year,' he said at a press conference. 'This fully exposes the belligerent nature of the U.S. and its obsession with hegemony and expansion.' The Foreign Ministry statement said the U.S. moves violate agreements between the two countries on Taiwan, interfere in China’s domestic affairs and undermine the nation's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Taiwan's government said earlier this month that China had sent dozens of ships into nearby seas to practice a blockade of the island, a move that Taiwan said undermined peace and stability and disrupted international shipping and trade. China has not confirmed or commented on the reported military activity.	https://apnews.com/article/china-sanctions-us-military-sales-taiwan-33e27d5389740e4a1f6c2f1ff7381931	2024-12-27T02:58:38-08:00	
Ukrainian drone attack was under way before Azerbaijani plane's crash, Russian aviation chief says	Russia's aviation chief said Friday that a Ukrainian drone attack was under way in the region of Chechnya at the time an Azerbaijani airliner attempted to land before diverting to Kazakhstan and crashing there earlier this week. Dmitry Yadrov, head of Russia’s civil aviation authority Rosaviatsia, didn’t comment on statements by an Azerbaijani lawmaker and many aviation experts who blamed Wednesday’s crash on Russian air defense fire. Azerbaijan Airlines’ Embraer 190 was flying from Azerbaijan’s capital of Baku to Grozny, the regional capital of the Russian republic of Chechnya, but it turned to Aktau in Kazakhstan across the Caspian Sea and crashed while making an attempt to land there. The crash killed 38 people and left all 29 survivors injured. Authorities in Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Russia were tight-lipped about a possible cause of the crash pending an official probe, but a member of Azerbaijan's parliament, Rasim Musabekov told the Azerbaijani news agency Turan on Thursday that the plane was fired on while in the skies over Grozny and urged Russia to offer an official apology. Asked about Musabekov's statement, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to comment, saying that it will be up to investigators to determine the cause of the crash. 'The air incident is being investigated and we don't believe we have the right to make any assessments until the conclusions are made as a result of the investigation,' Peskov said in a conference call with reporters. Yadrov, the Russian aviation chief, said that as the plane was preparing to land in Grozny in deep fog, Ukrainian drones were targeting Grozny, prompting authorities to close the area for air traffic. Yadrov said that after the captain made two unsuccessful attempts to land in Grozny, he was offered other airports as an alternative but decided to fly to Aktau across the Caspian Sea. 'The situation in the area of Grozny airport was quite difficult,' he said in a statement. 'There are many circumstances that it's necessary to investigate jointly.' Investigators from Azerbaijan are working in Grozny as part of the crash probe, Azerbaijani Prosecutor General’s office said in a statement. As the official crash probe started, some aviation experts pointed out that holes seen in the plane’s tail section suggested that it could have come under fire from Russian air defense systems fending off a Ukrainian drone attack. Ukrainian drones had previously attacked Grozny, the capital of the Russian republic of Chechnya, and other regions in the country’s North Caucasus. FlightRadar24 said in an online post that the aircraft had faced 'strong GPS jamming' that interfered with flight tracking data. Russia has extensively used sophisticated jamming equipment to fend off drone attacks. Following Wednesday's suspension of flights from Baku to Grozy and Makhachkala, Azerbaiajan Airlines announced Friday that it would also halt service to more Russian cities, cutting air links to Mineralnye Vody, Sochi, Volgograd, Ufa, Samara. It said in a statement that the flights will be suspended 'following the preliminary results of the investigation into the crash of the Embraer 190 aircraft operating flight J2-8243 from Baku to Grozny, caused by physical and technical interference, and considering potential risks to flight safety.' The company will continue to operate flights to six other Russian cities including Moscow, St. Petersburg and Kazan. Those cities also have been repeatedly targeted by Ukrainian drone strikes in the past. Kazakhstan's Qazaq Air also announced Friday that it was suspending flights from Astana to the Russian city of Yekaterinburg in the Ural Mountains for a month. The day before, Israeli El Al suspended flights from Tel Aviv to Moscow citing 'developments in Russia’s airspace.' The airline said it would reassess the situation next week to decide whether to resume the flights. __ Associated Press writer Aida Sultanova contributed to this report from London.	https://apnews.com/article/azerbaijan-airliner-crash-aktau-kazakhstan-russia-embraer-f23c1bb34a3c6911be5d00ae8fdccbdc	2024-12-27T02:43:21-08:00	
Suzuki Motor former boss Osamu Suzuki, who turned the minicar maker into a global player, dies at 94	TOKYO (AP) — Osamu Suzuki, the charismatic former boss of Suzuki Motor Corp. who helped turn the Japanese mini-vehicle maker into a globally competitive company, has died, the company said Friday. He was 94. Suzuki was known for his candid remarks and friendliness, calling himself an 'old guy from a small to mid-size company.' He became CEO of Suzuki in 1978 and was leading the company when it became the first Japanese automaker to start local production in India, where its cars proved hugely popular. Born on Jan. 30, 1930 as Osamu Matsuda, Suzuki worked in banking after graduating from Tokyo's Chuo University School of Law. He joined Suzuki Motor, which is based in the central Japanese city of Hamamatsu, in 1958 when he married a daughter of the company's then-president Shunzo Suzuki, who belonged to the company’s founding family. As is sometimes the custom in such situations, Matsuda adopted his wife’s maiden name. In 1979, a year after he became Suzuki Motor's fourth company president, he launched an affordable minicar, which became a big hit and was promoted to world markets. Under Suzuki's leadership, the company's sales grew more than tenfold to 3 trillion yen ($19 billion) in the 2000s. . Suzuki also led business tie-ups with other global leaders such as General Motors and Volkswagen AG in the 2000s. Amid intensifying competition and industrial transformation, Suzuki also formed a capital alliance with Toyota Motor Corp. in 2019 to co-develop self-driving vehicles. While other Japanese automakers have expanded in the U.S. and Chinese markets, offering a wide range of vehicles, Suzuki has stuck with mini and compact cars, mostly in South and Southeast Asia. Suzuki stressed the importance of understanding the grassroots level. 'Making good quality and low-price products is the basis of manufacturing,' Suzuki once told an interview with the broadcaster NHK television. 'We cannot lower costs while sitting in the offices of president or chairperson, so I have to be in a factory to understand the work and get ideas.' Suzuki stepped down as president at age 85 in 2015, handing the post to his son, Toshihiro Suzuki. He served as an advisor to the company after resigning as chairman in 2021. The company said Suzuki died Wednesday of malignant lymphoma.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-suzuki-motor-india-495bf88bbc55c2e96faa447a5b5806f0	2024-12-27T02:13:35-08:00	
Middle East latest: Houthi rebels fire missile at Israel hours after airstrikes on Yemen airport	Houthi rebels in Yemen fired a missile at Israel early Friday, hours after a wave of Israeli airstrikes hit Yemen's main airport as the World Health Organization’s director-general was about to board a flight there. Three people were killed and dozens were wounded in the Israeli airstrikes, including a member of the U.N. plane’s crew, the U.N. said. The crew member underwent surgery and was in stable condition, it said Friday. The Israeli military said the Houthi missile was intercepted by its air defenses on Friday before it entered Israeli territory. For several days this past week, Houthi launches have set off air raid sirens in Israel. The Houthis have also been targeting shipping in the Red Sea corridor in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. Israel's war in Gaza has killed over 45,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its count. Hamas ignited the war with its Oct. 7, 2023, attack in southern Israel in which about 1,200 people were killed and 250 taken hostage by Palestinian militants. Around 100 hostages are still being held in Gaza, although only two-thirds are believed to still be alive. Here’s the latest: Israel carries out more airstrikes deep inside Lebanon, state media say BEIRUT — Israeli warplanes carried three airstrikes deep into eastern Lebanon on Friday for the second time since a ceasefire ended the war between Hezbollah and Israel a month ago, Lebanon’s state-run news agency said. No casualties were reported in the strikes on the Bekaa Valley town of Qousaya and the target remained unclear. The Israeli military said its air force struck 'infrastructure used to smuggle weapons via Syria' to Hezbollah near the Janta crossing on the Syrian-Lebanese border, about 9 kilometers (5 miles) north of Qousaya. Israel accused Hezbollah’s Unit 4400 of overseeing smuggling operations from Iran through Syria, adding that it had killed the unit’s commander in early October. Since the ceasefire took effect on Nov. 27, the Israeli army has conducted near-daily operations in southern Lebanon, including shootings, house demolitions, excavations, tank shelling and airstrikes. These actions have killed at least 27 people, wounded more than 30 and destroyed residential buildings, including a mosque. The United Nations peacekeeping mission, UNIFIL, said it has observed 'concerning actions' by Israeli forces, including the destruction of homes and road closures. On Thursday, the Lebanese army accused Israeli troops of breaching the ceasefire by encroaching into southern Lebanon. Israeli bulldozers erected dirt barricades to block roads in Wadi Al-Hujayr. The Lebanese army later on Thursday said that following intervention by the ceasefire supervision committee, Israeli forces withdrew, and Lebanese soldiers removed the barriers to reopen the road in the area. The U.S.-brokered ceasefire, which ended the 14-month war, demands that Hezbollah and Israeli forces withdraw from southern Lebanon within 60 days, allowing Lebanese troops to gradually deploy south of the Litani River. Houthi rebels fire a missile at Israel following airstrikes on Yemen’s main airport JERUSALEM — Yemen’s Houthi rebels fired a missile toward Israel early Friday, hours after Israel carried out a wave of airstrikes on Yemen’s main airport. The Israeli military said the Houthi missile was intercepted by air defenses before it entered Israeli territory. Air raid sirens were set off in several areas in central Israel. A day earlier, a wave of Israeli airstrikes hit Yemen’s main airport outside the capital, Sanaa, killing three people and wounding dozens of others, according to the U.N. The strikes hit just as the World Health Organization’s director-general was about to board a flight at the airport. Israel said it attacked infrastructure used bv the Houthis. For several days this past week, Houthi launches have set off air raid sirens in Israel. The Houthis have also been targeting shipping in the Red Sea corridor, saying their attacks are in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. Last week, Israeli jets bombed Sanaa and Hodeida, killing nine people. The U.S. military also has targeted the Houthis in Yemen in recent days. 83-year-old woman stabbed to death in Israel TEL AVIV — A Palestinian from the West Bank stabbed to death an 83-year-old woman in Israel on Friday, police said. The attack took place in the town of Herzliya on the Mediterranean coast outside Tel Aviv. Police said the attacker was arrested. A medic with Israel’s emergency services, Kobi Avriel, said first responders found the woman unconscious on the sidewalk outside a nursing home with stabbing wounds. The Tel Aviv Ichilov Medical Center said she was pronounced dead on arrival. Israel has experienced an increase in attacks amid a surge in violence in the West Bank since the start of the military’s nearly 15-month-old campaign of bombardment and offensives in Gaza triggered by the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attacks on southern Israel. Displaced Syrians face dire winter conditions in tent camps, UN says UNITED NATIONS – An estimated 730,000 people living in tents in camps for the displaced in northwest Syria are experiencing dire conditions this winter including from flooding, the U.N. humanitarian office said. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, said Thursday that more than 200 family tents in camps in Idlib and northern Aleppo were damaged by flooding from heavy rainfall on Dec. 23. 'Since the start of 2024, flooding and strong winds have damaged more than 8,800 family tents – including nearly 2,000 that were fully destroyed – across 260 camps,' OCHA said. On another issue, OCHA quoted a report from the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor based in Britain, that since Dec. 8 -– when Syrian President Bashar Assad was ousted --- episodes involving explosive ordnance have killed more than 70 civilians including a dozen children and five women, with scores more injured. OCHA said mine experts have identified 109 new minefields across Idlib, Aleppo, Hama and Latakia since Nov. 26. So far, it said experts have destroyed more than 850 individual items of explosive ordnance. Elsewhere, OCHA said Israeli forces on Wednesday reportedly wounded six civilians when they opened fire in Al-Suweisah town in Quneitra province, which includes the Golan Heights. It said residents were ordered to evacuate and Israeli forces imposed a curfew.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-syria-lebanon-news-27-december-2024-0240c348e19255d1c1ceedc8b9ff3722	2024-12-27T01:58:19-08:00	
Germany's president dissolves parliament, sets national election for Feb. 23	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier on Friday ordered parliament dissolved and set new elections for Feb. 23 in the wake of the collapse of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's coalition, saying it was the only way to give the country a stable government capable of tackling its problems. Scholz lost a confidence vote on Dec. 16 and leads a minority government after his unpopular and notoriously rancorous three-party coalition collapsed on Nov. 6 when he fired his finance minister in a dispute over how to revitalize Germany’s stagnant economy. Steinmeier said he made the decision because it was clear after consultation with party leaders that there was no agreement among Germany's political parties on a majority for a new government in the current parliament. 'It is precisely in difficult times like these that stability requires a government capable of taking action and a reliable majority in parliament,' he said as he made the announcement in Berlin. 'Therefore I am convinced that for the good of our country new elections are the right way.' Since the post-World War II constitution doesn’t allow the Bundestag to dissolve itself, it was up to Steinmeier to decide whether to dissolve parliament and call an election. He had 21 days to make that decision. Once parliament is dissolved, the election must be held within 60 days. Leaders of several major parties agreed earlier on the election date of Feb. 23, seven months earlier than originally planned. Steinmeier warned about outside interference in the poll, saying it is 'a danger to democracy, whether it is covert, as was evidently the case recently in the Romanian elections, or open and blatant, as is currently being practiced particularly intensively on platform X.' A top Romanian court annulled the first round of the country’s presidential election, days after allegations emerged that Russia ran a coordinated online campaign to promote the far-right outsider who won the first round. The campaign is already well underway. Polls show Scholz’s party trailing the conservative opposition Union bloc led by Friedrich Merz. Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck of the environmentalist Greens, the remaining partner in Scholz’s government, is also bidding for the top job — though his party is further back. If recent polls hold up, the likely next government would be led by Merz as chancellor in coalition with at least one other party. Key issues include immigration, how to get the sluggish economy going, and how best to aid Ukraine in its struggle against Russia. The populist, anti-immigration Alternative for Germany, or AfD, which is polling strongly, has nominated Alice Weidel as its candidate for chancellor but has no chance of taking the job because other parties refuse to work with it. Germany’s electoral system traditionally produces coalitions, and polls show no party anywhere near an absolute majority on its own. The election is expected to be followed by weeks of negotiations to form a new government. It’s only the fourth time that the Bundestag has been dissolved ahead of schedule under Germany’s post-World War II constitution. It happened under Chancellor Willy Brandt in 1972, Helmut Kohl in 1982 and Gerhard Schroeder in 2005. Schroeder used the confidence vote to engineer an early election narrowly won by center-right challenger Angela Merkel.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-election-steinmeier-32a9c393067faac264fae7bb29b3e4ef	2024-12-27T01:09:00-08:00	
South Korea's opposition-controlled National Assembly votes to impeach acting President Han	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s opposition-controlled National Assembly voted Friday to impeach acting President Han Duck-soo despite vehement protests by governing party lawmakers, further deepening the country’s political crisis set off by President Yoon Suk Yeol’s stunning imposition of martial law and ensuing impeachment. Han’s impeachment means he will be stripped of the powers and duties of the president until the Constitutional Court decides whether to dismiss or reinstate him. The court is already reviewing whether to uphold Yoon's earlier impeachment. The impeachments of the country’s top two officials has worsened its political turmoil, deepened economic uncertainties and hurt its international image. The single-chamber National Assembly passed Han’s impeachment motion with a 192-0 vote. Lawmakers with the governing People Power Party boycotted the vote and surrounded the podium where assembly Speaker Woo Won Shik was seated, shouting that the vote was 'invalid' and demanding Woo's resignation. No violence or injuries were reported. The PPP lawmakers protested after Woo called for a vote on Han’s impeachment motion after announcing its passage required a simple majority in the 300-member assembly, not a two-thirds majority as claimed by the PPP. Most South Korean officials can be impeached by the National Assembly with a simple majority vote, but a president’s impeachment needs the support of two-thirds. There are no specific laws on the impeachment of an acting president. In a statement, Han called his impeachment 'regrettable' but said he respects the assembly's decision and will suspend his duties to 'not add to additional confusion and uncertainty.' He said he will wait for 'a swift, wise decision' by the Constitutional Court. Han’s powers were officially suspended after copies of his impeachment document were delivered to him and the Constitutional Court. The deputy prime minister and finance minister, Choi Sang-mok, took over. Later Friday, Choi's office said he instructed the military to boost its readiness to help prevent North Korea from miscalculating the situation and launching provocations. He also told the foreign ministry to inform the U.S., Japan and other major partners that South Korea's foreign policies remain unchanged. Han, who was appointed prime minister by Yoon, became acting president after Yoon, a conservative, was impeached by the National Assembly about two weeks ago over his short-lived Dec. 3 imposition of martial law. Han quickly clashed with the main liberal opposition Democratic Party as he pushed back against opposition-led efforts to fill three vacant seats on the Constitutional Court, establish an independent investigation into Yoon’s martial law decree and legislate pro-farmer bills. At the heart of the fighting is the Democratic Party’s demand that Han approve the assembly's nominations of three new Constitutional Court justices to restore its full nine-member bench ahead of its ruling on Yoon’s impeachment. That’s a politically sensitive issue because a court decision to dismiss Yoon as president needs support from at least six justices, and adding more justices will likely increase the prospects for Yoon’s ouster. Yoon’s political allies in the governing party oppose the appointment of the three justices, saying Han shouldn’t exercise the presidential authority to make the appointments while Yoon has yet to be formally removed from office. On Thursday, Han said he wouldn’t appoint the justices without bipartisan consent. Later in the day, the Democratic Party, which holds a majority in the assembly, submitted an impeachment motion against Han and passed bills calling for the appointment of three justices. South Korean investigative agencies are probing whether Yoon committed rebellion and abuse of power with his marital law decree. Yoon has repeatedly ignored requests by authorities to appear for face-to-face questioning, His defense minister, police chief and several other senior military commanders have already been arrested over the deployment of troops and police officers to the National Assembly, which prompted a dramatic standoff that ended when lawmakers managed to enter the chamber and voted unanimously to overrule Yoon’s decree. South Korean media reported that prosecutors indicted former Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun for allegedly playing a key role in Yoon's rebellion plot and committing abuse of power and obstruction. The reports said Kim, a close associate of Yoon, became the first person to be formally charged over the martial law decree. Calls to a Seoul prosecutors' office were unanswered. Han's impeachment motion accuses him of collaborating and abetting Yoon's declaration of martial law. It also accuses Han of attempting to obstruct the restoration of the Constructional Court's full membership and of delaying investigations into Yoon's alleged rebellion by not appointing independent counsels. The martial law enactment, the first of its kind in more than 40 years in South Korea, lasted only six hours but it caused political turmoil in South Korea, triggered alarms from its neighbors and rattled markets. Yoon has defended his decree as an act of governance, saying it was a warning to the Democratic Party which he said has been using its parliamentary majority to obstruct his agenda.	https://apnews.com/article/korea-impeach-acting-leader-han-president-yoon-0276374e86e88d9a97c7c2a06d9fabfd	2024-12-26T22:47:17-08:00	
Leaders and politicians pay homage to India’s former prime minister, Manmohan Singh	NEW DELHI (AP) — Authorities in India have declared a seven-day mourning period to honor Manmohan Singh, officials said Friday, as politicians and public paid tributes to the country’s former prime minister widely regarded as the architect of India’s economic reform program. Officials canceled all cultural and entertainment events for the week, with government buildings flying the national flag at half staff across India. Singh, who died late Thursday at age 92, is scheduled to be cremated on Saturday. Singh's body was put in a glass casket, adorned with flowers and wrapped in the Indian flag, as leaders and mourners paid their respects. Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited his home and offered condolences to his family. Later, Modi in a video message said Singh’s life 'was a reflection of his honesty and simplicity.' 'He saved the country from an economic crisis by providing a road towards a new economy. As a prime minister, his contribution towards the development and progress of the country will always be remembered,' Modi said. A mild-mannered technocrat, Singh was prime minister for 10 years and leader of the Congress Party in the Parliament’s upper house, earning a reputation as a man of great personal integrity. He was chosen to fill the role in 2004 by Sonia Gandhi, the widow of assassinated Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. Singh was reelected in 2009, but his second term as prime minister was clouded by financial scandals and corruption charges over the organization of the 2010 Commonwealth Games. This led to the Congress Party’s crushing defeat in the 2014 national election by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party under the leadership of Narendra Modi. Singh adopted a low profile after relinquishing the post of prime minister.	https://apnews.com/article/india-manmohan-singh-prime-minister-abedf0aefaec10815cb7418a6e0a5de5	2024-12-26T22:25:44-08:00	
We fall and we rise': Some amputees in Sierra Leone turn to farming to combat discrimination	FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) — Lahai Makieu struck the bamboo with a machete until it cracked and fell. Balancing on his crutch, he reached to pick it up. But colleagues pulled the bamboo's other end, and he tumbled into the dense grass. 'They forgot I had one leg,' the 45-year-old said, laughing. The trainer at a center for amputee farmers picked himself up and added: 'We fall and we rise.' The phrase encapsulates his journey since the civil war in Sierra Leone. From 1991 to 2002, conflict in the West African country created some 28,000 amputees like him. Amputation by machete was one terror tactic by rebels. But even now, amputation rates remain high in Sierra Leone due to motorbike accidents, poor medical care and delayed treatment by traditional healers, according to medical researchers. The government doesn't collect data on amputees, but the United Nations estimates there are about 500,000 disabled people in the country. Makieu's left leg was amputated as a child after rebels shot him and he received no medical attention for a week. More than 20 years later, in a nation ranked near the bottom of the U.N. development index, amputees still face discrimination, often regarded as a shameful reminder of the civil war. Many resort to begging and live in the streets. 'No one cares about you as an amputee in Sierra Leone,' Makieu said. The Farming on Crutches initiative where Makieu works near the capital, Freetown, offers a rare refuge. It aims to restore amputees’ confidence and independence by teaching them skills to start a farm business. They’ve trained 100 amputees and want to expand their work. The training has transformed Makieu's life. After his amputation in 2002, he lived in a small room with a friend in Freetown, dependent on him for food, money and shelter. At a displacement camp for 270 amputees in Freetown, he met Mambud Samai, the founder of Farming on Crutches and a pastor. 'Many (amputees) are being rejected by their families and communities. They don’t believe they have love,' the 51-year-old Samai said. He felt moved to help after being a refugee himself in Guinea during the civil war. First, Samai organized beach football matches for amputees in Freetown, boosting their confidence. During a visit to Sierra Leone, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon saw the project and funded a site for an amputee football club outside the capital. But Samai decided football was not enough. As a farmer, he saw agriculture as a path to self-sufficiency. In 2020, he set up a demonstration farm to teach amputees how to farm and become rural leaders. His project's name reflects amputees' widespread use of crutches instead of prosthetic legs in Sierra Leone. Foreign donors distributed them after the civil war but many people say they don’t fit well and cause sores. And the country's only prosthetic clinic is too expensive for many. Makieu was one of the first Farming on Crutches trainees in 2022. He learned how to use farm waste for organic fertilizer and bamboo sticks for fences. He set up a small farm operation this year with his wife, Zanib, also an amputee. They met during the training and now have a child. Makieu wants to inspire future farmers. 'It’s my dream to teach people about life. It’s about changing your mindset,' he said. Morning mist rolled over the nearby mountains as the camp rose for exercises ahead of a strenuous day. They gathered in a circle, harmonizing on local songs before Samai spoke. 'We are created for fellowship, not isolation,' he said. 'When we return, we are not as we came. We go home to serve our community as rural leaders.' Makieu interjected: 'I sustain my life through farming, I met my wife here. This training can be a big package for you.' But the vast majority of amputees in Sierra Leone have no such support. Alimany Kani, 30, lives in a camp built by the Norwegian Refugee Council for amputees on the outskirts of Freetown. He lost his leg when he was a baby, to the same bullet that killed his father in the civil war. Despite holding a master’s degree in social work, he cannot find a job. 'Even if you have qualifications, an able-bodied with less education will always get the job,' Kani said. Sierra Leone’s National Commission for Persons with Disability told AP that discrimination towards amputees has improved in the last decade since the Disability Act in 2011 aimed to provide equal opportunities and punish discrimination. Kani firmly disagreed and called on the government to deliver reparations to victims of the civil war. Sierra Leone’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 2009 recommended that amputees receive pensions, access to healthcare, accommodation and education. But many of those pledges remain unfulfilled, including for Kani. Only 1,300 out of 32,000 have received a full reparations package due to lack of resources, according to the U.N.’s International Organization for Migration. 'The government don’t keep their promises. It’s inhumane,' Kani said. There currently is no specific support for amputees from the government, the National Commission for Persons with Disability said. Sierra Leone's health ministry, the president's office and the National Commission for Social Action office that manages the reparations program did not respond to questions. A farming charity in Britain, Pasture for Life, is financing Farming on Crutches in full, but Samai said they need support from Sierra Leone's government to expand. Meanwhile, the government is investing over $600 million in agriculture but some believe this will largely benefit large-scale agriculture over small-scale farmers, such as Farming on Crutches' trainees, who form 70% of the population. Two such smallholders are cousins and Farming on Crutches trainees, Amara and Moustapha Jalloh, aged 19 and 21, in central Sierra Leone. Both recently harvested rice and cassava. Moustapha, who was born without a leg, said his harvest surplus allowed him to pay for computer science training. He dreams of being an agricultural engineer. 'Any successful story, there must be painful experiences,' he said. ___ For more on Africa and development: https://apnews.com/hub/africa-pulse ___ The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

AP PHOTOS: A river route for food and crime: The dual nature of a major South American waterway	VILLA GOBERNADOR GALVEZ, Argentina (AP) — From its headwaters in Brazil, the Paraguay River flows hundreds of miles (kilometers) south to where it joins the Parana River to form a single 2,100-mile (3,400-kilometer) waterway that carries much of the agricultural and mineral wealth of South America to the Atlantic. The riverine waterway connects Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay and carries much of the world’s soybeans, ore and minerals. While the Amazon River is longer and bigger, the Parana-Paraguay waterway carries almost as much freight. In a sense, it is the Mississippi River for the nations of South America’s southern cone. Given the nature of the freight — bulk cargos — most of the thousands of ships that ply this waterway are huge, hulking transports carrying loads for international food conglomerates like Cargill. They tower above the low-lying port towns that dot the length of the Paraguay-Parana. Into the bowels of the ships are fed unimaginably large quantities of soy beans from warehouses holding equally gargantuan piles of soy, the basic foodstuff for millions of farm animals around the globe. But like the Mississippi, the waterway known locally as the 'hidrovía' also conserves traces of its past. Fisherman Dante Andino rises at dawn, around 5 a.m. His son Pablo, 14, accompanies him, learning the trade. The elder Andino puts on his rubber boots and once on the water carefully uncoils the net he will cast by hand four or five times in a day from the prow of his tiny row boat. On average, that will earn him around $20 per day. His net is the most valuable tool he owns, and the one that is most at risk from the huge freighters. 'If we are not careful, they run over our nets and cut them.' 'This waterway has made it very difficult for us fisherman, because for these big ships to pass, they have to dredge out (the river bottom) very deep,' said Andino, as he prepared his net. 'They tell us that the river is for agricultural exports, not for fishermen.' 'But we have families, daily expenses, we can't stop,' he said. 'I am 35 years old, and stopping fishing now and looking for other work would be difficult.' Gustavo Idígoras, the head of Argentina's oil and seed business chamber, said the freight traffic on the waterway cannot stop. It's a question of 'world food security,' he says. 'It is truly a highway that connects our country with 120 overseas markets,' said Idígoras. But the waterway also carries violence and drug trafficking. And the drug cartels, among them, Brazil’s First Capital Command, have found devious and complex ways to use the waterway to ship cocaine as far away as Belgium and Holland. In the last two years, more than 50 tons of cocaine that traveled this route through South America were seized from the European ports of Antwerp, Belgium and Rotterdam in the Netherlands. Much of it was controlled by the First Capital Command. The trafficking is so large-scale that it can sometimes be downright brazen. In July, authorities at a river port on the outskirts of Asuncion, Paraguay seized four tons of cocaine that had been packed into sugar sacks in a container bound for Antwerp, Belgium. The traffickers apparently hoped that one sack of white crystals would look much like any other. According to a 2019 investigation by Paraguay’s anti-drug agency, Senad, huge loads of cocaine were produced in Bolivia. From there, traffickers loaded it aboard small airplanes and landed in Paraguay’s Chaco region, which borders Bolivia. It’s the perfect geography for drug trafficking, said Francisco Ayala, a spokesman for Senad. 'It is an ideal terrain for trafficking all kinds of products, it is ideal,' said Ayala. 'It is a sparsely populated area with rough terrain, directly on the border with Bolivia.' 'Paraguay’s Chaco (region) has, and lends itself to, setting up clandestine airstrips' for drug flights mainly from Bolivia, he said. Once in Paraguay, the drugs in the 2019 case were taken by land to Seguro de Villeta, a shipping port on the upper Paraguay River. There, the cocaine was hidden in freight containers bound for Belgium and Holland. Farther down the river is Rosario, Argentina, the picturesque hometown of soccer star Lionel Messi and revolutionary Ernesto 'Che' Guevara. It lies just 180 miles (300 kilometers) from where the vast river enters the sea. Here, the trafficking and violence intensifies as the shipments get closer to the sea and drug gangs vie to protect their shipments. Homicide numbers in Rosario are five times the national average for Argentina. Rosario’s link to soccer goes beyond Messi; in November, authorities said they were investigating the killings of two leaders of the fan club for the city’s soccer team, Rosario Central, as a possible hit by rivals or drug gangs. Things got so bad that President Javier Milei instituted a crackdown on crime. Known as 'Plan Bandera (the Flag Plan),' police were sent into the city’s roughest neighborhoods and tightened control on gang leaders running their operations from inside prisons.	https://apnews.com/article/parana-paraguay-river-waterway-freight-soy-4db7484e84696d8823be8cb52ec2957f	2024-12-26T20:11:08-08:00	
Croatia's outspoken president is seeking reelection. He faces several contenders in Sunday's vote	ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) — Croatia’s left-leaning president, an outspoken critic of Western military support for Ukraine in its war against Russia, is running for reelection this weekend against an array of contenders, including the candidate backed by the conservative government. President Zoran Milanović is seen as a favorite ahead of the presidential election on Sunday, though he is unlikely to score an outright victory. If none of the eight contenders gain more than half of the ballots cast in the first round, a runoff between the top two will be held on Jan. 12. The most popular politician in Croatia, 58-year-old Milanović had served as prime minister in the past. Populist in style, Milanovic has been a fierce critic of current Prime Minister Andrej Plenković and a continuous sparring of the two has lately marked Croatia's political scene. Ahead of Sunday's vote, Plenković's Hrvatska Democratska Zajednica party, or Croatian Democratic Union party has backed pediatrician and university professor Dragan Primorac for the presidency. Primorac has sought to portray himself as a unifier and Milanovic as divisive. Though the presidency is largely ceremonial in Croatia, an elected president holds political authority and acts as the supreme commander of the military. Milanović has criticized the European Union's support for Ukraine and has often insisted that Croatia should not take sides. He has said Croatia should stay away from global disputes, thought it is a member of both NATO and the EU. Milanovic has also blocked Croatia's participation in a NATO-led training mission for Ukraine, declaring that 'No Croatian soldier will take part in somebody else’s war.' His main rival in the election, Primorac, has stated that 'Croatia's place is in the West, not the East.' His presidency bid, however, has been marred by a high-level corruption case that landed Croatia’s health minister in jail last month and which featured prominently in pre-election debates. Political expert Andjelko Milardović said Milanović’s reelection would be good for democracy in Croatia because the ruling party holds a tight grip over all other government institutions. 'We are interested to see a balance and control of power,' said Milardović. Milanović is backed by center-left Social Democrats, the biggest opposition party. Some analysts believe that Marija Selak Raspudić, a conservative independent candidate polling third in pre-election surveys, could stand a better chance against Milanovic if she somehow makes it to the runoff. Selak Raspudić was close to a right-wing party in the past but now runs as non-partisan. She has focused on economic troubles of ordinary citizens and issues such as population decline in the country of some 3.8 million and corruption. Trailing fourth in the polls is the only left-green contender in the race, Ivana Kekin, from Možemo, or We Can, party which governs Zagreb, Croatia's capital. Married to a popular rock musician, Kekin says she is a 'president for a new generation.' As a psychiatrist, Kekin has accused Primorac and HDZ of syphoning money from Croatia's health system in shady corruption deals. Four more candidates are running but none are believed to stand a chance to reach the second round. Zagreb resident Ilka Matić said she expects Milanović to win another five-year mandate but that 'there is little difference between them all.' Croatia, the newest member state of the EU after joining the bloc in 2013, has around 1.6 million eligible voters.	https://apnews.com/article/croatia-president-election-milanovic-73147e652adbbfb3a9bdb3de89316122	2024-12-26T20:03:05-08:00	
China launches amphibious assault ship that can launch fighter jets	BANGKOK (AP) — China launched a new amphibious assault ship Friday, capable of launching fighter jets and designed to strengthen the navy's combat ability in distant seas. The Sichuan, the first ship of the 076 type, is China's largest such ship yet, displacing 40,000 tons and equipped with an electromagnetic catapult which will allow fighter jets to launch directly off its deck, according to the official Xinhua news agency. The ship is designed to launch ground troops in landing crafts and provide them with air support. Developed by Chinese researchers, it's also equipped with an 'arrestor technology' which allows fighter jets to land on its deck. China's first amphibious assault ships, the type 075, launched in 2019. China’s People’s Liberation Army Navy, or PLAN, has been working on modernizing its forces for more than a decade, with the aim of being able to operate globally rather than being restricted to waters near the Chinese mainland. China first managed to launch fighter jets with the new electromagnetic technology on its indigenously made aircraft carrier, the Fujian, which launched two years ago. Chinese military expert Song Zhongping compared the Sichuan to a 'light aircraft carrier,' according to the Global Times. The ship will undergo further testing, including sea trials. China has the largest navy in the world and is consistently trying to upgrade its fleet. Recently, researchers found that the country is working on designing a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, which would allow it to deploy its ships in distant waters without needing a base to refuel. The U.S. currently has 11 aircraft carriers, all nuclear powered, allowing it to keep multiple strike groups deployed around the world at all times, including in the Asia-Pacific. ___ AP researcher Yu Bing contributed to this report from Beijing.	https://apnews.com/article/china-new-amphibious-ship-596a481b3bc3b808947080005ab433c7	2024-12-26T19:57:00-08:00	
Stock market today: Asian shares advance after a mixed finish on Wall Street	BANGKOK (AP) — Asian shares were mostly higher on Friday, with Japan’s benchmark registering strong gains for a second straight day. Oil prices and U.S. futures declined. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index climbed 1.4% to 40,139.90, while the Japanese yen sank further after the central bank governor indicated that interest rate hikes might be delayed by threats to the economy such as higher U.S. tariffs on imports. The dollar fell to 157.66 Japanese yen from 158.00 yen. It had been trading below 150 yen until the past few days. Hong Kong's Hang Seng edged 0.1% higher to 20,120.54, while the Shanghai Composite index was up 0.3% at 3,407.89. South Korea's Kospi was the outlier, falling 1.4% to 2,393.60 after the country's main opposition party submitted a motion on Thursday to impeach the country’s acting leader over his reluctance to fill three Constitutional Court vacancies ahead of the court’s review of rebellion charges against impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol stemming from his short-lived martial law decree on Dec. 3. 'U.S. equities are stuck in a holding pattern as trading volumes dry up following the holiday break,' Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary. 'Liquidity remains razor-thin, and market moves appear more about year-end housekeeping than aggressive positioning.' The S&amp;P 500 fell less than 0.1% to 6,037.59 after spending the day wavering between small gains and losses. The tiny loss ended the benchmark index’s three-day winning streak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.1% to 43,325.80 and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.1% to 20,020.36. Trading volume was lighter than usual as U.S. markets reopened following the Christmas holiday. Semiconductor giant Nvidia, whose enormous valuation gives it an outsize influence on indexes, slipped 0.2%. Meta Platforms fell 0.7%, and Amazon and Netflix each fell 0.9%. Tesla was among the biggest decliners in the S&amp;P 500, finishing 1.8% lower. Some tech companies fared better. Chip company Broadcom rose 2.4%, Micron Technology added 0.6% and Adobe gained 0.5%. Health care stocks were a bright spot. CVS Health rose 1.5% and Walgreens Boots Alliance added 5.3% for the biggest gain among S&amp;P 500 stocks. Several retailers also gained ground. Target rose 3%, Ross Stores added 2.3%, Best Buy rose 2.9% and Dollar Tree gained 3.8%. Traders are watching to see whether retailers have a strong holiday season. The day after Christmas traditionally ranks among the top 10 biggest shopping days of the year, as consumers go online or rush to stores to cash in gift cards and raid bargain bins. U.S.-listed shares in Honda and Nissan rose 4.1% and 16.4%, respectively. The Japanese automakers announced earlier this week that the two companies are in talks to combine. The Labor Department reported that U.S. applications for unemployment benefits held steady last week, though continuing claims rose to the highest level in three years. Wall Street has several economic reports to look forward to next week, including updates on pending home sales and home prices, a report on U.S. construction spending and snapshots of manufacturing activity. In other dealings early Friday, U.S. benchmark crude oil picked up 7 cents to $69.69 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, gained 7 cents to $72.92 per barrel. The euro slipped to $1.0412 from $1.0424. ___ AP Business Writers Alex Veiga and Matt Ott contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-tech-china-rates-c80cb10ca9cdb0313b11d6e636a532d6	2024-12-26T19:26:08-08:00

China probes personal disputes after mass killings. Many fear further infringement on freedoms	BANGKOK (AP) — The order came from the top. China's leader Xi Jinping wants the recent spree of mass killings that shocked the country not to happen again. He ordered local governments to prevent future 'extreme cases.' The attacks, where drivers mow down people on foot or knife-wielding assailants stab multiple victims, are not new in China. But the latest surge drew attention. Local officials were quick to vow to examine all sorts of personal disputes that could trigger aggression, from marital troubles to disagreements over inheritance. However, the increasing reach into people’s private lives raises concerns at a time when the Chinese state has already tightened its grip over all social and political aspects in the East Asian nation. 'Revenge on Society Crimes' This is how people in China label these attacks. In November alone, three took place: A man struck people at an elementary school in Hunan province, wounding 30, after suffering investment losses. A student who failed his examination stabbed and killed eight at a vocational school in the city of Yixing. The most victims, 35 people, resulted from a man mowing down a crowd in the southern city of Zhuhai, supposedly upset over his divorce. While pinpointing the exact motive of such attacks can be difficult, there is an overwhelming feeling of being pressured within Chinese society, experts say. 'On the surface, it seems like there are individual factors, but we see there’s a common link,' Wu Qiang, a former political science professor, said. 'This link is, in my personal opinion, every person has a feeling of injustice. They feel deeply that this society is very unfair and they can’t bear it anymore.' Since 2015, Chinese police have targeted human rights lawyers and non-profit advocacy groups, jailing many, while keeping tight surveillance on others, effectively destroying the civil society that had been active from the early 2000s to 2010s. Wu was fired from Tsinghua University after conducting fieldwork during the 2014 Occupy protests in Hong Kong. He says police officers have been regularly stationed outside his home in Beijing since last year. Keeping a tight lid on the killings A decade ago, media outlets could report an incident as it developed and even share a suspect’s name. Nowadays, it's rarely possible. During the 24 hours before the death toll was released in the Zhuhai slaying, state censors were quick to remove any videos of the incident and eyewitness accounts shared online. In the case of the Hunan elementary school attack, authorities shared the number of the wounded only after the court sentencing, nearly a month later. A tally of violent attacks can be documented in other countries; notably, the U.S. had 38 mass killings so far this year, according to an Associated Press database. But in China, a lack of public data makes it hard to decipher mass killing trends. 'From 2000 to 2010, there was a lot of discussions, including how do we help these people by making structural changes to reduce these risks, but now there’s not,' said Rose Luqiu, a well-known former journalist with state-owned Phoenix Television and an associate professor at Hong Kong Baptist University. Luqiu believes the government may be enforcing censorship thinking it will prevent copycats from imitating such crimes. 'Things will only become more and more strict,' she predicted. For the Chinese state, 'the only method to deal with it is to strengthen control.' Officials vow to ferret out hidden risks After the Zhuhai attack, Xi called on all local governments 'to strengthen prevention and control of risks at the source, strictly prevent extreme cases from occurring, and to resolve conflicts and disputes in a timely manner,' according to the official Xinhua news agency. The AP found at least a dozen local government notices, from small towns to big cities, announcing actions in response. In eastern Anhui province, a ruling Communist Party leader inspected a middle school, a local police station, and even the warehouse of a chemical factory where he urged the workers to 'ferret out any hidden risks.' He said they must 'thoroughly and meticulously investigate and resolve conflicts and disputes,' including in families, marriages and neighborhoods. Police and prosecutors issued similar statements. The Ministry of Justice promised to curtail conflicts by looking into squabbles over inheritance, housing, land and unpaid wages. However, many expressed worry over how such disputes will be detected. 'I think we’re at the beginning of a vicious cycle,' said Lynette Ong, a professor at the University of Toronto and author of 'Outsourcing Repression: Everyday State Power in Contemporary China.' 'If you nip the conflict in its bud, you’d imagine the system then would impose a lot of pressure ... on schools, enterprises and factories.' The new announcements reminded Ong of China’s strict policies during the COVID-19 pandemic. Neighborhood committees, the lowest rung of government, set up fences and barriers in front of buildings to control entry and exit and broke into homes in extreme cases to disinfect the apartments of people who had caught the virus. Eventually, people protested en masse. 'If we see non-sensible measures being introduced, you’ll be met by resistance and anger and grievances from the people, and it’s going to feed into this vicious cycle where more extreme measures are going to be brought,' she said.	https://apnews.com/article/china-mass-killings-revenge-society-security-censors-705144a770b486eb222c040cba056f41	2024-12-26T17:15:23-08:00	
Canadian ministers head to Palm Beach for talks with incoming Trump administration	TORONTO (AP) — Two top Canadian Cabinet ministers are visiting Palm Beach to talk border security and trade with the incoming Donald Trump administration as Trump threatens tariffs on all Canadian products. New Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc and Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly will be in Palm Beach, Florida on Thursday for the talks this week, said Jean-Sébastien Comeau, a spokesman for LeBlanc. LeBlanc said last week he would meet with Tom Homan, Trump’s incoming 'border czar,' after Christmas to discuss Canada’s plan to secure the border as part of a bid to avoid the sweeping tariffs. Comeau said LeBlanc and Joly 'look forward to building on the discussions that took place when the Prime Minister met with President Trump at Mar-a-Lago last month, as well as the positive call the Ministers held with Mr. Tom Homan earlier this month.' 'The Ministers intend to focus on Canada’s efforts to combat fentanyl trafficking and illegal migration and the measures outlined in Canada’s Border Plan, as well as the negative impacts that the imposition of 25% tariffs on Canadian goods would have on both Canada and the United States,' Comeau added in a statement. The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment. Trump keeps calling embattled Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau the governor of the 51st state and has threatened to impose sweeping tariffs if Canada does not stem what he calls a flow of migrants and drugs in the United States — even though far fewer of each cross into the U.S. from Canada than from Mexico, which Trump has also threatened. Canada has a billion-dollar plan to increase security at the border. LeBlanc last week he discussed parts of the plan with American officials and is optimistic, but said they have a lot of work ahead. Trump has also made an issue of the U.S. trade deficit with Canada, erroneously calling it a subsidy. Canada’s ambassador to Washington, Kirsten Hillman, has said the U.S. had a $75 billion trade deficit with Canada last year. But she noted a third of what Canada sells into the U.S. are energy exports and said there is a deficit when oil prices are high. About 60% of U.S. crude oil imports and 85% of U.S. electricity imports are from Canada. Nearly $3.6 billion Canadian dollars ($2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border each day. Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states. Flows of migrants and seizures of drugs are vastly different at the U.S.'s two land borders. U.S. customs agents seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the Canadian border during the last fiscal year, compared with 21,100 pounds at the Mexican border. Most of the fentanyl reaching the U.S. — where it causes about 70,000 overdose deaths annually — is made by Mexican drug cartels using precursor chemicals smuggled from Asia. On immigration, the U.S. Border Patrol reported 1.53 million encounters with migrants at the southwest border with Mexico between October 2023 and September 2024. That compares to 23,721 encounters at the Canadian border during that time.	https://apnews.com/article/canada-trump-tariff-leblanc-joly-border-ca7f9bd358f05614d0f928f340162ef2	2024-12-26T16:29:28-08:00

An uneasy calm settles over Syrian city of Homs after outbreak of sectarian violence	HOMS, Syria (AP) — Syria's new security forces checked IDs and searched cars in the central city of Homs on Thursday, a day after protests by members of the Alawite minority erupted in gunfire and stirred fears that the country's fragile peace could break down. A tense calm prevailed after checkpoints were set up throughout the country’s third-largest city, which has a mixed population of Sunni and Shia Muslims, Alawites and Christians. The security forces are controlled by the former insurgent group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which led the charge that unseated former President Bashar Assad. On the road from Damascus, security teams at the checkpoints waved cars through perfunctorily, but in Homs they checked IDs and opened the trunk of each car to look for weapons. Armed men blocked the road leading to the square formerly named for Assad’s father, Hafez Assad, where one foot was all that remained of a statue of him that once stood in the center of the traffic roundabout. The square has been renamed Freedom Square, although some call it 'the donkey’s square,' referring to Assad. Protests erupted there Wednesday among Alawites — the minority sect to which the Assad family belongs — after a video circulated showing an Alawite shrine in Aleppo being vandalized. Government officials later issued a statement saying that the video was old. Wednesday's protests began peacefully, said Alaa Amran, the newly installed police chief of Homs, but then 'some suspicious parties ... related to the former regime opened fire on both security forces and demonstrators, and there were some injuries.' Security forces flooded the area and imposed a curfew to restore order, he said. Mohammad Ali Hajj Younes, an electrician who has a shop next to the square, said the people who instigated the violence are 'the same shabiha who used to come into my shop and rob me, and I couldn’t say anything,' using a term referring to pro-Assad militia members. The protests were part of a larger flare-up of violence Wednesday. Pro-Assad militants attacked members of the new security forces near the coastal town of Tartous, killing 14 and wounding 10, according to the Interior Ministry in the transitional government. In response, security forces launched raids 'pursuing the remnants of Assad's militias,' state media reported. The state-run SANA news agency reported late Thursday that clashes broke out in the village of Balqasa in a rural part of Homs province. The unrest left many people fearful that the relatively peaceful conditions that have prevailed since Assad's fall could break down into sectarian fighting as the country begins to recover following nearly 14 years of civil war. Those who instigated the violence 'are supported by parties that may be external that want strife for Syria to return it to square one, the square of sectarianism,' Amran said. Ahmad al-Bayyaa, an Alawite in the al-Zahra neighborhood of Homs, said he and his wife and three daughters fled to the coastal town of Baniyas when insurgent forces first arrived, but came back a day later after hearing from neighbors that the fighters had not harmed civilians. 'We had been given the idea that there would be slaughter and killing based on our identity, and nothing like that happened,' he said. 'We came back, and nobody asked to see my ID from the coast to Homs.' Before Assad's fall, al-Bayyaa said, he spent 10 years in hiding to avoid a call-up for reserve army service and was afraid to cross a checkpoint in his own neighborhood. After the former Syrian army collapsed in the face of the HTS-led advance, residents of the neighborhood set up a fruit and vegetable stand on an abandoned tank in a gesture of mockery. In the predominantly Christian Homs suburb of Fayrouzeh, a group of teenage girls took each other’s pictures next to a giant cutout of Santa Claus with a Christmas tree in the town square. Residents of the area said their initial fears that the country's new rulers would target religious minorities were quickly laid to rest. HTS was once aligned with al-Qaida, but its leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, has cut ties with the group and since coming to power has preached religious coexistence. 'We had a very beautiful holiday even though there was some anxiety before it,' said Fayrouzeh resident Sarab Kashi. 'The guys from HTS volunteered and stood as guards on the door of the churches.' The city’s Sunni majority, meanwhile, welcomed the new administration. Many of the young men now guarding its streets were originally from Homs and were evacuated to opposition-held Idlib when Assad’s forces solidified control of their areas years ago. 'These guys were young boys when they took them in the green buses, and they were crying,' said Wardeh Mohammed, gesturing at a group of young men manning a checkpoint in front of a grocery store on one of the city's main streets. 'Thank God, they have come back as young men, as fighters who made us proud.' The country’s new rulers have scrambled to impose order after the initial anarchic days after Assad’s fall. The former police and security forces — widely known for corruption — were disbanded, and members of the police force in what was formerly a regional government headed by HTS in the opposition-held northwest were deployed to other areas. Amran, the police chief, said recruitment efforts are underway to build up the forces, but he acknowledged that the current numbers are 'not sufficient to control security 100%.' The new security forces have also struggled to stem the proliferation of weapons in the hands of civilians or non-state groups, he said. Al-Sharaa has said that the country's patchwork of former rebel groups will come together in one unified national army, but it remained unclear exactly how that would happen or whether the groups can avoid infighting. In Homs, it was clear that several different armed factions patrolled the streets, in a sometimes uneasy coordination. An HTS official hastened to explain that a handful of armed men wearing patches with an insignia sometimes associated with the Islamic State were not members of his group. Many feared another flare-up of violence. 'From what happened yesterday, it’s clear that some people want to take the country backwards' to the worst days of the country’s civil war, al-Bayya said, 'and no one wants to go back 14 years.'	https://apnews.com/article/syria-homs-alawites-hts-assad-sectarian-6c8d534d9f93da13dc8629f2f2c49aae	2024-12-26T11:22:20-08:00	
Organizers say two sailors have died in the Sydney to Hobart yacht race amid a stormy first night	Two sailors on separate boats have been killed in boom accidents two hours apart on a storm-ravaged first night of the annual Sydney to Hobart race, adding to the event's long history of deaths at sea. The Cruising Yacht Club of Australia in Sydney, which administers the yacht race, said Friday that one sailor each on entrants Flying Fish Arctos and Bowline were killed after being struck by the boom, a large horizontal pole at the bottom of the sail. Officials later said a sailor was washed overboard on another boat, but was rescued. That crew member was from Hobart yacht Porco Rosso, and he drifted a kilometer from the yacht before being rescued. The incident triggered the crew member’s emergency position-indicating radio beacon, a safety device that must be worn by all sailors in the race. 'That is one of the most terrifying experiences that you can have,' said David Jacobs, vice-commodore of the CYCA. '(And) it was at night, which makes it tenfold more scary.' The deaths come 26 years after six sailors were killed in storms during the 1998 running of the race, which triggered a state coronial inquest and mass reforms to the safety protocols — including the radio beacon on all sailors — that govern the race. There have been 13 fatalities in the 79-year history of the race, with four of those deaths resulting from sailor heart attacks. The fleet was continuing its passage to Constitution Dock in Hobart, Tasmania, with the first boats expected to arrive early Saturday morning. The race is 628 nautical miles (722 miles, 1,160 kilometers) long. Jacobs reiterated the race would 'absolutely' continue. 'The conditions are challenging, but they’re not excessive,' he said. 'So we’ve got sort of winds at about 25 knots coming from the north seas around about two meters or thereabouts, so the conditions that most of the sailors would normally easily handle.' 'The sailing community is a very close community. There’s about a thousand sailors on the water in this race, and to lose two in this fashion is just devastating.' Just over 21 hours into the race, 87 entrants were still sailing and 17 yachts had retired at sea. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese paid tribute to the sailors who died. 'We have sadly awoken to tragedy in the Sydney to Hobart with the awful news two sailors have lost their lives,' he said. 'Our thoughts are with the crews, their families and loved ones at this deeply sad time.' The incident aboard Flying Fish Arctos occurred around 30 nautical miles east-southeast of Ulladulla on the New South Wales south coast. Crew members attempted CPR but could not revive their teammate. The crew member aboard Bowline was struck approximately 30 nautical miles east/north-east of Batemans Bay and fell unconscious, with CPR also unsuccessful. 'As these incidents are being dealt with by the Water Police and all family members are yet to be contacted, we cannot provide further details at this stage,' the CYCA said in a statement. 'Our thoughts are with the crews, family and friends of the deceased.' Flying Fish Arctos, a New South Wales-based 50-footer, has contested 17 previous Hobarts since being built in 2001. The boat was designed for round-the-world sailing and is currently used by Flying Fish, a sailing school that operates in Mosman, a suburb on Sydney’s north shore. The first all-Filipino crew of 15 sailors was entered in the 2024 race, but was among the retirements because of the weather. With veteran sailor Ernesto Echauz at the helm, Centennial 7 was one of six international entrants and includes sailors from the Philippines’ national team and the Philippines navy. Last year, LawConnect won line honors after holding off defending champion Comanche by less than a minute in an exciting finish between the super maxis. LawConnect, which was runner-up in the last three editions of the race, finished in 1 day, 19 hours, 3 minutes, 58 seconds. Comanche’s time was 1 day, 19 hours, 4 minutes, 49 seconds — a margin of just 51 seconds. Comanche, which was among the retirements in this year's race, holds the race record of 1 day, 9 hours, 15 minutes, 24 seconds, set when it won in 2017. LawConnect, which led out of Sydney Harbor on Thursday, was leading this year's race but still had 200 nautical miles before reaching Hobart. It could mean an overnight finish for the leading yachts early Saturday. Celestial V70 was in second place, about 10 nautical miles behind LawConnect. ___ AP sports: https://apnews.com/sports	https://apnews.com/article/sydney-hobart-sailing-yacht-race-ddd5a55f89a95c5fa6e8881265b182a8	2024-12-26T11:10:08-08:00	
An altercation erupts at a high-level meeting of a Russia-dominated economic union	MOSCOW (AP) — A tightly-scripted meeting of the Russia-dominated economic alliance of several ex-Soviet nations briefly went awry Thursday when two leaders engaged in bickering during a live broadcast of the event. Russian President Vladimir Putin and other heads of states attended the meeting of the Eurasian Economic Union, which includes Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, who has increasingly sought to phase down his country's ties with Moscow and forge closer relations with the West, joined the meeting via video link after canceling his trip following a positive test for COVID-19. The carefully choreographed session at a resort near St. Petersburg veered off script when Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, whose country was taking the rotating chairmanship in the economic grouping from Armenia, urged Pashinyan to visit Belarus for the union's next meeting. Pashinyan responded that he plans to attend the Belarus meeting via video call, after which Lukashenko pressed for an explanation and even offered to send a plane to fly the Armenian delegation to the Belarusian capital. Pashinyan then pointed to his earlier decision to freeze high-level visits to Belarus over Lukashenko's support for Armenia's rival, Azerbaijan. 'I don't think this is the right format for discussing these issues,' Pashinyan added. But Lukashenko kept arguing and Pashinyan snapped back. Putin, who sat next to Lukashenko, and other leaders watched the altercation in stony silence. The Eurasian Economic Union was formed a decade ago to encourage stronger business ties and facilitate trade between its members, but it has been marred by economic and other dispoutes between members.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-economic-union-belarus-armenia-1dc20197b7c743f18f8d86b923473132	2024-12-26T08:58:58-08:00	
The US says it pushed retraction of a famine warning for north Gaza. Aid groups express concern.	WASHINGTON (AP) — A lead organization monitoring for food crises around the world withdrew a new report this week warning of imminent famine in north Gaza under what it called Israel's 'near-total blockade,' after the U.S. asked for its retraction, U.S. officials told the Associated Press. The move follows public criticism of the report from the U.S. ambassador to Israel. The rare public dispute drew accusations from prominent aid and human-rights figures that the work of the U.S.-funded Famine Early Warning System Network, meant to reflect the opinion of unbiased international experts, has been tainted by politics. A declaration of famine would be a great embarrassment for Israel, which has insisted that its 15-month war in Gaza is aimed against the Hamas militant group and not against its civilian population. U.S. ambassador to Israel Jacob Lew earlier this week called the warning by the internationally recognized group inaccurate and 'irresponsible.' Lew and the U.S. Agency for International Development, which funds the monitoring group, both said the findings failed to properly account for rapidly changing circumstances in north Gaza. Humanitarian and human rights officials expressed fear of U.S. political interference in the world's monitoring system for famines. The U.S. Embassy in Israel and the State Department declined comment. FEWS officials did not respond to questions. 'We work day and night with the U.N. and our Israeli partners to meet humanitarian needs — which are great — and relying on inaccurate data is irresponsible,' Lew said Tuesday. USAID confirmed to the AP that it had asked the famine-monitoring organization to withdraw its stepped-up warning issued in a report dated Monday. The report did not appear among the top updates on the group's website Thursday, but the link to it remained active. The dispute points in part to the difficulty of assessing the extent of starvation in largely isolated northern Gaza. Thousands in recent weeks have fled an intensified Israeli military crackdown that aid groups say has allowed delivery of only a dozen trucks of food and water since roughly October. FEWS Net said in its withdrawn report that unless Israel changes its policy, it expects the number of people dying of starvation and related ailments in north Gaza to reach between two and 15 per day sometime between January and March. The internationally recognized mortality threshold for famine is two or more deaths a day per 10,000 people. FEWS was created by the U.S. development agency in the 1980s and is still funded by it. But it is intended to provide independent, neutral and data-driven assessments of hunger crises, including in war zones. Its findings help guide decisions on aid by the U.S. and other governments and agencies around the world. A spokesman for Israel's foreign ministry, Oren Marmorstein, welcomed the U.S. ambassador's public challenge of the famine warning. 'FEWS NET - Stop spreading these lies!' Marmorstein said on X. In challenging the findings publicly, the U.S. ambassador 'leveraged his political power to undermine the work of this expert agency,' said Scott Paul, a senior manager at the Oxfam America humanitarian nonprofit. Paul stressed that he was not weighing in on the accuracy of the data or methodology of the report. 'The whole point of creating FEWS is to have a group of experts make assessments about imminent famine that are untainted by political considerations,' said Kenneth Roth, former executive director of Human Rights Watch and now a visiting professor in international affairs at Princeton University. 'It sure looks like USAID is allowing political considerations -- the Biden administration’s worry about funding Israel’s starvation strategy -- to interfere.' Israel says it has been operating in recent months against Hamas militants still active in northern Gaza. It says the vast majority of the area’s residents have fled and relocated to Gaza City, where most aid destined for the north is delivered. But some critics, including a former defense minister, have accused Israel of carrying out ethnic cleansing in Gaza’s far north, near the Israeli border. North Gaza has been one of the areas hardest-hit by fighting and Israel’s restrictions on aid throughout its war with Hamas militants. Global famine monitors and U.N. and U.S. officials have warned repeatedly of the imminent risk of malnutrition and deaths from starvation hitting famine levels. International officials say Israel last summer increased the amount of aid it was admitting there, under U.S. pressure. The U.S. and U.N. have said Gaza’s people as a whole need between 350 and 500 trucks a day of food and other vital needs. But the U.N. and aid groups say Israel recently has again blocked almost all aid to that part of Gaza. Cindy McCain, the American head of the U.N. World Food Program, previously called for political pressure to get food flowing to Palestinians there. Israel says it places no restrictions on aid entering Gaza and that hundreds of truckloads of goods are piled up at Gaza’s crossings and accused international aid agencies of failing to deliver the supplies. The U.N. and other aid groups say ongoing combat, looting and insufficient security by Israeli troops make it impossible to deliver aid effectively. Lew, the U.S. ambassador, said the famine warning was based on 'outdated and inaccurate' data. He pointed to uncertainty over how many of the 65,000-75,000 people remaining in northern Gaza had fled in recent weeks, saying that skewed the findings. FEWS said in its report that its famine assessment holds even if as few as 10,000 people remain. USAID in its statement to AP said it had reviewed the report before it became public, and noted 'discrepancies' in population estimates and some other data. The U.S. agency had asked the famine warning group to address those uncertainties and be clear in its final report to reflect how those uncertainties affected its predictions of famine, it said. 'This was relayed before Ambassador Lew’s statement,' USAID said in a statement. 'FEWS NET did not resolve any of these concerns and published in spite of these technical comments and a request for substantive engagement before publication. As such, USAID asked to retract the report.' Roth criticized the U.S. challenge of the report in light of the gravity of the crisis there. 'This quibbling over the number of people desperate for food seems a politicized diversion from the fact that the Israeli government is blocking virtually all food from getting in,' he said, adding that 'the Biden administration seems to be closing its eyes to that reality, but putting its head in the sand won’t feed anyone.' The U.S., Israel’s main backer, provided a record amount of military support in the first year of the war. At the same time, the Biden administration repeatedly urged Israel to allow more access to aid deliveries in Gaza overall, and warned that failing to do so could trigger U.S. restrictions on military support. The administration recently said Israel was making improvements and declined to carry out its threat of restrictions. Military support for Israel’s war in Gaza is politically charged in the U.S., with Republicans and some Democrats staunchly opposed any effort to limit U.S. support over the suffering of Palestinian civilians trapped in the conflict. The Biden administration’s reluctance to do more to press Israel for improved treatment of civilians undercut support for Democrats in last month’s elections. ___ Sam Mednick and Josef Federman in Jerusalem contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/gaza-israel-famine-biden-trump-fews-89b4a0d3ab684669ee4456566b406621	2024-12-26T08:34:59-08:00	
India's former prime minister Manmohan Singh, architect of economic reforms, dies aged 92	NEW DELHI (AP) — India’s former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, widely regarded as the architect of India’s economic reform program and a landmark nuclear deal with the United States, has died. He was 92. Singh was admitted to New Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences late Thursday after his health deteriorated due to a 'sudden loss of consciousness at home,' the hospital said in a statement. 'Resuscitative measures were started immediately at home. He was brought to the Medical Emergency' at 8:06 p,m., the hospital said, but 'despite all efforts, he could not be revived and was declared dead at 9:51 PM.' Singh was being treated for 'age-related medical conditions,' the statement said. A mild-mannered technocrat, Singh became one of India’s longest-serving prime ministers for 10 years and earned a reputation as a man of great personal integrity. He was chosen to fill the role in 2004 by Sonia Gandhi, the widow of assassinated Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. But his sterling image was tainted by allegations of corruption against his ministers. Singh was elected to a second term as prime minister from 2009-2014 that was clouded by financial scandals and corruption charges over the organization of the 2010 Commonwealth Games. This led to the Congress Party’s crushing defeat in the 2014 national election by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party under the leadership of Narendra Modi. Singh adopted a low profile after relinquishing the post of prime minister. Prime Minister Modi, who succeeded Singh in 2014, called him one of India’s 'most distinguished leaders' who rose from humble origins and left 'a strong imprint on our economic policy over the years.' 'As our Prime Minister, he made extensive efforts to improve people’s lives,' Modi said in a post on social platform X. He called Singh’s interventions in Parliament as a lawmaker 'insightful' and said 'his wisdom and humility were always visible.'	https://apnews.com/article/india-manmohan-singh-prime-minister-obituary-06cfb0b96acc00a64a280cc6da3cc968	2024-12-26T08:27:19-08:00	
Ukraine's military intelligence says North Korean troops suffer heavy battlefield losses	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — North Korean troops are suffering heavy losses in the fighting in Russia's Kursk region and are facing logistical difficulties as a result of Ukrainian attacks, Ukraine’s military intelligence said Thursday. The intelligence agency, known under its acronym GUR, said that Ukrainian strikes near Novoivanovka inflicted heavy casualties on North Korean units. It said that as a result of Ukrainian attacks along the front line North Korean troops also faced supply issues and even experienced shortages of drinking water. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said earlier this week that 3,000 North Korean troops have been killed and wounded in the fighting in the Kursk region. It marked the first significant estimate by Ukraine of North Korean casualties several weeks after Kyiv announced that North Korea had sent 10,000 to 12,000 troops to Russia to help it in the almost 3-year war. The casualty disclosure came as the Biden administration was pressing to send as much military aid as possible to Ukraine before President-elect Donald Trump takes over. Ukrainian forces launched a foray into the Kursk region in August, dealing a significant blow to Russia's prestige and forcing it to distract some of its troops from eastern Ukraine, where they were pressing a slow-moving offensive. The Russian army has been able to reclaim some of the territory in the Kursk region from Ukrainian forces, but has failed to fully dislodge them. At the same time, Russia has sought to break Ukraine's resistance with waves of strikes with cruise missiles and drones against Ukraine's power grid and other vital infrastructure. The latest massive attack on Christmas morning involving 78 missiles and 106 drones struck power facilities and prompted Ukrainians to take shelter in metro stations on Christmas morning, Ukraine’s air force said. It claimed to have intercepted 59 missiles and 54 drones and jammed 52 other drones. On Thursday, Russia again attacked Ukraine with 31 exploding drones, 20 of which were shot down and another 11 didn’t reach their target due to jamming, the Ukrainian air force said. As part of the daily barrage, Russian forces also struck a central market in Nikopol in the Dnipropetrovsk region with a drone on Thursday, wounding eight people, according to local authorities. Ukraine struck back with drone strikes of its own. Ukraine’s Center for Strategic Communications said Thursday that the country's military has struck a plant in Kamensk-Shakhtynsky in Russia’s southern Rostov region that produces propellant for ballistic missiles. 'This strike is part of a comprehensive campaign to weaken the capabilities of the Russian armed forces to carry out terrorist attacks against Ukrainian civilians,' it said in a statement.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-north-korea-fe2506b30c4289a19a41c332f3dbe49c	2024-12-26T07:24:17-08:00	
Five facts about electric vehicles in 2024	DETROIT (AP) — Electric vehicles had another whirlwind year around the globe, driven by buyers in China, and growth in parts of Europe and the United States, despite headwinds. In a milestone for China, the world's biggest auto market, EVs hit 50% of new car sales in July. That included pure battery EVs plus plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. Chinese companies such as BYD continue to gain traction worldwide with their inexpensive EVs. Electric vehicles also made headway in Europe and the U.S. Uncertainty around purchase subsidies could complicate matters come 2025, especially under the incoming Trump administration in the U.S. But mainstream consumers remain interested in new models, longer driving ranges, better performance and lower prices. The transition to electric vehicles is an important part of the shift to clean energy. Road transport accounts for around one-sixth of all global emissions from energy, according to the International Energy Agency. Widespread EV adoption could significantly address climate change. Here are five facts about EVs this year. Most of the data comes from consultancy Rho Motion. How well did electric vehicles sell? The global EV market, including pure EVs and plug-in hybrids, grew by 25% year-over-year as of November. Rho Motion estimates 15.2 million EVs had been sold worldwide ahead of the end of the year, and the International Energy Agency expected electrified vehicle sales to reach one in five cars sold globally. Most were in China. Where did the EV share of new cars jump the most? Mexico sold roughly 5 times as many EVs this year than last, mostly from Chinese powerhouse automaker BYD, according to Rho Motion. Because China's population is so much larger, its 40% growth year-to-date translates to many more EVs than Mexico's fivefold increase. Other areas of note are the United Kingdom, which saw a roughly 17% increase year-to-date. That's interesting to compare to France and Germany, which saw sales decline. In Turkey, the EV market grew by almost 50% year-to-date, driven by Tesla entering the market last year and Togg, a Turkish auto company, ramping up its sales. In Norway, which for years has been in first place for share of vehicles that are electric, 90% of new cars were EVs. What was the best-selling electric vehicle globally? In the United States? The best-selling pure electric vehicles were the Tesla Model Y, followed by the Tesla Model 3 — both globally and in the U.S., according to Rho Motion. The Model Y SUV was released in 2020. Its base version today costs nearly $45,000. The Model 3 was released in 2017. The least expensive version sells for around $42,000. Both have been eligible for a $7,500 tax credit in the U.S. Tesla picture changing? Tesla's market share stood at 17% of all electric cars across the globe through October, according to Rho Motion. In the U.S., Tesla's market share was 49% through October. That means the company still has the biggest EV market share. But its hold is shrinking as other auto companies combined sell a growing number of electrics. For example, GM, Ford, Honda and more are offering a wider variety of EVs at lower prices and sizes and are chipping away at Tesla's longstanding lead. Tesla remains the most valuable auto company in the world, with a market value of $1.4 trillion. ___ Alexa St. John is an Associated Press climate solutions reporter. Follow her on X: @alexa_stjohn.

Middle East latest: Israel bombs Yemen's main airport and key infrastructure	Houthi rebels in Yemen say Israeli airstrikes on Thursday targeted the rebel-held capital of Sanaa and the port city of Hodeida. The Israeli military said it attacked infrastructure used by the Houthis at the international airport in Sanaa, power stations and ports. The strikes on Thursday follow several days of Houthi launches setting off sirens in Israel, and last week, Israeli jets bombed Sanaa and Hodeida, killing nine people. The Houthis have also been targeting shipping in the Red Sea corridor, calling it solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. In the Gaza Strip, an Israeli strike killed five Palestinian journalists in a van with press markings outside a hospital in a refugee camp, the Health Ministry said Thursday. Israel's military said it targeted a group of militants allied with Hamas, which ignited the war with its Oct. 7, 2023, attack in southern Israel. Israel's bombardment and ground invasion in Gaza has killed over 45,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its count. Hamas’s attack on southern Israel in October 2023 resulted in the deaths of about 1,200 people, while 250 others were taken hostage by Palestinian militants. Around 100 hostages are still being held in Gaza, although only two-thirds are believed to still be alive. Here’s the latest: Israel strikes Houthi rebels in Yemen’s capital and ports JERUSALEM — Houthi rebels in Yemen said Israeli airstrikes on Thursday targeted the rebel-held capital of Sanaa and the port city of Hodeida, following several days of Houthi launches that set off air-raid sirens in Israel. The Israeli military said it attacked infrastructure used by the Houthis at the international airport in Sanaa and ports at Hodeida, Al-Salif and Ras Qantib along with power stations. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a speech on Wednesday that 'the Houthis, too, will learn what Hamas and Hezbollah and Assad’s regime and others learned.' The Iran-backed Houthis’ media outlet reported the strikes in a Telegram post, but gave no immediate details. The U.S. military also has targeted the Houthis in Yemen in recent days. The United Nations has noted that the ports are important entryways for humanitarian aid. Over the weekend, 16 people were wounded when a Houthi missile hit a playground in Tel Aviv. Last week, Israeli jets struck Sanaa and Hodeida, killing nine people, calling it a response to previous Houthi attacks. The Houthis also have been targeting shipping on the Red Sea corridor, calling it solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. Kurdish-led group holds funeral for 6 fighters killed in northeast Syria fighting QAMISHLI, Syria — Thousands of people in northeastern Syria attended a funeral Thursday for six fighters from a Kurdish-led, U.S.-backed force who were killed in ongoing clashes with Turkish-backed militias. The Turkish-backed groups are launching attacks to take the Arab cities west of the Euphrates River that are under the control of the Kurdish group . The Turkish-supported groups helped overthrow Bashar al-Assad’s rule of Syria, and have since kept pushing eastward against the Kurdish groups. 'We thought that Syria today has entered a new stage after the fall and escape of Assad. We thought that we got rid of all of this, but this attack on us changed everything and those who came in are taking orders from Turkey,' said Nihayet Hassan, the uncle of a killed fighter. The fighters were killed during attacks on Tishreen Dam near the strategic city of Manbij in recent days. The bodies were returned to the city of Qamishli in northeastern Syria where the U.S.-backed group, known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, has a strong presence. Ankara sees the SDF as an affiliate of its sworn enemy, the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, which Turkey classifies as a terrorist organization. Turkish-backed armed groups backed by Turkish jets have for years attacked positions where the SDF are present across northern Syria, in a bid to create a buffer zone free from the group along the Turkish border. 'It is obvious that Turkey’s issue is with the Kurds. It is not about an organization, or the PKK, no, their target are the Kurds,' said Ahmad Ammo, a Qamishli resident who attended the funeral. The U.S. has about 2,000 soldiers in eastern Syria to help fight the Islamic State group and protect critical oil fields there. Lebanese military says Israel violated ceasefire agreement by entering southern Lebanon BEIRUT — The Lebanese military said Thursday that Israeli troops encroached on areas of southern Lebanon, violating a ceasefire agreement that ended the war between Israel and the Hezbollah group. The U.S.-brokered ceasefire that went into effect a month ago called for Hezbollah militants and Israeli troops to leave southern Lebanon over a 60-day period as Lebanese army soldiers gradually deploy in the country south of the Litani River. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the reported incident. Meanwhile, Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency said Israeli bulldozers are setting up dirt barricades that would close off the road between Wadi Slouqi and Wadi Hujeir. Lebanon’s military said it brought reinforcements into the areas entered by Israeli troops. NNA said the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, sent a patrol unit to an area near the southern town of Qantara where Israeli forces are present. UNIFIL in a statement expressed its 'concern at continuing destruction by the IDF (Israeli military) in residential areas, agricultural land, and road networks in south Lebanon.' Lebanese army chief Gen. Joseph Aoun traveled to Saudi Arabia earlier Thursday as part of ongoing efforts by the cash-strapped military to find financial support to deploy in larger numbers. The Lebanese military and government have complained about Israeli strikes and overflights in the country to a new monitoring committee headed by the U.S. that also includes France. Israeli strike kills five Palestinian journalists, Gaza Health Ministry says DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — An Israeli strike killed five Palestinian journalists outside a hospital in the Gaza Strip overnight, the Health Ministry said Thursday. The Israeli army said it had targeted a group of militants. The strike hit a car outside the Al-Awda Hospital in the built-up Nuseirat refugee camp in the central part of the territory. The journalists were working for the local news outlet Al-Quds Today, a television channel affiliated with the Islamic Jihad militant group. The military said it targeted a group of fighters from Islamic Jihad, a militant group allied with Hamas, whose Oct. 7, 2023, attack into southern Israel ignited the war. Associated Press video showed the incinerated shell of a van, with press markings still visible on the back doors. The Committee to Protect Journalists says over 130 Palestinian reporters have been killed since the start of the war. Israel has not allowed foreign reporters to enter Gaza except on military embeds. ___ This post has been corrected to show that the name of the local news outlet is Al-Quds Today, not the Quds News Network. China pledges 2 more shipments of aid to Gaza BEIJING — China has pledged two more shipments of humanitarian aid to Gaza, in an indication of support for the Palestinian Authority, state media reported Thursday. The agreement was overseen in Cairo by Chinese Ambassador to Egypt Liao Liqiang and Palestinian Ambassador to Egypt Diab al-Louh. 'To ease the humanitarian conditions in the Gaza Strip, the Chinese government has continued to provide assistance to Palestine,' Liao was quoted as saying. The types and quantities of aid to be delivered via Egypt were not given, but China has previously shipped food and medicine to Gaza. China has longstanding ties with the Palestinian Authority but has also sought to strengthen economic and political relations with Israel. Al-Louh 'voiced appreciation for China’s consistent and firm support for the just cause of the Palestinian people and for raising this issue on international occasions,' state media said. UN Security Council to hold emergency meeting on Houthi attacks UNITED NATIONS — The U.N. Security Council will hold an emergency meeting on Monday at Israel’s request to discuss recent attacks by Yemen’s Houthi rebels. Israel’s U.N. Mission said Wednesday the meeting will take place at 10 a.m. Monday. Israeli U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon said he expects the council will condemn the Houthi attacks. He urged the council 'to enforce international law and hold Iran, the Houthis’ patron, accountable.' Alluding to Israeli retaliation for the attacks, Danon said 'It seems that the Houthis have not yet understood what happens to those who try to harm the state of Israel.'	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-syria-lebanon-news-26-december-2024-99eeb805d4350e14cb82c6da989f912a	2024-12-26T04:27:53-08:00	
Turkey's central bank lowers key interest rate to 47.5%	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Turkey’s central bank lowered its key interest rate by 2.5 percentage points to 47.5% on Thursday, carrying out its first rate cut in nearly two years as it tries to control soaring inflation. Citing slowing inflation, the bank’s Monetary Policy Committee said it was reducing its one-week repo rate to 47.5% from the current 50%. The committee said in a statement that the overall inflation trend was 'flat' in November and that indicators suggest it is likely to decline in December. Demand within the country was slowing, helping to reduce inflation, it said. Inflation in Turkey surged in recent years due to declining foreign reserves and President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s unconventional economic policy of lowering rates as a way to tame inflation — which he later abandoned. Inflation stood at 47% in November, after having peaked at 85% in late 2022, although independent economists say the real rate is much higher than the official figures. Most economists argue that higher interest rates help control inflation, but the Turkish leader had fired central bank governors for failing to fall in line with his previous rate-cutting policies. Following a return to more conventional policies under a new economic team, the central bank raised interest rates from 8.5% to 50% between May 2023 and March 2024. The bank had kept rates steady at 50% until Thursday's rate cut. The high inflation has left many households struggling to afford basic goods, such as food and housing.	https://apnews.com/article/turkey-central-bank-interest-rate-cut-ca1b3732bd09724cc50ae688711f24a3	2024-12-26T03:12:19-08:00	
Finland stops Russia-linked vessel over damaged undersea power cable in Baltic Sea	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — Finnish authorities have detained a Russia-linked ship as they investigate whether it damaged a Baltic Sea power cable and several data cables, according to police and news media reports, in the latest incident involving disruption of key infrastructure. Finnish police and border guards boarded the vessel, the Eagle S, early Thursday and took over the command bridge, Helsinki Police Chief Jari Liukku said at a news conference. The vessel was being held in Finnish territorial waters, police said. The Eagle S is flagged in the Cook Islands, but was described by Finnish customs officials as a suspected part of Russia's shadow fleet of fuel tankers, Yle television reported. Those are aging vessels with obscure ownership, acquired to evade Western sanctions amid the war in Ukraine and operating without Western-regulated insurance. The Eagle S anchor is suspected of causing damage to the cable, Yle reported, relying on police statements. The Estlink-2 power cable, which brings electricity from Finland to Estonia across the Baltic Sea, went down on Wednesday. The incident follows damage to two data cables and the Nord Stream gas pipelines, both of which have been termed sabotage. Estonia's government was holding a extraordinary meeting on the issue Thursday, Prime Minister Kristen Michal said on X. Latvian Prime Minister Evika Silina said she was in close touch with Michal and Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo. 'Our armed forces have strengthened surveillance and are monitoring the situation,' she said on X. 'The Baltic states currently have sufficient energy production capacity, although we are challenged by the Baltic Sea cable incidents.' Two data cables — one running between Finland and Germany and the other between Lithuania and Sweden — were severed in November. Germany’s defense minister said that officials had to assume the incident was 'sabotage,' but he didn't provide evidence or say who might have been responsible. The remark came during a speech in which he discussed hybrid warfare threats from Russia. The Nord Stream pipelines that once brought natural gas from Russia to Germany were damaged by underwater explosions in September 2022.

What is known about a plane crash in Kazakhstan that killed 38 of 67 people on board	An Azerbaijani airliner has crashed in Kazakhstan after being diverted, killing 38 of 67 people on board. Some experts alleged that the plane went down after being hit by Russian air defense systems. Some things to know about the crash and the speculation about a possible cause: How did the plane crash? Azerbaijan Airlines’ Embraer 190 was en route from Azerbaijani capital Baku to the Russian city of Grozny in the North Caucasus on Wednesday when it was diverted for reasons that aren't fully clear yet. It crashed while making an attempt to land in Aktau, Kazakhstan, after flying east across the Caspian Sea. The plane went down near the coast about 3 kilometers (around 2 miles) from Aktau. Cellphone footage circulating online appeared to show the aircraft making a steep descent before hitting the ground and exploding in a fireball. Rescuers have rushed 29 people who survived the crash to hospitals. How did Azerbaijan react? Azerbaijan observed a nationwide day of mourning on Thursday. National flags were lowered across the country, traffic across the country stopped at noon, and signals were sounded from ships and trains. Speaking at a news conference Wednesday, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev said that the weather had forced the plane to change from its planned course. What do they say about a possible cause? Kazakhstani, Azerbaijani and Russian authorities say they are investigating the crash. Embraer told The Associated Press in a statement that the company is 'ready to assist all relevant authorities.' Russia’s civil aviation authority, Rosaviatsia, said that preliminary information indicated that the pilots diverted to Aktau after a bird strike led to an emergency on board. Some experts alleged that the holes seen in the plane’s tail section pictured after the crash possibly indicate that it could have come under fire from Russian air defense systems fending off a Ukrainian drone attack. Mark Zee of OPSGroup, which monitors the world’s airspace and airports for risks, said that the analysis of the fragments of the crashed plane indicate with a 90-99% probability that it was hit by a surface-to-air missile Osprey Flight Solutions, an aviation security firm based in the United Kingdom, warned its clients that the 'Azerbaijan Airlines flight was likely shot down by a Russian military air-defense system.' Osprey CEO Andrew Nicholson said that the company had issued more than 200 alerts regarding drone attacks and air defense systems in Russia during the war. In Azerbaijan, Caliber online newpspaper claimed that the airliner was fired upon by a Russian Pantsyr-S air defense system as it was approaching Grozny. It questioned why Russian authorities failed to close the airport despite the drone attack in the area on Wednesday, and why they didn’t allow the plane to land in Grozny or other Russian airports nearby after it was hit. Asked Thursday about the claims that the plane had been fired upon by air defense assets, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that 'it would be wrong to make hypotheses before investigators make their verdict.' Officials in Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan have similarly avoided comment on a possible cause of the crash, saying it will be up to investigators to determine it.	https://apnews.com/article/things-to-know-about-azerbaijan-airlines-crash-1e3ca32f895b577755b5776806e1eda7	2024-12-26T02:35:16-08:00	
Azerbaijan mourns air crash victims as some experts say Russia air defense damaged the plane	Azerbaijan on Thursday observed a nationwide day of mourning for the victims of the plane crash that killed 38 people and left all 29 survivors injured as speculation mounted about a possible cause of the disaster, with some experts saying that the airliner was damaged by Russian air defense fire. Azerbaijan Airlines' Embraer 190 was en route from Azerbaijan's capital of Baku to the Russian city of Grozny in the North Caucasus on Wednesday when it was diverted for reasons yet unclear and crashed while making an attempt to land in Aktau in Kazakhstan after flying east across the Caspian Sea. The plane went down about 3 kilometers (around 2 miles) from Aktau. Cellphone footage circulating online appeared to show the aircraft making a steep descent before smashing into the ground in a fireball. Other footage showed part of its fuselage ripped away from the wings and the rest of the aircraft lying upside down in the grass. As the official crash investigation started, theories abounded about a possible cause, with some experts alleging that holes seen in the plane’s tail section possibly indicate that it could have come under fire from Russian air defense systems fending off a Ukrainian drone attack. Ukrainian drones had previously attacked Grozny, the provincial capital of the Russian republic of Chechnya, and other regions in the country’s North Caucasus. An official in Chechnya said another drone attack on the region was fended off on Wednesday, although federal authorities didn't report it. On Thursday, national flags were lowered across Azerbaijan, traffic across the country stopped at noon, and signals sounded from ships and trains as the country observed a nationwide moment of silence. Speaking at a news conference Wednesday, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev said that it was too soon to speculate on the reasons behind the crash, but said that the weather had forced the plane to change from its planned course. 'The information provided to me is that the plane changed its course between Baku and Grozny due to worsening weather conditions and headed to Aktau airport, where it crashed upon landing,' he said. Russia’s civil aviation authority, Rosaviatsia, said that preliminary information indicated that the pilots diverted to Aktau after a bird strike led to an emergency on board. According to Kazakh officials, those aboard the plane included 42 Azerbaijani citizens, 16 Russian nationals, six Kazakhs and three Kyrgyzstan nationals. Russia's Emergencies Ministry on Thursday flew nine Russian survivors to Moscow for treatment. Mark Zee of OPSGroup, which monitors the world’s airspace and airports for risks, said that the analysis of the images of fragments of the crashed plane indicate that it was almost certainly hit by a surface-to-air missile, or SAM. 'Much more to investigate, but at high level we'd put the probability of it being a SAM attack on the aircraft at being well into the 90-99% bracket,' he said. Osprey Flight Solutions, an aviation security firm based in the United Kingdom, warned its clients that the 'Azerbaijan Airlines flight was likely shot down by a Russian military air-defense system.' Osprey provides analysis for carriers still flying into Russia after Western airlines halted their flights during the war. Osprey CEO Andrew Nicholson said that the company had issued more than 200 alerts regarding drone attacks and air defense systems in Russia during the war. 'This incident is a stark reminder of why we do what we do,' Nicholson wrote online. 'It is painful to know that despite our efforts, lives were lost in a way that could have been avoided.' Caliber, an Azerbaijani news website, claimed that the airliner was fired upon by a Russian Pantsyr-S air defense system as it was approaching Grozny. It questioned why Russian authorities failed to close the airport despite the apparent drone raid in the area. Khamzat Kadyrov, head of Chechnya's Security Council, said that air defenses downed drones attacking the region on Wednesday. Caliber also asked why Russian authorities didn't allow the plane to make an emergency landing in Grozny or other Russian airports nearby after it was hit. Asked about the claims that the plane had been fired upon by air defense assets, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that 'it would be wrong to make hypotheses before investigators make their verdict.' Kazakhstan’s parliamentary Speaker Maulen Ashimbayev also warned against rushing to conclusions based on pictures of the plane’s fragments, describing the allegations of air defense fire as unfounded and 'unethical.' Other officials in Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan have similarly avoided comment on a possible cause of the crash, saying it will be up to investigators to determine it. ___ Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and Aida Sultanova in London, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/azerbaijan-airliner-crash-aktau-kazakstan-embraer-872800d95273ee96e0950192a32e5228	2024-12-26T00:43:12-08:00	
Pope brings Holy Year and prayers for better future to Rome prison, a 'cathedral of pain and hope'	ROME (AP) — Pope Francis inaugurated his Holy Year at Rome’s main prison on Thursday, bringing a message of hope to inmates and involving them in the Catholic Church’s once every quarter-century celebration that is expected to bring about 32 million pilgrims to Rome. Francis stood up from his wheelchair, knocked on the door to the chapel at Rebibbia prison and walked across the threshold, reenacting the gesture he performed at the Holy Door of St. Peter’s Basilica two nights earlier on Christmas Eve. The opening of the Holy Door at the basilica officially kicked off the Jubilee year, a church tradition dating to 1300 that nowadays occurs every 25 years and involves the faithful coming to Rome on pilgrimages. 'The first Holy Door I opened at Christmas in St. Peter's. I wanted the second one to be here, in a prison,' Francis told the Rebibbia inmates before he entered. 'I wanted each of us here, inside and out, to have the possibility of throwing open the door of our hearts and understanding that hope doesn't disappoint.' Francis dedicated the 2025 Jubilee to hope and made clear that prisoners would be an important part of it: The final grand event of the Jubilee is a special Mass for inmates at St. Peter's on Dec. 14, 2025. Francis has long made prison ministry an important part of his priestly vocation and has made several visits to Rebibbia since becoming pope in 2013 while also including prison visits in many of his foreign trips. His message is always one of hope, believing that people who are serving prison sentences need something to look forward to more than most. That is especially true in Italy, where prison overcrowding and inmate suicides are at record highs, according to the Antigone Association, which tracks prison conditions. According to Antigone's 2024 report, 88 prisoners killed themselves in Italian lockups this year — more than any other year — and Italy's inmate population was 132% over the system's capacity. In a statement Thursday, Antigone called on Italian authorities to hear Francis' appeal to give prisoners hope. It called for structural reforms that put into practice the constitutional principles of 'a punishment that is dignified, humane and looks to the social reintegration of those who are in prison.' In his homily, Francis suggested the prisoners think of hope as an anchor that is fixed on the ground and that they try to hold tight to the rope that is attached to it, even if it sometimes hurts their hands. 'Hold onto the rope of hope, hold onto the anchor,' Francis said. 'Never let it go.' Speaking to reporters outside, Francis recalled that whenever he speaks to prisoners, the first thing he always asks himself is 'why them and not me.' 'Because we all can fall, the important thing is to not lose hope, to hold onto that anchor of hope,' he said. Back at the Vatican for his noon blessing, Francis called prison 'a cathedral of pain and hope' as he repeated his message. He also doubled down on his 2025 wish for peace in the world and for wealthy countries to reduce or eliminate the debt owed by poorer countries. 'One of the things that characterizes Jubilees is the remission of debts,' Francis said, calling the debts owed by many poor countries simply 'unsustainable.' Francis’ outing to Rebibbia on a frigid morning was his final big event of the week after he celebrated Christmas Eve Mass on Tuesday evening at St. Peter’s Basilica and delivered his Christmas Day blessing from the loggia overlooking the square. The 88-year-old pope, who often suffers from respiratory infections in winter, has a few days to rest before gearing up for the New Year’s Eve vigil and Mass the following day. With the St. Peter’s Holy Door now open to the public, a steady stream of pilgrims was filing into the basilica, a pace that is expected to continue through next year until the door closes on Jan. 6, 2026. Francis’ 2025 involves a dizzying calendar of Jubilee events that will sorely test his stamina, with special Jubilee Masses for all the main groups of pilgrims who are being celebrated during the year: Adolescents, migrants, teachers and law enforcement, among others. So far, he has only one foreign trip under study: A May visit to Turkey to commemorate the 1,700th anniversary of the Council of Nicaea, Christianity’s first ecumenical council. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Chinese automaker BYD slams reports of poor conditions at a factory site in Brazil	BANGKOK (AP) — A spokesperson for Chinese automaker BYD has objected to reports about poor conditions at a construction site in Brazil where it is building a factory, saying the allegations were aimed at 'smearing' China and Chinese brands. Earlier in the week, a task force led by Brazilian prosecutors said it had rescued 163 Chinese nationals it said were working in 'slavery-like' conditions at the site. A video from the Labor Prosecutor’s Office of dorms housing the workers showed beds with no mattresses and rudimentary cooking facilities. A BYD spokesperson, Li Yunfei, vehemently objected in a statement posted Thursday on his Weibo social media site. 'In the matter of smearing Chinese brands, smearing China, and attempting to undermine the friendship between China and Brazil, we have seen how relevant foreign forces maliciously associate and deliberately smear,' it said, also criticizing media reports about the situation. BYD, which stands for Build Your Dreams, is one of the world’s largest producers of electric cars. The company said on Monday night that it would 'immediately terminate the contract' with a contractor building the factory, the Jinjiang Group, and was 'studying other appropriate measures.' BYD said that the Jinjiang workers would be housed in nearby hotels for the time being, and would not suffer from the decision to stop work at the site. The company said that over the past few weeks it had been changing working conditions at the construction site and had told its contractors that 'adjustments' had to be made. Prosecutors said the sanitary situation at BYD’s site was especially bad, with only one toilet for every 31 workers, forcing them to wake up at 4 a.m. to line up to be ready to leave for work at 5:30 a.m. Under Brazilian law, slavery-like conditions are characterized by submission to forced labor or exhausting working hours, subjection to degrading working conditions and restriction of the worker’s freedom of movement. Jinjiang Construction Brazil, based in Camacari, said in a statement that it had been 'frequently and intensively inspected by the local labor department in Brazil.' It said that due to cultural differences, problems with translation and understanding, 'much of the information released by the labor department was inaccurate, especially statements saying the Jinjiang workers were ‘enslaved’ and ‘rescued,’ which is completely inconsistent with the facts.' It said its workers were willing to speak with media about the situation. Apart from living conditions for the workers, Brazilian officials said Jinjiang Construction Brazil had confiscated their passports and withheld 60% of their wages. Those who quit would be forced to pay the company for their airfare from China, and for their return ticket, the labor office said in a statement. Living conditions for migrant construction workers can be quite spartan in many parts of the developing world, and such labor often involves contracts that require workers to pay back large sums of money used to secure the jobs, despite laws prohibiting such arrangements. ___ AP researcher Yu Bing contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/china-brazil-byd-labor-autos-e45ed5a620896b321388361bf92f77c7	2024-12-25T22:46:04-08:00	
South Korean opposition submits motion to impeach the country's acting president as strife deepens	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s main opposition party submitted a motion on Thursday to impeach the country’s acting leader over his reluctance to fill three Constitutional Court vacancies ahead of the court’s review of rebellion charges against impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol stemming from his short-lived martial law decree on Dec. 3. The court appointments have stalled amid an intensifying dispute between the liberal opposition and Yoon’s conservative party, and the potential impeachment of Prime Minister Han Duck-soo may deepen the political paralysis that has halted high-level diplomacy and rattled financial markets. The opposition-controlled National Assembly also passed motions calling for the appointment of three Constitutional Court justices as the court prepares to start deliberations on whether to dismiss or reinstate Yoon. The vote came shortly after Han reiterated in a televised statement that he wouldn’t appoint the justices without bipartisan consent. National Assembly Speaker Woo Won Shik urged Han to swiftly appoint the justices, saying that his calls for bipartisan consent essentially amounted to a refusal and 'infringes on the National Assembly’s right to select Constitutional Court justices.' Yoon’s People Power Party, whose members mostly boycotted the National Assembly vote, argued that Han shouldn’t exercise presidential authority to appoint the proposed justices while Yoon has yet to be formally removed from office. The main opposition Democratic Party has accused the conservatives of undermining the court process to save Yoon’s presidency, and its motion to impeach Han could go to a floor vote as early as Friday. The Democrats’ floor leader, Park Chan-dae, said Han’s comments showed 'he lacks both the qualifications to serve as the acting leader and the will to uphold the Constitution.' Yoon’s presidential powers were suspended after the National Assembly voted to impeach him on Dec. 14 over an attempted power grab that lasted only hours but has triggered weeks of political turmoil that has shaken one of Asia’s most robust democracies. To formally end Yoon’s presidency, at least six justices on the nine-member Constitutional Court must vote in favor. Three seats remain vacant following retirements and a full bench could make conviction more likely. The court, which is to hold a pretrial hearing in Yoon’s case on Friday, has said it believes the acting president can exercise the right to appoint justices. Three of the court’s nine justices are directly appointed by the president. Three are nominated by the head of the Supreme Court and three by the National Assembly, and they are then formally appointed by the president in what is widely considered a procedural matter. The three seats that are currently open are to be nominated by lawmakers. South Korea’s Constitution states that the National Assembly 'selects' three spots on the court rather than recommends, suggesting that the presidential appointments for these spots are a formality rather than a substantive authority, according to some legal experts. 'The consistent spirit reflected in our Constitution and laws is that an acting president should focus on maintaining stability in governance to help the country overcome crisis while refraining from exercising significant powers exclusive to the president, including appointments to constitutional institutions,' Han said. 'I will withhold the appointment of Constitutional Court justices until the ruling and opposition parties submit an agreed-upon proposal.' Han has also clashed with the Democrats over his vetoes of bills calling for independent investigations of Yoon and corruption allegations involving his wife, Kim Keon Hee. If Han is impeached, Choi Sang-mok, the country’s deputy prime minister and finance minister, is next in line. The impeachment vote against Han could face legal ambiguities. Most South Korean officials can be impeached with a simple majority of the National Assembly, but impeaching presidents requires two-thirds. The rival parties differ on which standard should apply to an acting president. The Democratic Party controls 170 of the National Assembly’s 300 seats, so it would need support from members of other parties including Yoon’s own to get a two-thirds majority. While focusing on defending himself in the Constitutional Court, Yoon has dodged several requests by law enforcement authorities to appear for questioning over rebellion charges and also blocked searches of his office. Authorities have already arrested Yoon’s defense minister, police chief and several other military commanders involved in the attempt to implement martial law, which harkened back to the days of authoritarian leaders the country hasn’t seen since the 1980s. In a news conference in Seoul, Yoo Seung Soo, lawyer for former Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun, repeated Yoon’s claim that his martial law decree was to 'sound alarm against ... political abuse' by an opposition that has bogged down his agenda, and did not amount to a rebellion.	https://apnews.com/article/korea-yoon-martial-law-han-constitutional-court-f473b8a613a87732ee03ac37c39c79f0	2024-12-25T21:55:02-08:00	
Israeli strike kills 5 Palestinian journalists in Gaza, officials say	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — An Israeli strike killed five Palestinian journalists outside a hospital in the Gaza Strip overnight, the Health Ministry said early Thursday. The Israeli military said it had targeted a group of militants. The strike hit a car outside the Al-Awda Hospital in the built-up Nuseirat refugee camp in the central part of the territory. The journalists were working for the local Quds News Network, which also reported the strike. The military said it targeted a group of fighters from Islamic Jihad, a militant group allied with Hamas, whose Oct. 7, 2023 attack into southern Israel ignited the war. The Committee to Protect Journalists says over 130 Palestinian reporters have been killed since the start of the war. Israel has not allowed foreign reporters to enter Gaza except on military embeds. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed across the border in a surprise attack on nearby army bases and farming communities. They killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel's air and ground offensive has killed over 45,000 Palestinians, according to the Health Ministry. It says more than half the fatalities have been women and children but does not say how many of the dead were fighters. The offensive has caused widespread destruction and driven around 90% of the population of 2.3 million from their. homes. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps along the coast, with little protection from the cold, wet winter. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-lebanon-hezbollah-iran-news-12-26-2024-2e8c33648410c2da94ae7d0d73c0b1a1	2024-12-25T21:34:41-08:00	
Japan Airlines was hit by a cyberattack, delaying flights during the year-end holiday season	TOKYO (AP) — Japan Airlines said it was hit by a cyberattack Thursday, causing delays to more than 20 domestic flights but the carrier said it was able to stop the onslaught and restore its systems hours later. There was no impact on flight safety, it said. JAL said the problem started Thursday morning when the company's network connecting internal and external systems began malfunctioning. The airline said it was able to identify the cause as an attack intended to overwhelm the network system with massive transmissions of data. Such attacks flood a system or network with traffic until the target cannot respond or crashes. The attack did not involve a virus or cause any customer data leaks, JAL said. It said that as of late morning, the cyberattack had delayed 24 domestic flights for more than 30 minutes. Experts have repeatedly raised concerns about the vulnerability of Japan's cybersecurity, especially as the country steps up its defense capabilities and works more closely with the United States and other partners with much tighter cyber defenses. Japan has taken steps but experts say more work is needed. In June, Japan's space agency said it had suffered a series of cyberattacks since 2023, though sensitive information related to rockets, satellites and defense was not affected. It was investigating to take preventive measures. Last year, a cyberattack paralyzed operations at a container terminal at a port in the city of Nagoya for three days. JAL's ticket sales for both domestic and international fights scheduled for departure on Thursday were suspended temporarily but resumed several hours later. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told a regular news conference Thursday that the transport ministry told JAL to hasten efforts to restore the system and to accommodate affected passengers. Other Japanese airlines, including ANA Holdings, Skymark and Starflyer, were not affected. Television footage showed many passengers at Tokyo's Haneda airport crowded into its terminals as the attack hit the year-end holiday travel season. Offices will close from this weekend for the New Year holidays, the biggest celebration of the year, when millions of people travel back to their hometowns from the cities.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-jal-cyberattack-flights-travel-04fbd4848f3015a77057339a5c90ca32	2024-12-25T20:17:53-08:00	
Israel's plan to double the number of settlers in the Golan Heights is met with conflicting emotions	EIN ZIVAN, Golan Heights (AP) — A dry mountain wind whipped through a cluster of Israeli flags at the entrance of a kibbutz in the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights, where the tranquility belies the tumultuous events unfolding nearby. Earlier this month, Syrian President Bashar Assad was ousted after nearly 25 years in power. Within hours, Israeli tanks rolled past a razor wire-reinforced fence into the Golan's demilitarized buffer zone in Syria, created as part of a 1974 ceasefire between the countries. Israel said it was a temporary move to secure its border. Days later, the Israeli government approved Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s $11 million plan of financial incentives to double the population of Israeli settlers in the Golan Heights, which Israel seized from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war. Israel will 'continue to hold onto it, make it flourish and settle it,' Netanyahu said. The international community, with one exception, considers the Golan to be occupied Syrian territory, while the United Nations lists Israeli settlements there as illegal. In 2019, the United States became the only country to recognize Israel’s 1981 annexation. About 50,000 people currently live there, roughly half of them Israeli settlers and the other half Arab Druze, a religious minority spread among Syria, Lebanon, Israel and the Golan Heights. In the towns and kibbutzim of the Golan, news of the plan to increase the number of settlers was met with a mixture of skepticism, excitement and shock. Too much growth, too fast? Paul Hecht, who at 42 has lived in the Golan nearly all his life, greeted the news with 'mixed emotions, to be honest, because I love the Golan Heights the way it is. I'm kind of afraid that the place will be overpopulated but at the same time, of course, I want the place to advance.' The attraction is the rural way of life, the open spaces and the mountains, he explained. Doubling the population 'sounds a bit extreme,' especially if attempted in a short time frame, he said, noting the region needs infrastructure improvements — notably to roads — for its existing population before more people are brought in. The Golan's economy relies heavily on farming and the hospitality industry. Previous government attempts to attract more settlers have had little success — in large part because of a lack of job opportunities and the long distance from major cities. A well-publicized move in 2019 to name a Golan settlement after then-U.S. President Donald Trump failed to attract a major influx of residents. But Hecht said he believed more Israelis could be tempted by a life in the Golan after Assad's fall. 'I think that will that will bring in a lot more people who want to come and live in the Golan Heights because of the sense of security that people will have here,' he said. 'And obviously the best view and the best nature in Israel.' The dream of a rural lifestyle One such new settler could be Shlomo Benhaim, 60, who has been thinking of moving to the Golan for years. 'It’s my dream. If I will fulfill it, who knows,' he said during a day trip with his wife to Ein Zivan, a kibbutz about two kilometers (1.2 miles) from the Syrian buffer zone. One of the oldest kibbutzim dating from the late 1960s, Ein Zivan has barely 500 residents today. 'I love the Golan. It’s a unique area in Israel, very unique, with a lot of history, archaeology, modern history, a lot of memories,' he said. But moving wouldn’t be easy. The area is popular with mainly Israeli tourists who come for the mountains and outdoor activities, but it's a roughly three-hour drive from urban centers with well-paying jobs like Tel Aviv. On the other hand, there’s also a good education system and no traffic jams. 'There’s a lot of benefit to (life) in the Golan, and also a lot of negative things,' he said. In nearby Kibbutz Merom Golan, hotel manager Shefi Mod said that with tax breaks and cheap land, 'I think the support of the government indeed can help people to come and live here.' Mod first came to the area as a soldier decades ago and liked it so much he moved here. But whether others will be tempted to follow suit is still unclear. Concern among the Druze Many Golan Heights Druze consider themselves Syrians under occupation. While Israeli citizenship is open to them, most have not taken it and have Israeli residency permits instead. They have a complicated relationship with Israel. 'Whatever this government wants to do, it won’t ask our permission,' said Khaled Elshaer, a restaurant owner in the Druze village of Masada. The plan to double the number of settlers left him 'numb and shocked,' he said. He considers the Golan to be Syrian. But asked if he wanted it to be a part of Syria, he said no. 'I feel Golani. Neither Israeli nor Syrian,' he said. 'We are connected to the land, not to who will be president over it.' Local surgeon Ali Abu Awad stressed that the Golan Heights are 'an essential part of Syria,' and noted most of the local population with university degrees, including himself, had studied there. He accused the Israeli government of apartheid-like discrimination against religious minorities, including his own, and said there was clear discrimination in access to higher education and preferential treatment to Jewish citizens of Israel. The country's Arab citizens often suffer from discrimination, despite official guarantees of equal civil rights. Abu Awad was dismissive of the government's plan to double the number of settlers. 'They can say what they want,' he said. 'But until now, they have said this before and they have failed.'	https://apnews.com/article/israel-syria-golan-heights-expansion-netanyahu-41341a9598e44afbdad77f1683c2407e	2024-12-25T20:05:03-08:00	
A Syrian family recounts the horrors of the 2013 chemical attack near Damascus	ZAMALKA, Syria (AP) — A Syrian family that survived a 2013 chemical weapons attack that killed hundreds of people near the country’s capital, Damascus, says the ordeal they experienced haunts them to this day. The Aug. 21, 2013 attack targeted several Damascus suburbs, including Zamalka, where the Arbeeni family lives. Government forces of then-President Bashar Assad were blamed for the attack. The Arbeenis remember how they locked themselves inside a windowless room in their home for hours, escaping the fate of dozens of their neighbors who perished in what was one of the deadliest moments of Syria’s civil war. The gas that was used — sarin, an extremely toxic nerve agent — can kill in minutes. The Syrian government denied it was behind the attack and blamed opposition fighters, an accusation the opposition rejected as Assad's forces were the only side in the brutal civil war to posses sarin. The United States subsequently threatened military retaliation, with then-President Barack Obama saying Assad’s use of chemical weapons would be Washington’s 'red line.' 'It was a horrifying night,' Hussein Arbeeni, 41, told The Associated Press on Wednesday. The surface-to-surface missiles fell close to his family’s home without exploding, instead leaking the poisonous gas. Shortly after that, he says the family members had difficulties breathing, their eyes started to ache and they hearts beat faster and faster. Arbeeni, his parents, his siblings and their families, as well as a neighbor — 23 people in all — rushed into the only room in their home without windows and closed the door. He says he taped all around the door, soaked some clothes in water and rolled them up under the door to prevent the gas from coming in. 'I even taped the key hole,' he said. A few months earlier, Arbeeni said, the local first responders of the Syrian Civil Defense, also known as White Helmets, had instructed residents in the opposition-held suburbs of Damascus what to do in case of a chemical attack. He remembers them saying they should cover their nose and mouth with a cloth soaked in water with white vinegar, and breathe through that. They huddled for three hours inside the room — time that seemed endless that night. Outside, many people were dying. 'It is all because of God and this locked room,' Arbeeni says of their survival. Around daybreak, the White Helmets members rushed into their house, found the family inside the room on the ground floor and told them to leave the area immediately. They ran into the street and saw dead bodies lying all around. A passing truck took the family on and gave them a ride. Their neighbor, who had fainted from the shock of the horrific scene, was taken away by paramedics. 'I was scared to look,' said Arbeeni’s mother, Khadija Dabbas, 66. The family stayed for a few weeks some miles away from Zamalka but then came back. Despite Obama's threat, in the end, Washington settled for a deal with Moscow for Russia-backed Assad to give up his chemical weapons’ stockpile. But Assad's government was widely believed to have kept some of the weapons and was accused of using them again — including a 2018 chlorine gas attack over Douma, another Damascus suburb, that killed 43 people. Today, Arbeeni — remembering all the neighbors, friends and townspeople who perished — says he wants the 'harshest punishment' for those behind the attack in Zamalka. 'All those children and innocent people who were killed should get justice,' he said, looking at his 12-year-old son, Laith, a baby at the time of the attack. The new authorities in Syria are led by the jihadi group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, which late last month launched a stunning offensive from its northwestern stronghold that blitzed across large swaths of Syria and toppled Assad. They have vowed to bring to justice former Syrian government officials blamed for atrocities. But times are still unsettled — a few short weeks after Assad's ouster, no one knows what Syria's future will look like. 'The overthrow of the Assad government creates the possibility of justice for thousands of victims of atrocities, including those killed by chemical and other banned weapons,' says Adam Coogle, deputy director with the Middle East and North Africa division at Human Rights Watch. 'But justice will only happen if the new authorities prioritize it and urgently act to preserve evidence,' Coogle added. He urged for immediate access for U.N. agencies and international experts who would create a comprehensive plan to ensure that Syrians can seek justice and accountability. On Wednesday, about a dozen people visited the Martyrs Cemetery in Zamalka and the graves of people from the area killed during Syria's nearly 14-year war. Arbeeni's brother, Hassan, pointed to part of the cemetery that holds a mass grave. There are no names of the dead there, only a sign in Arabic that reads: 'August 2013.' 'The martyrs of the chemical attack are here,' Hassan said, and recited a Muslim prayer for the dead.	https://apnews.com/article/syria-chemical-weapons-attack-ghouta-assad-b16e04b72adbfc86334db1e872adcf6d	2024-12-25T19:54:21-08:00	
A survivor of the worst gang attack on Haitian journalists says colleagues were cut down by bullets	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — A survivor of the worst gang attack on Haitian journalists in recent memory described Wednesday seeing colleagues cut down by bullets and reporters with head and chest wounds going an hour or more without help. Two reporters and one police officer died in Tuesday's attack at the reopening of Port-au-Prince's biggest public hospital. Seven journalists covering the event were wounded. 'Some were hit in the chest,' photographer Jean Fregens Regala recalled. 'Some of the journalists had part of their face destroyed, some were shot in the mouth, or the head.' Members of the Viv Ansanm coalition of street gangs, which has taken control of much of Port-au-Prince, had surrounded the hospital and opened fire through a metal gate. The gangs later said they were angry the government had announced the re-opening of the hospital without their permission. Video from inside at the time of the attack shows a metal gate outside the hospital buckling under a hail of gunfire, as reporters scrambled to try to get inside the building. 'All the journalists started moving to go inside the hospital because we heard that the gunfire was getting close to us,' recalled Regala. 'I was hiding behind by the gate to put myself somewhere safe but other journalists were rushing to go inside the hospital and there was non-stop shooting.' Regala survived only because he remained sheltered behind a concrete guardhouse next to the gate. 'If I had rushed and ran, or ran inside the hospital to hide, I am sure I would among the victims.' 'We began calling for help, for just aid, for the victims that were bleeding heavily,' he said. 'There was no doctor or nurse around.' 'While the hospital was about to reopen, it had no medical supplies available for giving first aid to the journalist victims and the other victims,' Regala said, adding that since they couldn't find any gloves they used plastic bags on their hands as substitutes. Nor did the health minister show up. The area is so dangerous that when police finally responded to the journalists' calls for help after about two hours, they had to come in with a ladder over a wall from the nearby National Police because the gangs controlled most of the streets. 'These people spent more than an hour losing blood,' Regala said. The Haitian Association of Journalists issued a statement Tuesday calling on the country's barely functioning government not to put the lives of reporters — or the public — at risk with such events. The association called for 'authorities to act prudently in their rush to make decisions, to avoid exposing to danger the journalists and others who accompany them at their events.' Regala said it was clear as soon as they arrived that the area around the hospital was unsafe. 'The fact that the minister of health invited us, you feel that preparations have been made already,' he said. 'When we made contact with a police unit, the police told us, they were not aware of the event, of the reopening of the hospital.' The government had no immediate response to the complaints. Meanwhile, the seven wounded journalists were taken to another hospital. 'I send my sympathies to the people who were victims, the national police and the journalists,' Haiti’s interim president, Leslie Voltaire, said in an address to the nation Tuesday. Street gangs have taken over an estimated 85% of Port-au-Prince and have also targeted the main international airport and Haiti’s two largest prisons. Johnson 'Izo' André, considered Haiti’s most powerful gang leader and part of the Viv Ansanm group of gangs, posted a video on social media Tuesday claiming responsibility for the attack. The video said the gang coalition had not authorized the hospital’s reopening. Haiti has seen journalists targeted before. In 2023, two local journalists were killed in the space of a couple of weeks — radio reporter Dumesky Kersaint was fatally shot in mid-April that year, while journalist Ricot Jean was found dead later that month. In July, former Prime Minister Garry Conille visited the Hospital of the State University of Haiti, more widely known as the General Hospital, after authorities regained control of it from gangs. The hospital had been left ravaged and strewn with debris. Walls and nearby buildings were riddled with bullet holes, signaling fights between police and gangs. On Tuesday, Regala said workers were only just painting and cleaning the hospital. Gang attacks have pushed Haiti’s health system to the brink of collapse, looting, setting fires and destroying medical institutions and pharmacies in the capital. The violence has created a surge in patients and a shortage of resources to treat them. Regala said he will ignore his family's pleas to get out of journalism. 'The work needs to continue, to make sure the population is kept informed,' he said. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/haiti-gang-violence-capital-journalists-ab0c6a3797baa5882e04c0aea00ee74d	2024-12-25T19:53:33-08:00	
Stock market today: Asian shares are mostly higher in thin post-Christmas holiday trading	BANGKOK (AP) — Asian shares were mostly higher Thursday in thin post-Christmas holiday trading, while oil prices rose. Japan's Nikkei 225 index surged 0.8% to 39,449.55, on strong gains in retailers and tourism-related stocks after Japan agreed to ease visa conditions for Chinese tourists. Isetan Mitsukoshi Holdings, a major department store group, gained 7%. J. Front Retailing Co., owner of the Matsuzakaya and Daimaru department store groups, jumped 8.8%. Automakers also saw large gains. China and Japan also agreed Wednesday to conduct talks on contentious security issues and other sources of friction during a visit by Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya to Beijing, where he met with Chinese Premier Li Qiang and Foreign Minister Wang Yi. South Korea's Kospi slipped less than 0.1% to 2,438.85, while the Taiex in Taiwan gained 0.2%. The Shanghai Composite index edged less than 0.1% higher, to 3,395.41. Thailand's SET was up 0.1%. Markets were closed Thursday in Hong Kong, Australia, New Zealand and Indonesia. U.S. markets were closed on Wednesday and will reopen Thursday, when an update on U.S. unemployment benefits is due. Gains in Big Tech stocks contributed to a 'Santa rally' for Tuesday’s shortened holiday session. The S&amp;P 500 gained 1.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.9%. The Nasdaq composite climbed 1.3%. Also early Thursday, U.S. benchmark crude oil was up 27 cents at $70.37 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, picked up 24 cents to $73.31 per barrel. The dollar rose to 157.43 Japanese yen from 157.19 yen. The euro fell to $1.0401 from $1.0410. Tuesday’s U.S. market rally was in line with what's historically been a very cheerful season. The last five trading days of each year, plus the first two in the new year, have brought an average gain of 1.3% since 1950. So far this month, the U.S. stock market has lost some of its gains since President-elect Donald Trump’s win on Election Day, which raised hopes for faster economic growth and more lax regulations that would boost corporate profits. Worries have risen that Trump’s preference for tariffs and other policies could lead to higher inflation, a bigger U.S. government debt and difficulties for global trade. Even so, the U.S. market remains on pace to deliver strong returns for 2024. The benchmark S&amp;P 500 is up 26.6% so far this year and remains within roughly 1% of the all-time high it set earlier this month — its latest of 57 record highs this year.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-rates-china-24b017b95f02f3b06616a7cb30ef5a10	2024-12-25T19:50:47-08:00	
Heat wave leads to warnings of potentially devastating wildfires in southern Australia	NEWCASTLE, Australia (AP) — Communities and firefighters across Australia’s second-most populous state were preparing Thursday for potentially devastating wild fires as a heat wave fanned by erratic winds presented the worst fire conditions in several years. With temperatures in Victoria state reaching 37 degrees Celsius (99 degrees Fahrenheit) and with wind changes expected throughout the day, fire chiefs have issued stark warnings to rural communities to delay travel or leave their homes and seek safety at shelters. Several fires are currently burning out of control across the state and Victoria deputy premier Ben Carroll said the possibility for further fires in the coming days was likely. 'Dangerous fire conditions are forming today and will go right through to Saturday,' he said at a press conference in Melbourne. 'New fires can start anywhere and become dangerous very quickly. The largest uncontained fire is located in the Grampians National Park and has burnt through 55,000 hectares so far, but no homes have reported to have been lost. However, Emergency Management Commissioner Rick Nugent said there were many residential properties on the fringes of the fire that could come under threat. 'I wouldn’t be surprised at some point if we do have residential losses,' Nugent said. 'Firefighters, I can say, are doing everything possible to protect life and protect property.' An emergency warning was issued by fire authorities for the small town of Mafeking, 260 kilometers (160 miles) west of Melbourne, on Thursday. Residents there were told 'you are in danger and need to act immediately to survive. The safest option is to take shelter indoors immediately, as it is too late to leave.' The Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported around 100 personnel from other Australian states are now in Victoria to assist local firefighters battling the blazes. Firefighters are being assisted by scores of water-bombing aircraft. Parts of neighboring South Australia and New South Wales states are also on high alert due to the heat wave and elevated fire risks. The hot, dry conditions are being compared to the Black Summer fires that gripped Australia's two most populous states for months in 2019-20 and burned through 104 thousand square kilometers, an area roughly the size of Ohio, and destroyed thousands of homes and killed 33 people.	https://apnews.com/article/wild-fires-australia-victoria-d3ffa3454c942eb5d29b618e702c4373	2024-12-25T19:30:27-08:00	
This Somali migrant watched others around her die at sea. But she wants to try again for Europe	MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) — Idil Abdullahi Goley’s journey seeking a better life in Europe started in Somalia with a $6,500 payment to local smugglers. It ended a month later with fellow migrants around her dying at sea, one of them screaming and reciting the Muslim profession of faith. The deaths of 25 migrants last month in boats off the Indian Ocean island of Madagascar brought to light yet another route that some in Africa are taking in dangerous bids for Europe. Goley was one of the 48 people rescued. She spoke to The Associated Press about the journey that thousands of Somalis embark on every year as extremist attacks and climate shocks destroy hopes and livelihoods at home. Some Somalis head for the Gulf countries via the Red Sea and Yemen. Others, like Goley, gamble on a longer sea voyage south, toward the French island territory of Mayotte in the Indian Ocean, the poorest territory in the European Union. Somalis are among an estimated 100,000 migrants living in Mayotte, according to French authorities. The migrants are part of communities affected after Cyclone Chido leveled entire neighborhoods on Dec.14. The International Organization for Migration has estimated that two million people migrated from Somalia in 2021 in search of work, the latest data available. The 28-year-old Goley heard about the smugglers from friends who had traveled the route and raised the $6,500 fee from her small teashop business in the capital, Mogadishu, and from her brother and mother. She hoped to reach Europe and pay them back. She left her three small children behind. Her journey began with a flight from Mogadishu to Kenya's capital, Nairobi. Then she and others took a bus to the port city of Mombasa, where they set off in fishing boats for Mayotte, more than 620 miles (997 kilometers) away. They hoped to request asylum there. After three days at sea, the group of about 70 migrants was transferred to smaller boats whose engines started to fail. The smugglers said they would fix the engines and left with them on another boat, leaving the migrants drifting without water and food. They started catching fish and collecting rainwater to survive. It was nearly cyclone season, and waves were choppy. Goley said she tried to save the life of an infant whose mother was also on board but struggling. 'But she died right in front of me. We couldn’t hold onto her body for long and had to throw it into the sea to prevent it from decomposing, as more people perished around us,' she said. During 13 days of hunger, thirst and heat, Goley’s two friends also died. She held one in her lap as she passed. 'The other screamed for help. I couldn’t help her and she died shortly after, crying out loudly, reciting the Shahada,' Goley said. 'That is an image I will never forget, the suffering and helplessness we felt.' She said the ordeal ended when a fishing boat appeared on the horizon and the survivors waved for help. They offered the fishermen $100 for their rescue and were taken to a sports facility in Nosy Be in northern Madagascar. The migrants were repatriated in early December by chartered plane. Back home, Goley's mother had feared for the worst. Unable to eat, she had lost 20 kilograms (44 pounds). 'When I returned home, my mother couldn’t believe it until she heard my voice and saw me in person,' Goley said. As she and the other survivors arrived in Mogadishu, the Somali president’s special envoy on refugee affairs expressed hope for their future and said the government would help. 'They assured me they will never take the same risk again,' Maryan Yasin said. But Goley said she plans to attempt another journey on the same route, despite having nightmares about her ordeal. The hardships in Somalia are still the same, she said — and she did pay the smugglers' fee. 'Even if it leads me to prison, I believe I’d still find a better life than the one I have here,' she said. Her mother, meanwhile, fears this time she will never return. Other survivors are undecided as they mourn. Ahmed Hussein Mahadalle, 26, had watched helplessly as his sister Hanan, 21, died. Nothing compares to the pain of it, he said. His other sister, Haboon Hussein Mahadalle, was grateful for her brother's safe return, though he also has plans to try again. 'Hanan was courageous and vigilant. She met her fate with grace,' Haboon said, in tears. 'They say good people don’t stay long, and my sister embodied all the qualities I can’t begin to summarize.' ___ The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

Prayers and tears mark 20 years since the Indian Ocean tsunami that killed some 230,000 people	BANDA ACEH, Indonesia (AP) — People gathered in prayer and visited mass graves in Indonesia’s Aceh province on Thursday to mark 20 years since the massive Indian Ocean tsunami hit the region in one of modern history’s worst natural disasters. Many wept as they placed flowers at a mass grave in Ulee Lheue village, where more than 14,000 unidentified tsunami victims are buried. It is one of several mass graves in Banda Aceh, the capital of Indonesia’s northernmost province, which was one of the areas worst hit by a magnitude 9.1 earthquake and the massive tsunami it triggered. 'We miss them and we still don’t know where they are. All we know is that every year we visit the mass grave in Ulee Lhue and Siron,' said Muhamad Amirudin, who lost two of his children 20 years ago and has never found their bodies. 'This life is only temporary, so we do our best to be useful to others,' Amirudin, visiting the grave with his wife, said. The powerful earthquake off the coast of the Indonesian island of Sumatra on Dec. 26, 2004, triggered a tsunami that killed around 230,000 people across a dozen countries, reaching as far as East Africa. Some 1.7 million people were displaced, mostly in the four worst-affected countries: Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India and Thailand. More than 170,000 people died in Indonesia alone. Even though 20 years have passed, survivors in Indonesia are still grieving the loved ones they lost to the giant wave that flattened buildings all the way to the provincial capital of Banda Aceh. Hundreds of people gathered to pray at the Baiturrahman Mosque in downtown Banda Aceh. Sirens sounded across the city for three minutes to mark the time of the earthquake. Infrastructure in Aceh has been rebuilt and is now more resilient than before the tsunami struck. Early warning systems have been installed in coastal areas to alert residents of incoming tsunamis, providing crucial time to seek safety. The rebuilding efforts were made possible by the support of international donors and organizations, which contributed significant funds to help the region recover. Schools, hospitals, and essential infrastructure destroyed by the disaster have been reconstructed. In Thailand, people gathered at a memorial ceremony in Ban Nam Khem, a small fishing village in Phang Nga province that bore the brunt of the devastating wave in the country. The tsunami claimed the lives of over 8,000 people in Thailand, including many who remain missing, leaving a deep scar in the nation’s history. Nearly 400 bodies remain unclaimed. Mourners shed tears and comforted each other as they laid flowers at the village’s tsunami memorial. Around 300 people joined a modest ceremony with Muslim, Christian and Buddhist prayers. Urai Sirisuk said she avoids the seaside memorial park the rest of the year because the loss of her 4-year-old daughter still cuts deep every time she's reminded of it. 'I have this feeling that the sea has taken my child. I’m very angry with it. I can’t even put my foot in the water,' she said. But, she said, 'I still hear her voice in my ears, that she’s calling for me. I can’t abandon her. So I have to be here, for my child.' In India, hundreds gathered at Marina beach in the southern city of Chennai in Tamil Nadu state. They poured milk into the sea to propitiate gods and offered flowers and prayers for the dead as drums beat in the background. According to official data, 10,749 people were killed in India, including nearly 7,000 people in Tamil Nadu alone. 'It has been 20 years since the tsunami,' said 69-year-old Sadayammal, who uses one name. 'We are here to pay respects to the people who lost their lives.' In Sri Lanka, survivors and relatives of tsunami victims gathered at the coastal village of Pereliya and laid flowers at a memorial that commemorates nearly 2,000 passengers who died when their train, the Queen of the Sea, was hit by the wave. Only a few dozen people are believed to have survived. Anura Ranjith joined the mourners to pay respects to his younger sister, Anula Ranjani, and her 9-year-old daughter who were passengers on the train. Ranjith never heard from them after that day. 'I looked for them everywhere for years and still, no information about them. Their loss is a great sorrow and pain for me. I am still grieving,' he said. Overall, more than 35,000 people died in Sri Lanka in the tsunami. People across the country observed two minutes of silence on Thursday in memory of those who lost their lives. ___ Tarigan reported from Jakarta, Indonesia.

Kosovo appeals body overturns ban on ethnic Serb party, allowing it to run in parliamentary election	PRISTINA, Kosovo (AP) — Kosovo’s election appeals authority on Wednesday cancelled a ban on the main party of the ethnic Serb minority, allowing it to field candidates in the upcoming parliamentary election. The Electoral Panel for Complaints and Appeals decided that the party, Srpska Lista, or Serb List, has 'fulfilled the political terms to be certified for registration.' The panel overturned a decision Monday by the Central Election Commission, which declined to certify the Srpska Lista party because of its nationalist stance and close ties to neighboring Serbia. The panel ruled that the commission's decision was 'contrary to the legal dispositions referring to the application and certification of the political subjects.' Of the 10 seats reserved for the Serb minority in the 120-member parliament, Srspka Lista holds nine. It will put up 48 candidates for the parliamentary election on Feb. 9, expected to be a key test for Prime Minister Albin Kurti, whose governing party won in a landslide in the 2021. The original decision by the election commission was also opposed by Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić, who said 'Kurti is trying to root out the Serb people from (our) southern province.' The Western powers also expressed their concern over the commission's decision, fearing it may further aggravate the already tense ties between Kosovo and Serbia, despite their efforts to normalize them. Kosovo was a Serbian province until NATO’s 78-day bombing campaign in 1999 ended a war between Serbian government forces and ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo, which left about 11,400 dead, mainly ethnic Albanians, and pushed Serbian forces out. Kosovo proclaimed independence in 2008, which Serbia doesn’t recognize. Belgrade still considers Kosovo as its province and has a major influence on the Serb minority there.	https://apnews.com/article/kosovo-serbs-election-srpska-lista-party-ban-kurti-5f6ca84f50fcd86980b176f2f2e34c73	2024-12-25T10:06:21-08:00	
Clashes between Islamists now in power in Syria and Assad's supporters kill 6 fighters	DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — Clashes between Islamists who took over Syria and supporters of ousted President Bashar Assad's government killed six Islamic fighters on Wednesday and wounded others, according to a British-based war monitor. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the fighters were killed while trying to arrest a former official in Assad's government, accused of issuing execution orders and arbitrary rulings against thousands of prisoners. The fighters were from Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, which led the stunning offensive that toppled Assad earlier this month. Syria’s transition has been surprisingly smooth but it’s only been a few weeks since Assad fled the country and his administration and forces melted away. The insurgents who ousted Assad are rooted in fundamentalist Islamist ideology, and though they have vowed to create a pluralist system, it isn’t clear how or whether they plan to share power. Since Assad’s fall, dozens of Syrians have been killed in acts of revenge, according to activists and monitors, the vast majority of them from the minority Alawite community, an offshoot of Shiite Islam that Assad belongs to. In the capital, Damascus, Alawite protesters scuffled with Sunni counter-protesters and gunshots were heard. The Associated Press could not confirm details of the shooting. Alawite protests also took place along the coast of Syria, in the city of Homs and the Hama countryside. Some called for the release of soldiers from the former Syrian army now imprisoned by the HTS. At least one protestor was killed and five were wounded in Homs by HTS forces suppressing the demonstration, said the Syrian Observatory. In response to the protests, HTS imposed a curfew from 6 pm until 8am. The Alawite protests were apparently in part sparked by an online video showing the burning of an Alawite shrine. The interim authorities insisted the video was old and not a recent incident. Sectarian violence has erupted in bursts since Assad's ouster but nothing close to the level feared after nearly 14 years of civil war that killed an estimated half-million people. The war fractured Syria, creating millions of refugees and displacing tens of thousands throughout the country. This week, some Syrians who were forcibly displaced, started trickling home, trying to rebuild their lives. Shocked by the devastation, many found that little remains of their houses. In the northwestern Idlib region, residents were repairing shops and sealing damaged windows on Tuesday, trying to bring back a sense of normalcy. The city of Idlib and much of the surrounding province has for years been under control of the HTS, led by Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, once aligned with al-Qaida, but has been the scene of relentless attacks by the government forces. Hajjah Zakia Daemessaid, who was forcibly displaced during the war, said coming back to her house in the Idlib countryside was bitter-sweet. 'My husband and I spent 43 years of hard work saving money to build our home, only to find that all of it has gone to waste,' said the 62-year-old. In the dusty neighborhoods, cars drove by with luggage strapped on top. People stood idly on the streets or sat in empty coffee shops. In Damascus, Syria's new authorities raided warehouses on Wednesday, confiscating drugs such as Captagon and cannabis, used by Assad's forces. A million Captagon pills and hundreds of kilograms (pounds) of cannabis were set ablaze, the interim authorities said. ___ Albam reported from Damascus, Syria, and Alsayed from Idlib, Syria. ___ Follow AP’s Syria coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/syria	https://apnews.com/article/syria-assad-clashes-jihadi-hts-f31b8bf1f673a4cb38ebde5dcf36deaa	2024-12-25T09:36:18-08:00	
Japan to maximize nuclear power in clean-energy push as electricity demand grows	TOKYO (AP) — A government-commissioned panel of experts on Wednesday largely supported Japan's new energy policy for the next few years that calls for bolstering renewables up to half of electricity needs by 2040 while maximizing the use of nuclear power as the country seeks to accommodate the growing power demand in the era of AI while meeting decarbonization targets. The Industry Ministry presented the draft plan for final review by the panel of 16 mostly pro-nuclear members from business, academia and civil groups. It calls for maximizing the use of nuclear energy, reversing a phaseout policy adopted after the meltdown crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant in 2011 that led to extensive displacement of residents and lingering anti-nuclear sentiment. The plan is due to receive Cabinet approval by March after a period of consultation and will then replace the current energy policy, which dates from 2021. The new proposal says nuclear energy should account for 20% of Japan’s energy supply in 2040, up from just 8.5% last year, while expanding renewables to 40-50% from 22.9% and reducing coal-fired power to 30-40% from nearly 70% last year. The current plan set a 20-22% target for nuclear energy, 36-38% for renewables and 41% for fossil fuel, for 2030. Demand for low-carbon energy, such as renewables and nuclear, is growing because of the demand from data centers using AI and semiconductor factories around the country. Industry Minister Yoji Muto, who attended Wednesday’s panel meeting, said Japan must strengthen its energy security by not relying too much on a single source. 'How we can secure decarbonized energy determines Japan’s future growth,' Muto said. 'It's time to stop discussing a choice between renewable energy and nuclear power. We should maximize the use of both renewables and nuclear.' Japan has set a goal of achieving net zero emissions of climate-warming gases by 2050, and a 73% reduction by 2040 compared to 2013 levels. The draft energy plan places renewables as the main power source and calls for development of next-generation energy source, such as solar batteries and portable solar panels. It outlines a number of risk scenarios, including a possibility of less-than-expected investment and cost reduction in renewables. However, some experts said the plan lacked a feasibility outlook for 2040 or a roadmap for the phaseout of fossil fuels. The plan also calls for acceleration of the restarts of reactors that meet the post-Fukushima safety standards, and proposes construction of next-generation reactors -- at plants where existing reactors are being decommissioned. Still, to achieve the 20% target, all 33 workable reactors in Japan must be back online, with only 14 back in service after the Fukushima disaster. Given the current pace of safety checks by the nuclear regulation authority, experts say meeting the target would be difficult. Despite criticisms and skepticism about its feasibility, Japan still sticks to its pursuit of developing advanced reactors and a struggling spent fuel reprocessing program to achieve a complete nuclear fuel cycle.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-energy-nuclear-renewable-climate-fukushima-reactors-a9ce61e4a1cdef72cbf8f9e35deb4cfb	2024-12-25T07:21:40-08:00	
A baby froze to death overnight in Gaza as Israel and Hamas trade accusations of ceasefire delays	JERUSALEM (AP) — A baby girl froze to death overnight in Gaza, while Israel and Hamas accused each other of complicating ceasefire efforts that could wind down the 14-month war. The 3-week old baby was the third to die from the cold in Gaza's tent camps in recent days, doctors said, deaths that underscore the squalid conditions, with hundreds of thousands of Palestinians crammed into often ramshackle tents after fleeing Israeli offensives. Israel’s bombardment and ground invasion of Gaza has killed over 45,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its count. The offensive has caused widespread destruction and displaced some 90% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people, often multiple times. Hundreds of thousands are packed into tent camps along the coast as the cold, wet winter sets in. Aid groups have struggled to deliver food and supplies and say there are shortages of blankets, warm clothing and firewood. Israel has increased the amount of aid it allows into the territory, reaching an average of 130 trucks a day so far this month, up from around 70 a day in October and November. Still, the amount remains well below than previous months and the United Nations says it is unable to distribute more than half the aid because Israeli forces deny permission to move within Gaza or because of rampant lawlessness and theft from trucks. The father of 3-week-old Sila, Mahmoud al-Faseeh, wrapped her in a blanket to try and keep her warm in their tent in the Muwasi area outside the town of Khan Younis, but it wasn't enough, he told The Associated Press. He said the tent was not sealed from the wind and the ground was cold, as temperatures on Tuesday night dropped to 9 degrees Celsius (48 degrees Fahrenheit.) Muwasi is a desolate area of dunes and farmland on Gaza’s Mediterranean coast. 'It was very cold overnight and as adults we couldn’t even take it. We couldn’t stay warm,' he said. Sila woke up crying three times overnight and in the morning they found her unresponsive, her body stiff. 'She was like wood,' said al-Faseeh. They rushed her to a field hospital where doctors tried to revive her, but her lungs had already deteriorated. Images of Sila taken by the AP showed the little girl with purple lips, her pale skin blotchy. Ahmed al-Farra, director of the children’s ward at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, confirmed that the baby died of hypothermia. He said two other babies — one 3 days old, the other a month old — had been brought to the hospital over the past 48 hours after dying of hypothermia. Ceasefire complications Meanwhile, hopes for a ceasefire looked complicated Wednesday, with Israel and the militant Hamas group that runs Gaza trading accusations of delaying an agreement. In recent weeks, the two sides appeared to be inching toward a deal that would bring home dozens of hostages held by the militants in Gaza, but differences have emerged. Although Israel and Hamas have expressed optimism that progress was being made toward a deal, sticking points remain over the exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, people involved in the talks say. On Wednesday, Hamas accused Israel of introducing new conditions related to the withdrawal from Gaza, the prisoners and the return of displaced people, which it said was delaying the deal. Israel's government accused Hamas of reneging on understandings that have already been reached.' Still, both sides said discussions are ongoing. Israel’s negotiating team, which includes members from its intelligence agencies and the military, returned from Qatar on Tuesday evening for internal consultations, following a week of what it called 'significant negotiations.' During its Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel, Hamas and other groups took about 250 people hostages and brought them to Gaza. A previous truce in November 2023 freed more than 100 hostages, while others have been rescued or their remains have been recovered over the past year. Israel says about 100 hostages remain in Gaza — at least a third whom it believes were killed during the Oct. 7 attack or died in captivity. Sporadic talks have taken place for a year, but in recent weeks there's been a renewed push to reach a deal. President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office next month for his second term, has demanded the immediate release of Israeli hostages, saying on social media that if they're not freed before he is sworn in, there will be 'HELL TO PAY.' Families of the hostages are becoming increasingly angry, calling on the Israeli government for a ceasefire before Trump is sworn in. After Israel’s high-level negotiation team returned from Doha this week, hostage families called an emergency press conference in Tel Aviv, Israel, pleading for a ceasefire and a complete end to the war. Shir Siegel, the daughter of Israeli-American Keith Siegel, whose mother was released after more than 50 days in captivity, said every delay could endanger their lives. 'There are moments when every second is fateful, and this is one of those moments,' she said. Families of the hostages marked the first night of Hannukah with a candle lighting ceremony in Tel Aviv as well as by the Western Wall in Jerusalem. The agreement would take effect in phases and include a halt in fighting, an exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners, and a surge in aid to the besieged Gaza, according to Egyptian, Hamas and American officials. The last phase would include the release of any remaining hostages, an end to the war and talks on reconstruction. Houthi attacks Also Wednesday, a missile launched by Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels triggered air raid sirens across central Israel, sending residents fleeing to shelters. The Houthis said they operations were aimed at Israeli targets in the cities of Jaffa and Ashkelon. It was the fourth time in a week that fire from the Yemeni rebels set off sirens in Israel. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel will strike anyone threatening lives in Israel and warned the Houthis that they would learn lessons that Hamas, Hezbollah and Syria's ousted President Bashar Assad have learned. Israel also requested an emergency meeting by the U.N. Security Council to address the recent attacks. The meeting is set for Monday. Israel’s U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon said he expects the council to condemn the Houthi attacks and called on it 'to enforce international law and hold Iran, the Houthis’ patron, accountable.' ___ Goldenberg reported from Tel Aviv, Israel, and Khaled from Cairo.

The organizer of a Christmas fair in southern Mexico is assassinated at his holiday event	MEXICO CITY (AP) — The organizer of a Christmas fair in southern Mexico was assassinated at his city’s holiday event, authorities said late Tuesday. The governor of the southern state of Guerrero said gunmen killed the organizer of the annual Christmas and New Year's fair in the state capital of Chilpancingo. Gov. Evelyn Salgado called the Christmas Eve killing of Martín Ramírez Ruíz 'an unacceptable act that will not go unpunished.' Salgado wrote on her social media accounts that state prosecutors were investigating the crime. There was no immediate information on the motive, but the gangs gain much of their income extorting money from local businesses and routinely kill those who refuse to pay. In a separate statement, state prosecutors said that another person was killed along with Ramírez Ruíz, and that a third person in the crowd gathered outside a church was wounded in the attack. The gunmen had apparently waded into the crowd and directly targeted Ramírez Ruíz. Ramírez Ruíz was the head of the civic group that for almost two centuries has organized an arts, food and handicrafts fair that runs from roughly Christmas to Jan. 7. The fair also honors the local patron saint, St. Matthew. Two rival drug gangs, the Tlacos and the Ardillos, are fighting for control of the city of Chilpancingo, and violence against officials and residents there has reached grisly levels. In November, a former prosecutor and local police official was arrested in connection with the grisly decapitation of the city's mayor on Oct. 6. Mayor Alejandro Arcos was killed just a week after he took office as mayor of the state capital. Officials had blamed the killing on one of the gangs. The mayor's body was found in a pickup truck, with his severed head placed on the roof of the vehicle, in an apparent message from the gang. The same gang is thought to be responsible for killing 11 market vendors, including four boys, in late October. The vendors, members of an extended family, were abducted as they traveled to sell their wares. Their bodies were found dumped in the bed of a pickup truck on an avenue in Chilpancingo. Chilpancingo, a city of about 300,000, is so completely dominated by gangs that in 2023, one of them staged a demonstration of hundreds of people, hijacked a government armored car, blocked a major highway and took police hostage to win the release of arrested suspects. Violence in Guerrero reached such unprecedented levels that earlier this year, Roman Catholic bishops announced they had helped arrange a truce in another part of the state between two warring drug cartels. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-violence-christmas-fair-organizer-chilpancingo-killed-d1a281248d2adb5995c8a18de781684c	2024-12-25T05:06:25-08:00	
Desi Bouterse, a dictator convicted of murder who twice ruled Suriname, has died at 79	PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) — Desi Bouterse, a military strongman who led a 1980 coup in the former Dutch colony of Suriname then returned to power by election three decades later despite charges of drug smuggling and murder, has died. He was 79. Surinamese Vice President Ronnie Brunswijk wrote on Facebook Wednesday that Bouterse’s 'life had a lasting impact on our country and his efforts will not be forgotten.' The cause of death was not immediately known. Bouterse was applauded by supporters for his charisma and populist social programs. For his opponents, he was a ruthless dictator who was convicted of drug trafficking and extrajudicial killings. In December 2023, Bouterse was sentenced to 20 years in prison for the murders of 15 opponents of the then-military government i n December 1982, ending a historic 16-year legal process. He then vanished and never served time in jail despite the sentencing. 'There is nobody who has shaped the history of Suriname since its independence like Desi Bouterse,' said Dutch historian Pepijn Reeser, who wrote a biography of Bouterse in 2015. He said that Bouterse was the first to overcome the stark social class divide that once defined Suriname. 'Before the coup, it was unthinkable somebody from the lower class could become the most powerful man of the country. But he was also the first post-colonial leader to resort to political violence, and the first to use Suriname as a transshipment point for illegal narcotics,' Reeser said. Early Wednesday, dozens of supporters gathered outside Bouterse’s home where his wife lived, tears streaming down their faces. Many were dressed in purple, the color of his political party. Born Oct. 13, 1945, at a former sugar plantation near capital Paramaribo, Bouterse left for the Netherlands in 1968, as did thousands of other Surinamers in that era to seek adventure or a better life in Europe. Suriname was then still a colony, and as a Dutch citizen he was eligible for conscription, so he joined the armed forces a few months after arriving. He graduated from the Royal Military School and served at several Dutch army bases in the Netherlands and Germany. Bouterse returned to Suriname two weeks before it became an independent republic on Nov. 25, 1975, and joined its newly formed military. The initial optimism of young military men in serving their own country quickly turned into frustration over widespread favoritism and corruption in the consecutive governments of Prime Minister Henck Arron. When Arron forbade the troops from unionizing, 16 young soldiers led by Bouterse overthrew the government on Feb. 25, 1980, and made him the de facto ruler. 'We took control because we want to save this country from ruin. There needs to be a total change of mentality to transform Suriname into the paradise it used to be,' Bouterse said to a journalist a few hours after the coup. When promised democratic reforms did not materialize, opposition to Bouterse’s military regime grew rapidly. Frictions between the military and opposition groups culminated in the killing of 15 men on Dec. 8, 1982. The victims were journalists, lawyers, military and university teachers, and their slaying became known as the 'December Murders.' 'The executions were a severe blow to the rule of law in Suriname from which the country still has not fully recovered,' said Eddy Wijngaarde, a brother of journalist Frank Wijngaarde, one of the victims. 'The impact of the December Murders goes beyond the death of these 15 men. Since December 1982, Bouterse used fear for him as a means to secure his powerful positions and personal interests.' Shocked by the killings, the Netherlands suspended all development aid, disrupting life in Suriname. Ronnie Brunswijk, a former bodyguard of Bouterse, took up arms in 1986 in a bid to oust the dictator. For six years, the country’s jungles were torn by a civil war in which both sides violated human rights and hundreds died. International isolation and the lack of domestic support for his military regime led Bouterse to accept free elections in November 1987. He established his own political movement, the National Democratic Party, but won only three of 51 seats in Parliament. Nonetheless, as commander of the armed forces, Bouterse kept a tight grip on the newly elected government of President Ramsewak Shankar. Following a conflict between Bouterse and Shankar in 1990, the army seized power again, dismissing Shankar with a phone call. Civilian rule was restored the following year. Bouterse officially left Suriname’s army in 1993, and became what he described as a fulltime politician and businessman. In 1999, a Dutch court sentenced him in absentia to 11 years in prison for smuggling more than 1,000 pounds of cocaine to the Netherlands. The absence of an extradition treaty between the nations meant he never served his time in prison. In 2007, Suriname’s military court started a trial against Bouterse and 24 others for their alleged roles in the December Murders of 1982. Bouterse was painted as the chief instigator by the prosecution. He maintained he was not present during the executions, although he said he accepted 'political responsibility' as army commander. 'I want to apologize to all the relatives of the victims. But to think you can lock me up? Never, niemals, jamais, nunca,' Bouterse said during a televised speech in March 2007. While the trial dragged on for more than a decade, the former military leader reinvented himself as a politician by preaching nationalism and attracting support from many ethnic groups in Suriname, whose people have African, Asian, Amerindian, European and Middle Eastern roots. He was elected president for the first time in 2010. Instead of avoiding his past, he celebrated it. He quickly declared Feb. 25, the day of his military coup in 1980, a national holiday. He awarded other suspects in the December Murders case and coup plotters with high-ranking government jobs. 'Despite his controversial past, Bouterse was able to embody a new political dynamism, with strong leadership and a promising vision for the future,' political scientist Hans Breeveld of the Anton de Kom University in Suriname said in an interview in 2015. Inspired by the socialist politics of then Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, Bouterse continued construction of social housing, increased social welfare benefits and raised the government pension. These popular measures secured his reelection for another five-year term in 2015, but also proved to be an unpayable burden for the state. Large budget deficits and rampant inflation ensued. Consecutive devaluations of the Surinamese dollar in 2016 resulted in the currency losing more than half of its value in just a year. 'The reckless economic policies of Bouterse have put a huge burden on our future generations, who are forced to repay millions of dollars of loans to international creditors,' Surinamese economist Winston Ramautarsing told The Associated Press in 2016. With his support dwindling during his second term, Bouterse resorted to the tactics that he used during his dictatorship, including threatening the judges of his own murder trial during public events. History books for the country’s high schools that mentioned the December Murders were banned. He regularly fired Cabinet ministers while blaming them for Suriname’s problems. In 2012, the Bouterse administration proclaimed an internationally criticized amnesty law for the December Murders in an attempt to halt the murder trial. However, the law was ruled inapplicable by the military court in 2016, and in June 2017, the prosecutor recommended a 20-year prison sentence for Bouterse. 'If it was God who made me president, who is this judge to try to send me away?' Bouterse said. He tried to force out the attorney general, but the latter refused to quit. A verdict in the trial was expected in 2018. Bouterse said during a speech in August 2017 that he 'already knew' he would be reelected for a third five-year term in the 2020 election. But he had been making regular trips to Cuba that were described as routine check-ups, and after returning in September 2017 from a monthlong stay, his office admitted the president had undergone surgery, although it refused to disclose more details. Bouterse was married twice and had three children, one son and two daughters. His son, Dino Bouterse, was serving a 16-year prison sentence in the U.S. for drug trafficking.	https://apnews.com/article/suriname-bouterse-dies-dictator-fe5300461c2239c7bbdb6b5272660ed0	2024-12-25T03:41:58-08:00	
Missile fire from Yemen's Houthi rebels sets off sirens in central Israel for the second night	NAHARIYA, Israel (AP) — A missile launched from Yemen triggered air raid sirens across central Israel early Wednesday, sending millions of residents looking for cover for the second night in a row. The military said the missile was intercepted before crossing into Israeli territory, but police reported shrapnel from the interception fell in several towns. There were no reports of injuries. It was the fourth time in a week that fire from Yemen's Houthi rebels set off sirens in Israel. On Saturday, 1 6 people were injured when a missile hit a playground in Tel Aviv after Israel’s air defense system failed to intercept it. Earlier last week, Israeli jets struck Yemen’s rebel-held capital and a port city, killing nine. Israel said the strikes were in response to previous Houthi attacks. On Tuesday, Israel’s foreign minister requested an emergency meeting of the U.N.

Taliban say Pakistani airstrikes killed 46 people in eastern Afghanistan, mostly women and children	PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) — Pakistan’s airstrikes on eastern Afghanistan killed 46 people, mostly women and children, a Taliban government official said Wednesday, raising fears of further straining the relations between the two neighbors. Hamdullah Fitrat, the deputy spokesman for the Afghan government, said those killed in the strikes that targeted four locations in Barmal, a district in the province of Paktika, were refugees, adding that six others were also wounded. This comes a day after Pakistani security officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity in line with regulations, told The Associated Press that Tuesday’s operation was to dismantle a training facility and kill insurgents in Paktika in Afghanistan. Earlier Wednesday, Mohammad Khurasani, the spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban or Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, claimed in a statement that 50 people, including 27 women and children, have died in the strikes. He said they were 'unarmed refugees' who fled to Afghanistan because of Pakistan’s offensive in the northwest. The TTP — a separate group but also a close ally of the Afghan Taliban — also shared photos, alleging they were of children killed during the Pakistani operation. Meanwhile, residents in the area told an AP reporter over the phone that at least 13 people were left dead, adding that the death toll could be higher. They also said the wounded were transported to a local hospital. Pakistan has not commented on the strikes. However, on Wednesday, the Pakistani military said security forces killed 13 insurgents in an intelligence-based operation in South Waziristan, a district located along eastern Afghanistan’s Paktika province. Pakistan's Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Wednesday praised 'Pakistan’s brave security force' in a statement for thwarting 'the nefarious designs' of 'terrorists.' He didn't mention the Pakistani air strikes inside Afghanistan The Taliban Defense Ministry denounced the attacks on Tuesday and promised retaliation. On Wednesday, the situation along the shared border seemed to be business as usual. However, security analysts say the TTP could launch retaliatory attacks in Pakistan. Pakistan has seen innumerable militant attacks in the past two decades but there has been an uptick in recent months. The latest was this weekend when at least 16 Pakistani soldiers were killed when the TTP attacked a checkpoint in the country’s northwest. Pakistani officials have accused the Taliban of not doing enough to combat militant activity across the border, a charge the Afghan Taliban government denies, saying it does not allow anyone to carry out attacks against any country. North and South Waziristan are former strongholds of Pakistani Taliban, who have fled to Afghanistan. Tensions were at an all-high in March when Pakistan said intelligence-based strikes took place in the border regions inside Afghanistan. ___ Associated Press writers Rasool Dawar in Peshawar, Pakistan, and Ishtiaq Mahsud in Dera Ismail Khan, Pakistan, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-afghanistan-militant-camp-air-strikes-1eb6ebd92403795d03856b1b97cac0da	2024-12-25T00:36:47-08:00	
Pilgrims traverse Vatican Holy Door as Christmas marks the start of the 2025 Holy Year	VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pilgrims lined up early Wednesday to walk through the great Holy Door at the entrance of St. Peter’s Basilica, as Christmas marked the start of the 2025 Holy Year celebration that is expected to bring some 32 million Catholic faithful to Rome. Traversing the Holy Door is one way that the faithful can obtain indulgences, or forgiveness for sins during a Jubilee, a once-every-quarter-century tradition that dates from 1300. On Christmas Eve, Pope Francis knocked on the door and was the first to walk through it, inaugurating the 2025 Jubilee that he dedicated to hope. Pilgrims submitted to security controls before entering the Holy Door, amid new security fears following a deadly Christmas market attack in Germany. Many paused to touch the door as they passed and made the sign of the cross upon entering the basilica dedicated to St. Peter, founder of the Roman Catholic Church. At noon, Francis will deliver the 'Urbi et Orbi' — 'To the City and the World' address, which serves as a summary of the woes facing the world this year. A Chrismukkah miracle as Hanukkah and Christmas coincide Hanukkah, Judaism’s eight-day Festival of Lights, begins this year on Christmas Day, which has only happened four times since 1900. The calendar confluence has inspired some religious leaders to host interfaith gatherings, such as a a Chicanukah party hosted last week by several Jewish organizations in Houston, Texas, bringing together members of the city’s Latino and Jewish communities for latkes, the traditional potato pancake eaten on Hanukkah, topped with guacamole and salsa. While Hanukkah is intended as an upbeat, celebratory holiday, rabbis note that it’s taking place this year as wars rage in the Middle East and fears rise over widespread incidents of antisemitism. The holidays overlap infrequently because the Jewish calendar is based on lunar cycles and is not in sync with the Gregorian calendar, which sets Christmas on Dec. 25. The last time Hanukkah began on Christmas Day was in 2005. German celebrations muted by market attack German celebrations were darkened by a car attack on a Christmas market in Magdeburg on Friday that left five people dead, including a 9-year-old boy, and 200 people injured. President Frank-Walter Steinmeier rewrote his recorded Christmas Day speech to address the attack, saying that 'there is grief, pain, horror and incomprehension over what took place in Magdeburg.' He urged Germans to 'stand together' and that 'hate and violence must not have the last word.' A 50-year-old Saudi doctor who had practiced medicine in Germany since 2006 was arrested on suspicion of murder, attempted murder and bodily harm. The suspect’s X account describes him as a former Muslim and is filled with anti-Islamic themes. He criticized authorities for failing to combat 'the Islamification of Germany' and voiced support for the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. ____ Barry reported from Milan.

An Israeli soldier who died 417 days after his Oct. 7 wounds has become a symbol of sacrifice	MODIIN, Israel (AP) — For more than 400 days after being critically wounded during Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel, Yona Brief tried to recover. But after losing both legs and enduring medically induced comas, the combat medic died in late November. The dual Israeli-American citizen has come to symbolize the sacrifice by hundreds of fallen soldiers in what many in Israel see as a war for the country’s survival. 'He became a symbol of ‘Don’t quit,’' said his mother, Hazel. His father, David, compared him to the oil that lit the candelabra in the Hannukah story, miraculously burning longer than expected, according to Jewish tradition. More than 800 Israeli soldiers have been killed since Hamas’ attack, about 300 of them on the initial day and the rest in Gaza or in the war against Hezbollah in Lebanon. Thousands of others have been wounded, many of them seriously. The war in Gaza has killed nearly 45,000 Palestinians, while over 3,500 people have been killed in Lebanon, according to local health officials. Serving in Israel’s military is compulsory for most Jews. Soldiers’ service is revered, and Israelis see their sacrifice as deeply moving. Public opinion in previous wars has often been swayed by high soldier casualties. Months before Brief was called into action on Oct. 7, he had been seriously wounded, also in his legs, by a pipe bomb during a commando raid while serving in the occupied West Bank. The weekend of Oct. 7 was his first on duty after his recovery. As militants attacked from Gaza, he and his seven-soldier commando unit raced to join the Israeli army’s house-by-house war in the communal farming villages, military bases and towns along the border. His father said Brief’s unit was ordered to clear the Kibbutz Kfar Aza, where Hamas fighters ambushed them, killing two soldiers. When Brief rushed to help one of them, he was shot 13 times. Suddenly, his training as a medic was used to save himself. His father said he cinched tourniquets around his mutilated legs and dragged himself and a fellow soldier into a nearby bullet-ravaged home. There, the family of Hadas Eilon-Carmi hid in a reinforced room and later described Brief as the soldier 'full of blood.' Brief was evacuated to a hospital hours later. The other soldier, his commanding officer, died at the scene. The hospital stay was grueling, too. Brief was the most critically wounded patient from the Oct. 7 attack to be treated at Sheba Medical Center in Tel Aviv, the country's largest hospital. After his legs were amputated, he teetered between life and death. He had more than 20 surgeries. His doctors told Israeli media he received more than 200 units of blood. The hospital brought specialists and surgeons from around the world in a bid to save him. Eilon-Carmi’s family became close with his family, visiting Brief in the hospital and praying for his recovery. 'Yona represents everything I want an Israeli to be,' she said. Brief's determination to live became a source of inspiration for the doctors and medical staff, who had been overwhelmed by work and heartbreak in the early days of the war, said Steve Walz, the international spokesperson for Sheba Medical Center. Though there were periods when Brief was in a medically induced coma, he was often awake and lucid, even lively. He was grateful for what remained, his mother said. He worked out in his hospital bed, raising a barbell above his head. He sang and danced with visitors. Once, he even left the hospital to spend the night in his family home but his medical issues brought him back. Brief’s parents said there were sparks of joy in the nearly 14 months after he was wounded. Chefs cooked him special meals like sushi. Politicians and influencers visited, and Israel's top musicians played by his bedside. He turned 23. But while his parents said his spirit never wavered, his liver finally failed after months of heavy medication. Hundreds attended his funeral, and tributes poured in from all walks of Israeli life. 'With Yona, every day he had to fight for this victory and that’s why his heroism is extraordinary,' said Chili Tropper, an Israeli opposition lawmaker who became close with Brief and his family. 'For him, during 417 days, every single day was a war.' ___ Associated Press writer Melanie Lidman in Tel Aviv, Israel contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-gaza-soldiers-war-wounded-yona-brief-11f076ba459453f4ee9e4f046537873f	2024-12-24T23:49:24-08:00	
Japan's foreign minister seeks 'positive' direction in bilateral ties during his visit to China	BEIJING (AP) — Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya met with top Chinese leaders Wednesday during his visit to Beijing, the first since the heads of the two countries met at a summit in Peru last month, in an effort to make positive inroads in the bilateral relationship. The two neighbors have had a tense relationship in recent years. At the top of Iwaya's agenda is China’s ban on Japanese seafood in response to the release of treated radioactive wastewater into the sea from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, as well as China’s increasingly assertive military activity in the East and South China Seas. Iwaya met with China's premier, Li Qiang Wednesday as well as Wang Yi, his Chinese counterpart. 'Currently the China-Japan relations are at a critical period of improvement and development,' said Li, in his remarks. ' China is willing to work together with Japan to move towards the important direction proposed by the leaders of the two countries.' 'I want to build a relationship where the people of both countries feel that Japan-China relations have developed and progressed in a positive direction,' said Iwaya, ahead of his meeting with Wang. His trip comes just before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is to take office in January. Tokyo considers the Japan-U.S. alliance the lynchpin of its diplomatic and security policies, a tone emphasized in the past four years under U.S. President Joe Biden’s direction, but it’s unclear how Trump will impact the alliance. Japan has revamped its approach to defense i n response to Chinese actions in recent years, boosting military spending and shifting away from a principle of self-defense. Earlier this year, Japan protested when a Chinese military plane flew into Japan's airspace, while in the summer, a Chinese survey ship sailed into Japanese territorial waters. While how U.S.-China relations come out under the Trump administration is unclear, Japan is seeking stability in its relationship with its neighbor and hopes to develop ties in areas of mutual interest, including the economy and the elderly care industry. Iwaya told reporters before his departure Tuesday that he will also hold bilateral high-level people and cultural exchange talks, joined by the education ministers from the two sides. 'The relationship with China, our neighboring country, is one of Japan’s most important,' Iwaya told reporters Tuesday. Though there are many issues and concerns, Japan and China share a variety of possibilities, he said. 'The two countries share important responsibilities for the peace and prosperity of the region and the international society.' Iwaya, a security expert, is also expected to reiterate his concern about Japanese nationals detained in alleged spying allegations. Japan maintains that the water discharged from the Fukushima plant is treated and diluted to levels much safer than international standards and adequately monitored, but China calls the water contaminated. Japan and China agreed in September to work toward easing the seafood ban by allowing China in multinational sampling missions under the framework of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Chinese experts joined an IAEA monitoring mission to Fukushima in October, when China took water samples from the sea just off the coast of the Fukushima plant, as well as the water discharge system on the plant, for analysis. However, no breakthrough is expected during Iwaya’s visit. —- AP writer Mari Yamaguchi contributed to this report from Tokyo.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-visit-china-foreign-minister-improve-ties-4aabd3472505cdbccc93706184436fdb	2024-12-24T23:30:27-08:00	
Russia targets Ukrainian energy infrastructure on Christmas Day	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia launched a massive missile and drone barrage targeting Ukraine's energy infrastructure on Wednesday, striking a thermal power plant and prompting Ukrainians to take shelter in metro stations on Christmas morning. The strikes on Ukrainian fuel and energy sources included 78 air, ground, and sea-launched missiles as well as 106 Shaheds and other types of drones, Ukraine’s air force said. It claimed to have intercepted 59 missiles and 54 drones, with 52 more drones being jammed. '(Russian President Vladimir) Putin deliberately chose Christmas for an attack. What could be more inhumane?' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on X. 'They continue to fight for a blackout in Ukraine.' In Russia, meanwhile, one woman died and three people were wounded after falling debris from a downed drone sparked a fire in a shopping mall in the city of Vladikavkaz. The head of Russia’s republic of North Ossetia-Alania, Gov. Sergey Menyaylo, said security footage showed that the explosion took place outside the Alania Mall Wednesday morning. At least one person was killed in Russia's attack on Ukraine's Dnipro region, Vice Prime Minister Oleksii Kuleba said on Telegram, adding that heating was disrupted for 155 residential buildings. He also said 500,000 people in the Kharkiv region were without heat. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said one Russian missile passed Moldovan and Romanian airspace. Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said Russia again 'massively attacks energy infrastructure.' Ukraine’s air force said that multiple missiles had been fired at the Kharkiv, Dnipro and Poltava regions in the east of the country. Halushchenko said the power distributor took the necessary measures to limit consumption. 'As soon as the security situation allows, energy workers will establish the damage caused,' he said. State energy operator Ukrenergo applied preemptive power outages across the country due to a 'massive missile attack,' leading to electricity going out in several districts of the capital, Kyiv. Ukraine’s biggest private energy company, DTEK, said Russia struck one of their thermal power plants Wednesday morning, making it the 13th attack on Ukraine’s power grid this year. 'Denying light and warmth to millions of peace-loving people as they celebrate Christmas is a depraved and evil act that must be answered,' Maxim Timchenko, CEO of DTEK wrote on his X account. At least seven strikes targeted Kharkiv, sparking fires across the city, regional head Oleh Syniehubov wrote on Telegram. At least three people were injured, local authorities said. 'Kharkiv is under massive missile fire. A series of explosions rang out in the city and there are still ballistic missiles flying in the direction of the city. Stay in safe places,' Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov said. Russia’s Ministry of Defense said in its morning report Wednesday that it had shot down 59 Ukrainian drones overnight, including over the Belgorod, Voronezh, Kursk, Bryansk and Tambov regions, as well as over the Azov Sea. It did not mention the incident in North Ossetia-Alania. Four people were also killed as a result of Ukrainian shelling in the town of Lgov in the Kursk region, regional head Alexander Khinshtein said. Three people died after several residential blocks and a beauty salon were hit, he said. Another person later died in a hospital. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-missile-energy-infrastructure-christmas-906dafcdbc66bc4976b0428a5cc0d263	2024-12-24T23:27:44-08:00	
Azerbaijani airliner with 67 people onboard crashes in Kazakhstan leaving 32 survivors	An Azerbaijani airliner with 67 people onboard crashed Wednesday near the Kazakhstani city of Aktau, leaving at least 32 survivors, according to officials. More than 30 people may be dead. The plane was en route from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku to the Russian city of Grozny in the North Caucasus. Kazakhstan's Emergency Ministry said in a Telegram statement that those on board included five crew. A total of 29 survivors, including two children, have been hospitalized, the ministry told Russia's state news agency, RIA Novosti. Another Russian news agency, Interfax quoted medical workers as saying that four bodies have been recovered and emergency workers at the scene as saying that both pilots, according to a preliminary assessment, died in the crash. The Embraer 190 aircraft made an emergency landing 3 km from the city, Azerbaijan Airlines said earlier. Kazakhstan’s Emergency Ministry initially said 25 people survived the crash, later revising that number to 27, 28, and then 29 as the search and rescue operation continued at the site of the crash, bringing the supposed death toll down. The Prosecutor General's Office in Azerbaijan later reported that at least 32 people survived the crash, adding that the number wasn't final. Azerbaijan's Foreign Ministry said in a statement that some of them were in critical condition. The number of survivors could mean that over 30 people may be dead. According to Kazakhstani officials, those aboard the plane included 42 Azerbaijani citizens, 16 Russian nationals, six Kazakhstani and three Kyrgyzstani citizens, it said. RIA Novosti quoted Russia’s civil aviation authority, Rosaviatsia, as saying that preliminary information showed that the pilot had chosen to divert to Kazakhstan's Aktau after a bird strike on the aircraft led to 'an emergency situation on board'. Mobile phone footage circulating online appeared to show the aircraft making a steep descent before smashing into the ground in a fireball. Other footage showed part of its fuselage ripped away from the wings and the rest of the aircraft, lying upside in the grass. The footage corresponded to the plane’s colors and its registration number. Some of the videos posted on social media showed survivors dragging fellow passengers away from the wreckage of the plane. Flight-tracking data from FlightRadar24.com showed the aircraft making what appeared to be a figure-right once nearing the airport in Aktau, its altitude moving up and down substantially over the last minutes of the flight before impacting the ground. FlightRadar24 separately said in an online post that the aircraft had faced 'strong GPS jamming' which ' made the aircraft transmit bad ADS-B data', referring to the information that allows flight-tracking websites to follow planes in flight. Russia has been blamed in the past for jamming GPS transmissions in the wider region. In a statement, Azerbaijan Airlines said it would keep members of the public updated and changed its social media banners to solid black. Azerbaijan’s state news agency, Azertac, said that an official delegation consisting of Azerbaijan’s emergency situations minister, the country’s deputy general prosecutor, and the vice president of Azerbaijan Airlines had been dispatched to Aktau to conduct an 'on-site investigation'. Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev, who had been traveling to Russia, returned to Azerbaijan on hearing news of the crash, the president’s press service said. Aliyev was due to attend an informal meeting of leaders of the Commonwealth of Independent States, a bloc of former Soviet countries founded after the collapse of the Soviet Union, in St. Petersburg. Aliyev expressed his condolences to the families of the victims in a statement on social media. 'It is with deep sadness that I express my condolences to the families of the victims and wish a speedy recovery to those injured,' he wrote. Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke to Aliyev on the phone and expressed his condolences, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. Speaking at the CIS meeting in St. Petersburg, Putin also said that Russia's Emergency Ministry sent a plane with equipment and medical workers to Kazakhstan to assist with the aftermath of the crash. Kazakhstani, Azerbaijani and Russian authorities said they were investigating the crash. Embraer told The Associated Press in a statement that the company is 'ready to assist all relevant authorities.'	https://apnews.com/article/azerbaijan-airliner-crash-kazakhstan-aktau-a655474030a347a5a7ddda3a77bbeddc	2024-12-24T22:53:38-08:00	
Why Palestinian forces are cracking down on Palestinian militants in the occupied West Bank	JENIN REFUGEE CAMP, West Bank (AP) — Gunfire has rung out for days from the West Bank's Jenin refugee camp. But this time, it’s not Israeli forces that are facing off against armed groups. It is the forces of the Palestinian Authority clashing with Palestinian gunmen. The Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the occupied territory, launched a rare crackdown earlier this month that has sparked one of the worst armed confrontations between Palestinians in years. The authority says it wants to bring law and order to what's long been a hotbed of militancy and a place where it has little control. Its ability to contain armed groups there will reverberate far beyond the West Bank. The Palestinian Authority wants to position itself to take over governance in Gaza once the war there ends. But confronting Palestinians at a time when many view the authority as a subcontractor for Israel could deepen divisions in Palestinian society. Here is a look at the days of fighting between Palestinians in the West Bank: Fighting rages on the streets and at least 5 are dead Earlier this month, security forces for the Western-backed Palestinian Authority stormed into Jenin refugee camp, a restive militant stronghold, and began a crackdown against armed groups. Fighting has raged in the streets of the camp, and armored cars are seen patrolling. Palestinian security forces have taken over part of a hospital, using it as a base and shooting from inside, according to the United Nations. At least one militant from the Islamic Jihad group and three security force members have been killed, including a captain in the intelligence services whose death was announced Wednesday, according to the Palestinian forces. About 50 people have been arrested. At least two uninvolved civilians have been killed and some wounded. The fighting prompted the main U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, to suspend its services, including schooling. The violence has disrupted safe access for Palestinians to other services, including water and health. It also has complicated the restoration of services destroyed in previous Israeli raids of the camp. The Jenin refugee camp explained The urban, built-up refugee camp in the northern West Bank houses Palestinians whose families were displaced in the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation. It has long been a center for Palestinian militancy and a bastion of armed struggle against Israel. The militant groups Islamic Jihad and Hamas operate freely there, and its streets are regularly lined with posters depicting slain fighters as martyrs for the Palestinian cause. The Palestinian Authority, which administers the main Palestinian population centers of the West Bank as part of interim peace agreements with Israel from the 1990s, has little presence in Jenin. Many people view the Palestinian Authority forces with suspicion and see them as serving Israel's interests because of security coordination that has facilitated Israel's own crackdowns on Palestinians. The refugee camp and the adjacent city of Jenin have long been targets of Israel in its stated bid to stamp out militancy. Since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, which has sparked a wave of violence in the West Bank, Israel has raided or carried out airstrikes in Jenin multiple times, killing dozens and leaving heavy destruction. Palestinian health officials say Israeli raids throughout the West Bank since Oct. 7, 2023, have killed more than 800 Palestinians. Israel says most of these are militants, but youth throwing stones and people not involved in confrontations have also been killed. The PA raid is meant to restore order but it's also linked to postwar Gaza According to Brig. Gen. Anwar Rajab, the spokesperson for the Palestinian security forces, the raid is meant to impose law and order and restore peace and security. The troops were focused on 'eradicating' Iran-backed groups that were trying to incite 'chaos and anarchy,' he added. The raid will end when those goals are reached, according to the security forces. But the raid is also shining a spotlight on the Palestinian Authority's ability to impose order and security in a restive area. With no clear vision for who will administer postwar Gaza, the raid could convince skeptics that the authority has what it takes to rule the Palestinian enclave. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is considering an agreement with Hamas that would create a committee of politically independent technocrats to administer the Gaza Strip after the war. The committee would report to him. The Biden administration sees a rehabilitated Palestinian Authority as the best option to govern and secure postwar Gaza. The U.S. has for years invested heavily in training the Palestinian security forces, and the administration has seen its re-entry into Gaza, after being routed by Hamas in 2007, as a feasible replacement for Hamas, whose rule Israel has sought to end with the war. Israel rejects this idea, seeing the Palestinian Authority as too weak to be able to contain Hamas. It says it will maintain open-ended security control over Gaza. The incoming Trump administration has not yet laid out its vision for postwar Gaza, but Trump's first term was overwhelmingly supportive of Israel's positions. For Palestinians, the raid highlights and deepens their internal divisions Palestinians are not strangers to divisions within their society, with the most prominent the rift between Hamas and Abbas' Fatah party. The parties fought bloody street wars in Gaza before Hamas forced Fatah out of the territory, and the sides have failed to reconcile since. Since then, the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority has tried to diminish Hamas' influence in the West Bank, often with Israel's help. Reeling from the yearslong internal rift, Palestinians have staged general strikes and protests calling for unity. But the raid could deepen the perception of the Palestinian Authority as a facilitator of Israel's whims and potentially undermine any popular support for it to return to effectively rule Gaza. ___ Goldenberg reported from Tel Aviv, Israel.	https://apnews.com/article/palestinians-authority-jenin-raid-israel-d698557816e2b9b674c6221511a80ef6	2024-12-24T22:09:06-08:00
