Canadian Cabinet voices support for Trudeau as some Liberals prepare to confront him	TORONTO (AP) — Canada's deputy prime minister said she believes Justin Trudeau has the support of a majority of Liberals in Parliament as some prepare to confront him Wednesday in the hopes of convincing him to step down. Chrystia Freeland and other Cabinet members voiced support for the prime minister on Tuesday ahead of a broader meeting with colleagues. A number of Liberals have signed a letter hoping to persuade Trudeau to step down before the next election. It was unclear how many signed. 'The vast majority of Liberal Members of Parliament support the prime minister, support him as leader of our government, support him as leader of our party and support him as the guy who is going to lead us into the next election,' Freeland said. Freeland said she is more confident of that after meetings in the last 36 hours. The Liberal recently suffered upsets in special elections in districts the party has held for years, raising doubts about Trudeau’s leadership. Losing a district in Canada’s largest city of Toronto, a traditional Liberal stronghold, does not bode well. A number of Liberal lawmakers have said they will not run again. Trudeau has said he will lead the party into the election, which come any time between this fall and October, 2025. His Liberal party must rely on the support of at least one major party in Parliament as the Liberals do not have the majority in the House of Commons. The opposition leader of the Bloc Québécois said his party will work with the Conservatives and NDP parties to bring the Liberals down and force an election if the government doesn't boost old age security payments for seniors. 'The whole story is now: what will Justin Trudeau, superstar, do in the coming days,' Bloc Leader Yves-François Blanchet said. Trudeau's Liberals have been in power since 2015 but Canadians have been frustrated by the cost of living coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic. Trudeau reasserted the country’s liberal identity in 2015 after almost 10 years of Conservative rule. His legacy includes opening the doors wide to immigration. He also legalized cannabis and brought in a carbon tax to fight climate change. 'Anybody who has ever bet against Justin Trudeau is sorry they made that bet the next day,' said Employment Minister Randy Boissonnault. Some Cabinet ministers acknowledged some colleagues don't agree. 'Any time there are voices of dissent we have to deal with them, we have to listen to them carefully,' Labor Minister Stephen MacKinnon said. 'We have to deal with them and present a unified face to Canadians.' Opposition Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre goaded the prime minister about the potential revolt. 'The reality is he can’t administer the government because he’s too busy fighting for his job after nine years,' Poilievre said. Nelson Wiseman, professor emeritus at the University of Toronto, said the shelf life of Canadian prime ministers has been about a decade for the past 75 years. 'Trudeau’s time is up. Scandals over the years have tarnished his image. He deflects or evades rather than answering straight-forward questions. There is a popular appetite for change. Most Canadians have tuned him out,' he said. 'He is the reason why the Liberals went from the wilderness to power in 2015, but it is no longer 2015.' Trudeau’s father, Pierre Trudeau, swept to power in 1968 on a wave of 'Trudeaumania' and led Canada for almost 16 years.	https://apnews.com/article/trudeau-cabinet-liberal-leadership-election-e7a8fc0be9647d887154c4e748aaf8e9	2024-10-22T13:09:39-07:00	
Desperation amid search for survivors of an airstrike on a crowded area near major Beirut hospital	BEIRUT (AP) — Nearly 16 hours after an Israeli airstrike hit across the street from Beirut’s main public hospital, rescuers were still removing debris Tuesday from the overcrowded slum area. An excavator was digging at one of the destroyed buildings, picking out twisted metal and bricks in search for bodies. Residents standing on mounds of debris said an entire family remained missing under the rubble. Mohammad Ibrahim, a Sudanese national, came looking for his brother. 'His mobile phone is still ringing. We are trying to search for him,' he said. 'I don’t know if he is dead or alive.' Hours later, health officials said five bodies had been recovered from under the rubble. At least 18 people were killed, including four children, and at least 60 wounded in the strike that also caused damage across the street at the Rafik Hariri University Hospital, the capital’s main public medical facility. Jihad Saadeh, director of the Rafik Hariri Hospital, said the strike broke several glass windows and the solar panels of the medical facility, which continued to operate despite the damage and the panic. None of the staff was injured. Saadeh said the hospital received no warning of the impending strike, just a few meters (yards) across the street. Neither did the residents of the slum area, where several buildings were crammed and which houses several migrant workers as well as working class Lebanese. The Israeli military said it struck a Hezbollah target, without elaborating. It added had not targeted the hospital itself. It was hard for rescue equipment to reach the area of clustered settlements and dusty narrow roads. Nizar, one of the rescuers, said he had been at the site of the explosion since Monday night. 'It was too dark and there was so much panic,' he said, giving only his first name in line with the rescue team’s regulations. 'People didn’t understand yet what had happened.' The overcrowded slum was covered in debris, furniture and remains of life poking out of the twisted metal and broken bricks. Residents who survived the massive explosion were still in shock, some still searching through the debris with their hands for their relatives or what is left of their lives. Gunmen stood guard at the site. The Lebanese Civil Defense said Tuesday five buildings were destroyed and 12 sustained severe damage. The dead included one Sudanese and at least one Syrian. 'This is a very crowded area; buildings are very close. The destruction is massive,' Nizar said, explaining that the scale of the damage made their rescue effort harder. Across the street, the hospital was still treating a few of the injured. The morgue had received 13 bodies. Hussein al-Ali, a nurse who was there when the attack happened, said it took him a few minutes to realize it was not the hospital that was hit. Dust and smoke covered the hospital lobby. The glass in the dialysis unit, the pharmacy and other rooms in the hospital was shattered. The false roof fell over his and his colleagues' heads. 'We were terrified. This is a crime,' said al-Ali. 'It felt like judgement day.' It took only minutes for the injured from across the street to start streaming in. Al-Ali said he had little time to breathe or reassure his terrified colleagues and the rattled patients. 'Staff and patients thought the strike was here. We fled outside as the injured were coming in,' he said. And when he was done admitting the injured, 'we came out to carry our (killed) neighbors. They are our neighbors.' Ola Eid survived the strike. She helped dig out her neighbors’ children from under the rubble, before realizing she herself was injured. 'The problem is we didn’t feel it. They didn’t inform us. We heard they want to strike al-Sahel hospital,' said Eid, bandaged and still in shock sitting at the hospital gate. Israel had hinted another hospital miles away could possibly be a target, alleging it is housing tunnels used by the Hezbollah militant group. Eid, an actress, said she was playing with her neighbor’s kids when the first explosion hit. It knocked her to the floor and scattered the candy she was handing out to the kids. She stood up, not believing she was still alive, to find her neighbor’s kid soaked in blood. One was killed immediately; the other remained in intensive care. 'I looked ahead and saw the kids torn apart and hurt,' she said. 'The gas canisters were on fire. I didn’t know what to do — put out the fire or remove the kids.'	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-strike-hospital-israel-rescue-survivors-rubble-da09186fc06d734e0457e6c099f3d992	2024-10-22T10:07:23-07:00	
Mexico announces food and agriculture plan that could take the country back to the 1980s	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico’s new president announced a new agriculture plan Tuesday that could make the country’s food production and distribution look a lot more like it did in the 1980s, when meals in Mexico were dominated by tortillas, beans, instant coffee and cheap hot chocolate. Four decades ago, the ingredients for those meals were often bought at government stores that stocked a few basic goods. President Claudia Sheinbaum pledged Tuesday to revive those often shabby, limited government stores and continue efforts to achieve 'food sovereignty.' 'It is about producing what we eat,' Sheinbaum said of her policy, whose main focus will be on increasing bean and corn production. Sheinbaum appears to have a deep interest in boosting beans. On Monday, she said, 'It is much better to eat a bean taco than a bag of potato chips.' Agriculture Secretary Julio Berdegué said the focus would be on guaranteeing prices for farmers who grow corn used for tortillas and lowering tortilla prices by 10%, after prices jumped a couple of years ago. The government aims to boost bean production by about 30% in six years to replace imports of beans, and will set up research centers to supply higher-yielding bean seeds. 'Self-sufficiency in beans is a goal the president has set for us,' Berdegué said. The government will also focus on supporting coffee production, but mainly for instant coffee, which it claims is used by 84% of Mexican households. The plan will also seek to support cocoa production, but mainly for powdered baking and hot chocolate, not fine chocolate bars. The policies appear to run counter to market trends and what Mexican food sales look like today, when consumption of most of the old basics has fallen. Most Mexicans today shop at modern grocery stores, and consumption of fresh ground coffee, not instant, has increased enormously, accompanied by a boom in specialized coffee chains and shops. Meanwhile, bean consumption has been dropping precipitously for decades in Mexico. According to the government's '2024 Agricultural Panorama' report, Mexicans consume only about 17 pounds (7.7 kilograms) of beans annually. That's less than half of the 35.2 pounds (16 kilograms) consumed per year in 1980. A combination of factors, including the time it takes to cook dried beans, may be behind this. Amanda Gálvez, a researcher at Mexico's National Autonomous University, wrote that 'we look down at beans because it is considered ‘the food of the poor,’ and we are making a serious mistake,' because beans are a good source of protein. However, the health benefits aren't clear: The most common bean recipe in Mexico — refried beans — often contains a considerable dose of lard. Tortilla consumption has also fallen from nearly 220 pounds (100 kilograms) per capita annually in 2000 to about 165 pounds (75 kilograms) in 2024. Consumers have increasingly taken to buying bread and other bakery products instead of tortillas. Apart from the challenge of trying to change consumer habits, the policy also runs counter to market trends. While some countries are trying to encourage high-value varietal and specialized chocolate strains, Mexico is focusing on the cheapest products. While chocolate was first exported to the rest of the world from Mexico, Mexico's own production has fallen dramatically because of plant diseases and a lack of investment. It dropped from almost 50,000 tons in 2003 to about 28,000 tons in 2022. And while most Mexican homes may have a jar of instant coffee in their cupboards, that's not where the tendency — or consumer spending — is headed. According to a Technavio industry report, instant products accounted for only about 37% of the sales value of coffee in Mexico. Sheinbaum's focus on self-sufficiency in oil, energy and foodstuffs is a holdover from her predecessor and political mentor, former President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who left office on Sept. 30. López Obrador also appears to have passed on his nostalgia for a 1970s-style Mexico — including passenger rail service, state-owned industries, tight-knit families and small corner stores — to Sheinbaum.	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-food-agriculture-plan-beans-nostalgia-1e3bd9d5e1af9e57376d2509e90d1260	2024-10-22T10:00:28-07:00	
Cuba fights to come back from a nationwide blackout, then a storm that killed six	HAVANA (AP) — A small town in far eastern Cuba was recovering Tuesday from flooding that killed at least six people after Oscar crossed the island’s eastern coast as a tropical storm with winds and heavy rain. Cuba's capital was partially illuminated after a large-scale blackout generated a handful of protests and a stern government warning that any unrest would be punished. President Miguel Díaz-Canel said on state television that rescue and recovery work continued in the town of San Antonio del Sur and officials hadn't yet entered some flooded areas. People in Havana collected subsidized food Tuesday and said the country faced an intensive recovery period. 'There are lines everywhere you go,' city resident Carlos López said. 'You get to a place and there are obstacles and obstacles.' Tropical Storm Oscar disintegrated as it headed toward the Bahamas after making landfall in Cuba as a Category 1 hurricane. The remnants were expected to drop up to 4 inches (10 centimeters) of rain across the southeastern Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands. Modesto Hernández, who lived in central Havana, said Tuesday that 'we don’t know anything about what is going on.' 'These problems need to be solved now,' he said. 'We are in bad shape.' Díaz-Canel warned on national television Sunday that 'we're not going to allow any vandalism, or let anyone disturb people's tranquility.' The prolonged nationwide blackout that followed a massive outage Thursday night was part of countrywide energy problems that led to the largest protests in Cuba in almost 30 years, in July 2021. Those were followed by smaller local protests in October 2022 and March 2024. All are part of a deep economic crisis that has prompted the exodus of more than half a million Cubans to the U.S., with thousands more heading to Europe. The Cuban government and its allies blame the United States' 62-year-old trade embargo on the island for its economic problems but White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Monday that the Cuban government’s 'long-term mismanagement of its economic policy and resources has certainly increased the hardship of people in Cuba.' Power remains relatively cheap but increasingly unavailable. The Cuban government on state television Monday night said that it’s producing 1300 megawatts when peak demand can hit 3 gigawatts. Authorities said by Monday afternoon that about 80 percent of Havana had intermittent power but people remained fearful. Energy Minister Vicente de la O Levy said in a news conference he hoped that more reliable electricity would be restored by Tuesday morning but classes remained closed through at least Thursday. He said that Oscar would bring 'an additional inconvenience' to Cuba's recovery since it would affect key Cuban power plants, such as Felton in the city of Holguín, and Renté in Santiago de Cuba. Many of Havana's 2 million people resorted to cooking with improvised wood stoves on the streets before their food went bad in refrigerators. People lined up to buy subsidized food and few gas stations were open. The failure of the Antonio Guiteras plant on Friday was the latest problem with energy distribution in a country where electricity has been restricted and rotated among different regions at different times. The blackout was considered to be Cuba’s worst since Hurricane Ian hit the island as a Category 3 storm in 2022 and damaged power installations. It took days for the government to fix them. Local authorities initially said the outage stemmed from increased demand from small- and medium-sized companies and residential air conditioners. Later, the blackout got worse because of breakdowns in old thermoelectric plants that haven’t been properly maintained, and the lack of fuel to operate some facilities. ___ Associated Press writer Josh Boak in Washington contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/oscar-cuba-storm-caribbean-8c07aa1fe2b2b46dc9465a83acbaa745	2024-10-22T09:24:44-07:00	
The little airline that could — Lebanon's national carrier braves Israeli airstrikes	BEIRUT (AP) — Since Israel began bombarding Beirut's southern suburbs as part of its offensive against the Hezbollah militant group, Lebanon's national air carrier has become a local icon simply by continuing to do its job. Middle East Airlines is the only commercial airline still operating out of the Beirut airport, located on the coast next to the densely-populated suburbs where many of Hezbollah's operations are based. Unlike the bruising monthlong war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006, in which an Israeli strike almost immediately took Lebanon's only commercial airport out of commission, it has not been targeted in the current conflict. Capt. Mohammed Aziz, adviser to MEA chairman Mohamad El-Hout, said the airline has received assurances that Israel won't target its planes or the airport as long as they are used solely for civilian purposes. The carrier conducts a risk assessment each day to determine if it's safe to fly, he said. 'As long as you see us operating, it means our threat assessment says that we can operate,' Aziz said. 'We will never jeopardize the life of anyone.' Still, the sight of jetliners rising and descending as fire and clouds of smoke blacken the Beirut skyline can be alarming. Some of the most dramatic images making the rounds on social media depicting jets landing in fiery hellscapes have been AI-generated. And, Aziz said, the plumes of smoke that appear in news footage are often farther away from the airport than they appear. Still, some strikes have landed too close for comfort. On Monday night, one hit the coastal area of Ouzai, about 200 meters (650 feet) from one of the runways. There were no planes in the area at the time. Since the escalation began, many embassies have chartered extra commercial flights to get their citizens out. Other flights have carried Lebanese citizens to nearby destinations like Turkey and Cyprus to wait out the conflict. The number of daily MEA flights ranges from 32 to 40 — not much below the usual number for this time of year, Aziz said. The difference: now the flights usually depart Beirut full and return two-thirds or three-quarters empty. While many Lebanese have fled, others continue to fly in and out for business or family reasons. Elie Obeid, a business consultant, was scheduled to fly to Brussels this month for a seminar. After his original flight on Turkish Airlines was canceled, he booked on MEA. As his return flight was landing Saturday, heavy airstrikes were underway in the surrounding area. Onboard, Obeid was unaware of what was happening until the plane landed and he opened his phone to a barrage of messages. He said he had mixed feelings about the experience. 'I do appreciate the fact that they are still flying, since that’s our only connection with the outer world currently,' he said. 'But at the same time it is very risky. We should have been told that strikes were happening, and maybe even they could have told the pilot to request to land in Cyprus for a while until the strikes ended.' John Cox, a U.S.-based former airline pilot who is now an aviation-safety consultant, said when there's a potential threat, it's the captain’s call whether or not to proceed, and it’s not unusual for passengers to be left in the dark. Telling them about a threat they can’t control 'doesn’t really do any good, and it stresses them out. So, I would be very hesitant to do that,' he said. But, he added, 'I’m not sure that I want to fly into an area of open conflict like that with passengers on board.' It is 'pretty unusual,' Cox said, for a commercial airline to decide that operating in an active war zone is an 'acceptable level of risk.' 'When you’re in an area with ongoing military operations there’s an awful lot of variables,' he said. 'Even just keeping the airplanes ... so that they’re not in the same airspace at the same time, that becomes very difficult.' Aziz said the airline is in 'continuous coordination' with the Lebanese government and security agencies, and attempts to mitigate the risk by spacing out flights so the airport is not too crowded at any given time. About 20% of its fleet is parked outside of Lebanon to reduce potential damage. They have also taken measures to adjust for the frequent GPS jamming that is used by Israel to ward off missile and drone attacks but also disrupts civilian navigation technology. Other airlines have different considerations, Aziz said. Their trips to Lebanon might be 'one flight out of 200 or 300 flights per day, so spending two or three hours a day just to make a risk assessment for one flight is a waste of time for them,' he said. 'But for us it’s a necessity, because if we don’t do it we’ll stop operation completely.' He added, 'It’s our duty, of course, to maintain this link between Lebanon and the outside world.' For many, having that link is a comfort — even if the journey might be harrowing. Marie-Jose Daoud, editor-in-chief of an online journalism platform, flew to Cyprus with her parents a few days after the massive strike in Beirut's southern suburbs that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. As they were waiting for their flight, she saw on the news that the Israeli military had issued evacuation notices for two areas close to the airport. Soon after, she heard the muffled sounds of airstrikes through the airport's soundproofed walls. As the plane took off, the crew and most of the passengers remained calm. One man pointed out the window to show his young son the smoke rising. The plane made it safely to Cyprus. Daoud said her parents want to return home despite the risks, so she is traveling back with them in a few days. She plans to leave again soon after, but she knows she can 'come back at a day's notice' if her family needs her. 'As long as the airport is open, I know that (MEA) are going to be flying,' she said.	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-hezbollah-middle-east-airlines-mea-4abfae7f6165b7b34083e2512272ce54	2024-10-22T09:09:52-07:00	
AP PHOTOS: Images capture exact moments an Israeli missile strikes building in Beirut	BEIRUT (AP) — Taking cover behind a large tree, an Associated Press photographer pointed his camera toward a Beirut apartment building the Israeli military warned was in its sights. When a missile plunged from the sky moments later, journalist and lens were perfectly positioned to document the trail of destruction — second by second, frame by frame. 'I heard the sound of the missile whistling, headed toward the building and then I started filming,' photographer Bilal Hussein said Tuesday, hours after Israeli forces launched the attack. The images Hussein captured of the projectile, frozen in mid-flight before obliterating the structure, provide a striking look at the speed, power and devastation of modern warfare. The strike on Tuesday came roughly 40 minutes after an Israeli military spokesman posted a warning in Arabic on social media, notifying people in and around a pair of buildings on Beirut’s southern outskirts that that they should evacuate the area. He did not explain why the buildings were being targeted, other than to say they were near 'interests and facilities' associated with the Hezbollah militant group. The warning prompted many people to flee the busy, densely populated neighborhood, even as others, including a few journalists, kept watch. By the time of the attack the building had been evacuated and there were no reports of casualties Tuesday. Minutes before the missile brought down the building, two smaller projectiles were fired at the roof in what Israel’s military often refers to as warning strikes, according to AP journalists at the scene. It is a practice Israel has followed in staging strikes in Gaza during past wars. When the primary missile hurtled toward the building Tuesday it was a blur, but Hussein’s camera provided witness. One picture showed the missile arching through the air. Another captured it a fragment of a second before it smashed through a lower-floor balcony. In the images that followed, a cloud of smoke and debris billowed outward as the building collapsed. Hussein, who has spent years covering conflicts in Iraq and Lebanon since joining the AP in 2004, says he has become accustomed to the sounds of explosions. The night before the building was destroyed, he filmed more than a dozen Israeli strikes nearby, 'I have the ability to control my reactions in critical moments and maintain stability as much as possible,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-beirut-israel-missile-41be424dcf3031457bd93acd0cb3389e	2024-10-22T09:08:04-07:00	
A UN report says it could take 350 years for Gaza to rebuild if it remains under a blockade	U.N. agencies have long warned that it could take decades to rebuild Gaza after Israel's offensive against Hamas, one of the deadliest and most destructive military campaigns since World War II. Now, more than a year into the war, a new report speaks in terms of centuries. The U.N. Conference on Trade and Development said in a report released Monday that if the war ends tomorrow and Gaza returns to the status quo before Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, it could take 350 years for its battered economy to return to its precarious prewar level. Before the war, Gaza was under an Israeli and Egyptian blockade imposed after Hamas seized power in 2007. Four previous wars and divisions between Hamas and the Western-backed Palestinian Authority in the West Bank also took a toll on Gaza's economy. The current war has caused staggering destruction across the territory, with entire neighborhoods obliterated and roads and critical infrastructure in ruins. Mountains of rubble laced with decomposing bodies and unexploded ordnance would have to be cleared before rebuilding could begin. 'Once a ceasefire is reached, a return to the pre-October 2023 status quo would not put Gaza on the path needed for recovery and sustainable development,' the report said. 'If the 2007–2022 growth trend returns, with an average growth rate of 0.4 percent, it will take Gaza 350 years just to restore the GDP levels of 2022.' Even then, GDP per capita would decline 'continuously and precipitously' as the population grows, it said. Israeli officials did not respond to a request for comment on the report. 350 years is more of a calculation than a prediction Three hundred and fifty years is a long time. It would be as though England and the Netherlands were only now recovering from the wars they fought against each other in the late 1600s. Rami Alazzeh, author of the report, said he based the calculation on the decimation of the economy during the first seven months of the war, and how long it would take to restore it at the GDP growth rate Gaza averaged from 2007 until 2022. Gross domestic product, or GDP, is the sum total of all goods and services produced in a country or territory. 'The message is the recovery in Gaza depends on the conditions in which the recovery would happen,' he said. 'We’re not saying that it will take Gaza 350 years to recover because that means that Gaza will never recover.' At the end of January, the World Bank estimated $18.5 billion of damage — nearly the combined economic output of the West Bank and Gaza in 2022. That was before some intensely destructive Israeli ground operations, including in the southern border city of Rafah. A U.N. assessment in September based on satellite footage found roughly a quarter of all structures in Gaza had been destroyed or severely damaged. It said around 66% of structures, including more than 227,000 housing units, had sustained at least some damage. The Shelter Cluster, an international coalition of aid providers led by the Norwegian Refugee Council, calculated how long it would take to rebuild all the destroyed homes under what was known as the Gaza Reconstruction Mechanism. That process was established after the 2014 war to facilitate some reconstruction under heavy Israeli surveillance. It found that under that setup, it would take 40 years to rebuild all the homes. Even in best-case circumstances, recovery could take decades The report says that even under the most optimistic scenario, with a projected growth rate of 10%, Gaza’s recovery would still take decades. 'Assuming no military operation, and freedom of movement of goods and people and a significant level of investment, and population growth of 2.8 percent per year, UNCTAD estimates that Gaza’s GDP per capita will return to its 2022 level by 2050,' it said. A separate report released by the U.N. Development Program on Tuesday said that with major investment and the lifting of economic restrictions, the Palestinian economy as a whole, including the West Bank, could be back on track by 2034. In the absence of both, its predictions align with those of UNCTAD. The more positive scenarios appear unlikely. Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted another 250 when they stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Around 100 captives are still inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel's offensive has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, who don't distinguish combatants from civilians but say more than half the dead are women and children. It has displaced around 90% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million, forcing hundreds of thousands into squalid tent camps. Israel says the blockade is needed to prevent Hamas from importing arms and is unlikely to lift it as long as the group has a presence inside Gaza. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will maintain open-ended security control over the territory. Since May, Israel has controlled all of Gaza's border crossings. U.N. agencies and humanitarian groups say they have struggled to bring in food and emergency aid because of Israeli restrictions, ongoing fighting and the breakdown of law and order inside Gaza. There's also no indication that international donors are willing to fund the rebuilding of Gaza as long as it remains in the grip of war or under Israeli occupation. Arab Gulf states like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have said they will only do so if there is a pathway to a Palestinian state, something to which Netanyahu is deeply opposed. Meanwhile, the war rages with no end in sight. This month, Israel launched another major operation in northern Gaza — the most heavily destroyed part of the territory — saying Hamas had regrouped there. 'Everybody now calls for a cease-fire, but people forget that once the cease-fire is done, the 2.2 million Palestinians will wake up having no homes, children having no schools, no universities, no hospitals, no roads,' Alazzeh said. All that will take a long time to rebuild, and could prove impossible under the blockade. 'If we go back to where it was before, and we shouldn’t go back to the way it was before,' he said, 'then I think it means that Gaza’s done.' ___ Follow AP’s Gaza coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-gaza-reconstruction-un-0ac47ddba7401e102b2bb95e85f3e105	2024-10-22T09:06:32-07:00	
Biden heaps praise on Slovenia PM for aiding release of Americans in major US-Russia prisoner swap	WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden heaped praise on Slovenian Prime Minister Robert Golob on Tuesday for his role in the recent seven-nation prisoner swap that freed Americans Evan Gershkovich, Alsu Kurmasheva and Paul Whelan from Russian prison. The deal, completed in August, was the largest U.S.-Russian prisoner swap in post-Soviet history, involving 24 people, many months of negotiations and concessions from other European countries — including Slovenia — that released Russians in their custody as part of the exchange. 'I want to thank you for your diplomacy and for your support and your leadership,' Biden said at the start of his Oval Office meeting with the Central European leader. 'You made it possible. That’s not hyperbole. You made it possible.' Slovenia agreed to the release of Artem Viktorovich Dultsev and Anna Valerevna Dultseva, two Russian spies who were living for years in the Slovenian capital Ljubljana while posing as Argentines operating a startup IT company and an online art gallery. The couple, who had two children, reportedly used Ljubljana as their base to travel to neighboring NATO and EU member states, relay orders from Moscow and bring cash to other Russian sleeper agents. They were arrested in 2022. Golob said the prisoner swap demonstrated that with a 'little help of true friends, nothing is impossible.' He is just the third Slovenian prime minister to be invited to Washington for a White House sit down with a president. Prime Minister Janez Jansa was the country's last prime minister to get a White House meeting with a U.S. president, when George W. Bush hosted him in 2006. (Prime Minister Borut Pahor visited the White House in February 2011 to meet then U.S. Vice-President Biden. During that visit President Barack Obama briefly joined both leaders.) Gershkovich, a Wall Street Journal reporter, had spent 16 months in a Russian prison; Kurmasheva, a Russian-American editor for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, was also arrested last year; and Whelan, a former U.S. Marine, had been in Russian detention since his 2018 arrest. Russia convicted all three on what the White House rejected as trumped-up charges of espionage for Gershkovich and Whelan and spreading of false information for Kurmasheva. Kremlin critic Vladimir Kara Murza, an American green card holder who won a Pulitzer Prize while in Russian detention, was also released as part of the swap. Kara-Murza, 42, is a Russian politician, author and historian who has been imprisoned in Russia since April 2022. He was convicted of treason last year for denouncing the war in Ukraine. 'We made it clear to anyone who questions whether our allies matter,' Biden said. The two leaders' agenda included talks on the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, energy security, and their countries' shared approach to the Western Balkans, according to the White House. Golob has also been an outspoken critic of Israel's handling of the war in Gaza. Last month, Golob in his address at the annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations called on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to 'stop the bloodshed.' 'Mr. Netanyahu, stop this war now,' he said, pounding the lectern for emphasis. The meeting with Golob comes on the heels of Biden's visit to Berlin last week that was made in part to thank German Chancellor Olaf Scholz for his country's cooperation in the prisoner swap. Scholz agreed to release Vadim Krasikov, a Russian who was convicted of the 2019 murder of a 40-year-old Georgian citizen and later claimed asylum in Germany.	https://apnews.com/article/biden-slovenia-prisoner-exchange-nato-2305a3f501b31c421333fa805cc20cdb	2024-10-22T07:53:59-07:00	
France defends restrictions on Israeli firms supplying Middle East wars and says it's not a boycott	PARIS (AP) — France's government on Tuesday defended its decision to bar Israeli companies supplying the wars in the Middle East from exhibiting at an upcoming trade fair outside Paris. Organizers of the Nov. 4-Nov. 7 naval defense exhibition, called Euronaval, posted on the event's website that Israeli firms can take part in the show and 'may have an exhibition stand, provided that their products are not used in military operations in Gaza and Lebanon.' The organizers attributed the restrictions to French government decisions taken earlier this month. Addressing parliament Tuesday, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot said the policy doesn't amount to a boycott of Israeli firms. But he also said it would be 'incoherent' for France to allow the promotion of weapons used in the wars when Paris is also pushing for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza and Lebanon. 'Therefore, we have indicated to the Israeli authorities, with whom we communicate very regularly, that the participation in the form of stands by companies should respect this balance,' Barrot said. 'Also, companies whose equipment is not used in offensive actions in Gaza and Lebanon will naturally be able to have stands at the exhibition,' he said. In a post Sunday on X, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz urged French President Emmanuel Macron to rescind the restrictions, calling them 'unacceptable' and 'anti-democratic.' 'France, as well as the entire Western world, should stand with us -- not against us,' Katz posted. Barrot reiterated that France supports Israel's right to defend itself. The minister cited, as an example, France's decision to continue exporting components that he said are used in Israel's 'Iron Dome' air-defense system. 'On the other hand, it would be incoherent to enable any promotion of weapons used in Gaza and Lebanon, which lead to unacceptable damage for the civilian populations, when this government and our country is calling for an immediate cease-fire,' the French minister said.	https://apnews.com/article/france-israel-euronaval-middle-east-wars-205705adbf8c2e94ea4092f0c85ef34e	2024-10-22T07:00:02-07:00	
Several casualties feared after a gasoline truck explodes by a highway near Uganda's capital	KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) — A Ugandan police spokesman says several people might be dead after a fuel truck exploded next to a highway in the East African country. Patrick Onyango said the truck had overturned after an accident and later exploded in a town just outside Kampala, the capital. A video shared online by an onlooker appeared to show people scooping up fuel from the truck, a dangerous scene that echoed a similar incident in Nigeria last week that killed more than 140 people, including children. People who rush to collect fuel from stricken trucks hope to sell it for money. There have been similar incidents over the years across East Africa. At least 62 people were killed in Tanzania in 2019 as they attempted to siphon fuel out of a damaged truck.	https://apnews.com/article/uganda-fuel-truck-explosion-ae9b329cbd20e0799fab949cf5e8aefe	2024-10-22T06:45:17-07:00	
EU observers flag irregularities and 'alteration of results' in Mozambique elections	JOHANNESBURG (AP) — European Union election observers have flagged irregularities in Mozambique's election as the country awaits the announcement of official results this week amid protests by opposition supporters and the recent killing of two prominent opposition figures. The EU observer mission said Tuesday that some of its 179 election observers deployed to the country had been prevented from observing tabulation processes in some districts, provinces and at national level. The mission also noted 'unjustified alteration' of election results at some polling stations. 'The EU EOM (election observer mission) has continued to observe the electoral process, although EU observers were prevented to observe tabulation processes in some districts and provinces, as well as at the national level. 'To date, the EU EOM has noted irregularities during counting and unjustified alteration of election results at polling station and district level,' chief observer Laura Ballarín said in a statement on Tuesday. Ballarin called on electoral bodies in the country to conduct the tabulation process in a transparent way to ensure the credibility of the election results. 'The publication of disaggregated results by polling stations is not only a matter of good practice, but also a strong safeguard for the integrity of results,' Ballarin said. Tensions around the country's election escalated after the killing of two prominent opposition figures last Friday, followed by protests by opposition supporters on Monday, which were quelled by police firing tear gas at protesters. Elvino Dias, a lawyer and adviser to opposition presidential candidate Venancio Mondlane, was killed when gunmen riddled his car with bullets in the capital, Maputo. Paulo Guambe, the spokesperson for the PODEMOS opposition party that is backing Mondlane, was also in the car and was killed. Mondlane this week called for nationwide protests, alleging that the governing Frelimo party was rigging the election and his supporters faced off with security forces, raising concerns about further election violence once official results have been released. The U.S State Department on Monday condemned the killing of both men and called for a thorough investigation, while urging those aggrieved by election results to file their complaints through official channels. 'We urge all state institutions, political leaders, citizens and stakeholders to resolve electoral disputes peacefully and lawfully, rejecting violence and inflammatory rhetoric. 'We also call on all Mozambicans to turn to peaceful means of filing electoral grievances and reject violence and violent rhetoric,' it said. The election results are expected to be announced this week before being validated by the country's Constitutional Council, which will validate them after handling all the disputes raised by political parties. The governing Frelimo party's candidate, David Chapo, is expected to succeed President Filipe Nyusi as the party leads the polls so far and is expected to extend its 49-year rule. ___ AP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa	https://apnews.com/article/mozambique-election-irregularities-results-protest-killings-50ea2d587e563dece5454253547897d4	2024-10-22T06:30:02-07:00	
Poland alleges Russian sabotage and is closing one of Moscow's consulates	WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Poland’s foreign minister said Tuesday that he is ordering the closure of one of three Russian consulates in the country in response to acts of sabotage including arson attacks that he said were sponsored by Moscow. Radek Sikorski demanded that Russia stop what he called hybrid war actions against Poland and its Western allies, warning that Poland reserves the right 'to take further decisive action' if they don't stop. 'As the minister of foreign affairs, I have information that the Russian Federation is behind attempts at sabotage, both in Poland and in allied countries,' Sikorski told reporters in Warsaw. He said he was withdrawing consent for the Russian Consulate in Poznan, and that its personnel would be unwelcome in Poland. Russia also has consulates in Gdansk and Krakow. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova promised 'a painful response to yet another hostile act' in comments to state news agency RIA Novosti. Sikorski cited the arrest in January of a Ukrainian citizen who he said admitted that Russian agents told him to carry out an arson attack in the city of Wroclaw. The attack was foiled, and the 51-year-old man, identified only as Serhii S., is awaiting a court trial. Sikorski alleged that about 20 such sabotage suspects are under investigation in Poland, and that he has knowledge of other such arson plans in allied countries. 'Putin must be deterred,' the foreign minister said in an interview Monday on the private TVN broadcaster. 'We have other such arson attacks all over Europe, all over Europe, and we know about the Russian plans for further arson attacks.' The pro-European Union government in Warsaw says Russia is pursuing acts of hybrid war against Poland and other Western countries in retaliation for their support for Poland's neighbor Ukraine in its struggle against Russia’s invasion. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/poland-russia-ukraine-hybrid-war-sabotage-66a7c9c683e00f08dc46e4178776d7b9	2024-10-22T06:28:08-07:00	
Black motorist fatally shot by London police officer in 2022 was a member of a violent gang	LONDON (AP) — A Black motorist killed by a London police marksman who was acquitted of murder this week was a member of a violent gang and allegedly shot a rival a week earlier, according to court records that were allowed to be published Tuesday. Jurors were not told about Chris Kaba’s gang ties during the trial that ended with Sgt. Martyn Blake being found not guilty Monday in the Central Criminal Court. Kaba, 24, was shot on Sept. 5, 2022, after ramming police vehicles during a traffic stop. Police did not know who was driving the vehicle, but it was an Audi Q8 that had been used as a getaway car in an unsolved shooting a night earlier. Blake fired a single round through the windshield of the Audi because he said he thought fellow officers’ lives were in danger. Kaba was found to be unarmed. Prosecutors defended their decision to charge Blake in an exceptionally rare case against a British police officer for a death in the line of duty. They argued at trial that Blake misjudged the risk to his colleagues, exaggerated the threat after the shooting and aimed for Kaba’s head. Blake denied those assertions. A judge had said the details of Kaba's criminal record and alleged involvement in other shootings were irrelevant for jurors to consider in determining whether Blake used unreasonable force. Justice James Goss ordered news media not to report any of those details. Following the trial, the news media challenged Goss' order, and he lifted the restrictions on the information that had emerged during earlier proceedings. The Metropolitan Police supported the release of the information to remove any 'misleading impression' about Kaba's character in the hopes it could quell violence toward officers, particularly on Saturday when an annual demonstration is held in London by family members of people who have died in police custody. 'If the information in relation to Mr. Kaba’s character is shared with the public, those who would seek to provoke anti-police violence would gain less support and the overall likelihood of disorder and the risk to public safety would reduce,' Deputy Assistant Commissioner Stuart Cundy said in a court statement. Kaba’s mother, Helen Lumuanganu, had asked the court not to release the details until an inquest could be held into her son’s death, which could take years. Dozens of demonstrators held a peaceful protest Monday night outside the Old Bailey courthouse where the trial was held, chanting for justice for Kaba. 'Despite this verdict, we won’t be silenced,' his family said in a statement. 'We are deeply grateful to everyone who stood by us and fought for justice. We will continue fighting for Chris, for justice, and for real change. Chris’ life mattered, and nothing can take that away from us.' Information from previous trials indicated Kaba had shot a gang rival on the dance floor of a nightclub on Aug. 30 and then chased the victim outside and shot him again before fleeing. The victim, who was hit twice in the leg, survived. The vehicle he was driving on the night he was killed had been used to drive him to the club that night and was also linked to another shooting in May. Kaba had convictions for fighting and possessing a knife and had served several stints behind bars, including a four-year sentence in 2017 for possessing an imitation firearm. Kaba, who had been a rapper and was about to become a father, was facing a possible court order aimed at curbing gang behavior at the time of his death. Fatal shootings by police in the U.K. are rare. In the year to March 2023, officers in England and Wales who are authorized to carry a gun fired their weapons at people 10 times and killed three, according to official statistics. The shooting renewed racism allegations against the Met police, also known as Scotland Yard, as it had been trying to restore confidence following a series of scandals and an independent review that found it mired in sexism, homophobia and institutional racism. The decision to charge Blake created a backlash from some of his specially trained firearms colleagues who refused to carry their weapons in a show of solidarity. The Met was briefly forced to call on neighboring departments and the military for backup. The union representing Met police officers applauded the decision to lift the reporting restrictions on Kaba's gang involvement and said Blake never should have faced trial.	https://apnews.com/article/london-police-acquitted-black-motorist-8e1242c9be7543f0c41d4efc8c62dc13	2024-10-22T06:01:21-07:00	
FBI says it's investigating leak of secret documents on Israel's possible attack plans	WASHINGTON (AP) — The FBI said Tuesday that it is investigating the unauthorized release of classified documents on Israel’s preparation for a potential retaliatory attack on Iran. White House national security spokesman John Kirby said Monday that the Biden administration is still not certain if the classified information was leaked or hacked but that officials don’t have any indication at this point of 'additional documents like this finding their way into the public domain.' The Associated Press reported Saturday that U.S. officials were investigating the release. The FBI confirmed the investigation for the first time on Tuesday and said in a statement that it is 'working closely with our partners in the Department of Defense and Intelligence Community.' It did not comment further. The documents are attributed to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency and note that Israel is still moving military assets in place to conduct a military strike in response to Iran’s blistering ballistic missile attack on Oct. 1. They were shareable within the 'Five Eyes,' an intelligence alliance comprised of the U.S., Great Britain, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. Marked top secret, the documents first appeared online Friday on the Telegram messaging app and quickly spread among Telegram channels popular with Iranians.	https://apnews.com/article/fbi-israel-classified-documents-iran-c12111c65413a132ee3301684825259a	2024-10-22T05:10:15-07:00	
Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny's posthumous memoir is a testament to resilience	NEW YORK (AP) — In a memoir released eight months after he died in prison, Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny never loses faith that his cause is worth suffering for while also acknowledging he wished he could have written a very different book. 'There is a mishmash of bits and pieces, a traditional narrative followed by a prison diary,' Navalny writes in 'Patriot,' which was published Tuesday, and is, indeed, a traditional narrative followed by a prison diary. 'I so much do not want my book to be yet another prison diary. Personally I find them interesting to read, but as a genre — enough is surely enough.' The final 200 pages of Navalny's 479-page book do, in some ways, have the characteristics of other prison diaries or of such classic Russian literature as Alexander Solzhenitsyn's 'One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich.' He tracks the boredom, isolation, exhaustion, suffering and absurdity of prison life, while working in asides about everything from 19th century French literature to Billie Eilish. But 'Patriot' also reads as a testament to a famed dissident's extraordinary battle against despair as the Russian authorities gradually increase their crackdown against him, and even shares advice on how to confront the worst and still not lose hope. 'The important thing is not to torment yourself with anger, hatred, fantasies of revenge, but to move instantly to acceptance. That can be hard,' he writes. 'The process going on in your head is by no means straightforward, but if you find yourself in a bad situation, you should try this. It works, as long as you think everything through seriously.' In recent years, Navalny had become an international symbol of resistance. A lawyer by training, he started out as an anti-corruption campaigner, but soon turned into a politician with aspirations for public office and eventually became the main challenger to Russia’s longtime president, Vladimir Putin. Navalny’s widow, Yulia Navalnaya, oversaw the book’s completion. In a promotional interview for 'Patriot,' she told the BBC that she would run for president if she ever returned to Russia -– an unlikely move with Putin in power, Navalnaya acknowledged. She has been arrested in absentia in Russia on charges of involvement with an extremist group. Putin 'needs to be in a Russian prison, to feel everything what not just my husband, but all the prisoners in Russia' feel, Navalnaya said during an interview on CBS' '60 Minutes.' Navalnaya has vowed to continue her late husband’s fight. She has recorded regular video addresses to her supporters and has been meeting with Western leaders and top officials, advocating for Russians who oppose Putin and his war in Ukraine. She had two children with her husband, who in his book writes of his immediate attraction to her and their enduring bond, praising Navalnaya as a soulmate who 'could discuss the most difficult matters with me without a lot of drama and hand-wringing.' During the first section of his book, Navalny reflects on the fall of the Soviet Union, his disenchantment with 1990s Russian leader Boris Yeltsin, his early crusades against corruption, his entry into public life, and his discovery that he did not need to look far for a politician 'who would undertake all sorts of needed, interesting projects and cooperate directly with the Russian people.' 'I wanted and waited, and one day I realized I could be that person myself,' he wrote. His vision of a 'beautiful Russia of the future,' where leaders are freely and fairly elected, official corruption is tamed, and democratic institutions work -– as well as his strong charisma and sardonic humor -– earned him widespread support across the country's 11 time zones. He had young, energetic activists by his side — a team that resembled 'a fancy startup' rather than a clandestine revolutionary operation, according to his memoir. 'From the outside we looked like a bunch of Moscow hipsters,' he writes, and together they put out colorful, professionally produced videos exposing official corruption. Those garnered millions of views on YouTube and prompted mass rallies even as the authorities cracked down harder on dissent. The authorities responded to Navalny’s growing popularity by levying multiple charges against him, his allies and even family members. They jailed him often and shut down his entire political infrastructure -– the Foundation for Fighting Corruption he started in 2011 and a network of several dozen regional offices. In 2020, Navalny survived a nerve agent poisoning he blamed on the Kremlin, which denied involvement. He describes it in great detail in the very beginning of the book, recounting, 'This is too much, and I'm about to die.' His family and allies fought for him to be airlifted to Germany for treatment, and after recovering there for five months, he returned to Russia, only to be arrested and sent to prison, where he would spend the last three years of his life. In the memoir, Navalny recalls telling his wife while still hospitalized in Berlin that 'of course' he will go back to Russia. The pressure on him continued behind bars, intensifying after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 and ratcheted its clampdown on dissent to unprecedented levels. In messages he was able to get out of prison, Navalny described harrowing conditions of solitary confinement, where he was placed for months on end for various minor infractions prison officials relentlessly accused him of, sleep deprivation, meager diet and lack of medical help. In October 2023, three of his lawyers were arrested and two more were put on a wanted list. In December 2023, the authorities transferred Navalny to a penal colony of the highest security level in the Russian penitentiary system in a remote town above the Arctic Circle. In February 2024, 47-year-old Navalny suddenly died there; the circumstances and the cause of his death still remain a mystery. Yulia Navalnaya and his allies say the Kremlin killed him, while the authorities argue that Navalny died of 'natural causes,' but wouldn’t reveal any details of what happened. Tens of thousands of Russians attended his funeral on the outskirts of Moscow in March in a rare show of defiance in a country where any street rally or even single pickets often result in immediate arrests and prison. For days afterward, people brought flowers to the grave, and a handful even came Tuesday. 'I dream of as many people as possible reading this book, because it seems to me that everyone will learn something new about Alexei. (Everyone) will laugh and cry a bit. He was so cool: strong and brave, kind and funny. The best. And the dearest,' Yulia Navalnaya said on X. Navalny's team has said the book will be available in Russian, the language he wrote it in, but shipping to his homeland and its neighbor Belarus won't be possible 'as we cannot guarantee delivery and the absence of problems at customs.' The Kremlin and Russian state media ignored the release, much as they ignored many other developments related to Navalny, whose name Putin and other top officials almost never uttered in public. —- Litvinova reported from Tallinn, Estonia.	https://apnews.com/article/navalny-memoir-putin-russia-opposition-patriot-8e12b158f1ae44e8274eebbdad194847	2024-10-22T04:08:30-07:00	
IMF's view: The global fight against high inflation is 'almost won'	WASHINGTON (AP) — The global war against inflation has largely been won — and at surprisingly little cost to economic growth, the International Monetary Fund declared Tuesday. In its latest assessment of the global economy, the IMF predicted that worldwide inflation will cool from 6.7% last year to 5.8% this year and to 4.3% in 2025. It estimates that inflation will fall even faster in the world’s wealthy countries, from 4.6% last year to 2.6% this year and 2% — the target range for most major central banks — in 2025. The slowdown in inflation, after years of crushing price increases in the aftermath of the pandemic, led the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank to cut interest rates this year after they had aggressively raised them to try to tame inflation. 'The battle against inflation is almost won,″ Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the IMF's chief economist, told reporters Tuesday. 'In most countries, inflation is hovering close to central bank targets.″ Inflation had accelerated when the world economy recovered with unexpected speed from the COVID-19 recession, leaving factories, freight yards, ports and businesses overwhelmed with customer orders and creating shortages, delays and higher prices. The high borrowing rates engineered by major central banks, along with the end of supply chain logjams, brought inflation dramatically down from the four-decade highs it hit in mid-2022. And to the surprise of forecasters, the economy — especially the largest, in the United States — continued to grow and employers kept hiring despite higher borrowing costs. 'The decline in inflation without a global recession is a major achievement,'' Gourinchas wrote in a blog post that accompanied the IMF's latest World Economic Outlook. The IMF, a 190-nation lending organization, works to promote economic growth and financial stability and reduce global poverty. On Tuesday, besides sketching a milder inflation outlook, it upgraded its economic expectations for the United States this year, while lowering its estimates for growth in Europe and China. The IMF left its forecast for global growth unchanged at a relatively lackluster 3.2% for 2024. The IMF expects the U.S. economy to expand 2.8% this year, down slightly from 2.9% in 2023 but an improvement on the 2.6% it had forecast for 2024 back in July. Growth in the United States has been led by strong consumer spending, fueled by healthy gains in inflation-adjusted wages. Next year, though, the IMF expects the U.S. economy to decelerate to 2.2% growth. With a new presidential administration and Congress in place, the IMF envisions the nation's job market losing some momentum in 2025 as the government begins seeking to curb huge budget deficits by slowing spending, raising taxes or some combination of both. The IMF expects China's economic growth to slow from 5.2% last year to 4.8% this year and 4.5% in 2025. The world’s No. 2 economy has been hobbled by a collapse in its housing market and by weak consumer confidence — problems only partly offset by strong exports. The 20 European countries that share the euro currency are collectively expected to eke out 0.8% growth this year, twice the 2023 expansion of 0.4% but a slight downgrade from the 0.9% the IMF had forecast three months ago for 2024. The German economy, hurt by a slump in manufacturing and real estate, isn’t expected to grow at all this year. Now that interest rates are coming down and likely to aid the world’s economies, the IMF warned, the need to contain enormous government deficits will likely put a brake on growth. The overall world economy is expected to grow 3.2% in both 2024 and 2025, down a tick from 3.3% last year. That’s an unimpressive standard: From 2000 through 2019, before the pandemic upended economic activity, global growth had averaged 3.8% a year. The IMF also continues to express concern that geopolitical tension, including antagonism between the United States and China, could make world trade less efficient. The concern is that more countries would increasingly do business with their allies instead of seeking the lowest-priced or best-made foreign goods. Still, global trade, measured by volume, is expected to grow 3.1% this year and 3.4% in 2025, improving on 2023’s anemic 0.8% increase. Gourinchas also suggested that economic growth could end up being weaker than expected if countries take steps to reduce immigration, which has helped ease labor shortages in the United States and other advanced economies. And he said armed conflicts, like those in Ukraine and the Middle East, could also threaten the economic outlook. India’s economy is expected to 7% this year and 6.5% in 2025. While still strong, that pace would be down from 8.2% growth last year, a result of consumers slowing their spending after a post-pandemic boom. The IMF predicts that Japan’s economy, hurt by production problems in the auto industry and a slowdown in tourism, will expand by a meager 0.3% this year before accelerating to 1.1% growth in 2025. The United Kingdom is projected to register 1.1% growth this year, up from a dismal 0.3% in 2023, with falling interest rates helping spur stronger consumer spending.	https://apnews.com/article/imf-global-economy-inflation-growth-federal-reserve-715442446ade21f91548095ed46ba312	2024-10-22T04:02:21-07:00	
The Latest: Trump and Harris court Latino voters as early voting starts in key battleground states	With just over two weeks before the 2024 presidential election, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are hitting the campaign trail in strategic battleground states. Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: Trump again rails against green power sources He claimed that switching to all-electric trucks would require rebuilding every one of the country’s bridges and that solar fields kill rabbits. He says he recently saw a a solar field 'that looked like it took up half the desert.' 'It’s all steel and glass and wires. And it looks like hell,' he said. 'You see rabbits, they get caught in it.' Trump often rails against wind power, saying the turbines 'kill all the birds' and confuse whales. He’s been more complimentary of electric cars since he received the backing of Tesla CEO Elon Musk. But he is criticizing their range and weight at an event with Latino supporters Tuesday, claiming the nation would need to rebuild every one of its bridges if truck fleets swap diesel for electric vehicles to handle the extra weight. Trump criticized the Biden administration for the leak of secret documents detailing Israel’s preparation for a potential retaliatory attack on Iran He called it a 'bad thing.' 'Can you imagine somebody doing that? That’s the enemy. I guess that maybe is the enemy from within,' he said, repeating the phrase he’s used in recent speeches to refer to Democratic lawmakers such as U.S. Reps. Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff. 'We just can’t stand for this incompetence anymore.' The FBI said Tuesday that it’s investigating the unauthorized release of these documents. At his event, Trump compliments Goya, the largest, Hispanic-owned food company in the country The company’s CEO, Bob Unanue, is a vocal supporter. 'It’s actually quite good out of the can,' Trump says of the company known for its beans and other products. 'I eat it whenever I can,' he claims. Bruce Springsteen is holding campaign concerts for Kamala Harris starting Thursday in Atlanta Former President Barack Obama will also be there. Springsteen will hold another concert with Obama on Monday in Philadelphia. A senior campaign official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said more concerts will be announced in the coming days. — Chris Megerian Trump is using the roundtable with Latin American leaders to complain about negative ads against him and criticize Harris’ intellect At the event, Trump said Harris is 'slow' and has a 'low IQ.' 'We don’t need another low IQ person,' he said. Trump criticized Harris for her schedule Tuesday, which includes meetings in Washington and interviews with Telemundo and NBC, but no public events 'She’s sleeping right now,' he said. 'This is not what you want.' Trump’s jabs come after Harris tried to cast him as 'exhausted' after he pulled out of several interviews — though Trump has had a busy schedule of interviews with conservative outlets and podcasts. Trump will be speaking to Hispanic voters and leaders in a smaller gathering at Trump National Doral Miami In the opening remarks, notable Florida Republicans including Miami Mayor Francis Suarez and U.S. Sen. Rick Scott proclaimed Trump’s record in supporting the Hispanic community during his previous term. Suarez was one of three Florida Republicans running for president in the earlier campaign cycle, but despite running against Trump, the mayor endorsed the former president in March. Suarez said that under Trump’s term, Hispanics experienced the lowest unemployment and the biggest reduction in poverty. Scott, who’s running for reelection, emphasized Trump would be the best to handle Latin American conflicts and fight against dictatorial regimes, where the families of many voters in the crowd escaped from. Miami is home to one of the largest Hispanic communities in the country, with about 70% of Miami-Dade County’s population identifying as Hispanic according to 2023 Census data. Trump is starting his day at a roundtable with Latino leaders at his Doral golf club in Florida It’s a beautiful day in Miami, with blue skies framing the property’s many palm trees. US Sen. Rick Scott spoke to a crowd of about 100 Hispanic voters at the Trump National Doral Miami Scott’s main message to Hispanic voters was that under Trump’s presidency, Hispanic voters were better off, because the border was more secure and inflation was lower. Scott is saying Harris’ policy will institute price controls, which is socialism. He said her administration would raise taxes. 'The Hispanic vote is the deciding factor. If you want someone to fight for Latin America, Trump’s going to do it,' Scott said. Those early Zoom meetings got people fired up for Harris. Now they’re trying to get them to vote When Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race and Kamala Harris jumped in, a cascade of Zoom meetings with hundreds of thousands of participants popped up seemingly out of nowhere and helped propel her to the Democratic nomination. Now organizers are trying to turn that burst of digital enthusiasm into traditional get-out-the-vote efforts like phone banking and door knocking. They’ve created a loose constellation of volunteer networks operating independently of the Harris campaign, all geared toward marshaling local or online communities behind the vice president. People are sending postcards, texting friends, canvassing battleground states, making friendship bracelets with campaign messages, and sometimes surprising themselves by getting involved in ways they’ve never done before. The question is whether the Zoom meetings that drew so much attention during the summer — for Black women, Black men, white women, white dudes, cat ladies, Taylor Swift fans and more — will turn out to be a short-lived phenomenon or a powerful catalyst for Harris to beat Republican nominee Donald Trump. ▶ Read more about Zoom organizing by Democrats. With less than two weeks before Election Day, Kamala Harris is heading Friday to the reliably red state of Texas But she’s not necessarily trying to sway voters there. She’s trying to highlight a make-or-break issue for Democrats: abortion rights. Harris will seek to show how Texas’ restrictive abortion ban is creating increasing medical distress for women. During her campaign, the Democratic presidential nominee has often highlighted the increasingly perilous landscape for women since the fall of Roe, and she links it to Donald Trump, who appointed three of the Supreme Court justices who overturned the landmark abortion rights ruling. But it’s unusual for her to do it from a state she’s highly unlikely to win. Campaign officials say the plan is a nontraditional way to capture the attention of voters in battleground states who are inundated with campaign ads and run-of-the-mill campaign events. But Harris also thinks the issue is resonating for Republican voters, too, particularly women. In hard-fought Pennsylvania, fast-growing Hispanic communities present a test for Harris and Trump Pennsylvania is arguably the hardest fought of the battleground states and happens to have one of the fastest-growing Hispanic communities in the country, in what is known as the 222 Corridor, after the highway that connects small cities and towns west and north of Philadelphia. It’s fertile ground for both Democrats and Republicans to test their strength among Latinos in a state where small margins decide who gets 20 electoral votes. It’s a place where Democratic nominee Kamala Harris can prove that her party still commands a large share of the demographic’s support, and where Republican Donald Trump’s campaign has been working to gain ground. 'This is the epicenter for Latino voters in Pennsylvania,' said Victor Martinez, who is of Puerto Rican descent and lives in and broadcasts his show from Allentown. 'I like the fact that Kamala Harris has to keep sending people over here to listen to us and talk to us. I like it. I like the fact that JD Vance has to keep coming back. I like it, because that means that they have to pay attention to us.' Pennsylvania’s Latino eligible voter population has more than doubled since 2000 from 208,000 to 579,000, according to the Latino Data Hub from the University of California, Los Angeles’ Latino Policy &amp; Politics Institute. The population in cities like Allentown and Reading is now more than half Hispanic, with a majority being of Puerto Rican descent and a sizable portion of Dominican origin. ▶ Read more about the Latino vote in this election. Biden administration awards $428M to help hard-hit coal communities transition to clean energy The Biden-Harris administration is awarding $428 million for 14 clean-energy manufacturing projects in Pennsylvania and other states hit hard by the decline of the U.S. coal industry. One of the larger grants, $87 million, will go to a Pennsylvania company to make state-of-the-art linear generators at a plant outside Pittsburgh, a key battleground in the presidential election. Linear generators can use any fuel source to produce low-carbon power for utilities, data centers and industry. Mainspring Energy plans to use Energy Department funds to create enough electricity annually to power more than 40,000 homes. Harris, like Biden, has pledged to help workers displaced by the transition to clean energy, a key-issue in energy-rich Pennsylvania. Mideast conflict looms over US presidential race as Harris and Trump jostle for an edge Two weeks out from Election Day, the crisis in the Middle East is looming over the race for the White House, with one candidate struggling to find just the right words to navigate its difficult cross-currents and the other making bold pronouncements that the age-old conflict can quickly be set right. Vice President Kamala Harris has been painstakingly — and not always successfully — trying to balance talk of strong support for Israel with harsh condemnations of civilian casualties among Palestinians and others caught up in Israel’s wars against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Former President Donald Trump, for his part, insists that none of this would have happened on his watch and that he can make it all go away if elected. Both of them are bidding for the votes of Arab and Muslim American voters and Jewish voters, particularly in extremely tight races in the battleground states of Michigan and Pennsylvania. ▶ Read more about the Mideast conflict’s role in the election. How Project 2025’s rightward vision became a flashpoint in this year’s election For the past year, Project 2025 has endured as a persistent force in the presidential election, its far-right proposals deployed by Democrats as shorthand for what Donald Trump would potentially do with a second term at the White House. Even though the former president’s campaign has vigorously distanced itself from Project 2025, the sweeping Heritage Foundation’s proposal to gut the federal workforce and dismantle federal agencies aligns closely with his vision. Project 2025’s architects come from the ranks of Trump’s administration and top Heritage officials have briefed Trump’s team about it. It’s rare for a complex 900-page policy book to figure so dominantly in a political campaign. But from its early start at a think tank, to its viral spread on social media, the rise and fall and potential rise again of Project 2025 shows the unexpected staying power of policy to light up an election year and threaten not only Trump atop the ticket but down-ballot Republicans in races for Congress. Through it all, Project 2025 hasn't gone away. It exists not only as a policy blueprint for the next administration, but as a database of some 20,000 job-seekers who could staff a Trump White House and administration and a still unreleased '180-day playbook' of actions a new president could employ on Day One. ▶ Read more about Project 2025. Early voting kicks off in battleground Wisconsin with push from Obama and Walz In-person early voting kicks off Tuesday across battleground Wisconsin, with former President Barack Obama and Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz hosting a rally in liberal Madison and Republicans holding events to encourage casting a ballot for Donald Trump before Election Day. Trump lost Wisconsin by just under 21,000 votes in 2020, an election that saw unprecedented early and absentee voting due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are expecting another razor-thin margin in Wisconsin and both sides are pushing voters to cast their ballots early. Trump was highly critical of voting by mail in past elections, falsely claiming it was rife with fraud. But this election, he and his backers are embracing all forms of voting, including by mail and early in-person. Trump himself encouraged early voting at a rally in Dodge County, Wisconsin, earlier this month. ▶ Read more about early voting in Wisconsin.

Lee Kuan Yew's youngest son says the UK has granted him asylum from persecution in Singapore	LONDON (AP) — Lee Hsien Yang, the estranged brother of former Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, said Tuesday that he is now a 'political refugee' after the U.K. government granted him asylum from what he described as persecution at home. The Lee brothers are the sons of Singapore's first prime minister Lee Kuan Yew, widely regarded as the city-state's modern founding father. They have been engaged in a public spat since 2017 over the late patriarch’s family home, and Lee Hsien Yang has accused Singapore's government of persecuting him, his wife and his son. In a Facebook post Tuesday, he said that he sought asylum protection in 2022 'as a last resort.' 'The Singapore government’s attacks against me are in the public record. They prosecuted my son, brought disciplinary proceedings against my wife, and launched a bogus police investigation that has dragged on for years,' he wrote. 'On the basis of these facts, the U.K. has determined that I face a well-founded risk of persecution and cannot safely return to Singapore.' 'I remain a Singapore citizen and hope that someday it will become safe to return home,' he added. The Guardian published an interview with Lee Hsien Yang on Tuesday in which he strongly criticized the Singapore government and alleged it facilitated money laundering. 'People need to look beyond Singapore’s bold, false assertions and see what the reality really is like,' he was quoted as saying. 'There is a need for the world to look more closely, to see Singapore’s role as that key facilitator for arms trades, for dirty money, for drug monies, crypto money.' The Singapore government said in a statement there was no basis to the allegations in the Guardian's report. The city-state has a 'robust system to deter and tackle money laundering and other illicit financial flows, which is consistent with international standards,' it said. 'In Singapore, no one is above the law. Anyone, including the offspring of the founding prime minister, Mr. Lee Kuan Yew, can be investigated and brought before the courts,' it added. Lee Hsien Yang and his sister, Lee Wei Ling, who died earlier this month, accuse their eldest brother of abusing his power to stop them from demolishing the family home according to the wishes of their father, who died in 2015 after leading Singapore with an iron grip for more than three decades. The family feud saw Lee Hsien Yang and his wife entangled in official investigations over allegations that the pair provided false evidence in judicial proceedings regarding Lee Kuan Yew's will. Lee Hsien Loong stepped down in May after two decades at the helm. He handed power to his deputy, Lawrence Wong, but still holds a Cabinet post as senior minister. Lee Hsien Yang joined the opposition party in the 2020 general elections, saying the governing party led then by his brother had 'lost its way.' The U.K. Home Office didn't immediately comment when asked about Lee Hsien Yang's asylum status. ___ Eileen Ng reported from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.	https://apnews.com/article/singapore-lee-hsien-yang-asylum-uk-d5bee7c0f88f23a1c041a1b2a0367ea5	2024-10-22T02:57:37-07:00	
Austria's chancellor asked to form new government after parties refuse to work with far-right leader	VIENNA (AP) — Austria's president on Tuesday tasked incumbent Chancellor Karl Nehammer with forming a new government after all other parties refused to work with the leader of the far-right Freedom Party, which last month won a national election for the first time. The Freedom Party finished first in the Sept. 29 election with 28.8% of the vote, ahead of Nehammer’s conservative Austrian People’s Party, which took 26.3%. The center-left Social Democrats were third with 21.1%. The outgoing governing coalition of Nehammer’s party and the environmentalist Greens lost its majority. Whoever leads the next government will need to build a coalition to have a parliamentary majority. But Nehammer's party has said it wouldn't work with the Freedom Party under its leader, Herbert Kickl. The other three parties in the new parliament said they wouldn't work with the Freedom Party at all. And Kickl said the Freedom Party would only go into government with him as chancellor. President Alexander Van der Bellen on Oct. 9 asked the leaders of the three biggest parties to hold talks on possible cooperation, dispensing with a tradition of giving the election winner the task of trying to form a new government. The party leaders reported back to him on Monday, and Van der Bellen said all had stuck to their positions. As a result, he said he was asking Nehammer to form a government and talk to the Social Democrats. There was no immediate public response from the chancellor or the far-right party.	https://apnews.com/article/austria-president-nehammer-chancellor-government-far-right-b7c91e9030d266d92f348f52acd9e5a8	2024-10-22T02:55:30-07:00	
Ukraine's Zelenskyy says only a US green light on a NATO invitation will sway a reluctant Germany	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine's president is hoping allies will take a more positive stance on his so-called victory plan after the U.S. election, but concedes that its key demand — an invitation to join NATO — is not welcome by some key Western partners, in particular Germany. Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia was also likely looking at the postelection scenario in the U.S. to assess the possibility of cease-fire talks with Ukraine. He assessed that if partial cease-fire deals could be reached over attacks on energy infrastructure and Black Sea shipping routes, it would signal the end of the 'hot phase' of the war. Zelenskyy spoke to journalists on Monday and his comments were embargoed until Tuesday. On NATO, Zelenskyy said France, Britain and Italy have shown signs of support. Germany has reservations, however, and Zelenskyy believes only a U.S. green light will convince Berlin to accept the idea. 'The German side is skeptical about our NATO membership — that’s a fact. I believe their stance is softer than it was before — this is also a fact. But when it comes to the invitation I’m talking about now, they are afraid of ... Russia’s reaction,' he said. 'I believe that their position will be influenced by a bigger alliance. A bigger alliance in supporting us — a confident 'Yes' from the United States.' Many significant issues will hinge on decisions taken following the fraught election period, the president said. 'After the elections, we hope for a more positive reaction from the US — not because of a change in the president, but because the focus of the United States is now on the elections, and I believe that any sharp statements from the U.S. today might be inappropriate or carry risks. I think they don’t want unnecessary risks,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-nato-germany-zelenskyy-dea72695475ebcf3d5b22f3a9c8aecac	2024-10-22T02:36:48-07:00	
Switzerland to close 9 centers for asylum-seekers as fewer people arrive than expected	GENEVA (AP) — Swiss authorities said Tuesday they will shut nine temporary centers for asylum-seekers because the number of people seeking asylum recently has been below expectations. Switzerland has been building up refugee accommodation since 2022, putting in place 36 centers for asylum-seekers across the country. The State Secretariat for Migration said that just over half the places are currently occupied. It said that, unlike in previous years, there hasn't been a rise in new asylum-seekers in the summer and fall. In August, there were 23% fewer applications than a year earlier, and there was a 40% drop in September. 'The situation on the migration routes toward Western Europe does not point to a dramatic increase in the coming months,' the secretariat said in a statement. The nine centers being shut can accommodate 1,735 people. It said that, following their closure, the remaining ones will be able to put up about 7,000 people from March onward — a number that could be increased again if there is a sharp increase in new arrivals.	https://apnews.com/article/switzerland-migration-asylum-centers-closing-b8c1a396a28323196705ddd7f1cf26e9	2024-10-22T02:02:18-07:00	
Tunisia's president is inaugurated for a second term following a crackdown on his opponents	TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) — Tunisia's President Kais Saied has been inaugurated for a second term, following a monthslong crackdown and string of arrests against his political opponents. Weeks after winning re-election with a 90.7% share of the vote, the 66-year-old former law professor in his inauguration speech Monday called for a 'cultural revolution' to combat unemployment, fight terrorism and root out corruption. 'The aim is to build a country where everyone can live in dignity,' Saied said in a speech addressing members of Tunisia's parliament. Saied's Oct. 7 re-election came after a turbulent first term during which he suspended the country's parliament, rewrote its post-Arab Spring constitution and jailed dozens of his critics in politics, media, business and civil society. He has justified elements of the crackdown as necessary to fight corruption and enemies of the state, using populism to appeal to Tunisians disillusioned with the direction that those who preceded him took the country after nationwide protests led to the 2011 ouster of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. He promised to target the 'thieves and traitors on the payroll of foreigners' and blamed 'counterrevolutionary forces' for obstructing his efforts to buoy Tunisia's struggling economy throughout his first term in office. 'The task was not easy. The dangers were great,' he said. 'The arms of the old regime were like vipers circulating everywhere. We could hear them hissing, even if we couldn’t see them.' Though Saied proclaimed a commitment to respecting freedoms, many journalists were prevented from covering his swearing-in on Monday, leading to a rebuke from the National Syndicate of Tunisian Journalists, which expressed 'its firm condemnation of the ongoing blackout policy and restrictions on journalistic work' in a news release on Monday.	https://apnews.com/article/tunisia-president-kais-saied-f911f1dfc86445ef8be157a3a792e1e2	2024-10-22T01:53:38-07:00	
Tropical Storm Oscar swirls toward the Bahamas after hitting Cuba as a hurricane	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Tropical Storm Oscar chugged toward the Bahamas on Tuesday after making landfall in Cuba as a Category 1 hurricane, killing at least six people as it unleashed heavy rains on an island also hit by an unrelated massive power outage. Oscar was located 45 miles (75 kilometers) south-southeast of Long Island in the Bahamas on Tuesday morning. It had winds of 40 mph (65 kph) and was moving north-northeast at 12 mph (19 kph), according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami. 'Oscar is at best barely a tropical storm at this time,' the center said. It was expected to drop up to 5 inches (13 centimeters) of rain across the southeastern Bahamas, with up to 8 inches (20 centimeters) in isolated areas. A tropical storm warning was in effect for the central and southeastern Bahamas. The storm made history as the smallest recorded hurricane, with a wind field of only about 6 miles (10 kilometers) across. It caught many by surprise as it made landfall in Grand Inagua Island in the Bahamas on Saturday and a second landfall in eastern Cuba late Sunday. 'It’s not often we see a colossal failure in hurricane forecasting,' Michael Lowry, a hurricane specialist and storm surge expert, wrote in an analysis. He noted no models indicated Oscar would strengthen into a hurricane. Oscar dropped at least 15 inches (38 centimeters) of rain in parts of eastern Cuba on Monday, with forecasters warning of heavy flooding and possible landslides. The six deaths were reported in Guantánamo. The storm hit as Cuba struggles to recover from a massive blackout that sparked a handful of small protests and a stern government warning that any unrest will be punished. Oscar is the 15th named storm and 10th hurricane of the Atlantic hurricane season, which begins June 1 and ends Nov. 30. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted an above-average Atlantic hurricane season this year because of record-warm ocean temperatures. It forecast 17 to 25 named storms before the season ends, with four to seven major hurricanes of Category 3 or higher. Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Kristy swirled over open waters in the Pacific Ocean. It was located 375 miles (605 kilometers) west-southwest of Acapulco, Mexico on Tuesday. It had maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 kph) and was moving west-northwest at 15 mph (24 kph). Kristy was expected to become a hurricane by Tuesday night.	https://apnews.com/article/tropical-storm-oscar-cuba-bahamas-hurricane-c61b9266c182c4ace4544d73b5cedd3a	2024-10-22T01:48:36-07:00	
India bringing in a new law to curb the menace of hoax bomb threat calls disrupting airlines flying	NEW DELHI (AP) — The Indian government plans a new law to punish those making hoax bomb threats against flights, which disrupt the schedules of airlines and cause massive inconvenience to thousands of passengers. In less than two weeks, more than 120 flights operated by Indian carriers have received bomb threats, the Press Trust of India news agency reported. Civil Aviation Minister K Rammohan said on Monday that the government is planning to introduce legislation that would put offenders on a no-fly list and amend the 1982 Civil Aviation Act so that they can be arrested and investigated without a court order. On Tuesday, IndiGo, a private Indian airline, said nine of its flights destined for Jeddah and Dammam in Saudi Arabia and some flights from Turkey had received such hoax calls. The flights were diverted to the nearest airports for security checks. 'We worked closely with the relevant authorities and followed standard operating procedures,' the airline said in a statement. The hoaxers have largely gone untraced so far. The Mumbai police said they detained a 17-year-old boy from eastern Chhattisgarh state on Wednesday for allegedly posting bomb threat messages on the social media of various airlines. Police officer Maneesh Kalwaniya said the boy's motive was to implicate another person involved in a business dispute with him. The Press Trust of India said 30 domestic and international flights operated by Indian airlines, including IndiGo, Vistara, and Air India, received bomb threats on Monday night alone. 'Even though bomb threats are hoaxes, things cannot be taken non-seriously,' Rammohan said.	https://apnews.com/article/india-bomb-threat-calls-airlines-ac9cf86f8f64b46a980596b52bc37569	2024-10-22T01:23:16-07:00	
South Korea warns it can send arms to Ukraine after reports of North's troops in Russia	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea warned Tuesday it could consider supplying weapons to Ukraine in response to North Korea allegedly dispatching troops to Russia, as both North Korea and Russia denied the movements. The South Korean statement is apparently meant to pressure Russia not to bring in North Korean troops in its war against Ukraine. South Korean officials worry that Russia may reward North Korea by giving it sophisticated weapons technologies that can boost the North’s nuclear and missile programs that target South Korea. In an emergency National Security Council meeting, top South Korean officials condemned North Korea’s alleged dispatch of troops as 'a grave security threat' to South Korea and the international community. They described North Korea as 'a criminal group' that forces its youths to serve as Russian mercenaries for an unjustifiable war, the South Korean presidential office said in a statement. The officials agreed to take phased countermeasures, linking the level of their responses to progress in Russian-North Korean military cooperation, according to the statement. Possible steps include diplomatic, economic and military options, and South Korea could consider sending both defensive and offensive weapons to Ukraine, a senior South Korean presidential official told reporters on condition of anonymity in a background briefing. The official said North Korea could attempt to get high-tech Russian technologies to perfect its nuclear missiles. The official said Russia's possible help for North Korea's efforts to modernize its outdated conventional weapons systems and acquire a space-based surveillance system would pose a serious security threat to South Korea as well. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, South Korea has joined U.S.-led sanctions against Moscow and shipped humanitarian and financial support to Kyiv. But it has avoided directly supplying arms to Ukraine in line with its policy of not supplying weapons to countries actively engaged in conflicts. South Korea’s spy agency said last week it had confirmed that North Korea sent 1,500 special operation forces to Russia this month. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said his government had intelligence that 10,000 North Korea soldiers were being prepared to join invading Russian forces. North Korea and Russia intensify cooperation North Korea and Russia have been sharply boosting their cooperation in the past two years. In June, they signed a major defense deal requiring both countries to use all available means to provide immediate military assistance if either is attacked. South Korea said at the time it would consider sending arms to Ukraine, a similar statement that it made Tuesday. South Korea's spy agency said that North Korea had sent more than 13,000 containers of artillery, missiles and other conventional arms to Russia since August 2023 to replenish its dwindling weapons stockpiles. North Korea and Russia have denied the North Korean troop deployment as well as the purported weapons transfer. At a U.N. Security Council meeting Monday, Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia dismissed the South Korean assertion as well as Western allegations of Iran supplying Russia with missiles and China providing arms components. He accused the West of 'circulating scaremongering with Iranian, Chinese and Korean bogeymen, each one of which is more absurd than the one before.' At a separate U.N. committee meeting, a North Korean diplomat said his delegation feels no need to comment on the troop dispatch, calling it 'groundless, stereotype rumors aimed at smearing the image' of the North and undermining the legitimate cooperation between two sovereign states. Also Tuesday, the powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called South Korean and Ukraine governments 'lunatics' as she slammed them for making 'reckless remarks against nuclear weapons states.' The U.S. and NATO haven’t confirmed North Korea’s troop deployment, but they warned against the danger of such a development if true. U.S. deputy ambassador to the U.N. Robert Wood said that if true, the North Korean troop dispatch marks 'a dangerous and highly concerning development' and noted that the U.S. was 'consulting with our allies and partners on such a dramatic move.' __ Associated Press writer Kim Tong-hyung contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-south-russia-troops-ukraine-3bf74624cfa6856edd4f15fb3992bfa0	2024-10-22T01:19:08-07:00	
A man who allegedly planned a bomb attack for the Islamic State group is indicted in Germany	BERLIN (AP) — German prosecutors said Tuesday they have filed an indictment against a man who allegedly joined the Islamic State group in Iraq and planned to carry out an attack in Germany on its behalf. The Iraqi national, identified only as Mahmoud A. in line with German privacy rules, was arrested in June in Esslingen, near Stuttgart. The federal prosecutor's office said he has now been formally charged at the state court in Stuttgart with membership in a foreign terrorist organization and preparing a serious act of violence. The suspect joined IS in Iraq in May 2016, and fought and carried out guard duties for the extremist group until October 2017, according to prosecutors. He then allegedly went to Turkey in consultation with IS, and continued to Germany in October 2022. From January onward, he planned a bomb attack, prosecutors said. After looking up how to make a bomb on the internet, he allegedly procured the necessary chemicals and components for an ignition device. He was arrested before he could carry out any plan for an attack.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-islamic-state-attack-suspect-indicted-d03a5b20ce0d104ede6b216eb37c3879	2024-10-22T00:57:49-07:00	
Putin hosts Global South leaders at BRICS summit meant to counterbalance Western clout	KAZAN, Russia (AP) — China’s Xi Jinping, India’s Narendra Modi and other global leaders arrived Tuesday in the Russian city of Kazan for a summit of the BRICS bloc of developing economies that the Kremlin hopes to turn into a rallying point for defying what some see as the Western liberal order. For Russian President Vladimir Putin, the three-day meeting also offers a powerful way to demonstrate the failure of U.S.-led efforts to isolate Russia over its actions in Ukraine. Kremlin foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov touted the summit as 'the largest foreign policy event ever held' by Russia, with 36 countries attending and more than 20 of them represented by heads of state. The alliance that initially comprised Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa has expanded rapidly to embrace Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. Turkey, Azerbaijan and Malaysia have formally applied to become members, and a few others have expressed interest in joining. Observers see the BRICS summit as part of the Kremlin's efforts to showcase support from the Global South amid spiraling tensions with the West and help expand economic and financial ties. Proposed projects include the creation of a new payment system that would offer an alternative to the global bank messaging network SWIFT and allow Moscow to dodge Western sanctions and trade with partners. Putin is set to hold about 20 bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the summit, including Tuesday's encounters with China’s Xi, India’s Modi and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa. The summit underlined the close relationship between Xi and Putin, who announced a 'no-limits' partnership weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. They already have met at least twice this year, in Beijing in May and at a Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Kazakhstan in July. Russia’s cooperation with India has also flourished as New Delhi considers Moscow a time-tested partner since Cold War times despite Russia’s close ties with India’s main rival, China. Western allies want India to be more active in persuading Moscow to end the war in Ukraine, but Modi has avoided condemning Russia while emphasizing a peaceful settlement. Modi, who last visited Russia in July, said this visit reflects the close friendship between the countries. Speaking at the start of his meeting with Putin, he also reaffirmed New Delhi's push for peace in Ukraine. Putin hailed what he described as a 'privileged strategic partnership' between Russia and India. On Thursday, Putin is also set to meet with United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who will be making his first visit to Russia in more than two years. Guterres has repeatedly criticized Russia’s actions in Ukraine.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-brics-summit-china-india-ukraine-war-39e90fce8443b922f4d224c65c2ec932	2024-10-22T00:33:12-07:00	
Blinken arrives in Israel as US looks to renew cease-fire efforts after the killing of Hamas leader	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Israel on Tuesday on his 11th visit to the region since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war. The U.S. hopes to revive cease-fire efforts after the killing of top Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, but so far all the warring parties appear to be digging in. Israel is still at war with Hamas more than a year after the militant group’s Oct. 7 attack, and with Hezbollah in Lebanon, where it launched a ground invasion earlier this month. Israel is also expected to strike Iran in response to its ballistic missile attack on Oct. 1. Blinken landed just hours after Hezbollah launched a barrage of rockets into central Israel, setting off air raid sirens in the country’s most populated areas and its international airport, but causing no apparent damage or injuries. The Israeli military said it intercepted most of the five projectiles, with one landing in an open area. Another 15 projectiles were fired from Lebanon into northern Israel at around the same time, it said. Hospitals in Lebanon fear being targeted by Israel The death toll from Israeli airstrikes late Monday that destroyed several buildings facing one of Beirut’s main hospitals climbed to 13. Lebanon's Health Ministry said 57 others were wounded, including seven who were in critical condition. The Israeli military said it struck a Hezbollah target, without elaborating, and said that it had not targeted the hospital itself. Associated Press reporters visited the Rafik Hariri University Hospital, the country’s largest public hospital, on Tuesday. They saw broken windows in the hospital’s pharmacy and dialysis center, which was full of patients at the time. The force of the explosions also destroyed some of the hospital’s solar panels. Staff said that in the midst of their own panic, they had to deal with wounded patients streaming into the hospital in the aftermath of the strikes across the street. Staff at another Beirut hospital feared it would be targeted after Israel alleged that Hezbollah had stashed hundreds of millions of dollars in cash and gold in its basement, without providing evidence. The director of the Sahel General Hospital denied the allegations and invited journalists to visit the hospital and its two underground floors on Tuesday. AP reporters saw no sign of militants or anything out of the ordinary. The few remaining patients had been evacuated after the Israeli military's announcement the night before. The rest had left earlier because of repeated airstrikes in the surrounding neighborhood. 'We have been living in terror for the last 24 hours,' said hospital director Mazen Alame. 'There is nothing under the hospital.' Many in Lebanon fear Israel could target its hospitals in the same way it has raided medical facilities across Gaza. The Israeli military has accused Hamas and other militants of using hospitals for military purposes, allegations denied by medical staff. Hospitals can lose their protection under international law if they are used for military purposes. Blinken expected to focus on Gaza The State Department said ahead of the visit that Blinken would focus on ending the war in Gaza, securing the release of hostages held by Hamas and alleviating the suffering of Palestinian civilians. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Blinken would underscore the need for a dramatic increase in the amount of humanitarian aid reaching Gaza, something that Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin made clear in a letter to Israeli officials last week. That letter reminded Israel that the Biden administration could be forced by U.S. law to curtail some forms of military aid should the delivery of humanitarian aid continue to be hindered. Blinken's previous trips have yielded little in the way of ending hostilities, but he has managed to increase aid deliveries to Gaza in the past. The United States, Egypt and Qatar have brokered months of talks between Israel and Hamas, trying to strike a deal in which the militants would release dozens of hostages in return for an end to the war, a lasting cease-fire and the release of Palestinian prisoners. But both Israel and Hamas accused each other of making new and unacceptable demands over the summer, and the talks ground to a halt in August. Hamas says its demands have not changed following the killing of Sinwar. US and Iran both step up outreach ahead of expected Israeli strike Blinken is expected to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other top officials, and to visit a number of Arab countries, likely to include Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has been criss-crossing the region in recent days to try and built support ahead of Israel’s threatened retaliatory strike. Speaking in Kuwait on Tuesday, he said Gulf Arab countries had assured him they would not allow their territory to be used for any Israeli strike. 'All the neighbors assured us that they will not allow their lands and air to be used against Iran,' Araghchi said, according to the state-run IRNA news agency. The Arab Gulf countries have not publicly offered such assurances. Gulf Arab nations like the UAE and Qatar host major military installations, and there are concerns that an all-out regional war could draw them in. Iran has repeatedly vowed to respond to any Israeli strike. War rages in Lebanon and northern Gaza The U.S. has also tried to broker a cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah, but those efforts fell apart as tensions spiked last month with a series of Israeli strikes that killed the militant group’s top leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and most of his senior commanders. Israel is currently waging another major operation in already-devastated northern Gaza, which has killed hundreds of Palestinians over the last two weeks, according to local health authorities. In Lebanon, Israel has carried out waves of heavy airstrikes across southern Beirut and the country’s south and east, areas where Hezbollah has a strong presence. Hezbollah has fired hundreds of rockets, missiles and drones into Israel, including some that have reached the country’s populous center. Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking another 250 hostage. Around 100 of the captives are still held in Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Hezbollah began attacking Israel the day after the Hamas attack. Both groups are backed by Iran. Israel’s offensive has killed over 42,000 Palestinians in Gaza and wounded tens of thousands, according to local health authorities, who do not say how many were combatants but say more than half were women and children. It has also caused massive devastation across the territory and displaced around 90% of its population of 2.3 million. ___ El Deeb reported from Beirut.

2 transgender women stabbed to death at home in northwest Pakistan	PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) — Two men armed with daggers killed two transgender women at their home in conservative northwest Pakistan overnight before fleeing the scene, police said, a sign of increasing violence against trans people in the country. The killings happened Sunday night in Mardan, a city in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, local police chief Fahim Khan said. He said the motive behind the murders was unclear and officers are still investigating. Transgender people are often subjected to harassment, abuse and attacks in Muslim-majority Pakistan. They are also among the victims of so-called honor killings carried out by relatives to punish perceived sexual transgressions. Farzana Jan, President of the Trans Action rights group in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, said another nine trans people have been killed in gun attacks in the province since January. She said none of the attackers involved in the previous cases had been brought to justice, mainly because families pardoned the attackers or prosecutors did not pursue the cases seriously. The transgender community has threated to protest if the attackers are not arrested. 'We have given a three-day deadline to the police for arresting those behind the latest killings in Mardan,' Jan said. 'We will stage rallies if the killers of two members of our community are not arrested,' she said. There are no exact figures about the number of trans people in Pakistan, but Jan estimated that about 75,000 live in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Mardan is located about 50 kilometers (30 miles) east of Peshawar.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-trans-women-stabbed-killed-northwest-fe0eef893e486013d51cc5f470a6807e	2024-10-21T21:58:48-07:00	
Middle East latest: Over a dozen killed in Israeli strikes near one of Beirut's main hospitals	Israeli airstrikes in and around Beirut caused significant damage to the country's largest public hospital and killed more than a dozen people, Lebanese health officials said, as Hezbollah launched a barrage of rockets into central Israel hours before U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in the region. Lebanon's health ministry said that 60 others were wounded in airstrikes late Monday that destroyed several buildings facing the Rafik Hariri University Hospital, located on the outskirts of southern Beirut. The Israeli military said it struck a Hezbollah target, without elaborating, and that it had not targeted the hospital itself. The State Department said Blinken would focus on ending the war in Gaza, securing the release of hostages held by Hamas and alleviating the suffering of Palestinian civilians. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has pledged to annihilate Hamas and recover dozens of hostages held by the group. Hamas says it will only release the captives in return for a lasting cease-fire, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the release of Palestinian prisoners. On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel’s security fence and stormed in, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting another 250. Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not differentiate between militants and civilians. The war has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced about 90% of its population of 2.3 million people. ___ Here's the latest: France's government defends decision to bar some Israeli companies from exhibiting at upcoming trade fair PARIS — France’s government is defending its decision to bar Israeli companies supplying the war in the Middle East from exhibiting at an upcoming trade fair outside Paris. Organizers of the Nov. 4-7 naval defense exhibition, called Euronaval, posted on the event’s website that Israeli firms can take part in the show and 'may have an exhibition stand, provided that their products are not used in military operations in Gaza and Lebanon.' Addressing parliament on Tuesday, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot said the policy does not amount to a boycott of Israeli firms. But he also said it would be 'incoherent' for France to allow the promotion of weapons used in the war when Paris is also pushing for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon. 'Therefore, we have indicated to the Israeli authorities, with whom we communicate very regularly, that the participation in the form of stands by companies should respect this balance,' Barrot said. In a Sunday post on the social platform X, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz urged French President Emmanuel Macron to rescind the restrictions, calling them 'unacceptable' and 'anti-democratic.' Lebanon's health ministry says 63 people were killed and 234 wounded in past 24 hours BEIRUT — Lebanon’s health ministry said that 63 people were killed and 234 wounded in the past 24 hours, raising the total toll over the past year of conflict between Israel and Hezbollah to 2,546 killed and 11,862 wounded. Lebanon’s crisis response unit recorded 125 airstrikes and incidents of shelling in the past day, mostly concentrated in southern Lebanon and the Nabatiyeh province. Some 1,095 centers — including educational complexes, vocational institutes, universities, and other institutions — are currently sheltering 191,516 people, including 44,124 families, displaced by the Israeli offensive in Lebanon, the report said. Among these shelters, 908 have now reached full capacity. The fighting in Lebanon has driven 1.2 million people from their homes, including more than 400,000 children, according to the U.N. children’s agency. Despite a major border crossing between Lebanon and Syria being out of commission after Israel struck the road several times, crowds have continued to flow across the border seeking relative safety in Syria. Between Sept. 23 and Oct. 22, Lebanese General Security recorded 343,404 Syrian and 147,608 Lebanese citizens crossing into Syria, the report said. Yellen says the US is working to ‘ensure that legitimate aid flows reach Gaza,’ among other things WASHINGTON — The U.S. is working to 'ensure that legitimate aid flows reach Gaza,' as well as 'imposing sanctions on Israeli violent extremist settlers and pressing Israel to maintain vital correspondent banking relationships with Palestinian banks,' U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a speech ahead of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank annual meetings this week. 'We look forward to the Israeli cabinet extending the waivers to preserve correspondent banking relationships for banks in the West Bank by the end of the month deadline to support economic stability in the West Bank,' she added. The agreement will expire on October 31, after Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich agreed to extend it for only three months during the summer. U.S. officials have warned that a failure to extend the banking relationship risks an economic collapse in the occupied West Bank and of the Palestinian Authority. Death toll from strike near Beirut hospital rises to 18 BEIRUT — The death toll from Israeli airstrikes late Monday that destroyed several buildings facing one of Beirut’s main hospitals climbed to 18. Lebanon’s health ministry said 60 others were wounded in the strikes, including seven who were in critical condition. Netanyahu's private residence was hit, damaged during weekend drone attack TEL AVIV, Israel — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s private residence was hit and lightly damaged during a drone attack over the weekend, according to footage of the attack published by Israeli media on Tuesday. A photo of the attack showed damage to the bedroom window, which had a spiderweb of cracks and some burn marks. There were no injuries in the attack and neither Netanyahu nor his wife were in the home at the time of the attack. Earlier on Tuesday, Hezbollah’s chief spokesman took responsibility for the drone attack. 'The attempt by Iran’s proxy Hezbollah to assassinate the Prime Minister, it’s clearly a grave mistake,' said David Mencer, Israeli government spokesman. Israel’s military has at times struggled to intercept drones, which are smaller, fly more erratically and are harder to track and intercept. Last week, a Hezbollah drone attack on an army base in central Israel killed four soldiers and wounded 67 others, the deadliest strike by the militant group since Israel launched its ground invasion of Lebanon three weeks ago. Israeli airstrike levels building in southern Beirut suburb BEIRUT — An Israeli airstrike leveled a building in the southern Beirut suburb of Beirut on Tuesday. The strike came 40 minutes after Israeli military Arabic spokesperson Avichay Adraee issued a warning, claiming the two buildings targeted contained 'Hezbollah facilities.' The building stood in a heavily trafficked area across the street from a large park, which has become a refuge for many displaced families. It is also not far from the French ambassador’s residence. No immediate casualties were reported. The Israeli military did not have immediate comment about the target of the strike. At the time of the warning, Hezbollah’s chief spokesperson was holding a pre-scheduled press conference just a few hundred meters from the targeted area. The event was quickly cut short, with journalists and the spokesperson evacuating the location. The Israeli military did not have an immediate comment about the target of the strike. Amnesty International criticizes Israel's strikes on al-Qard al-Hassan JERUSALEM — Human rights group Amnesty International has criticized Israel’s targeting of branches of a Hezbollah-linked financial institution, saying the round of strikes this week 'likely violates international humanitarian law.' Amnesty said Tuesday the attack on al-Qard al-Hassan must be investigated as a war crime because financial institutions are considered civilian infrastructure under the laws of war unless they are being used for military purposes. 'Even if as the Israeli military alleges, the institution does provide financing to Hezbollah, it is not likely to meet the definition of a military objective, particularly for branches serving civilian customers,' said Erika Guevara Rosas, Amnesty’s senior director for research, advocacy, policy and campaigns. Israel’s strikes overnight Sunday into Monday hit at least 15 branches of al-Qard al-Hassan in Lebanon. Israel says the bank is used to fund attacks, and it issued evacuation warnings ahead of the strikes. Many ordinary Lebanese keep their savings at the financial institution. Hezbollah says it was behind drone attack on Netanyahu's house BEIRUT — Hezbollah’s chief spokesman says the group was behind the weekend drone attack that targeted Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s house without inflicting casualties. Mohammed Afif told reporters in Beirut Tuesday that if in the previous attack Netanyahu was not hurt, 'the coming days and nights and the (battle) fields are between us.' Afif was hinting that Hezbollah might carry out such attempts in the future. Afif said Hezbollah is fully responsible for the drone attack that targeted Netanyahu's house. He added that the group did it on its own. Netanyahu’s office said the drone on Saturday targeted his house in the Mediterranean coastal town of Caesarea. Neither he nor his wife was there. It wasn’t clear if the house was hit. Journalists taken on a tour of the Beirut hospital where Israel claimed Hezbollah stored cash and gold BEIRUT — An Associated Press team was among journalists taken on a tour inside a hospital in Beirut’s southern suburb where the Israeli army claimed without offering evidence that Hezbollah was storing hundreds of millions of dollars in cash and gold in tunnels underneath. The Sahel General Hospital had already been emptied of most patients and staff following intense bombardment of the area in recent days, and the few remaining ones were hastily evacuated late Monday after the Israeli claim. 'We have been living in terror for the last 24 hours,' hospital director Mazen Alame said Tuesday. 'There is nothing under the hospital.' Journalists were taken to the two floors under the hospital, the first of which had two rooms for surgeries and the other had oxygen bottles stored inside. The second floor included a morgue with six doors in one room and a giant water tank in another. Alame said the hospital has no affiliation with any political group or religious institution and has been working under the supervision of Lebanon’s health ministry since its founding. Israel has made similar claims about tunnels used by Hamas militants under hospitals in Gaza. Omar Mneimne, a doctor at the hospital’s emergency department, said he fears a repeat scenario in Lebanon. 'We fear that,' Mneimne said, adding that the international community should act to defend health facilities in Lebanon. 'It’s extremely hard. It’s very stressful for the community.' 7 Jerusalem residents arrested over an alleged Iranian-guided plot TEL AVIV, Israel — Israeli authorities said Tuesday they have arrested seven Jerusalem residents in connection with an alleged Iranian-guided plot to assassinate an Israeli scientist and mayor. It was the latest in a series of similar alleged spy rings foiled by Israel and blamed on Iran, highlighting the ongoing shadow war between the two countries even as their conflict has become more direct during the war in Gaza. A statement by Israel’s domestic security agency Shin Bet did not name the scientist or the mayor targeted. It said the seven people arrested were assigned various tasks as part of the alleged plot, including blowing up a police car and lobbing a grenade at a home. The Iranian agent promised the seven roughly $50,000 in exchange for the acts, the Shin Bet said. It said police found multiple credit cards, tens of thousands of shekels and a fake police car license plate. Those arrested were not identified but were from a predominantly Palestinian area of Jerusalem, the Shin Bet said. Tensions between Israel and Iran have soared since the killing in Tehran of Hamas’ leader Ismail Haniyeh — an attack blamed on Israel — and an Iranian missile attack on Israel earlier this month, for which Israel is expected to respond. Death toll from strike near Beirut hospital rises to 13 BEIRUT — The death toll from Israeli airstrikes that destroyed several buildings facing one of Beirut’s main hospitals late Monday has climbed to 13. Lebanon’s health ministry said 57 others were wounded in the strikes, including seven who were in critical condition. It said the airstrikes significantly damaged Rafik Hariri University Hospital, the country’s largest public hospital, located on the outskirts of southern Beirut. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. State Department source says progress on day-after plan is key to US hopes for cease-fire TEL AVIV, Israel — The U.S. is making an eleventh hour effort to resuscitate aspects of the halted cease-fire deal between Israel and Hamas weeks before the presidential election and as Israel’s invasion of neighboring Lebanon intensifies, according to a senior U.S. State Department official. Since negotiations fell apart over the summer, Americans have focused on a postwar plan for Israel and Gaza. The State Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity late Monday to preview Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s strategy, said stakeholders have reached consensus on some aspects of the so-called day-after plan and that the U.S. is hopeful the progress will bring the parties back to the table on a cease-fire. The official added that the decision to go to Israel before meeting with Arab partners was a shift in the U.S.'s negotiation strategy. The U.S. has long pushed for a postwar settlement in which a reformed Palestinian Authority would govern Gaza with help from Arab states and Saudi Arabia would normalize relations with Israel. Arab leaders insist such plans would depend on a pathway to Palestinian statehood, something to which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is deeply opposed. He has ruled out any postwar role for the PA and says local Palestinians will administer Gaza, with Israel maintaining open-ended security control. Blinken also planned to reiterate concerns about the humanitarian aid crisis in Gaza that U.S. officials outlined in a recent letter to Israel, the official said. But the official said an anticipated Israeli retaliation against Iran is looming over the meeting, which will likely be the last time Blinken and Netanyahu meet before the U.S. presidential election. — By Farnoush Amiri Blinken arrives in Israel on mission to restart cease-fire talks U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Israel on Tuesday on his 11th visit to the region since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war, as the U.S. hopes to revive cease-fire efforts after the killing of top Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. Blinken is expected to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other top officials. Following Israel, he’s expected to visit several Arab countries, likely to include Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. Here more here. Iran keeps up pressure as Israeli retaliation looms DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Iran said Tuesday that its Arab Gulf neighbors wouldn’t allow their territory to be used for an expected Israeli strike as the Islamic Republic once again vowed to respond to any attack. The comments from Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian and Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi come as speculation grows over how Israel will retaliate for Tehran’s Oct. 1 ballistic missile attack on Israel. Speaking in Kuwait as part of a Mideast tour, Araghchi insisted that Gulf Arab neighbors he’s spoken to wouldn’t allow their territory to be used. 'All the neighbors assured us that they will not allow their lands and air to be used against Iran,' Araghchi said, according to the state-run IRNA news agency. 'This is an expectation from all friendly and neighboring countries and we consider this a sign of friendship.' However, many Gulf Arab nations host major U.S. military installations, like Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, as a hedge against any possible attack by Iran. Washington also has based aircraft carriers around the region as tensions have persisted in the wake of Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel and the subsequent wars raging across the Mideast. Gulf Arab nations have not made any public pledges like those described by Araghchi. There have been tensions in the Persian Gulf and among Gulf Arab countries since Tehran launched a series of attacks targeting shipping in the region in 2019 over the U.S.'s unilateral withdrawal from Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers as well. Separately, Pezeshkian warned that Israel will face a 'corresponding answer' for any attack it carries out. Another Israeli strike hits Lebanon-Syria border crossing BEIRUT — Lebanon’s state news agency says another Israeli airstrike has targeted the country’s main border crossing with Syria, leaving a second large crater on the highway running through it. The National News Agency reported that the early Tuesday airstrike was closer to the Syrian side of the crossing, known as Jdeidet Yabous. Syrian TV also reported an airstrike in the border area. An Israeli airstrike on Oct. 5 blocked a highway and left a giant crater near the Lebanese side of the crossing, known as Masnaa, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) from Beirut. That strike prevented vehicles from going through the crossing, which tens of thousands of people have used to flee to Syria. People now have to cross by foot in or around the two large craters several kilometers (miles) away. The Israeli military has accused the Hezbollah militant group of using the Masnaa crossing to truck in military equipment from Syria. There was no immediate comment on the latest strike. Hezbollah fires rockets into central Israel TEL AVIV, Israel — Hezbollah launched a barrage of rockets into central Israel on Tuesday, setting off air raid sirens in the country’s most populated areas but causing no apparent damage or injuries. The Israeli military said five projectiles were fired from Lebanon into Israel and most were intercepted by Israel’s missile defense system. One landed in an open area. Israeli police said there were no reports of damage or injury following the salvo. The Israeli military said that at the same time, about 15 projectiles were fired from Lebanon into northern Israel. Earlier Tuesday, air raid sirens went off in the Israeli-occupied West Bank after a rocket was launched from Lebanon, the Israeli military said. Homes in the Palestinian village of Shuqba were damaged. The rocket fire came as Israel stepped up its strikes in Lebanon, targeting a Hezbollah-run financial institution, and as Israeli troops pushed ahead in their invasion of southern Lebanon.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-hezbollah-mideast-latest-22-october-2024-9fc49430fd9824a0143b3ba6dd0f0d6c	2024-10-21T21:01:20-07:00	
A Samoan village prepares to welcome King Charles but fears an uncertain future for its reef	SIUMU, Samoa (AP) — Under clear skies, shortly after sunrise in the beachside fishing village of Siumu, Samoa, on Tuesday a dozen men and children prepared their small boats for a day at sea. But underwater a mile off the coast, lay the hulking shape of a sunken New Zealand naval vessel them is forcing them to travel further away to fish than before. They had arrived home from Monday's trip just a few hours earlier. The village, festooned with Samoan and British flags, is bustling with preparations to host King Charles III and Queen Camilla when the royals arrive on Wednesday for a biennial meeting of leaders from 56 Commonwealth countries. It is the first time a Pacific Island nation has hosted the event. But Siumu was already busy. New Zealand and Samoan officials have been working along miles of the nearby coastline for weeks to monitor and curb environmental damage caused by the sinking of the HMNZS Manawanui, which ran aground on the reef, caught fire and sank earlier this month. The 75 people on board the specialist dive and hydrographic vessel — one of nine ships in New Zealand's navy — were all evacuated safely. Early fears of a catastrophic fuel spill were later quashed by officials who said oil had not gushed from the ship as it sank. But many who live in Siumu and surrounding villages are worried that damage to the reef from the wreck threatens their longer-term survival. 'I don’t know when it’s going to be good again and to back to the normal as we have before,' said Netina Malae, who has temporarily closed her small resort at nearby Tafitoala. The colorful fales, or huts, lining the beach sit empty. Recovery efforts on the reef have focused on removing three large shipping containers left after the sinking, one of them laden with food. New Zealand's military hoped to float the final one — which is empty and damaged — to shore on Tuesday, although winds and tides threatened to foil their efforts. Meanwhile, fishers who once spent their days where the boat foundered face longer and more expensive trips, they told The Associated Press. 'We doubled the amount of petrol to go far out to get fish,' said Faalogo Afereti Taliulu, citing advice from Samoa’s government that seafood from the area around the sunken ship should not be eaten. 'That’s why that’s our concern. It’s financially affecting us.' Taliulu and others from the village on Upolu, the largest island of Samoa, fish mostly for tuna. It is their biggest industry and a family affair. His cousin, Taula Fagatuai, said currents and tides meant the fishers were unsure if seafood they were catching further afield than the exclusion area was safe to eat. Repercussions for the fragile marine ecosystem of damage caused by the vessel, its anchor chain and shipping containers are not yet clear. 'That boat is going to be ruining our reef,' Fagatuai said. Some in Siumu and surrounding villages are urging New Zealand’s government to pay compensation for their lost earnings, but a swift resolution is unlikely. The cause of the ship’s sinking is unknown and a court of inquiry has been established to investigate the episode. How much fuel is seeping from the vessel is another contested matter. New Zealand’s Defense Minister Judith Collins said last week that a residual 'trickle' of diesel from the ship was evaporating quickly from the ocean's surface. She said the amount of fuel that had spilled into the ocean was less than what had been reported by Samoan officials and that much of what the ship was carrying burned out in the fire. Samoa's Prime Minister Fiame Naomi Mata’afa assured reporters last week that there was 'no evidence of any leaks' from the vessel's main tanks. But the amount of diesel that flowed from the ship as it sank is not known, Commodore Andrew Brown, the senior national representative for the New Zealand’s military in Samoa, told the AP on Tuesday. Retrieving the remaining fuel from the sunken vessel was 'a priority,' he added. There are not yet plans to raise the vessel from its resting place. The diesel sheen on the water surface and its movement in the currents is observed daily, Brown said. 'We’re also monitoring the coastline.' Officials from both countries have said there is no visible damage to Samoa's beaches or wildlife. But some in the surrounding villages, who say they have encountered oil in the water and seen it coating people or fish, are not reassured. 'My children went to the spot where they surf. And when they came back they said that everywhere there is oil,' Malae said. 'And then I touched their bodies -- slippery with the oil. So I’m sure that this oil was there.' The disaster unfolded as Samoa prepared to host the British royals — who will stay at a resort near Siumu's fishing village — and other world leaders at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. Meetings among civil society leaders have already begun, with an official opening ceremony scheduled for Friday. But the uncertainty over the impact of the sunken ship has curtailed tourism opportunities during the event. Malae usually takes visitors out to sea on fishing or surfing trips or to spot turtles. Now, she said, 'it's all stopped.' ___ Graham-McLay reported from Wellington, New Zealand.	https://apnews.com/article/samoa-king-charles-zealand-navy-boat-sank-be10fb9b6d85ff74c25f07daaafa9198	2024-10-21T20:41:04-07:00	
Stock market today: Asian shares fall after Wall Street pulls back from its records	TOKYO (AP) — Asian shares outside of China declined in cautious trading Tuesday ahead of earnings reports both in the region and overseas, after Wall Street’s long, record-breaking rally ran out of steam. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 dove 1.1% to 38,496.44. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 dropped 1.6% to 8,213.00, while South Korea's Kospi slipped nearly 1.0% to 2,579.56. Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 0.5% to 20,576.07 while the Shanghai Composite rose 0.5% to 3,285.49 following a cut to interest rates that took effect on Monday. On Wall Street, the S&amp;P 500 slipped 0.2% to 5,853.98, coming off a sixth straight winning week, its longest such streak of the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.8% from its own record that was likewise set on Friday, to 42,931.60. The Nasdaq composite rose 0.3% to 18,540.00. Real-estate stocks fell to the sharpest loss among the 11 sectors that make up the S&amp;P 500 index, while homebuilders Lennar and D.R. Horton both fell at least 4.3%. Home Depot’s 2.1% drop was one of the heaviest weights on the S&amp;P 500. The declines mean at least a pause in Wall Street’s rally to records, which was built in large part on optimism that the U.S. economy can make a perfect escape from the worst inflation in generations, one that ends without a painful recession that many investors had worried could be inevitable. With the Federal Reserve now cutting interest rates to keep the economy humming, optimists hope stocks can rise even further. But critics are warning stock prices look too expensive given they’ve climbed much faster than corporate profits. That puts pressure on companies to deliver growth in profits to justify their stock prices, and more than 100 companies in the S&amp;P 500 are scheduled to give details this week about their performances during the summer. That includes such heavyweights as AT&amp;T, Coca-Cola, IBM, General Motors and Tesla. Tesla slipped 0.8% ahead of its report. Its stock has been shaky recently, including a tumble after an update on its highly anticipated robotaxi included fewer details than investors were hoping for. Boeing is reporting its latest results on Wednesday. It rose 3.1% after reaching an agreement with the union representing its striking machinists on a contract proposal. The union’s members could vote Wednesday on the deal, which could end a costly walkout that has crippled production of airplanes for more than a month. Trump Media &amp; Technology Group rose 5.8% to top $31, continuing its strong run since it briefly dipped below $12 last month. The company behind former President Donald Trump’s Truth Social platform is still losing money, but its stock often moves more with his perceived chances of reelection than anything else. Markets appear to be rotating towards a possible Trump win, according to Michael Wilson and other strategists at Morgan Stanley. They point to how stocks of financial companies have helped to lead the market this month, and consumer companies that could be hurt by tariffs are lagging. Bond yields are also rising, along with some precious metals prices and cryptocurrencies. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.19% from 4.08% late Friday. The Bank of Canada will also announce its latest decision on interest rates Wednesday, where it could cut by half a percentage point. In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude lost 21 cents to $70.35 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 18 cents to $74.11 a barrel. In currency trading, the U.S. dollar rose to 150.96 Japanese yen from 150.69 yen. The euro was unchanged at $1.0819. ___ AP Business Writer Stan Choe contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-china-earnings-rates-0323c07ea21f8a000c26b9c7f2a6cb64	2024-10-21T19:42:44-07:00	
In annual religious pilgrimage, Panamanians crawl to reach the Black Christ of Portobelo	PORTOBELO, Panama (AP) — At dawn, pilgrims like Ernesto Troya undertook the hardest stretch of their journey to reach the statue of the Black Christ of Portobelo in Panama. Moved by faith, they crawled for several hours along the street toward the image of the saint. It is one of the most striking scenes to happen every year in the northern province of Colón. Every Oct. 21, the province celebrates the festival of the Black Christ of Portobelo. It is considered one of the largest Catholic pilgrimages in the Central American country and dates back centuries. Portobelo is a tourist destination that is part of Panama’s historical and cultural heritage. The city served as a port and trade center during the Spanish colonial times in the Caribbean Sea. According to some historians, legend has it that a fisherman found the statue of the Black Christ wrapped in a 'cayuco,' or wooden boat, off the coast of Portobelo on Oct. 21, 1658. When the Spaniards discovered the presence of the saint, they decided to move it to another country on the continent. However, every time the boat tried to set sail with the statue, a storm came and prevented it from leaving port. The settlers, many of them of slave and African descent, adopted the image as their patron saint. Thousands of pilgrims arrive at the church of San Felipe, which houses the Black Christ on an altar. After walking long distances in what is known as 'mandas' they give thanks for a favor or miracle granted. Many pilgrims like Troya, a 46-year-old security guard, made a dramatic final run through the streets of the town. Crawling to the image of the Christ, the pilgrimage usually causes cramps and knee injuries. 'If one gets on their knees with the faith one has (in the saint) everything will go well. With faith everything is possible,' said Troya.	https://apnews.com/article/panama-black-christ-pilgrimage-religion-portobelo-1394eb0de3ac6b6fe2d77f23e88505b3	2024-10-21T19:06:04-07:00	
China holds live-fire drills opposite Taiwan, a week after large-scale exercise	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — China is holding live-fire drills off the coast of its southern Fujian province facing Taiwan, just a week after a massive air-and-sea drill it described as punishment for Taiwan's president rejecting Beijing's claims of sovereignty. The live-fire drills were being held near the Pingtan islands, according to a notice from the Maritime Safety Administration. It warned ships to avoid the area. It did not offer additional details. Taiwan's Defense Ministry said China's drills were part of an annual exercise and it was tracking them. 'It cannot be ruled out that it is one of the ways to expand the deterrent effect in line with the dynamics in the Taiwan Strait,' the statement added. Taiwan is a self-ruled island that Beijing claims is part of China. Tensions around the issue have flared in recent years. China has increased its presence in the waters and skies around Taiwan. It now increasingly sends large numbers of warplanes and navy vessels to military exercises near Taiwan, and its coast guard carries out patrols. Last week, China held a one-day military exercise aimed at practicing the 'sealing off of key ports and key areas.' Taiwan counted a record one-day total of 153 aircraft, 14 navy vessels and 12 Chinese government ships. Taiwan's premier, Cho Jung-tai, called on China to stop its exercises aimed at Taiwan. 'Like all democratic countries in the world, we believe that China’s military exercises are a threat to regional peace and stability. Regardless of the scale of the exercise, China’s military exercises should not frequently approach Taiwan to make meaningless declarations,' he said. In response to Chinese moves, the U.S. has continued what it calls 'freedom of navigation' transits through the Taiwan Strait. On Sunday, the destroyer USS Higgins and the Canadian frigate HMCS Vancouver transited the narrow band of ocean that separates China and Taiwan. Germany sent two warships through the Taiwan Strait last month as it seeks to increase its defense engagement in the Asia-Pacific region. China has also exerted diplomatic pressure on Taiwan, poaching its allies. South Africa, which does not recognize Taiwan as a country, asked the island last week to move its liaison office outside the capital, Pretoria, as a concession to China. Taiwan on Monday said it would fight the request. —— AP senior video producer Johnson Lai contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/china-taiwan-live-fire-drills-4f7b62d187f68878acdacdd4d55fb891	2024-10-21T19:01:54-07:00	
King Charles III's Commonwealth visit to Samoa will highlight climate change ... and dance	LONDON (AP) — King Charles III should be prepared to dance when he visits Samoa this week. Freddie Tuilagi made sure of that when he visited St. James' Palace recently wearing nothing but a bark cloth wrap and a necklace historically worn by orator chiefs. Charles, in a blue suit and carefully knotted tie, grinned while gamely trying to follow along as Samoa’s honorary consul to the U.K. moved through the steps of a traditional dance. 'He loves it. He said he wants to learn the dance,' Tuilagi said afterward, showing off his moves once again. Tuilagi, who moved to Britain to play professional rugby, said the 75-year-old king can expect more of the same when he arrives in the South Pacific island nation on Wednesday. Villagers throughout the country of 220,000 people have taken steps to decorate and show how much they appreciate Charles’ visit, he said. Charles, the symbolic head of the Commonwealth, is traveling to Samoa for a meeting of top government officials from each of the 56 independent nations that make up the organization. At the top of the agenda is the fight against climate change, an issue Charles has championed for decades. The king can count on Samoans to be receptive. Its islands are at the forefront of the climate emergency, facing increasing threats from rising sea levels, warming ocean temperatures and more intense storms. The royal visit is attracting global media attention. Many Samoans hope that images of the king and Queen Camilla strolling on the islands’ breathtaking beaches will help attract European tourists and boost the economy. 'It’s an opportunity to showcase our culture, showcase our heritage and how ... proud (of) that we are as a country,’’ Tuilagi told The Associated Press. 'To host the king and the leaders of the Pacific, you know, the Commonwealth coming to Samoa is something special for us.’’ Before his Samoa trip, Charles visited Australia, where not everyone welcomed him. On Monday, Sen. Lidia Thorpe, shouted 'you are not my king,'' at a parliamentary reception for the king to protest the former British Empire's treatment of Indigenous peoples and to call on Australia to sever ties with the monarchy. But Samoa has a different relationship with the monarchy. Unlike Australia, Samoa is not one of the 14 independent countries outside the United Kingdom where the British monarch remains the head of state. Tuilagi said he hopes his demonstration of Samoan dance and song will help the king when he arrives. He particularly hoped that he would make an impression since he wore national dress, which includes leaving the shirt at home. Think joy. That's Tuilagi's point. 'It’s not every day the king will see a chief from Samoa topless ... at the palace,’’ he said, chuckling.	https://apnews.com/article/king-charles-samoa-commonwealth-dance-89b658cf3b0529b7a19c0361208a29c8	2024-10-21T18:27:27-07:00	
King Charles III ends first Australian visit by a reigning British monarch in 13 years	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — King Charles III ends the first visit to Australia by a reigning British monarch in 13 years Tuesday with anti-monarchists hoping his journey is a step toward an Australian citizen becoming head of state. Controversy interrupted the visit on Monday when Indigenous independent senator Lidia Thorpe yelled at Charles during a reception that he was not her king and Australia was not his land. Esther Anatolitis, co-chair of the Australian Republic Movement, that campaigns for an Australian citizen to replace the British monarch as Australia’s head of state, said while thousands turned out to see the king and Queen Camilla at their public engagements, the numbers were larger when his mother Queen Elizabeth II first visited Australia 70 years ago. An estimated 75% of Australia’s population saw the queen in person during the first visit by a reigning British monarch in 1954. 'It’s understandable that Australians would be welcoming the king and queen, we also welcome them,' Anatolitis said. 'But it doesn’t make any sense to continue to have a head of state appointed by birth right from another country.' Anatolitis acknowledged that getting a majority of Australians in a majority of states to vote to change the constitution would be difficult. Australians haven’t changed their constitution since 1977. 'It’s tricky, isn’t it? We’ve got that hurdle, of course,' Anatolitis said. Constitutional lawyer Anne Twomey said an Australian republic was not something that Charles, 75, need worry about in his lifetime. She said the failure of a referendum last year to create an 'utterly innocuous' Indigenous representative body to advise government demonstrated the difficulty in changing Australia’s constitution. 'It’s just that on the whole people aren’t prepared to change the constitution,' Twomey said. 'So a republic, which would be a much more complex constitutional question than the one last year, would be far more vulnerable to a scare campaign and to opposition,' she said. 'So unless you had absolutely unanimous support across the board and a strong reason for doing it, it would fail,' she added. Philip Benwell, national chair of the Australian Monarchist League, which wants to maintain Australia’s constitutional link to Britain, said he was standing near Thorpe at the Canberra reception when she started yelling at the king and demanding a treaty with Indigenous Australians. 'I think she alienated a lot of sympathy. If anything, she’s helped to strengthen our support,' Benwell said. Thorpe has been criticized, including by some Indigenous leaders, for shouting at the king and failing to show respect. Thorpe was unrepentant. She rejected criticism that her aggressive approach toward the monarch was violent. 'I think what was unacceptable is the violence in that room, of the King of England praising himself, dripping in stolen wealth, that’s what’s violent,' Thorpe told Australian Broadcasting Corp. 'The violence is from the colonizer being in that room asserting his authority, being paid for by every taxpayer in this country.' Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese wants Australia to become a republic but has ruled out a referendum during his first three-year term. A vote remains a possibility if his center-left Labor Party wins elections due by May next year. Australians decided in a referendum in 1999 to retain Queen Elizabeth II as head of state. That result is widely regarded to have been the consequence of disagreement about how a president would be chosen rather than majority support for a monarch. Sydney University royal historian Cindy McCreery suspects Australia is not yet ready to make the change. 'There's interest in becoming a republic, but I think what we may forget is that logistically speaking we're not going to have a referendum on that issue any time soon,' McCreery said. 'I, as a historian, think that it's probably not realistic to expect a successful referendum on a republic until we've done more work on acknowledging our ... complicated history,' she said. 'Becoming a republic doesn't mean that we've somehow thrown off British colonialism. It hopefully has meant that we're engaging with our own history in an honest and thoughtful way,' she added. Charles and Camilla’s Tuesday began watching Indigenous dancers perform at a Sydney Indigenous community center. The couple used tongs to cook sausages at a community barbecue lunch at the central suburb of Parramatta and later shook the hands of well-wishers for the last time of their visit outside the Sydney Opera House. Their final engagement was an inspection of navy ships on Sydney Harbor in an event known as a fleet review. Charles's trip to Australia was scaled down because he is undergoing cancer treatment. He arrives in Samoa on Wednesday.	https://apnews.com/article/australia-king-charles-republic-monarchy-2bdb86c1e7e492f4447288efd84c74ed	2024-10-21T18:22:50-07:00	
Two plead guilty to murder of former Air India suspect Ripudaman Singh Mali	NEW WESTMINSTER, British Columbia (AP) — Two men accused of killing of former Air India bombing suspect Ripudaman Singh Malik have pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in a Canadian court. The courthouse in New Westminster, British Columbia, confirmed the pleas on Monday from Tanner Fox and Jose Lopez in the shooting death of Malik, who was acquitted in 2005 of the bombings that killed 331 people in 1985. Fox and Lopez, who were originally charged with first-degree murder, will next appear in court on Oct. 31 for sentencing. In a statement, Malik’s family said while the family is 'grateful' that Fox and Lopez were brought to justice, they are urging the two men to cooperate with police 'in bringing those that hired you to justice.' Malik, 75, was shot dead in his vehicle outside his business in Surrey, British Columbia, on July 14, 2022. He was a one-time supporter of the separatist Khalistan movement in India. Malik and a co-defendant were found not guilty of murder and conspiracy in the 1985 Air India bombings. A high-altitude bombing of one plane caused it to crash in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Ireland, killing all 329 passengers and crew. The terror attack was the worst act of mass murder in Canadian history. Roughly one hour later, a bomb destined for another Air India plane exploded prematurely at an airport in Japan, killing two baggage handlers. Inderjit Singh Reyat, the only man convicted in the bombings, testified for the prosecution at Malik and Bagri’s trial and was later convicted of perjury. The alleged suspects in the bombings were Sikhs in the Khalistan movement, an effort to create a separate homeland for Sikhs in India’s Punjab state. Police said before charging Fox and Lopez that people waited for hours in a vehicle for Malik before the shooting. Malik’s son, Jaspreet Singh Malik, has said family members had never heard of Fox or Lopez, and he did not know why anyone would kill his father. In the latest statement, the Malik family called the killing an assassination without identifying who they believe to be involved. 'Tanner Fox and Jose Lopez were hired to commit this murder,' the statement said. 'Until the parties responsible for hiring them and directing this assassination are brought to justice, the work remains incomplete. 'To Tanner Fox and Jose Lopez we say: You have taken a good first step in taking responsibility for your actions. Now take the next step and co-operate with the RCMP in bringing those that hired you to justice.' Earlier this month, Royal Canadian Mounted Commissioner Mike Duheme said the force had launched a special unit to investigate multiple cases of extortion, coercion and violence, including murders, linked to agents of the Indian government. Duheme said the RCMP were speaking out due to what it deemed as a serious threat to public safety. Canada expelled six Indian diplomats who police have named as persons of interest in the cases. They were not specific about which murders may be involved in the allegations. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told Parliament last year that there was credible intelligence linking India’s government to the murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a temple leader shot while in his truck in the parking lot of the gurdwara in Surrey, British Columbia. Four men have been charged in that murder. Police are alleging that diplomats used their position to collect information on Canadians within the Khalistan movement. Mounties alleged the diplomats passed the information on to criminal gangs who targeted individuals directly, allegations that India has denied. Court documents show both Fox and Lopez have previous criminal records.	https://apnews.com/article/air-india-bombing-suspect-murder-canada-98257bb3ff8522ee4aaa3901353eff3f	2024-10-21T17:21:22-07:00	
Peru’s ex-president Toledo gets more than 20 years in prison in case linked to corruption scandal	LIMA, Peru (AP) — Peru’s former President Alejandro Toledo on Monday was sentenced to 20 years and six months in prison in a case involving Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht, which became synonymous with corruption across Latin America, where it paid millions of dollars in bribes to government officials and others. Authorities accused Toledo of accepting $35 million in bribes from Odebrecht in exchange for allowing the construction of a highway in the South American country. The National Superior Court of Specialized Criminal Justice in the capital, Lima, imposed the sentence after years of legal wrangling, including a dispute over whether Toledo, who governed Peru from 2001 to 2006, could be extradited from the United States. Judge Inés Rojas said Toledo’s victims were Peruvians who 'trusted' him as their president. Rojas explained that in that role, Toledo was 'in charge of managing public finances' and responsible for 'protecting and ensuring the correct' use of resources. Instead, she said, he 'defrauded the state.' She added that Toledo 'had the duty to act with absolute neutrality, protect and preserve the assets of the state, avoiding their abuse or exploitation,' but he did not do so. Odebrecht, which built some of Latin America’s most crucial infrastructure projects, admitted to U.S. authorities in 2016 to having bought government contracts throughout the region with generous bribes. The investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice spun probes in several countries, including Mexico, Guatemala and Ecuador. In Peru, authorities accused Toledo and three other former presidents of receiving payments from the construction giant. They alleged Toledo received $35 million from Odebrecht in exchange for the contract to build 650 kilometers (403 miles) of a highway linking Brazil with southern Peru. That portion of the highway was initially estimated to cost $507 million, but Peru ended up paying $1.25 billion. Rojas at one point read parts of the testimony from Jorge Barata, a former Odebrecht executive in Peru, who told prosecutors that the former president called him up to three times after leaving office to demand that he be paid. Toledo lowered his gaze and looked at his hands as Rojas read the expletive-laden remarks that Barata recounted to prosecutors. Toledo has denied the accusations against him. His attorney, Roberto Siu, told reporters after the hearing that they will appeal the sentence. The former president on Monday frequently smirked, and at times laughed, particularly when the judge mentioned multimillion-dollar sums central to the case as well as when she struggled to read transcripts and other evidence in the case. Throughout the hearing, he also leaned to his right to speak with his attorney. In contrast, last week, he asked the court with a broken voice and his hands together, as if he were praying, to let him return home citing his age, cancer and heart problems. Toledo, 78, was first arrested in 2019 at his home in California, where he had been living since 2016, when he returned to Stanford University, his alma mater, as a visiting scholar to study education in Latin America. He was initially held in solitary confinement at a county jail east of San Francisco but was released to house arrest in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic and his deteriorating mental health. He was extradited to Peru in 2022 after a court of appeals denied a challenge to his extradition and he surrendered to authorities. He has since remained under preventive detention. Rojas said Toledo will get credit for time served starting in April 2023. He will serve the remainder of his sentence at a prison on the outskirts of Lima that was built specifically to house former Peruvian presidents. Prosecutor José Domingo Pérez after the hearing described the sentence as 'historic' and said it shows Peruvians that 'crimes and corruption are punished.' Odebrecht rebranded as Novonor in 2020. ____ Garcia Cano reported from Mexico City. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/peru-toledo-prison-sentence-odebrecht-5f23c3d8fd176dfc6ca8125e96b2e3ec	2024-10-21T14:11:02-07:00	
Hundreds mourn Catholic priest and Indigenous peace activist killed in southern Mexico	SAN ANDRES LARRAINZAR, Mexico (AP) — Hundreds gathered Monday to mourn Catholic priest Marcelo Pérez, an activist for Indigenous peoples and farm laborers who was killed in the southern Mexico state of Chiapas. It was a killing that many say was a tragedy foretold, in a state where drug cartels have caused thousands of people to flee their homes. Mourners gathered in San Andres Larrainzar, near the city of San Cristobal de las Casas, where Pérez was killed on Sunday. Pérez, a leading activist for peace in the violence-torn state, was from San Andrés Larrainzar. A mass in his honor Monday was held in Spanish and Tzotzil, the Indigenous language he spoke. Pérez, 50, had often received threats, but nonetheless continued to work as a peace activist. Human rights advocates said Pérez did not receive the government protection he needed. 'For years, we insisted that the Mexican government should address the threats and aggressions against him, but they never implemented measures to guarantee his life, security and well-being,' The Fray Bartolome de las Casas human rights center wrote. While there was no immediate information on the killers — President Claudia Sheinbaum only said that 'investigations are being carried out' — Rev. Pérez's peace and mediation efforts may have angered one of the two drug cartels that are currently fighting for control of Chiapas. The state is a lucrative route for smuggling both drugs and migrants. 'Father Marcelo Pérez was the subject of constant threats and aggressions on the part of organized crime groups,' according to the rights center, adding that his killing 'occurred in the context of a serious escalation of violence against the public in all the regions of Chiapas.' For at least the last two years, the Sinaloa and Jalisco cartels have been engaged in bloody turf battles that involve killing whole families, and forcing villagers to take sides in the dispute. Hundreds of Chiapas residents have had to flee to neighboring Guatemala for their own safety. 'They should look for an intelligent way to disarm those groups,' said Cardinal Felipe Arizmendi, who once served as the bishop for the area. 'They shouldn't wait for people to file complaints, and people are going to file complaints because their lives are at risk.' Together with continued drug violence in the northern state of Sinaloa, and the army killings of six migrants earlier this month, the killing of Pérez was another embarrassment for the government. Sheinbaum took office Oct. 1 and has pledged to follow the policy of her predecessor and mentor, former president Andrés Manuel López Obrador, of not confronting the drug cartels. The policy has failed to significantly reduce violence. 'This is a reflection of the whole country,' Cardinal Arizmendi said following the mass for Pérez. 'They shouldn't say everything is fine in Mexico. Please.' he continued. 'This strategy has not worked.' The state prosecutors’ office said Rev. Pérez was shot dead by two gunmen when he was in his van, just after he had finished celebrating Mass. He served in the community for two decades and was known as a negotiator in conflicts in a mountainous region of Chiapas where crime, violence and land disputes are rife. Pérez also led several marches against violence, which has brought him several death threats. The U.N. Human Rights Office said Pérez was the seventh human rights activist killed in Mexico so far in 2024. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-violence-chiapas-priest-activist-killed-91babd8eb739a110888d69b5d1afef86	2024-10-21T13:34:30-07:00	
A New Zealand airport wants you to hug goodbye faster	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Emotional farewells are a common sight at airports, but travelers leaving the New Zealand city of Dunedin will have to be quick. A new three-minute time limit on goodbye hugs in the airport's drop-off area is intended to prevent lingering cuddles from causing traffic jams. 'Max hug time three minutes,' warn signs outside the terminal, adding that those seeking 'fonder farewells' should head to the airport’s parking lot instead. The cuddle cap was imposed in September to 'keep things moving smoothly' in the redesigned passenger drop-off area outside the airport, CEO Dan De Bono told The Associated Press on Tuesday. It was the airport’s way of reminding people that the zone was for 'quick farewells' only. The signs had polarized social media users, De Bono said. 'We were accused of breaching basic human rights and how dare we limit how long someone can have a hug for,' he said, adding that others had welcomed the change. The signs were meant as an alternative to those at other airports warning of wheel clamping or fines for drivers parked in drop-off areas. Some in Britain have imposed fees for all drop-offs — however brief. Dunedin's airport — a modest terminal serving a city of 135,000 people on New Zealand's South Island — preferred a 'quirky' approach, De Bono said. Three minutes was 'plenty of time to pull up, say farewell to your loved ones and move on,' he said. 'The time limit is really a nicer way of saying, you know, get on with it.' A 20-second hug is long enough to release the wellbeing-boosting hormones oxytocin and serotonin, De Bono said. Anything longer was 'really awkward.' But passengers need not worry unduly about enforcement. 'We do not have hug police,' De Bono said. Visitors might, however, be asked to move their lingering embraces to the parking lot, where they can cuddle free of charge for up to 15 minutes.	https://apnews.com/article/new-zealand-airport-goodbye-hugs-time-limit-d6176082ffb6ab66e8d2f05dd590b8aa	2024-10-21T13:23:53-07:00	
President Paul Biya returns to Cameroon amid rumors his health is failing	YAOUNDE, Cameroon (AP) — Cameroon’s President Paul Biya returned to his home country after weeks abroad amid rumors that his health is failing, a state-run television station reported Monday. The 91-year-old president of the West African country appeared on television at the airport in the capital Yaounde, shaking hands with officials next to his wife Chantal and greeted by a cheering crowd of supporters. 'Finally, this is not a phantom, it is President Paul Piya having a lengthy discussion with government officials,' a presenter from the state-run broadcaster Cameroon Radio Television (CRTV) said. Questions about Biya's health and whereabouts grew after he was last seen in public at the China-Africa summit in Beijing a month ago. Since then, he has not attended gatherings where he had been expected, including the United Nations General Assembly and the International Organization of La Francophonie summit in France. Biya, who is known for traveling often to Europe, is known to be sick but no details have been publicly shared. Biya is Africa’s second-longest-serving leader and Cameroon’s second president since independence in 1960. He has been in power since 1982. He is the only leader many in the country have ever known. His government faces various challenges, including the secessionist movement in Cameroon’s English-speaking provinces that has resulted in deadly clashes with security forces as well as Islamic extremist violence by the Boko Haram group based in neighboring Nigeria.	https://apnews.com/article/cameroon-president-biya-return-health-60c15abc848d5de766b72c1139d147f3	2024-10-21T10:41:44-07:00	
What is the Hezbollah-linked financial institution Israel is targeting in Lebanon?	BEIRUT (AP) — The Israeli military has carried out a wave of airstrikes targeting branches of a financial institution affiliated with Lebanon’s Hezbollah, saying the quasi-banking system is being used to fund the militant group's military wing. The strikes destroyed more than a dozen branches of al-Qard al-Hasan across Lebanon Sunday night, and came two weeks after an airstrike killed the man who many referred to as Hezbollah’s 'finance minister.' After assassinating most of Hezbollah’s top political and military commanders, including the group’s longtime leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, and pummeling its communities with devastating airstrikes, Israel says it is now going after the Shiite group’s funders and financial institutions in an attempt to further disrupt it and its base of support. Hezbollah started attacking Israeli military posts along the border with Lebanon a day after the Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Hamas on southern Israel that killed some 1,200 people and took about 250 hostage. Hezbollah said that by launching attacks along the Lebanon-Israel border it was backing up its Hamas allies in the Gaza Strip. What is al-Qard al-Hasan and who benefits from it? Al-Qard al-Hasan is officially a non-profit charity institution operating outside the Lebanese financial system, and one of the tools by which Hezbollah entrenches its support among the country’s Shiite population. In addition to its military wing, Hezbollah has branches that run schools, hospitals, low-price grocery stores, as well as al-Qard al-Hasan, from which hundreds of thousands of its supporters benefit. Israel says the institution finances arms purchases and is used to pay Hezbollah fighters. The U.S. Treasury has imposed sanctions on it since 2007, saying it is 'used by Hezbollah as a cover' to manage the militant group’s financial activities 'and gain access to the international financial system.' Founded four decades ago, soon after Hezbollah’s inception, the association, whose name in Arabic means 'the benevolent loan,' offers interest-free loans and allows people to deposit gold as collateral in return for the credit, enabling them to pay for school fees and weddings, buy a car or open a small business. People can also open savings accounts. Al-Qard al-Hasan has more than 30 branches around Lebanon. Following Lebanon’s 2019 financial collapse, the institution provided a lifeline for many Lebanese. Unlike banks around the country that imposed limits on how much people could withdraw from their bank accounts, people with deposits at al-Qard al-Hasan were still able to withdraw their cash. In 2021, the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control imposed sanctions on seven individuals in connection with Hezbollah and al-Qard al-Hasan. A year later, the Biden administration slapped terrorism sanctions on two others, including al-Qard al-Hasan’s director, Adel Mansour, and two companies in Lebanon for providing Hezbollah with financial services. Mansour did not respond to messages left by The Associated Press for comment. After sanctions were imposed against him two years, he told the AP: 'I am proud and this is a medal of honor for me.' A senior official at the central bank in Beirut refused to comment about the Israeli targeting of al-Qard al-Hasan branches when contacted by the AP on Monday. David Asher, an expert on illicit financing who has worked at the U.S. Defense and State Departments and is now a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, said the Israeli attacks were 'a big deal.' 'Al-Qard al-Hasan is part of Hezbollah’s central financial unit,' which is akin to its treasury, he said. Faysal Abdul-Sater, a Lebanese political analyst who closely follows Hezbollah’s affairs, said the militant group is not funded through al-Qard al-Hasan. He said the money deposited at the institution belongs to individuals and companies, and the system benefits people with low incomes. 'This is a symbolic strike,' Abdul-Sater said about targeting al-Qard al-Hasan. How harmful are the Israeli strikes? The systematic destruction of al-Qard al-Hasan branches, coming after assassinations that took out almost all of Hezbollah’s top leadership and displaced hundreds of thousands of the group’s supporters, is bound to add to the chaos and fears within Hezbollah’s base of support. But experts say it is unlikely to harm Hezbollah's finances in and of itself. Al-Qard al-Hasan tried to reassure customers, saying in a statement late Sunday that it had evacuated all its branches and relocated gold and other deposits to safe areas. Lebanese economist Louis Hobeika said destroying al-Qard al-Hasan branches will have no effect on Hezbollah’s funding as its money comes from Iran and wealthy supporters around the world. The group's salaries are known to be paid in cash in dollars. 'As long as Iran and Hezbollah’s allies are funding the group it will not be affected,' Hobeika said, adding that the flow of 'bags of cash' from abroad will continue just like in the past. Lina Khatib, an associate fellow at Chatham House who focuses on the Middle East, said al-Qard al-Hasan customers still have faith that 'Hezbollah will be able to compensate them for their losses.' Khatib noted that al-Qard al-Hasan's operations, like those of any financial institution, are not limited to any physical assets the strikes targeted. A Lebanese woman who gave only her first name, Zahraa, for safety reasons, said she was in need of cash and deposited a gold necklace and several rings earlier this year in return for an $800 loan. The woman said she has been repaying it in $50 monthly installments. 'I don’t care whether I get the gold or not at a time when men are sacrificing their souls in south Lebanon,' Zahraa said referring to Hezbollah gunmen who are fighting invading Israeli forces. Who was the Hezbollah financier killed? Israel began going after Hezbollah's finances earlier this month, when an Israeli airstrike destroyed the top two floors of a south Beirut building, killing Mohammed Jaafar Qassir, who the U.S. Treasury and Israel accused of transferring hundreds of millions of dollars from Iran to Hezbollah over the years. The U.S. had offered $10 million for information leading to the disruption of the financial mechanisms of Hezbollah. The U.S. Treasury said Qassir provided funding for Hezbollah operations through a number of 'illegal smuggling and procurement activities and other criminal enterprises.' It added that Qassir was also a critical conduit for financial disbursements from the powerful Quds Force branch of Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard that are used to fund Hezbollah’s activities. The Israeli military said Qassir was in charge of Hezbollah’s Unit 4400, which ships weapons from Iran to Lebanon, and supervised Hezbollah’s development of precision-guided missiles. Hezbollah did not comment on Qassir’s killing. Days after Qassir was killed in Beirut, an airstrike in Damascus, Syria, blamed on Israel killed his brother Hasan, who was married to Nasrallah’s daughter, Zeinab. ____ Associated Press writers Adam Schreck in Jerusalem and Mohammad Zaatari in Sidon, Lebanon, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/alqard-alhassan-hezbollah-lebanon-israel-airstrikes-67220b894b55500b0be799a0be4245c3	2024-10-21T08:40:11-07:00	
Finnish conductor and composer Segerstam will be honored with a tribute event after his funeral	HELSINKI (AP) — The prolific Finnish conductor and composer Leif Segerstam, who was one of the most colorful personalities in the Nordic country’s classical music scene, will be remembered in a tribute event at the Finnish National Opera following his funeral next month, his family said Monday. His son Jan Segerstam told The Associated Press that the Nov. 8 memorial for his father, who died in Helsinki on Oct. 9 at age 80 from complications following pneumonia, will showcase his musical history. He said it will include musical tributes for the artist who composed his first work at age 6 and was also a violinist. As a composer, Segerstam became known for creating 371 symphonies, which he claimed was a world record. The large number is partly explained by the brevity of many works. Even illness didn’t stop his composing. 'He was creating music at the hospital, together with visiting music friends, still a few days before his death,' his son said. The last symphony created by Segerstam premiered in Helsinki during his 80th birthday in March. In an interview by Finnish news agency STT to mark his birthday, he said conducting an orchestra supported his composer’s work, as it gives 'a deeper knowledge of the soul life of the tunes.' From 1963 on, he conducted a variety of orchestras in Europe, including the Finnish National Opera, the Royal Swedish Opera, the Deutsche Oper Berlin and the Vienna Radio Symphony Orchestra. He also guest-conducted for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the Los Angeles Philharmonic and the Toronto Symphony Orchestra. Born in the coastal city of Vaasa in western Finland, Segerstam was brought up in a musical family. He initially trained as a violinist and pianist and studied at the Sibelius Academy in Helsinki and The Juilliard School in New York. From 1997 until 2013, he was a professor of orchestra conducting at the Sibelius Academy, where his students included now-prominent Finnish and international conductors. 'Leif was a very colorful human being,' his son said. 'He was a peculiar person who lived through the feelings of his music. That was his context. For many people coming from a more conventional background, he seemed to be an eccentric.' Segerstam was married and divorced twice and is survived by five children from the two marriages.	https://apnews.com/article/leif-segerstam-finland-obituary-composer-music-4714857dddcf924bfb9f103312c879cc	2024-10-21T08:33:33-07:00	
Russia investigates the claimed shoot-down of a cargo jet in Sudan's Darfur region	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces said Monday they shot down a cargo jet in the country’s far western reaches of Darfur, a claim that Russian diplomats said they were trying to investigate in the war zone. Mobile phone footage showed what appeared to be a debris field with fighters from the paramilitary force, known as the RSF, showing off what appeared to be identity documents recovered from the crash. However, documents also shown in the footage from the crash site suggest the aircraft was affiliated with an airline previously linked to an effort by the United Arab Emirates to arm the RSF in the war, something that has been strenuously denied by the UAE despite evidence. A message from Russia's Embassy in Khartoum confirmed its diplomats were investigating the incident in Sudan's Malha region in northern Darfur near the border with Chad. The embassy's message said Russians may have been on board at the time. The RSF has been at war with the Sudanese army since April 2023.The paramilitary force claimed in a statement it shot down a 'foreign warplane' that had been aiding the Sudanese military. It alleged without providing evidence that the aircraft had been dropping 'barrel bombs' on civilians. 'All foreign mercenaries aboard the aircraft were eliminated in the operation,' the statement said. Mobile phone footage showed fighters among the burning wreckage, claiming they shot down the aircraft with a surface-to-air missile. Identity documents shown included a Russian passport and an ID that linked back to a UAE-based company, whose phone number was disconnected. A crumpled safety card, also purportedly from the aircraft, identified the plane as an Ilyushin Il-76 flown by New Way Cargo of Kyrgyzstan. Civil aviation officials in Kyrgyzstan did not respond to a request for comment late Monday. The group Conflict Observatory, which is funded by the U.S. State Department and has been monitoring the Sudan war, linked New Way Cargo's Ilyushin Il-76s to arming the RSF in a report this month. It said the airline had facilitated the UAE arms transfers through flights to Aéroport International Maréchal Idriss Deby in Amdjarass, Chad — flights the UAE has claimed have been for supporting a local hospital. Amdjarass is just across the border from Malha, where the shoot-down reportedly happened. 'The UAE has used the airport as a waypoint to facilitate weapons to the RSF,' the report said, noting that the Emirates offered a $1.5 billion loan to rapidly expand the airport. 'Absent evidence of a significant local humanitarian crisis and a lack of significant Sudanese refugees in the area casts significant doubt on the UAE’s claims that the airport construction is only for a hospital.' United Nations experts have said accusations that the UAE armed the RSF were 'credible.' Emirati officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment over the reported plane shoot-down. Sudan's war has killed over 24,000 people so far, according to the group Armed Conflict Location and Event Data, which has been monitoring the violence since the conflict's start. The Sudanese army has been pursuing an intensified offensive near Khartoum, while forces allied with it have been battling the RSF in Darfur. Sudan has been unstable since a popular uprising forced the removal of longtime dictator Omar al-Bashir in 2019. The short-lived transition to democracy was derailed when two generals, the army's chief Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan and Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo of the RSF, joined forces to lead a military coup in October 2021. They began battling each other in 2023. Al-Bashir faces charges at the International Criminal Court over carrying out a genocidal campaign in the early 2000s in Darfur with the Janjaweed, the precursor to the RSF. Rights groups and the U.N. say the RSF and allied Arab militias again are attacking ethnic African groups in the war. ___ Associated Press writer Samy Magdy in Cairo contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/sudan-cargo-jet-shot-down-russia-rsf-war-2ddf073f44918eacd3d09357f0d39529	2024-10-21T08:25:32-07:00	
Biden is 'deeply concerned' about the release of secret documents on Israel's possible attack plans	WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden is 'deeply concerned' about the unauthorized release of classified documents on Israel's preparation for a potential retaliatory attack on Iran, a White House spokesman said Monday. The Biden administration is still not certain if the classified information was leaked or hacked, White House national security spokesman John Kirby said. Officials don’t have any indication at this point of 'additional documents like this finding their way into the public domain,' he said. Kirby added that the Pentagon is investigating. U.S. officials on Saturday had confirmed an investigation by the administration. 'We’re deeply concerned, and the president remains deeply concerned about any leakage of classified information into the public domain. That is not supposed to happen, and it’s unacceptable when it does,' Kirby said. The documents are attributed to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency, and note that Israel was still moving military assets in place to conduct a military strike in response to Iran’s blistering ballistic missile attack on Oct. 1. They were sharable within the 'Five Eyes,' an intelligence alliance comprised of the U.S., Great Britain, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. Marked top secret, the documents first appeared online Friday on the Telegram messaging app and quickly spread among Telegram channels popular with Iranians. Analysts at the SITE Intelligence Group, a consultancy that monitors and analyzes online threats from extremist groups, tracked the release of the documents to a Telegram channel popular with Iran-backed militias. The channel contained posts from an anonymous user with a long history of posting other supposedly top-secret content who said they had access to the documents. The user also wrote that they had sold some of the material and provided it to the Iranian military. The Telegram channel identifies itself as being based in Tehran, Iran’s capital. It previously published memes featuring Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and material in support of Tehran’s self-described 'Axis of Resistance,' which includes Middle East militant groups armed by the Islamic Republic. One of the two documents resembled the style of other material from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency leaked by Jack Teixeira, an Air National Guardsman who pleaded guilty in March to leaking highly classified military documents about Russia’s war on Ukraine and other national security secrets. The release comes at a pivotal time in the Middle East, as Israel considers its response to Iran's attack. The U.S. has urged Israel to take advantage of its elimination of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and press for a cease-fire in Gaza and has likewise urgently cautioned Israel not to further expand military operations in the north in Lebanon and risk a wider regional war. However, Israel’s leadership has repeatedly stressed it will not let Iran’s missile attack go unanswered. The investigation into the release of the documents may take some time as authorities look for digital or physical clues that could reveal how the information got out, and what implications it may have for information management and intelligence sharing with U.S. allies, according to Gavin Wilde, a senior fellow in the Technology and International Affairs Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. 'I imagine they'll eventually get to the bottom of it,' said Wilde, who formerly worked on the National Security Council. 'The intelligence community has gotten a lot better at digital chain of custody — who has seen a particular document, how many times it's been shared, and with whom.' White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Monday declined to comment on what changes the government has made to better safeguard top secret information in the aftermath of the Discord leak. She added that Biden has 'complete confidence' in the Pentagon, Justice Department and intelligence community following the latest unauthorized disclosure. The nation's spy agencies have worked to bolster cybersecurity since the Discord leak and the conviction of former NSA contractor Reality Winner. Accounting for human behavior, however, can be a harder challenge, according to Shawnee Delaney, a former officer at the Defense Intelligence Agency who is now CEO of the Vaillance Group, a private threat analysis firm. 'Cybersecurity isn’t just a technological issue,' Delaney told The Associated Press. 'It’s a human one, and humans are wholly unpredictable.' Spokespeople for the Pentagon and the NSA said officials were aware of the incident but had no further comment.	https://apnews.com/article/united-states-israel-iran-classified-documents-5cc9b0f30b7119a039d122599bf0c285	2024-10-21T07:39:24-07:00	
Slovakia and former Czech leader settle lawsuit over collaboration with communist secret police	PRAGUE (AP) — Slovakia’s Interior Ministry agreed in a lawsuit settlement Monday that former former Czech populist Prime Minister Andrej Babis did not knowingly collaborate with communist-era secret police in what was then Czechoslovakia The ministry said it acknowledged that any interpretations of documents in the archives of the StB secret police agency that Babis was a secret agent were unjustified Babis welcomed the settlement of a case that dated to 2012. 'I had no doubt that I’d win the dispute,' he said. Babis, who was born in Slovakia, was originally suing the Institute for National Memory, which holds parts of his secret police files following the division of Czechoslovakia into the Czech Republic and Slovakia in 1993. In a decision published on Feb. 1, Slovakia’s Constitutional Court, the highest legal authority in the country, upheld the previous rulings by lower courts dismissing the case. Some of the files were destroyed, but the institute said those that still exist contain evidence that Babis was an agent under the code name 'Bures' from 1982. Babis vehemently denied that. The regional court in the capital, Bratislava, originally rejected the lawsuit in 2018, but the Constitutional Court ordered a retrial, saying the institute could not be sued and the respondent should be the Slovak Interior Ministry. The ministry said its decision was based on two legal analyses of the case. Babis, a billionaire, is currently in opposition after his populist ANO centrist movement lost the 2021 parliamentary election. He was running to become the Czech president in the election for the largely ceremonial post in January last year but lost to Petr Pavel, a retired army general.	https://apnews.com/article/slovakia-babis-secret-police-collaboration-case-df786bf38b9e0d0acd9e20c1aa9c6f0d	2024-10-21T07:33:20-07:00	
London police officer who fatally shot a Black motorist is acquitted of murder	LONDON (AP) — A London police officer who fatally shot a Black motorist two years ago was acquitted Monday of murder in a case that intensified mistrust of Britain's largest police force among many in the city’s Black communities. Metropolitan Police marksman Martyn Blake, 40, was cleared by a London jury in the death of Chris Kaba, who was unarmed but was driving a vehicle that had been involved in a shooting a day earlier. Kaba, 24, was shot in the head after the vehicle was boxed in by two police cars on a narrow residential street in the Streatham Hill neighborhood on Sept. 5, 2022. Blake fired a single round through the windshield of the Audi because he thought fellow officers’ lives were in danger when Kaba began ramming the police cars in an attempt to break free. A prosecutor said Blake misjudged the risk to his colleagues, exaggerated the threat in statements after the shooting and aimed for Kaba's head. Blake denied those assertions. The shooting renewed racism allegations against the Met police, also known as Scotland Yard, as it had been trying to restore confidence following a series of scandals and an independent review that found it mired in sexism, homophobia and institutional racism. The rare decision to prosecute Blake, who had been suspended, created a backlash from some of his specially trained firearms colleagues who refused to carry their weapons in a show of solidarity. The Met was briefly forced to call on neighboring departments and the military for backup. Fatal shootings by police in the U.K. are rare. In the year to March 2023, officers in England and Wales who are authorized to carry a gun fired their weapons at people 10 times and killed three, according to official statistics. Prosecutions of British officers for murder or manslaughter for actions performed on duty are exceptionally rare. Jurors in London's Central Criminal Court deliberated for about three hours before finding Blake not guilty. Blake let out a puff of relief as the verdict was read. Kaba’s family, seated in the courtroom, showed no visible reaction. The family later said they were devastated and would continue to fight for justice. 'The not guilty verdict leaves us with the deep pain of injustice adding to the unbearable sorrow we have felt since Chris was killed,' the family said in a statement issued by the justice advocacy group Inquest. 'Chris was stolen from us, and this decision shows his life — and many others like him — does not matter to the system. Our son deserved better.' Prosecutors said their thoughts were with the Kaba family, but they respected the jury’s decision. 'We recognize that firearms officers operate under enormous pressure, but it is our responsibility to put cases before a jury that meet our test for prosecution, and we are satisfied that test was met in this case,' Frank Ferguson, head of the Crown Prosecution Service Special Crime and Counter Terrorism Division said. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Mark Rowley said Blake paid 'a huge personal and professional sacrifice' for 'a split-second decision on what he believed was necessary to protect his colleagues and to protect London.' Defense lawyer Patrick Gibbs said during his closing argument that Blake was not a 'RoboCop with total vision and nanosecond reactions like a computer.' 'He is not a robot, he is a human being with a human brain who did this to the best of his ability,' Gibbs said. Another firearms officer said he would have taken the shot if Blake had not and another said he was fractions of a second from pulling the trigger.	https://apnews.com/article/london-police-officer-acquitted-shooting-black-man-4d0fb07a538bad09f14fc3b238d23f8a	2024-10-21T06:24:04-07:00	
Police in Mozambique fire tear gas at opposition politician as post-election tensions soar	MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) — Police in Mozambique fired tear gas at the country's leading opposition politician and supporters as he spoke with reporters Monday, forcing them to run for cover as the nation remains on edge following a disputed election and the slaying of two prominent opposition figures. Venancio Mondlane, the main challenger to the decades-long governing party in the Oct. 9 presidential election, was giving interviews on a road in the capital, Maputo, near the spot where his lawyer and a senior opposition party official were killed in their car by unidentified gunmen Friday night. Police officers fired tear gas in Mondlane's direction, according to a video posted on his Facebook page. The video shows Mondlane, aides, supporters and journalists running as tear gas canisters land around them. One journalist was injured, according to local media. Mondlane previously called for a nationwide shutdown and urged people to stay away from work on Monday in protest at what he and other parties have called fraudulent elections. He and some supporters had planned to gather near the site of the killings to protest. Police fired tear gas at protesters earlier in the day. The election is likely to see the ruling Front for the Liberation of Mozambique party, or Frelimo, extend its 49-year rule since the southern African country gained independence from Portugal in 1975. The final results are expected later this week, but official preliminary results show Frelimo candidate Daniel Chapo with a comfortable lead on Mondlane, who ran as an independent but was supported by the new Podesa opposition party. If he wins, Chapo would succeed President Filipe Nyusi, who has served the allowed two terms. The killings of the opposition figures heightened tensions following the election. Podesa said Mondlane’s lawyer and the party’s top spokesperson were chased down by gunmen in two vehicles who sprayed their car with bullets. The attack is widely viewed in Mozambique as politically motivated. Mondlane's lawyer, Elvino Dias, was closely involved in preparations to challenge the election results at the supreme electoral body. The European Union, which sent a team of election observers, called for an immediate investigation into the killings 'that will bring to justice those responsible for this outrageous crime.' The killings were also condemned by United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres. Frelimo has often been accused of rigging elections, which it has denied, while Mozambique's security forces have been criticized for clamping down on dissent and breaking up peaceful protests with deadly force. Mondlane told reporters that police had tried to keep him at his house and prevent him from joining the protests on Monday. 'The whole of last night, police cars were at my doorstep,' he said. 'I was trying to find other ways to leave the house without being noticed. I did. I won’t say how.' ___ AP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa	https://apnews.com/article/mozambique-election-protests-police-opposition-95f53c6b33b6685dc196e87d3baca5d8	2024-10-21T04:49:17-07:00	
Police in Haiti battle gang coalition trying to seize control of the entire capital	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — Police on Monday clashed with gunmen trying to take over one of the few communities in Haiti’s capital, Port-au-Prince, that is not controlled by gangs. Solino has been under attack since Thursday, with residents calling radio stations pleading for help as they fled their homes. Officers have seized control of several areas in Solino as they keep pursuing gang members, Haiti’s National Police said in a statement late Sunday. In a video posted on social media, gang members hoisted automatic weapons in the air and cheered as they claimed control over parts of Solino, warning that all those who are not part of a gang coalition known as 'Viv Ansanm' will be 'burned to ashes.' The coalition also has attacked other neighborhoods, including Tabarre 27, forcing hundreds of residents to flee in recent days. Gangs that control 80% of Port-au-Prince also have threatened journalists covering the most recent attacks, calling them out by name and ordering that they be killed. Viv Ansanm, which means 'Living Together,' formed in September 2023, creating a coalition between two large gang federations that were enemies. It was responsible for launching large-scale attacks on critical government infrastructure starting in February, eventually leading to the resignation of Prime Minister Ariel Henry. The coalition also has unified to fight a U.N.-backed mission led by Kenyan police to quell gang violence in Haiti that began earlier this year. After the coalition was formed, armed clashes between gangs fell by 78% from March to August, compared with the previous six months, according to a report published this month by ACLED, a U.S. nonprofit that collects data on violent conflicts worldwide. 'The consolidation of the Viv Ansanm alliance has enabled gangs to focus their resources on criminal activities and confrontations with security forces, rather than engaging in infighting,' it said. The report also warned that 'despite the volatile relationships among gang members, Viv Ansanm is likely to endure as long as it faces the shared threat of an international security force.'	https://apnews.com/article/haiti-gangs-violence-solino-un-mission-c6bea0069973d723d51d23cbd9110e49	2024-10-21T03:29:06-07:00	
The Latest: Trump heads to North Carolina while Harris stumps in the Midwest	With just over two weeks to go before the 2024 presidential election and the race in a dead heat, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are hitting the campaign trail in strategic battleground states. Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: How does abortion translate? Ballot measures are a challenge for interpreters Reproductive rights measures are on the ballots in 10 states after heated debates over how to describe their impact on abortion — and that’s just in English. In 388 places across the U.S. where English isn’t the primary language among communities of voters, the federal Voting Rights Act requires that all elections information be made available in each community’s native language. Such translations are meant to help non-native English speakers understand what they’re voting for. But vague or technical terms can be challenging, even more so when it comes to Indigenous languages that have only limited written dictionaries. For example, there’s no single word for abortion in the native language of the Ute Mountain Ute tribe in Colorado’s Montezuma County. New York’s referendum doesn’t even use the word 'abortion,' making it all the more challenging to convey intent, advocates complain. And how exactly should the science of 'viability' in the Florida and Nevada measures be explained in the oral traditions of the Seminole and Shoshone tribes? The Navajo and Hopi tribes get more material translated than most, and they have more than enough voters to sway outcomes. ▶ Read more about translating ballot measures into other languages. Most voters think the economy is poor, but split on whether Trump or Harris can fix it: AP-NORC poll Voters remain largely divided over whether they prefer Republican Donald Trump or Democrat Kamala Harris to handle key economic issues, although Harris earns slightly better marks on elements such as taxes for the middle class, according to a new poll. A majority of registered voters in the survey by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research describe the economy as poor. About 7 in 10 say the nation is going in the wrong direction. But the findings reaffirm that Trump has lost what had been an advantage on the economy, which many voters say is the most important issue this election season above abortion, immigration, crime and foreign affairs. 'Do I trust Trump on the economy? No. I trust that he’ll give tax cuts to his buddies like Elon Musk,' said poll respondent Janice Tosto, a 59-year-old Philadelphia woman and self-described independent. An AP-NORC poll conducted in September found neither Harris nor Trump had a clear advantage on handling 'the economy and jobs.' But this poll asked more specific questions about whether voters trusted Trump or Harris to do a better job handling the cost of housing, jobs and unemployment, taxes on the middle class, the cost of groceries and gas, and tariffs. ▶ Read more about the poll. Trump takes questions at a barbershop in the Bronx Donald Trump went to a barbershop in the Bronx section of New York for a segment with commentator Lawrence Jones that aired Monday on 'Fox &amp; Friends.' He took questions from clients at the business about immigration, energy and taxes. The barbers wore a black shirt with the phrase 'Make Barbers Great Again.' One of the clients asked Trump if, once he generated enough revenue with some of his proposals, it would be possible to eliminate federal taxes. 'There is a way. There is a way,' Trump said, adding that in the 1890s, people did not have to pay income taxes. The business owner, who leases the building, told him his main challenge was paying for his energy bill, which had shot up from $2,100 to $15,000 in the last seven months. 'What?' Trump said. 'How many heads can you take care of? That’s a lot.' Trump asked how much average hair cuts cost and how much they had gone up. He was told they had gone up from a range between $12 and $15 to between $30 and $40. Toward the end of the visit, Trump told the men 'you guys are the same as me. It’s the same stuff. We were born the same way.' Some Jewish voters in presidential swing states reconsider their longtime devotion to Democrats For Rona Kaufman, the signs are everywhere that more Jews feel abandoned by the Democratic Party and may vote for Republican Donald Trump. It’s in her Facebook feed. It’s in the discomfort she observed during a question-and-answer at a recent Democratic Party campaign event in Pittsburgh. It’s in her own family. 'The family that is my generation and older generations, I don’t think anybody is voting for Harris, and we’ve never voted Republican, ever,' Kaufman, 49, said, referring to Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris. 'My sister has a Trump sign outside her house, and that is a huge shift.' How big a shift? Surveys continue to find that most Jewish voters still support the Democratic ticket, and Kaufman acknowledges that she’s an exception. Still, any shift could have enormous implications in Pennsylvania, where tens of thousands of votes decided the past two presidential elections. Many Jewish voters say the 2024 presidential election is like no other in memory, coming amid the growing fallout from Hamas’ brutal attack on Israelis last year. ▶ Read more about Jewish voters in this election.	https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-donald-trump-2024-6d5141e5ce6be797fc4d65ae9be34a65	2024-10-21T03:22:08-07:00	
Blinken heads to Mideast for 11th time since Gaza war; prospects for a truce remain uncertain	WASHINGTON (AP) — Secretary of State Antony Blinken is heading again to the Middle East, making his 11th trip to the region since the Gaza war erupted last year and as Israel steps up attacks against Hezbollah in Lebanon. The State Department said Blinken will depart on Monday for a weeklong trip to Israel and a number of Arab countries, on a visit that also comes as Israel weighs retaliation against Iran for ballistic missile attacks earlier this month. The trip had been expected after President Joe Biden said last week he would dispatch Blinken to the region following Israel’s killing of Hamas military chief Yahya Sinwar, a move that some believe could open a window for new talks on a cease-fire proposal that has been languishing for months. 'Throughout the region, Secretary Blinken will discuss the importance of bringing the war in Gaza to an end, securing the release of all hostages, and alleviating the suffering of the Palestinian people. He will continue discussions on post-conflict period planning and emphasize the need to chart a new path forward that enables Palestinians to rebuild their lives and realize their aspirations free from Hamas’ tyranny,' State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said in a statement. He said Blinken would also underscore the need for a dramatic increase in the amount of humanitarian aid reaching Gaza, something that Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin made clear in a letter to Israeli officials last week. That letter reminded Israel that the Biden administration could be forced by U.S. law to curtail some forms of military aid should the delivery of humanitarian assistance continue to be hindered. In addition to the conflict in Gaza, Blinken will also raise the importance the administration places on reaching a diplomatic resolution to the escalating conflict between Israel and Hezbollah in southern Lebanon and elsewhere. 'He will reaffirm the U.S. commitment to work with partners across the region to de-escalate tensions and provide lasting stability,' Miller said in the statement. Since the Hamas attacks in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023 and the Israeli response, Blinken has traveled to the Middle East 10 times seeking an end to the crisis. His previous trips have yielded little in the way of ending hostilities but he has managed to increase aid deliveries to Gaza in the past.	https://apnews.com/article/us-israel-gaza-lebanon-hamas-ba3c1e1eb131916818e62c81ead22f36	2024-10-21T01:29:54-07:00	
Lebanon assesses damage after Israel strikes Hezbollah-run financial institution	BEIRUT (AP) — Lebanese were surveying the damage on Monday after overnight Israeli strikes hit nearly a dozen branches of a Hezbollah-run financial institution that Israel says is used to fund attacks but where many ordinary people keep their savings. The strikes targeted Al-Qard Al-Hassan branches in the southern neighborhoods of Beirut, across southern Lebanon and in the eastern Bekaa Valley, where Hezbollah has a strong presence. One strike flattened a nine-story building in Beirut with a branch inside it. Smoke rose from several locations on Monday. The Israeli military issued evacuation warnings ahead of the strikes. There were no reports of casualties. Israel invaded Lebanon earlier this month, saying it aims to push Hezbollah from the border after more than a year of rocket, missile and drone attacks that began after Palestinian Hamas militants launched their surprise Oct. 7, 2023, attack into Israel from the Gaza Strip. Israeli airstrikes have pounded large areas of Lebanon for weeks, forcing over a million people to flee their homes. The United States is hoping to revive diplomatic efforts to resolve both conflicts after the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in the Gaza Strip last week, but so far all sides appear to be digging in. Hezbollah-run lender filled gaps left by Lebanon's troubled banks The Arabic language spokesman for the Israeli military, Avichay Adraee, said warplanes targeted several locations 'used to store money for the military arm of Hezbollah,' including Al-Qard Al-Hassan, which he said finances arms purchases and is used to pay fighters. He said Hezbollah stores hundreds of millions of dollars in the branches, without providing evidence, and that the strikes were aimed at preventing the group from rearming. The institution has more than 30 branches across Lebanon. It tried to reassure customers, saying it had evacuated all branches and relocated gold and other deposits to safe areas. Many customers are civilians unaffiliated with Hezbollah. The registered nonprofit, sanctioned by the United States and Saudi Arabia, has long served as an alternative to Lebanon's banks, which have imposed restrictions in the face of a severe financial crisis that began in 2019. Bulldozers cleared mounds of rubble at the site of one strike. Clothes, furniture and the remains of a beauty salon were seen in the debris. Al-Qard al-Hassan documents were scattered across the area, but there was no sign of cash or other valuables. US envoy says UN resolution that ended past war is ‘no longer enough’ U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein, who has spent much of the past year trying to broker a cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah, was back in Lebanon on Monday for talks with senior officials. He said U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, was 'no longer enough' to ensure peace and a new mechanism was needed to enforce it. The resolution called for Hezbollah to withdraw from the border with Israel and for U.N. peacekeepers and the Lebanese army to control southern Lebanon, without any Hezbollah or Israeli presence. Israel says the resolution was never implemented and that Hezbollah built up extensive military infrastructure right up to the border. Lebanon has long accused Israel of violating its airspace and failing to abide by other provisions of the resolution. '1701 was successful at ending the war in 2006, but we must be honest that nobody did anything to implement it,' Hochstein said after meeting with Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, a political ally of Hezbollah who is involved in cease-fire talks. In a separate development, the Israeli military apologized for a strike on Sunday in southern Lebanon that killed three Lebanese army soldiers. It said it targeted a vehicle in an area that Hezbollah had recently used for attacks without realizing it belonged to the Lebanese military. Lebanon’s army is a respected institution within the country, but it is not powerful enough to impose its will on Hezbollah or defend Lebanon from Israel’s invasion. The army has largely kept to the sidelines as Israel and Hezbollah have traded blows over the past year. US tries to revive Gaza cease-fire talks after Sinwar’s death The United States has expressed hope that the killing of Hamas leader Sinwar could give new impetus for a cease-fire in Gaza, which would give a major boost to parallel efforts to halt the fighting in Lebanon. The head of Israel’s Shin Bet security agency, Ronen Bar, visited Egypt for the second time in less than a week and had an hours-long meeting with Egyptian officials on Sunday, according to an Egyptian official who was not authorized to brief media and spoke on condition of anonymity. The official said Egypt, a key mediator between Israel and Hamas, remains opposed to any Israeli presence along the Gaza-Egypt border, a key sticking point in talks that sputtered to a halt in August. Hamas has said its demands remain unchanged after the killing of Sinwar. The militant group has said it will only release dozens of Israeli hostages in return for an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, a lasting cease-fire and the release of a large number of Palestinian prisoners. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to destroy Hamas and recover all the captives, and says Israel must maintain an open-ended security presence in Gaza to keep Hamas from re-arming. Israel has been waging a major operation in northern Gaza, the hardest-hit part of the territory, for more than two weeks, and its forces have repeatedly returned to other areas of Gaza after saying Hamas had regrouped. Palestinian medical officials said on Monday they collected over a dozen bodies of people killed in Israel’s ongoing air and ground operation in northern Gaza. They included six men killed early Monday when they were trying to get drinking water in the urban Jabaliya refugee camp, the main focus of the operation, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Four others, including two women, were killed in a strike on an area sheltering displaced people in Jabaliya, the ministry said. Another three people were killed in a strike on a school-turned-shelter in the border town of Beit Hanoun. On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel’s security fence and stormed in, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Around 100 captives are still being held in Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed more than 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who don’t distinguish combatants from civilians but say most of the dead were women and children. The war has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced about 90% of its population of 2.3 million people. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

Becky Sauerbrunn and over 100 women's soccer players protest FIFA deal with Saudi oil giant Aramco	ZURICH (AP) — Former U.S. national team captain Becky Sauerbrunn and Netherlands forward Vivianne Miedema are among more than 100 women's soccer players who have signed an open letter protesting FIFA's sponsorship deal with Saudi Arabian state oil giant Aramco. The letter calls the deal, which includes sponsorship at the 2027 Women's World Cup in Brazil, 'much worse than an own goal,' citing Saudi Arabia's record on the rights of women and LGBTQ+ people and the impact of Aramco's oil and gas production on climate change. Sauerbrunn voiced concern for women who are imprisoned in Saudi Arabia. 'The safety of those women, the rights of women, LGBTQ+ rights and the health of the planet need to take a much bigger priority over FIFA making more money,' Sauerbrunn said in comments via campaign group Athletes Of The World. The letter calls on FIFA to replace Aramco 'with alternative sponsors whose values align with gender equality, human rights and the safe future of our planet,' and to give players a voice on the ethical implications of future sponsorship deals. 'This letter shows that as players this is what we don’t want to stand for and accept within women’s football. It’s simple: this sponsorship is contradicting FIFA’s own commitments to human rights and the planet,' Miedema said. FIFA's deal with Aramco was announced in April as part of ever-closer ties between Saudi Arabia and world soccer's governing body. FIFA is expected to confirm Saudi Arabia as host of the 2034 men's World Cup in December. It is the only candidate for the tournament. 'FIFA values its partnership with Aramco and its many others commercial and rights partners. FIFA is an inclusive organisation with many commercial partners also supporting other organizations in football and other sports,' world soccer's governing body said in an emailed statement Monday, adding that commercial revenue is reinvested into developing women's soccer. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer	https://apnews.com/article/fifa-saudi-arabia-aramco-becky-sauerbrunn-cb41913acfa00adba988cf73e0fc70b7	2024-10-21T00:30:53-07:00	
A Japanese police chief apologizes to a man acquitted after 50 years on death row	TOKYO (AP) — A Japanese police chief on Monday apologized in person to Iwao Hakamada for his decades-long suffering that started from an overbearing investigation and wrongful conviction that had kept him on death row until last month, when he was acquitted in a retrial. The 88-year-old Hakamada, a former boxer, was acquitted by the Shizuoka District Court, which said police and prosecutors had collaborated to fabricate and plant evidence against him, and forced him to confess with violent, hourslong closed interrogations. The acquittal was finalized earlier this month when the prosecution waived its right to appeal — though it complained about the ruling — finally ending Hakamada’s nearly 60-year legal battle to prove his innocence. Shizuoka Prefectural Police chief Takayoshi Tsuda on Monday visited Hakamada at his home and offered an apology in person. As he entered the room where Hakamada, his sister Hideko Hakamada and their supporter waited, Hakamada silently rose from his sofa to greet him. 'We are sorry to have caused you unspeakable mental distress and burden for as long as 58 years from the time of the arrest until the acquittal was finalized,' Tsuda said, as he stood straight in front of Hakamada and bowed deeply. 'We are terribly sorry.' Tsuda promised a 'meticulous and appropriate investigation.' Hakamada, who has difficulty carrying out conversation due to his mental condition from the decades of death row confinement, responded: 'What it means to have the authority ... Once you have the power, you’re not supposed to grumble.' Hakamada’s 91-year-old sister, who had stood by her brother through the long process to clear his name and now lives with him, thanked the police chief for visiting them. 'There is no use complaining to him after all these years. He was not involved in the case and he only came here as his duty,' she told reporters afterward. 'But I still accepted his visit just because I wanted (my brother) to have a clear break from his past as a death row inmate.' He was arrested in August, 1966, in the killing of an executive at a miso bean paste company and three of his family members in Hamamatsu, central Japan. He was initially sentenced to death in a 1968 district court ruling but was not executed because of the lengthy appeal and retrial process in Japan. It took nearly three decades for the Supreme Court to deny his first appeal for a retrial. His second appeal for a retrial, filed by his sister in 2008, was granted in 2014. The court ordered his release from his death row solitary cell but without removing his conviction, pending the retrial process. Hakamada was the world’s longest-serving death row prisoner and only the fifth death row inmate to be acquitted in a retrial in postwar Japan, where criminal trials take years and retrials are extremely rare. His case and acquittal have triggered calls for more transparency in the investigation, legal change to lower hurdles for a retrial and debate over death penalty in Japan.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-death-row-police-apology-hakamada-7226946cfbf17524a12a95370fa55733	2024-10-21T00:19:15-07:00	
Self-exiled Turkish spiritual leader Fethullah Gülen dies in the US	SAYLORSBURG, Pa. (AP) — Fethullah Gülen, a reclusive U.S.-based Islamic cleric who inspired a global social movement while facing accusations he masterminded a failed 2016 coup in his native Turkey, has died. Abdullah Bozkurt, the former editor of the Gülen-linked Today’s Zaman newspaper, who is now in exile in Sweden, said Monday he spoke to Gülen's nephew, Kemal Gülen, who confirmed the death. Fethullah Gülen was in his eighties and had long been in ill health. The Alliance for Shared Values, a New York-based group that promotes Gulen’s work in the U.S., confirmed his death on X and its website 'with sorrowful hearts and humble acceptance of Allah’s will.' It did not provide details. Gülen spent the last decades of his life in self-exile, living in a gated compound in Pennsylvania’s Pocono Mountains and wielding influence among his millions of followers. He espoused a philosophy that blended Sufism — a mystical form of Islam — with staunch advocacy of democracy, education, science and interfaith dialogue. It is not known who, if anyone, will lead the movement now. Gülen began as an ally of Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan but became a foe. He called Erdogan an authoritarian bent on accumulating power and crushing dissent. Erdogan cast Gülen as a terrorist, accusing him of orchestrating the attempted military coup on July 15, 2016, when factions within the military used tanks, warplanes and helicopters to try to overthrow Erdogan’s government. Heeding a call from the president, thousands took to the streets to oppose the takeover attempt. The coup-plotters fired at crowds and bombed parliament and other government buildings. A total of 251 people were killed and around 2,200 others were wounded. Around 35 alleged coup plotters were killed. Gülen adamantly denied involvement, and his supporters dismissed the charges as ridiculous and politically motivated. Turkey put Gülen on its most-wanted list and demanded his extradition, but the United States showed little inclination to send him back, saying it needed more evidence. Gülen was never charged with a crime in the U.S., and he consistently denounced terrorism as well as the coup plotters. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Monday that Gülen’s death 'will not make us complacent or relaxed. This organization has been a threat rarely seen in the history of our nation.' He called on Gülen’s followers to turn away from 'this treasonous wrong path.' In Turkey, Gülen’s movement — sometimes known as Hizmet, Turkish for 'service' — has been subjected to a broad crackdown. The government arrested tens of thousands of people for their alleged link to the coup plot, sacked more than 130,000 suspected supporters from civil service jobs and more than 23,000 from the military, and closed hundreds of businesses, schools and media organizations tied to Gülen. Gülen called the crackdown a witch hunt and denounced Turkey’s leaders as 'tyrants.' 'The last year has taken a toll on me as hundreds of thousands of innocent Turkish citizens are being punished simply because the government decides they are somehow ‘connected’ to me or the Hizmet movement and treats that alleged connection as a crime,' he said on the one-year anniversary of the failed coup. Ozgur Ozel, the leader of Turkey's main opposition Republican People's Party, said Gülen’s vast network remained a threat to Turkey. 'The founder is dead but the organization remains. No one should think that this danger has passed or is over. Everyone should be on guard against this organization,' Ozel said. Fethullah Gülen was born in Erzurum, in eastern Turkey. His official birth date was April 27, 1941, but that has long been in dispute. Y. Alp Aslandogan, who leads a New York-based group that promotes Gülen’s ideas and work, said Gülen was actually born sometime in 1938. Trained as an imam, or prayer leader, Gülen gained notice in Turkey some 50 years ago. He preached tolerance and dialogue between faiths, and he believed religion and science could go hand in hand. His belief in merging Islam with Western values and Turkish nationalism struck a chord with Turks, earning him millions of followers. Gülen’s acolytes built a loosely affiliated global network of charitable foundations, professional associations, businesses and schools in more than 100 countries, including 150 taxpayer-funded charter schools throughout the United States. In Turkey, supporters ran universities, hospitals, charities, a bank and a large media empire with newspapers and radio and TV stations. But Gülen was viewed with suspicion by some in his homeland, a deeply polarized country split between those loyal to its fiercely secular traditions and supporters of the Islamic-based party associated with Erdogan that came to power in 2002. Gülen had long refrained from openly supporting any political party, but his movement forged a de facto alliance with Erdogan against the country’s old guard of staunch, military-backed secularists, and Gülen’s media empire threw its weight behind Erdogan’s Islamic-oriented government. Gülenists helped the governing party win multiple elections. But the Erdogan-Gulen alliance began to crumble after the movement criticized government policy and exposed alleged corruption among Erdogan’s inner circle. Erdogan, who denied the allegations, grew weary of the growing influence of Gülen’s movement. The Turkish leader accused Gülen’s followers of infiltrating the country’s police and judiciary and setting up a parallel state, and began agitating for Gülen’s extradition to Turkey even before the failed 2016 coup. The cleric had lived in the United States since 1999, when he came to seek medical treatment. In 2000, with Gülen still in the U.S, Turkish authorities charged him with leading an Islamist plot to overthrow the country’s secular form of government and establish a religious state. Some of the accusations against him were based on a tape recording on which Gülen was alleged to have told supporters of an Islamic state to bide their time: 'If they come out too early, the world will quash their heads.' Gülen said his comments were taken out of context. The cleric was tried in absentia and acquitted, but he never returned to his homeland. He won a lengthy legal battle against the administration of then-President George W. Bush to obtain permanent residency in the U.S. Rarely seen in public, Gülen lived quietly on the grounds of an Islamic retreat center. He left mostly only to see doctors for ailments that included heart disease and diabetes, spending much of his time in prayer and meditation and receiving visitors from around the world. Gülen never married and did not have children. ___ Associated Press Writer Suzan Fraser contributed from Ankara, Turkey.	https://apnews.com/article/fethullah-gulen-turkey-dead-d808184b89acffcd1c9b24ba87d3d5f5	2024-10-21T00:11:37-07:00	
South Korea calls for immediate withdrawal of North Korean troops allegedly in Russia	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea on Monday demanded the immediate pullout of North Korean troops allegedly deployed in Russia as it summoned the Russian ambassador to protest deepening military cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow. South Korea's spy agency said Friday it had confirmed that North Korea sent 1,500 special operation forces to Russia this month to support Moscow's war against Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy earlier said his government had intelligence that 10,000 North Korea soldiers were being prepared to join invading Russian forces. During a meeting with Russian Ambassador Georgy Zinoviev, Vice South Korean Foreign Minister Kim Hong Kyun 'condemned in the strongest terms' North Korea's troop dispatch that he said poses 'a grave security threat' to South Korea and the international community, the South Korean Foreign Ministry said in a statement. Kim said that South Korea in collaboration with the international community will mobilize all available means to deal with an act that threatens its vital national security interests, according to the statement. The Russian Embassy quoted Zinoviev as saying that the Russian-North Korean cooperation is not aimed against the security interests of South Korea. In a telephone call with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte on Monday, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said that Seoul won’t sit idly by 'reckless' military cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow. Yoon said South Korea will soon send a delegation to NATO to exchange information about Russian-North Korean cooperation, according to Yoon’s office. Rutte wrote on X that North Korea possibly fighting alongside Russia would 'mark a significant escalation.' The U.S. and NATO haven't confirmed that North Korean troops were sent to Russia. But the reports of their presence have already stoked concerns in South Korea that Russia might provide North Korea with sophisticated technologies that can sharply enhance the North's nuclear and missile programs in return for its troop dispatch. North Korea's advancing nuclear arsenal is a major security threat to South Korea. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un recently took steps to permanently terminate all relations with South Korea and threatened to use nuclear weapons preemptively. Some observers say South Korea will likely consider supplying weapons to Ukraine if Russian transfers of high-tech nuclear and missile technologies to North Korea are verified. South Korea has joined U.S.-led sanctions against Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. But South Korea hasn’t directly provided arms to Kyiv, citing its longstanding policy of not supplying weapons to countries actively engaged in conflicts. Russia has earlier denied using North Korean troops in its war with Ukraine. North Korea's state media hasn't commented on the matter. Ukrainian officials released a video allegedly showing North Korean soldiers lining up to collect Russian military clothes and bags at an unknown location. The Associated Press couldn’t verify the footage independently. Asked about the North Korean troops during a conference call with reporters Monday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that 'we are seeing a lot of contradictory information.' 'South Koreans say one thing, then the Pentagon says it has no confirmation of such statements. There is a lot of contradictory information,' Peskov said. 'It must be treated as such.' North Korea's troop deployment to Russia would be its first participation in a major war since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War. Many experts question how much North Korean troops would help Russia on the battlefield, citing their lack of combat experience. Cooperation between North Korea and Russia has flourished over the past two years. The U.S., South Korea and their partners have accused North Korea of supplying conventional arms to Russia in return for economic and military assistance. In June, Kim and Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a pact stipulating mutual military assistance if either country is attacked. __ Associated Press writer Kim Tong-hyung contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/north-south-korea-russia-ukraine-27780e4b672ee638b96099ec5f5168e4	2024-10-20T23:32:47-07:00	
Middle East latest: Israel apologizes for strike that killed 3 Lebanese soldiers	The Israeli military apologized Monday for a strike that killed three Lebanese soldiers in southern Lebanon, saying it is not battling the country's military and its troops believed they were targeting a vehicle belonging to the Hezbollah militant group. Israeli strikes meanwhile hit nearly a dozen branches of a Hezbollah-run financial institution that Israel says is used to fund attacks but where many ordinary people keep their savings. Last week, Hezbollah said it is entering a new phase in its fight against invading Israeli troops, as the region reckoned with the killing of top Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in a battle with Israeli forces in Gaza. Sinwar was a chief architect of the attack on southern Israel that precipitated the latest escalating conflicts in the Middle East. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has pledged to annihilate Hamas and recover dozens of hostages held by the group. Hamas says it will only release the captives in return for a lasting cease-fire, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the release of Palestinian prisoners. On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel’s security fence and stormed in, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not distinguish combatants from civilians. The war has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced about 90% of its population of 2.3 million people. ___ Here's the latest: Over a dozen bodies collected in northern Gaza, medical workers say CAIRO — Palestinian medical officials say they have collected over a dozen bodies of people killed in Israel’s ongoing air and ground operation in northern Gaza. The Gaza Health Ministry’s emergency service said they included six men killed early Monday when they were trying to get drinking water in the urban Jabaliya refugee camp, the main focus of the operation. Four others, including two women, were killed in a strike on an area sheltering displaced people in Jabaliya, it said. Another three people were killed in a strike on a school-turned-shelter in the border town of Beit Hanoun. Dr. Hossam Abu Safiyya, the director of the nearby Kamal Adwan Hospital, said it was overwhelmed with wounded people and patients. Israel launched the operation more than two weeks ago, saying Hamas militants had regrouped in Jabaliya after several previous military operations there. The military says it tries to avoid harming civilians. Israeli authorities have dramatically reduced the amount of aid allowed into Gaza, raising fears among Palestinians that they are implementing a surrender-or-starve plan advocated by retired Israeli generals. Israel ordered the entire population of the northern third of Gaza, including Gaza City, to evacuate to the south in the war’s opening weeks and reiterated those instructions this month. Around 400,000 people are believed to have remained in the north, which is encircled by Israeli forces and off limits to Palestinians who fled their homes there. Israeli police arrest 7 citizens allegedly paid by Iran to gather intelligence JERUSALEM — Israeli police have arrested seven citizens who they say were paid by Iran to collect intelligence for over two years. In a statement released Monday, Israel’s internal security agency and police said that the seven collected information about other Israelis and photographed Israeli military installations, including missile defense systems, air force and naval sites, and power plants. Iran paid them paid hundreds of thousands of dollars, often in cryptocurrency, the statement said. It did not provide evidence for the alleged plot. Israeli authorities say they have foiled several recent plots by Iran that involved recruiting Israelis for espionage or assassinations. Israel has vowed to retaliate for Iran’s Oct. 1 ballistic missile attack. Israeli air defenses shot down most of the missiles, but some hit Israeli military installations. Israel and Iran have waged a shadow war for years that burst to the surface after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack triggered the war in Gaza. Israel and Iran exchanged fire directly for the first time in April. Iran supports armed groups across the region, including Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Macron calls for a cease-fire in a phone call with Netanyahu PARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron called once again for a cease-fire in Gaza and Lebanon in a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday, the Elysee Palace said in a statement. Macron said the elimination of Hamas’ top leader Yahya Sinwar last week in Gaza 'must be an opportunity to begin a new phase of negotiation' for a cease-fire, the release of hostages and the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza. Macron alo called for Israel to preserve infrastructure and protect civilians in Lebanon. Macron shared his intention to keep communication channels open with Teheran, 'to obtain guarantees on Iran’s nuclear program, ballistic program and regional policy,' the statement. Relations between the two leaders became tense recently after Macron called for 'a halt to arms exports for use in Gaza,' drawing strong criticism from Netanyahu. Head of Israel's security agency visited Cairo to discuss cease-fire talks CAIRO — The head of Israel’s internal security agency has visited Cairo to discuss reviving Gaza cease-fire talks after the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, officials said. Israel and Hamas, as well as Egypt, which has served as a key mediator, appear to still be divided over whether Israel would retain control over parts of Gaza, a dispute that dragged the talks to a halt in August. An Egyptian official said Ronen Bar, the head of Israel’s Shin Bet security agency, held an hourslong meeting Sunday with Egypt’s newly appointed intelligence chief, Hassan Mahmoud Rashad. An Israeli official also confirmed the visit, speaking on condition of anonymity because it was not publicized. The visit was widely reported by Israeli media. The Egyptian official, who was not authorized to brief media and spoke on condition of anonymity, said they discussed the possibility of reviving the negotiations after the death of Sinwar, who was killed in an Israeli military operation last week. The official said Egypt is still opposed to any Israeli presence in a strip of land running the length of the Gaza side of the territory’s border with Egypt, and that Hamas is unlikely to lift its demand for a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Hamas has said its demands for a lasting cease-fire, Israel’s full withdrawal from Gaza and the release of a large number of Palestinian prisoners in return for dozens of hostages held in Gaza for over a year have not changed following Sinwar’s death. Bar also visited Egypt last Tuesday, before Sinwar’s death. — By Samy Magdy in Cairo and Julia Frankel in Jerusalem Lebanon's caretaker PM calls for implementation of UN resolution to end fighting BEIRUT — Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister says implementing a nearly 2-decade-old U.N. resolution still offers the best path to ending the Israel-Hezbollah war. In an interview with the Al-Arabiya network broadcast Monday, ahead of the arrival of a U.S. envoy, Najib Mikati said a new resolution appeared unlikely. 'There is no solution but a diplomatic solution, and the diplomatic solution is currently on the table,' he said. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war, called for Hezbollah to withdraw from the border and for U.N. peacekeepers and the Lebanese army to control southern Lebanon, without any Hezbollah or Israeli presence. Israel says the resolution was never implemented and that Hezbollah built up extensive military infrastructure right up to the border. Lebanon has long accused Israel of violating its airspace and failing to abide by other provisions of the resolution. U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein, who was in Beirut on Monday, said U.N. resolution 1701 is 'no longer enough' and a new mechanism must be put in place to ensure it is implemented 'fairly, accurately, transparently.' '1701 was successful at ending the war in 2006, but we must be honest that nobody did anything to implement it,' Hochstein said in a news conference after meeting with Berri. 'The lack of implementation over those years contributed to the conflict that we are in today.' Hezbollah, which said it would continue attacks on Israel until there is a cease-fire in Gaza, appears to have softened that position in recent weeks as Israeli strikes have eliminated much of its top leadership and pounded large areas of Lebanon. Hezbollah now says it supports the diplomatic efforts of Mikati and Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, a political ally of the militant group. Both Lebanese leaders have said they are no longer seeking to tie a cease-fire in Lebanon to one in Gaza. Israeli military apologizes for strike that killed Lebanese soldiers JERUSALEM — The Israeli military has apologized for a strike in southern Lebanon that killed three Lebanese soldiers. The military said it struck a truck on Sunday that had entered an area where it had previously targeted a Hezbollah truck transporting a launcher and missiles. The military said soldiers were not aware that the second truck belonged to the Lebanese army. The military said it is 'not operating against the Lebanese Army and apologizes for these unwanted circumstances.' Lebanon’s army is a respected institution within the country, but it is not powerful enough to impose its will on Hezbollah or defend Lebanon from Israel’s invasion. The army has largely kept to the sidelines as Israel and Hezbollah have traded blows over the past year. Israeli forces invaded southern Lebanon at the beginning of the month and have been operating in a narrow strip along the border. Israeli airstrikes have pounded large areas of the country, targeting what Israel says are Hezbollah sites. The militant group has fired thousands of rockets, missiles and drones into Israel since Oct. 8, 2023, the day after its ally Hamas launched a surprise attack into Israel, triggering the war in Gaza.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-hezbollah-mideast-latest-21-october-2024-b6a1782da26a614fcb3a3d4e42df0635	2024-10-20T23:22:09-07:00	
Moldova narrowly votes to secure path toward EU membership after accusing Russia of interference	CHISINAU, Moldova (AP) — Moldovans voted by a razor-thin majority in favor of securing the country’s path toward European Union membership, electoral data showed Monday, after the pro-Western president accused foreign interference and 'criminal groups' of trying to undermine the vote in the former Soviet republic. The 'No' vote appeared to be ahead until the last few thousand votes were counted from the large diaspora of Moldova, whose authorities have accused Russia of trying to destabilize the country. With 99.41% of votes counted in the EU referendum held Sunday, the 'Yes' vote stood at 50.39% and the 'No' vote at 49.61%, according to the Central Electoral Commission. A loss would have been a political disaster for the pro-Western government, which strongly supported the pro-EU campaign. On Monday, President Maia Sandu reiterated claims that unprecedented voter fraud and foreign interference had undermined the voting, calling it a 'vile attack' on Moldova’s sovereignty. 'Unfortunately, the justice system failed to do enough to prevent vote-rigging and corruption,' she told a news conference. 'Here, too, we must draw a line, correct what went wrong, and learn the lesson. We heard you: we know we must do more to fight corruption.' Moldovan authorities claim that Moscow has intensified a 'hybrid war' campaign to destabilize the country and derail its EU path. The allegations include funding pro-Moscow opposition groups, spreading disinformation, meddling in local elections and backing a major vote-buying scheme. Russia has repeatedly denied it is interfering in Moldova. Moldova applied to join the EU in the wake of Russia’s full-scale invasion of neighboring Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, and was granted candidate status that summer, alongside Ukraine. Brussels agreed in June to start membership negotiations. In Brussels, the EU’s executive branch, the European Commission, said its services had noted 'unprecedented interference and intimidation by Russia and its proxies, aiming to destabilize the democratic processes' in Moldova, and it underlined its continued support for Moldova on its EU accession path. Spokesperson Peter Stano told reporters that allegations of vote-buying, the bussing of voters and disinformation are only the most recent forms of Russian interference, and that attempts to undermine Moldova and its support for the EU have been going on for months. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told Moldova's people: 'You’ve done it again! In the face of Russia’s hybrid tactics, Moldova shows that it is independent, it is strong and it wants a European future!' In the presidential race that was held at the same time, Sandu won the first round with 42% of the vote in a field of 11, short of an outright majority. She will face Alexandr Stoianoglo, a Russia-friendly former prosecutor general who outperformed polls with around 26% of the vote, in a runoff on Nov. 3. By the time polling stations closed at 9 p.m. Sunday, more than 1.5 million voters — about 51% of eligible voters — had cast ballots, according to the Central Electoral Commission. Moldova has a population of about 2.5 million. Cristian Cantir, a Moldovan associate professor of international relations at Oakland University, told The Associated Press that earlier polls might have 'overestimated the pro-EU feeling' inside Moldova and the referendum would have failed to pass without votes from outside the country. 'It’s going to be particularly problematic because ... it’s going to feed into narratives that are pushed by the Kremlin and pro-Russian forces,' he said. The White House on Monday called the referendum a 'historic step forward in Moldova’s European integration' but warned that Russia would try to interfere in next month’s runoff in the presidential race. 'The last several months Moscow has dedicated millions of dollars towards these efforts,' said U.S. national security spokesman John Kirby. 'Now, Russia did not succeed. The results demonstrate democracy is strong, as is the will and desire of the Moldovan people to advance toward European integration.' In early October, Moldovan law enforcement said it had uncovered a massive vote-buying scheme orchestrated by Ilan Shor, an exiled pro-Russia oligarch who currently lives in Russia, which paid 15 million euros ($16.2 million) to 130,000 people to undermine the two ballots. Shor was convicted in absentia last year of fraud and money laundering and sentenced to 15 years in prison in the case of $1 billion that went missing from Moldovan banks in 2014. He denied the allegations, saying the payments were legal and citing a right to freedom of expression. Shor’s populist Russia-friendly Shor Party was declared unconstitutional last year and banned. On Thursday, Moldovan authorities foiled another plot in which more than 100 young Moldovans received training in Moscow from private military groups on how to create civil unrest around the two votes. Some also attended more advanced training in 'guerrilla camps' in Serbia and Bosnia, police said, and four people were detained for 30 days. A pro-Western government has been in power in Moldova since 2021, a year after Sandu won the presidency. A parliamentary election will be held next year. ___ Associated Press writers Raf Casert and Lorne Cook contributed from Brussels; Aamer Madhani from Washington.	https://apnews.com/article/moldova-elections-eu-referendum-russia-325cb2c13beb1d76565a6e2aadef971a	2024-10-20T23:14:36-07:00	
US defense chief visits Kyiv for talks on how to keep supporting Ukraine's fight against Russia	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin arrived in Kyiv on an unannounced visit Monday, hours after a Russian drone attack on the Ukrainian capital and as Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pushes Western partners to keep providing military support for the war. Austin said on the X platform that his fourth visit shows 'that the United States, alongside the international community, continues to stand by Ukraine.' Ukraine is having difficulty holding back a ferocious Russian campaign along the eastern front that is gradually compelling Kyiv’s forces to give up a series of towns, villages and hamlets. Zelenskyy is urging Western allies to support his so-called ‘victory plan’ to end the almost three-year war, which is Europe’s biggest conflict since World War II and has cost tens of thousands of lives on both sides, including many civilians. His strategy includes a formal invitation for Ukraine to join NATO and permission to use Western long-range missiles to strike military targets in Russia — steps Kyiv’s allies have previously balked at supporting. The Western response has been lukewarm, and Austin was expected to discuss the plan with Ukrainian officials in Kyiv. Zelenskyy said in a Sunday evening video address that his plan had won the backing of France, Lithuania, Nordic countries and 'many other allies' in the European Union which he didn’t name. The key country, however, is the United States, which is Ukraine’s biggest military supplier. Zelenskyy said he had received 'very positive signals from the United States,' but he stopped short of saying he had secured Washington’s endorsement for the plan. Russia fired three missiles and 116 Shahed drones at Ukraine overnight from Sunday to Monday, Ukraine's air force said. Machine gun fire and the noise of drones’ engines was heard in Kyiv’s center throughout the night. Authorities reported minor damages to civilian infrastructure caused by falling drone debris in the three districts of the city. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-us-austin-zelenskyy-562b5bd0ce4c8849d29b5a3d0fa7dfb4	2024-10-20T22:36:58-07:00	
Tropical Storm Oscar brings winds and heavy rains to eastern Cuba	HAVANA (AP) — Tropical Storm Oscar advanced across eastern Cuba early Monday after making landfall as a Category 1 hurricane on the island already beleaguered by a massive power outage. Its maximum sustained winds were blowing at 60 mph (95 kph) early Monday as Oscar moved west-southwest at 5 mph (8 kph), the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami said. Oscar made landfall in the eastern province of Guantanamo, near the city of Baracoa, on Sunday evening with winds of 75 mph (120 kph). Rain and flooding in low-lying areas were reported in eastern provinces. Cuban media said 2-meter (6.5-feet) swells were hitting the coast and roofs and walls in Baracoa had been damaged. The storm is expected to move across the island into Monday and approach the central Bahamas on Tuesday, U.S. forecasters said. Cuba suffered an islandwide power blackout Friday. Some electrical service was restored Saturday, but most residents remain without power. The country's energy minister expressed hope the grid could be restored Monday or Tuesday.	https://apnews.com/article/tropical-storm-oscar-cuba-power-outage-b03e933253e5bc99e986489994b15d72	2024-10-20T21:48:49-07:00	
Stock market today: Asian markets are mixed after another winning close on Wall Street	BANGKOK (AP) — Asian shares were mixed on Monday after U.S. stocks rose to records to close out their latest winning week. U.S. futures also were mixed and oil prices climbed. Hong Kong's Hang Seng sank 1.5% to 20,869.39, while the Shanghai Composite gained 0.2% to 3,268.11. The A-share index of the smaller market in Shenzhen picked up 1.6%. China cut its one-year and five-year Loan Prime Rates, which are reference rates for lending. Lower rates can help reduce pressure on borrowers, particulary property developers that have suffered following a crackdown on excessive borrowing several years ago. But any impact on market sentiment appeared to be short-lived. Given that the main constrain is weak demand, the 'heavy lifting' will have to come from government spending, Zichun Huang of Capital Economics said in a report. China's Finance Ministry has pledged to ramp up such outlays in coming months, 'However, we are still skeptical that fiscal easing will be large enough to deliver anything more than a modest and short-lived pick-up in activity.' Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index edged 0.1% lower to 38,954.60, while the Kospi in Seoul advanced 0.4% to 2,604.92. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 closed 0.7% higher at 8,344.40. Oil prices climbed after tumbling last week as worries receded that Israel will attack Iranian oil facilities as part of its retaliation for Iran’s missile attack early this month. Iran is a major producer of crude, and a strike could upend its exports to China and elsewhere. Concerns about the strength of demand from China have also hit oil prices. Early Monday, U.S. benchmark crude was up 52 cents at $69.21 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard, picked up 41 cents to $73.47 per barrel. The dollar rose to 149.78 Japanese yen from 149.57 yen late Friday. The yen has weakened recently on expectations that the pace of interest rate hikes by the Bank of Japan may be slower than earlier thought. The euro slipped to $1.0856 from $1.0866 late Friday. On Friday, Wall Street logged more records. The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.4% to squeak past the all-time high it had set early this week, closing at 5,864.67. The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged 0.1% higher to 43,275.91, another record. The Nasdaq composite climbed 0.6% to 18,489.55. Trading overall on Wall Street remained relatively calm, as the S&amp;P 500 closed its sixth straight winning week. That’s its longest such winning streak of 2024. Solid economic data has boosted hopes the U.S. economy can make a perfect escape from the worst inflation in generations, one that ends without a painful recession that many investors had seen as nearly inevitable. And with the Federal Reserve now cutting interest rates to keep the economy humming, the expectation among optimists is that stocks can rise even further. Traders are coalescing around the idea that the Federal Reserve will cut its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point at its next meeting in November. Expectations had been high earlier for the Fed to deliver another larger-than-usual cut of half a percentage point, but strong updates on the economy have eliminated those. The federal funds rate is currently sitting in a range of 4.75% to 5%.	https://apnews.com/article/stock-markets-rates-china-oil-e6f3d911ef800bea10aa6ec642f22f37	2024-10-20T20:22:43-07:00	
New Zealand revels in a weekend of sporting success	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — New Zealand boasts that it punches above its weight in international sport and backed up that claim at the weekend with success around the world and in a variety of sports. The claim already had gained some credibility this year when the nation of 5.2 million placed 11th on the medal table at the Paris Olympics with 10 gold medals and 20 medals overall. Over the last 48 hours, New Zealand: Beat Great Britain 7-2 in the final of the 37th edition of sailing’s America’s Cup to win world sport’s oldest trophy for the third straight time. Team New Zealand is the only team in the modern era to win the trophy on three consecutive occasions. Beat India by eight wickets in the first cricket test at Bengaluru, winning in India for only the third time and the first time since 1988. The New Zealand Black Caps are only the fourth team to beat India at home this century. New Zealand bowled out India for 46 in its first innings, its lowest-ever total at home. Beat South Africa by 32 runs to win the women’s Twenty20 cricket World Cup for the first time and as underdogs. South Africa were favorites after beating six-time champion Australia in the semifinals. In addition: New Zealand’s Hayden Wilde won the final leg of the World Triathlon Championship Series at Torremolinos, Spain. Ally Woolaston won the women’s omnium event at the UCI Track Cycling World Championships for her second gold and third medal of the championships. The New Zealand women’s team beat Italy 6-1 in the final of the Canoe Polo world championships in Deqing, China. Auckland FC, part owned by American businessman Bill Foley, won its first-ever match in Australian soccer's A-League, beating the Brisbane Roar 2-0. New Zealand’s Liam Lawson finished ninth in the United States F1 Grand Prix in his first race of the season and after starting from 19th on the grid. 'In New Zealand’s history there haven’t been too many sporting weekends like the one we’ve just seen, with epic wins from Team New Zealand, the White Ferns, the Black Caps, the Silver Ferns (netball team) and the Paddle Ferns (canoe polo team),' New Zealand Sports Minister Chris Bishop said. 'I know lots of Kiwis will be bleary-eyed today after a couple of long nights watching our teams go up against the best. But I bet they’re as stoked at the results and as proud of our teams as I am. 'All in all, I think this was a weekend that will go down in New Zealand’s sporting annals. All five teams should know that their country is enormously proud of them. And I think Kiwi sports fans can be forgiven if they’re caught yawning at work today, after so much sporting excitement packed into one weekend!' ____ AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports	https://apnews.com/article/new-zealand-sporting-success-336268f9b418bd33aaec015ac2736036	2024-10-20T19:59:28-07:00	
Cubans struggle with an extended power outage and a new tropical storm	HAVANA (AP) — Many Cubans waited in anguish and some took to the streets in protest as widespread blackouts stretched into their third day. Their concerns were heightened as a Hurricane Oscar hit Cuba’s eastern coast with winds and heavy rain. In Santo Suárez, part of a populous neighborhood in southwestern Havana, people went into the streets banging pots and pans in protest Sunday night. 'We haven’t had electricity for three nights, and our food is rotting. Four days without electricity is an abuse to the children,' resident Mary Karla, a mother of three children, told The Associated Press. She didn't give her surname. The protesters, who say they have no water either, blocked the street with garbage. Energy Minister Vicente de la O Levy said in a news conference he hopes the electricity grid will be restored on Monday or Tuesday morning. But he said that Oscar, which made landfall on the eastern coast Sunday evening, will bring 'an additional inconvenience' to Cuba's recovery since it will touch a 'region of strong (electricity) generation.' Key Cuban power plants, such as Felton in the city of Holguín, and Renté in Santiago de Cuba, are located in the area. Oscar later weakened to a tropical storm but its effects were forecast to linger in the island through Monday. Some neighborhoods had electricity restored in Cuba’s capital, where 2 million people live, but most of Havana remained dark. The impact of the blackout goes beyond lighting, as services like water supply also depend on electricity to run pumps. People resorted to cooking with improvised wood stoves on the streets before the food went bad in refrigerators. In tears, Ylenis de la Caridad Napoles, mother of a 7-year-old girl, says she is reaching a point of 'desperation.' The failure of the Antonio Guiteras plant on Friday, which caused the collapse of the island's whole system, was just the latest in a series of problems with energy distribution in a country where electricity has been restricted and rotated to different regions at different times of the day. The status of Cuba's other power plants was unclear. People lined up for hours on Sunday to buy bread in the few bakeries that could reopen. Some Cubans like Rosa Rodríguez have been without electricity for four days. 'We have millions of problems, and none of them are solved,' said Rodríguez. 'We must come to get bread, because the local bakery is closed, and they bring it from somewhere else.' The blackout was considered to be Cuba’s worst since Hurricane Ian hit the island as a Category 3 storm in 2022 and damaged power installations. It took days for the government to fix them. This year, some homes have spent up to eight hours a day without electricity. Cuba’s government had said Saturday that some electricity had been restored. But the 500 megawatts of energy in the island’s electricity grid, far short of the usual 3 gigawatts it needs, had quickly decreased to 370 megawatts. Even in a country that is used to outages as part of a deepening economic crisis, Friday’s collapse was massive. The Cuban government has announced emergency measures to slash electricity demand, including suspending school and university classes, shutting down some state-owned workplaces and canceling nonessential services. Local authorities said the outage stemmed from increased demand from small- and medium-sized companies and residential air conditioners. Later, the blackout got worse because of breakdowns in old thermoelectric plants that haven’t been properly maintained, and the lack of fuel to operate some facilities. Cuba's energy minister said the country's grid would be in better shape if there had not been two more partial blackouts as authorities tried to reconnect on Saturday. De la O Levy also said Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela and Russia, among other nations, had offered to help. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/cuba-power-blackout-hurricane-oscar-b197e174af2c9f664d4c3aaf0c5a6e75	2024-10-20T19:49:59-07:00	
Gunmen kill 7 people working on a strategic tunnel project in Indian-controlled Kashmir	SRINAGAR, India (AP) — Gunmen fatally shot at least seven people working on a strategic tunnel project in Indian-controlled Kashmir and injured at least five others, officials said on Monday. Police blamed militants who have been fighting against Indian rule for decades for the 'terror attack' at a camp for construction workers near the disputed region’s resort town of Sonamarg. No rebel group immediately claimed responsibility. Police said at least two gunmen fired 'indiscriminately' at officials and workers associated with the construction, leaving two dead on the spot. At least 10 others were taken to hospital, where five more died. The attack came shortly after workers returned to their lodgings on Sunday night. There was no immediate independent confirmation of the attack. The dead included five non-local laborers and officials, one Kashmiri worker and a Kashmiri doctor. Reinforcements of police and soldiers launched search operations in the area to nab the attackers. Omar Abdullah, the region's top elected official, condemned the attack in a post on social media platform X, calling it 'dastardly &amp; cowardly.' A key Kashmiri resistance leader said he was 'deeply saddened by the outrageous killings.' 'Another grim reminder of the unending cycle of violence and uncertainty we are suffering for decades,' Mirwaiz Umar Farooq wrote on X. Hundreds of people, mostly non-local laborers, are working on the ambitious tunnel project that aims to connect the Kashmir Valley with Ladakh, a cold desert region that is isolated for half the year because of massive snowfalls. Experts say the tunnel project is important to the military, which will gain significantly improved capabilities to operate in Ladakh. The strategically important region shares de facto borders with Pakistan and China, and Indian and Chinese soldiers have been engaged in a military standoff there since 2020. Both countries have stationed tens of thousands of soldiers there, backed by artillery, tanks and fighter jets. Sunday’s attack was the second attack on a non-local worker in the region since a largely powerless local government was sworn into office Wednesday, following the first local elections since India stripped the region of semi-autonomy five years ago. On Friday, body of a worker from eastern Bihar state, riddled with bullet wounds, was recovered from a maize field in southern Shopian district, police said. They blamed militants for the killing. Kashmir has witnessed a spate of killings, many targeting workers from other parts of India, since 2021. Police say the killings, which have also included local Muslim village councilors, police officials and civilians, have been carried out by anti-India rebels. India and Pakistan each administer a part of Kashmir, but both claim the territory in its entirety. The nuclear-armed rivals have fought two of their three wars over the territory since they gained independence from British colonial rule in 1947. Militants in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir have been fighting New Delhi’s rule since 1989. Many Muslim Kashmiris support the rebels’ goal of uniting the territory, either under Pakistani rule or as an independent country. India insists that Kashmir militancy is Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. Pakistan denies the charge, and many Kashmiris consider it a freedom struggle. Tens of thousands of civilians, rebels and government forces have been killed in the conflict.	https://apnews.com/article/kashmir-india-tunnel-project-migrant-laborers-sonamarg-39d00d362a518f67f699c1368617d51c	2024-10-20T19:44:52-07:00	
Israel's wars are expensive. Paying the bill could force tough choices	On top of the grievous toll in human life and misery, Israel's war against the Hamas and Hezbollah militant groups has been expensive, and the painfully high financial costs are raising concerns about the long-term effect of the fighting on the country's economy. Military spending has ballooned, and growth has stalled, especially in dangerous border areas that were evacuated. Economists say the country could face declining investment and higher taxes as the war strains government budgets and forces tough choices between social programs and the military. Here is a look at the monetary costs Israel faces as a result of the conflict: Spending on the military has soared The Israeli government is spending much more per month on the military, from $1.8 billion before Hamas started the fighting by attacking Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, to around $4.7 billion by the end of last year, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. The government spent $27.5 billion on the military last year, according to the institute, ranking 15th globally behind Poland but ahead of Canada and Spain, all of which have larger populations. Military spending as a percentage of annual economic output was 5.3%, compared with 3.4% for the United States and 1.5% for Germany. That pales in comparison to Ukraine, which spent 37% of its GDP and more than half its entire government budget on fighting off Russia’s invasion. The war hurt growth and the labor supply In the three months after Hamas attacked, Israel's economic output shrank 5.6%, the worst performance of any of the 38 countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of mostly rich nations. The economy partly rebounded with growth of 4% in the first part of this year but grew only 0.2% in the second quarter. The war has inflicted an even heavier toll on Gaza’s already broken economy, where 90% of the population has been displaced and the vast majority of the workforce is unemployed. The West Bank economy has also been hit hard, where tens of thousands of Palestinian laborers lost their jobs in Israel after Oct. 7 and Israeli military raids and checkpoints have hindered movement. The World Bank says the West Bank economy contracted by 25% in the first quarter. In Israel, the war has imposed many economic burdens. Call-ups and extensions of military service threaten to crimp the labor supply. Security worries deter investment in new business, and disruptions in flights have kept many visitors away, cutting into the tourism industry. Meanwhile, the government is paying for housing for thousands of people who had to leave their homes in the south near the border with Gaza and in the north where they were exposed to fire from Hezbollah. One of the biggest concerns is the open-ended nature of the fighting, which has lasted more than a year. Israel's economy rebounded quickly from a 2006 war with Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. But that conflict lasted only 34 days. Moody's Ratings cited that idea on Sept. 27, when it lowered the Israeli government's credit rating, two notches. The Baa1 rating is still considered investment grade, albeit with moderate risk, according to Moody’s. The Israeli economy is still strong, with modest debt Israel's economy is hardly collapsing. The country has a diversified, highly developed economy with a strong information-technology sector, which supports tax revenues and defense spending. Unemployment is low, and the TA-35 stock index is up 10.5% on the year. Even amid the fighting, tech companies raised some $2.5 billion in capital during the third quarter, according to Zvi Eckstein, head of the Aaron Institute for Economic Policy at Reichman University. Israel started the war 'in the best economic condition' regarding government debt, which stood at a relatively modest 60% of GDP, Eckstein said. 'We financed the war mainly with debt,' which has now risen to 62% but is still contained compared with France at 111% and in line with Germany at 63.5%. The institute foresees debt reaching 80% of GDP, assuming the fighting does not markedly intensify and some sort of cease-fire or conclusion can be reached by the end of next year. Even then, higher defense spending is likely, especially if Israel maintains a military presence in Gaza after the war. Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich’s budget for 2025 foresees a deficit of below 4%, saying that will ensure that Israel’s debt burden remains stable. Smotrich said the country has a stable shekel currency, rising share prices, a tight jobs market, strong tax revenues and access to credit, and a rebounding tech sector. Moody’s questioned the deficit figures, forecasting a 6% deficit for next year. The credit downgrade will lead to higher borrowing costs, meaning Israelis are likely to see cuts to public services and higher taxes, said Karnit Flug, a former head of Israel’s central bank and now vice president of research at the Israel Democracy Institute. The U.S. stepped up military aid and could provide financial backing Before the war, American military aid to Israel amounted to around $3.8 billion per year under a deal signed during President Barack Obama's administration. That comes to roughly 14% of Israel’s prewar military spending, much of which goes to U.S. defense companies. Since the war in Gaza began and led to escalating conflict across the Middle East, the United States has spent a record of at least $17.9 billion on military aid to Israel, according to a report for Brown University’s Costs of War project that was released on the anniversary of the Hamas attacks on Israel. Beyond strictly military aid, the U.S. has offered critical financial support for Israel during times of trouble. Congress in 2003 approved $9 billion in credit guarantees that let Israel borrow at affordable rates after the economy suffered during the so-called second intifada, or Palestinian uprising. Some of those guarantees remain unused and could in theory be tapped to stabilize government finances if Israel faces unaffordable borrowing costs. What's the way forward? The government has convened a commission under former acting national security adviser Jacob Nagel, who negotiated Israel’s most recent U.S. aid package, to offer recommendations on the size of the future defense budget and to assess how increased defense spending could affect the economy. Economist Eckstein said a budget that includes some tax increases and cuts in social spending would be needed to support a postwar rebound and pay for likely higher ongoing defense costs. ___ Find more coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/mideast-wars	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-hezbollah-war-cost-military-spending-32a53a86d946418022ca636539a83f4f	2024-10-20T19:42:02-07:00	
US and Canadian warships transit the Taiwan Strait a week after Beijing’s war games	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — U.S. and Canadian warships sailed through the Taiwan Strait on Sunday, almost a week after China held massive war games around Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its own territory. The destroyer USS Higgins and the Canadian frigate HMCS Vancouver made a 'routine' transit of the Taiwan Strait meant to uphold the principle of freedom of navigation for all countries, read a statement Monday by the U.S. Navy’s 7th Fleet. The U.S. Navy, occasionally joined by ships from allied countries, regularly transits the sensitive waterway separating China from Taiwan. China condemned the maneuver, saying it undermined peace and stability in the region. The People’s Liberation Army’s Eastern Theater Command said it mobilized naval and air forces to monitor the transit of the U.S. and Canadian ships 'in accordance with the law.' The transiting ships navigated 'through waters where high-seas freedom of navigation and overflight apply in accordance with international law,' read the U.S. Navy 7th Fleet statement. 'The international community’s navigational rights and freedoms in the Taiwan Strait should not be limited,' it added. The transit came less than a week after China conducted large-scale military exercises surrounding Taiwan and its outlying islands last Monday, simulating the sealing off of key ports in a move that underscores the tense situation in the Taiwan Strait. Beijing employed a record 125 aircraft, as well as its Liaoning aircraft carrier and ships as part of the drills, which were in reaction to a National Day speech by Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te. Lai had emphasized his commitment to 'resist annexation or encroachment' by Beijing. Taiwan was a Japanese colony before being unified with China at the end of World War II. It split away in 1949 when Chiang Kai-shek’s Nationalists fled to the island as Mao Zedong’s Communists defeated them in a civil war and took power. The U.S. is Taiwan’s biggest unofficial ally and is bound by its own laws to provide the island with the means to defend itself.	https://apnews.com/article/china-us-canada-taiwan-strait-navy-74250cf8ed17221a92d9525e20e6be57	2024-10-20T19:11:01-07:00	
Putin hosts a summit in a bid to show the West it can't keep Russia off the global stage	In the coming days, Russian President Vladimir Putin will be shaking hands with multiple world leaders, including China’s Xi Jinping, India’s Narendra Modi, Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Iran’s Masoud Pezeshkian. They will all be in the Russian city of Kazan on Tuesday for a meeting of the BRICS bloc of developing economies, defying predictions that the war in Ukraine and an international arrest warrant against Putin would turn him into a pariah. The alliance, which aims to counterbalance the Western-led world order, initially included Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, but started to rapidly expand this year. Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia joined in January; Turkey, Azerbaijan and Malaysia formally applied, and a number of others expressed a desire to be members. Russian officials already see it as a massive success. Putin’s foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov said 32 countries confirmed participation, and more than 20 will send heads of state. Putin will hold around 20 bilateral meetings, Ushakov said, and the summit could turn into 'the largest foreign policy event ever held' on Russian soil. Optics and deals for the Kremlin Analysts say the Kremlin wants both the optics of standing shoulder-to-shoulder with its global allies amid continued tensions with the West, as well as the practicality of negotiating deals with them to shore up Russia's economy and its war effort. For the other participants, it’s a chance to amplify their voices and narratives. 'The beauty of BRICS is that it doesn’t put too many obligations on you,' says Alexander Gabuyev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center. 'There are not that many strings attached, really, to being part of BRICS. And at the same time, there might be interesting opportunities coming your way, including just having more face time with all of these leaders.' For Putin, the summit is important personally because it shows the failure of Western efforts to isolate him, Gabuyev says. The gathering will demonstrate at home and abroad that 'Russia is really an important player that is leading this new group that will end the Western dominance -– that’s his personal narrative,' he says. The Kremlin will be able to talk to major players like India and China about expanding trade and bypassing Western sanctions. India is an important market for Russian commodities, while China is where Moscow hopes to get its hands on dual-use and various military-related goods, Gabuyev says. Russia also wants more countries participating in a payment system project that would be an alternative to the global bank messaging network SWIFT, allowing Moscow to trade with its partners without worrying about sanctions. 'The Russian idea is that if you create a platform where there is China, Russia, India and Brazil and Saudi Arabia, many countries that are vital partners for the U.S., the U.S. will not be ready to go after this platform and sanction it,' Gabuyev said. Goals for Iran and China Russia also is expected to sign a 'comprehensive strategic partnership' treaty with Iran, bolstering the increasingly close ties between Moscow and Tehran. After the invasion of Ukraine, Iran provided Moscow with hundreds of drones and helped launch their production in Russia. The Iranian drone deliveries, which Moscow and Tehran have denied, have allowed for a constant barrage of long-range drone strikes at Ukraine’s infrastructure. Iran, in turn, wants sophisticated Russian weapons, like long-range air defense systems and fighter jets to help fend off a possible attack by Israel. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov refused to comment when asked whether the treaty will include mutual military assistance. For China, BRICS is among several international organizations -– along with the security-focused Shanghai Cooperation Organization -– through which it seeks to promote an alternative to the U.S.-led world order. Xi pushed for enlarging BRICS, and the Kazan summit will consolidate economic, technological and military ties in the expanded bloc, said Willy Lam, a senior China fellow at the Jamestown Foundation. Beijing and Moscow also want to see if a new international trading currency could 'challenge so-called dollar hegemony,' Lam said. The summit will allow Xi and Putin to flaunt their close relationship. The two, who announced a 'no-limits' partnership only weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, already have met at least twice this year, in Beijing in May and at a SCO summit in Kazakhstan in July. Although they will continue to present a united front, experts are watching for subtle signs of Xi distancing himself from Putin over the war. 'While Putin will want the China-Russia relationship to appear as good as ever, Xi may also want to signal to Western states and others that Beijing officially remains ‘neutral’ in Russia’s war in Ukraine and is not a formal ally of Moscow,' said Eva Seiwert, a foreign policy and security expert with the Mercator Institute for China Studies in Berlin. 'This will be crucial for conveying the image of China as a serious and legitimate peacemaker in the Russia-Ukraine conflict.' Balancing acts for India and Turkey An expected Modi-Putin meeting could see some rebalancing of their ties. Western friends want India to be more active in persuading Moscow to end the war. Modi has avoided condemning Russia while emphasizing a peaceful settlement. New Delhi considers Moscow a time-tested partner from the Cold War, cooperating on defense, oil, nuclear energy, and space, despite Russia’s closer ties with India’s main rival, China. Their meeting will be the second in months. Modi visited Russia in July, saw President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Ukraine in August and traveled to the U.S. to see President Joe Biden in September. 'India can’t simply abandon Russia because of its deep defense ties, the question of the regional balance of power, and the logic of multi-alignment,' said Raja Mohan, a professor at the Institute of South Asian Studies in Singapore. 'At the same time, it also builds and develops its relations with the U.S. and the West because that is where the logic of India’s major economic development and technological growth depends on partnership.' India and Brazil view BRICS primarily through an economic lens to promote a more equitable distribution of power in the international system, while 'China and Russia see it more as a geopolitical forum,' said Chietigi Bajpayee, who studies South Asia at the Chatham House in London. India and Brazil also don't want to be 'pulled into China's gravitational orbit,' said Theresa Fallon of the Center for Russia, Europe, Asia Studies. Another key participant is Turkey, which has applied to join the BRICS group. That comes at a time when the NATO member and European Union candidate is increasingly frustrated with the West. Turkey’s EU membership talks have stalled since 2016 due to disputes with Cyprus and concerns over human rights. Turkey’s relations with Washington have been strained over its removal from the F-35 fighter jet program after procuring a Russian missile defense system. Erdogan also has accused the U.S. and other Western allies of alleged 'complicity' in Israel’s military actions in Gaza. Membership in BRICS would help Erdogan 'strengthen his own hand' at a time when ties with the West are at a low, said Gonul Tol, director of the U.S.-based Middle East Institute’s Turkey program. Middle powers like Turkey 'try to extract more from both camps by being in-between camps, by having one foot in each camp,' he said. ___ Litvinova reported from Tallinn, Estonia.

King Charles and Queen Camilla lay wreaths at Australian War Memorial then greet well-wishers	CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — King Charles III and Queen Camilla laid wreaths at the Australian War Memorial in the national capital Canberra on Monday then shook hands with well-wishers on the second full day of their visit. Charles, 75, is being treated for cancer, which has led to a scaled-down itinerary. It is Charles’ 17th trip to Australia and the first since he became king in 2022. It is the first visit to Australia by a reigning British monarch since his late mother Queen Elizabeth II traveled to the distant nation in 2011. Charles and Camilla rested the day after their arrival before they made their first public appearance of the trip at a church service in Sydney on Sunday. They then flew to Canberra where they visited the Tomb of the Unknown Australian Soldier then a reception at Parliament House hosted by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. The couple took their time leaving the war memorial to greet hundreds of people who gathered gathered under clear skies flying Australian flags. The temperature was forecast to reach a mild high of 24 degrees Celsius (75 degrees Fahrenheit). The reception was not attended by the government leaders of all six Australian states, who declined invitations because they would prefer an Australian citizen as head of state rather than the British monarch. Albanese would also prefer Australia became a republic but has ruled out putting the question to a referendum during his current term. On Wednesday, Charles will travel to Samoa, where he will open the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting.	https://apnews.com/article/australia-canberra-king-charles-visit-4ea87d39d17c4a9fe3cbfab3455fb8f7	2024-10-20T17:48:26-07:00	
Environmental delegates gather in Colombia for a conference on dwindling global biodiversity	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — Global environmental leaders gathered Monday in Cali, Colombia to assess the world’s plummeting biodiversity levels and commitments by countries to protect plants, animals and critical habitats. The two-week United Nations Biodiversity Conference, or COP16, is a follow-up to the 2022 Montreal meetings where 196 countries signed a historic global treaty to protect biodiversity. The accord includes 23 measures to halt and reverse nature loss, including putting 30% of the planet and 30% of degraded ecosystems under protection by 2030. In opening remarks on Sunday, Colombia's environment minister and COP16 president Susana Muhamad said the conference is an opportunity 'to collect the experience that has passed through this planet from all civilizations, from all cultures, from all knowledge ... to generate livable, relatively stable conditions for a new society that will be forged in the light of the crisis.' A real threat to biodiversity loss All evidence shows dramatic decline in species abundance and distribution, said Linda Krueger, director of biodiversity at The Nature Conservancy. 'A lot of wild species have less room to live, and they’re declining in numbers,' Krueger said. 'And we also see rising extinction rates. Things that we haven’t even discovered yet are blinking out.' The world is experiencing its largest loss of life since the dinosaurs, with around 1 million plant and animal species now threatened with extinction, according to the United Nations Environment Programme. In the Amazon rainforest, threats to biodiversity include the expansion of the agricultural frontier and road networks, deforestation, forest fires and drought, says Andrew Miller, advocacy director at Amazon Watch, an organization that protects the rainforest. 'You put all of that together and it’s a real threat to biodiversity,' Miller said. Global wildlife populations have plunged on average by 73% in 50 years, according to the WWF and the Zoological Society of London biennial Living Planet report this month. The report said Latin America and the Caribbean saw 95% average declines in recorded wildlife populations. Indigenous communities key to biodiversity protection Indigenous people are on the front lines of protecting biodiversity and fighting against climate change, putting their lives at great risk, said Miller of Amazon Watch. 'A lot of discourse has been given about the voices of local communities … Indigenous peoples really playing a key role,' he said. 'So that’s one of the things that we’ll be looking for at COP16.' Indigenous peoples hold the solutions to combat the climate change and biodiversity crises, said Laura Rico, campaign director at Avaaz, a global activism nonprofit. 'They're who have been taking care of the land, healing the land through their governance systems, their care systems and their ways of life,' she said. 'So ... it's fundamental that the COP recognizes, promotes and encourages the legalization of their territories.' In Colombia’s capital, Bogota, the head of an Amazon Indigenous organization said the region's Indigenous people have been preparing for months for COP16. 'This is a great opportunity to make the impact that we need to demonstrate to all the actors that come from other countries the importance of Indigenous peoples for the world,' said José Mendez, secretary of the National Organization of the Indigenous Peoples of the Amazon. 'It's no secret to anyone that we ... are at risk right now,' he said. 'The effects that we are currently experiencing due to climate change, the droughts that the country is experiencing, the Amazon River has never gone through a drought like the current one. … This is causing many species to become extinct.' Nature can recover Environment minister Muhamad told local media this month that one of the conference's main objectives is to deliver the message that 'biodiversity is as important, complementary and indispensable as the energy transition and decarbonization.' Part of Colombia's first ever leftist government, Muhamad cautioned last year's World Economic Forum about the risks of continuing an extractive economy that ignores the social and environmental consequences of natural resource exploitation. Since the 2022 Montreal conference, 'progress has been too slow', says Eva Zabey, executive director of the coalition Business for Nature. 'There's been some progress,' she said. 'But the headline message is the implementation of the global biodiversity framework is too slow and we need to scale and speed up.' 'COP16 comes at an absolutely critical moment for us to move from targets setting to real actions on the ground,' Zabey said. Although biodiversity declines are grim, some environmentalists believe a reversal is possible. 'We’ve had some very successful species reintroductions and we’ve saved species when we really focus on what is causing their decline,' said The Nature Conservancy's Krueger. __ Follow Steven Grattan on X: @sjgrattan __ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

In one portrait, an AP Photographer tells the story of how difficult the job of a miner is	STONAVA, Czech Republic (AP) — AP photographer Petr David Josek started working with The Associated Press in 2002 and became a full-time staffer in 2011, when he got the Prague bureau job. Since then, he has covered the Iraq War, eight Olympics and four World Cups among numerous sports and news assignments. Here’s what he had to say about this extraordinary photo. Why this photo? When walking through the dark shafts of the mine you come across quite a few miners, but this guy’s unique physique struck me. I figured it would be nice to get some portraits of the man. Luckily, he walked past me more than once, so I had few chances to shoot a couple of frames as he was doing his work. How I made this photo I shot this picture on 24mm 1.4 lens at 1000/sec. Going to the mine is somehow specific. It’s a very dusty and dark environment, so I figured less equipment is better for that. I took two cameras that I covered with foil for protection from the dust and two fixed lenses, 24 mm and 85 mm. I was equipped with a flashlight that you use to navigate through the mine - it also helped for the pictures, as you can light up your subject. Why it works I had several pictures of this man but I think in this one, the combination of his strong posture, his facial expression and the dirt on his body reflects the best, just how hard this job really is. Also, the fact that his eyes aren’t seen makes it a bit more mysterious.

Expelled Indian high commissioner denies involvement in murder of Sikh leader in Canada	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) — India’s high commissioner to Canada has denied any involvement in the murder of a Canadian Sikh leader who was killed in British Columbia last year even though the Canadian government has named him as a person of interest in the assassination. Sanjay Kumar Verma, who was expelled last Monday along with five other Indian diplomats, said in an interview on CTV’s Question Period Sunday that the allegations are politically motivated. 'Nothing at all,' Verma said when asked if he had any role in in the shooting of Hardeep Singh Nijjar who was killed outside a cultural center in Surrey, British Columbia on June 18, 2023. 'No evidence presented. Politically motivated.' Four Indian nationals living in Canada were charged with Nijjar’s murder and are awaiting trial. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police went public this week with allegations that Indian diplomats were targeting Sikh separatists in Canada by sharing information about them with their government back home. They said top Indian officials were then passing that information to Indian organized crime groups who were targeting the activists, who are Canadian citizens, with drive-by shootings, extortions and even murder. Verma denied the Indian government was targeting Sikh separatists in Canada. 'I, as high commissioner of India, have never done anything of that kind,' he said. Any action taken by Indian officials in Canada was 'overt,' said Verma. In the interview Verma condemned Nijjar’s death. 'Any murder is wrong and bad,' he said. 'I do condemn.' Verma also pushed back on comments made by Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly that compared India to Russia. She said Canada’s national police force has linked Indian diplomats to homicides, death threats and intimidation in Canada. 'Let me see the concrete evidence she’s talking about,' said Verma. 'As far as I’m concerned, she’s talking politically.' India has rejected the Canadian accusations as absurd, and its foreign ministry said it was expelling Canada’s acting high commissioner and five other diplomats in response. Verma said 'not a shred of evidence has been shared with us' about the Canadian allegations. The RCMP has said attempts earlier this month to share evidence with Indian officials were unsuccessful. Verma said the RCMP had not applied for the proper visas to visit India. 'A visa needs to be affixed,' he said. 'For any government delegation to travel to another country, you need an agenda to go by. There was no agenda at all.' Canada is not the only country that has accused Indian officials of plotting an assassination on foreign soil. The U.S. Justice Department announced criminal charges against an Indian government employee Thursday in connection with an alleged foiled plot to kill a Sikh separatist leader living in New York City. In the case announced by the Justice Department, Vikash Yadav, who authorities say directed the New York plot from India, faces murder-for-hire charges in a planned killing that prosecutors have previously said was meant to precede a string of other politically motivated murders in the United States and Canada. 'An indictment is not a conviction,' Verma said. 'It will follow its judicial process.' India has repeatedly criticized the Canadian government for being soft on supporters of what is known as the Khalistan movement, which is banned in India but has support among the Sikh diaspora, particularly in Canada. The Khalistan movement supports the establishment of an independent Sikh state in India. The Nijjar killing in Canada has soured India-Canada ties for more than a year, but Verma doesn’t expect this will impact business relations between the two countries. 'I don’t see much impact on non-political bilateral relations,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/canada-india-diplomats-sikh-5d0dc43576a99e8355e605785a9cb5ca	2024-10-20T11:36:44-07:00	
Cyprus thwarted a digital attack against the government's main online portal	NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — Cyprus said Sunday that it has successfully thwarted a digital attack aimed at blocking access to the government’s central online portal, the latest in a string of similar attacks over a three-day period against state-run utilities and the Cypriot subsidiary of a Greek energy company. Cyprus’ Deputy Ministry of Research, Innovation and Digital Policy said in a statement that 'a quick and coordinated response' by authorities foiled the attack, whose purpose was exclusively to prevent access to specific government websites. The distributed denial-of-service attack, or DDoS, only affected the main government portal gov.cy 'for a few minutes' and that no other online government ministry or service website was affected. The deputy ministry didn’t say who was behind the attacks or what the possible motive may have been. Sunday’s attack came after Cyprus’ electricity and telecommunications authorities, as well as the operator of the island nation’s two airports, Hermes and fuel company EKO Cyprus Ltd., were targeted on Friday and Saturday. Officials told the Cyprus News Agency that all those attacks had also failed and that no client information had been leaked or compromised.	https://apnews.com/article/cyprus-cyber-digital-attack-a5971b2387269a8c154a09998e3697f5	2024-10-20T10:31:32-07:00	
Catholic priest and Indigenous activist Pérez killed by 2 gunmen in southern Mexico	TAPACHULA, Mexico (AP) — Catholic priest Marcelo Pérez, an activist for Indigenous peoples and farm laborers in southern Mexico, was killed on Sunday. The prosecutors' office in the city of San Cristóbal de las Casas, in the state of Chiapas, said the religious leader was shot dead by two gunmen when he was in his van. Pérez was a member of the Tzotzil Indigenous people and had just finished serving a Mass when he was attacked. He served the community for two decades and was known as a negotiator in conflicts in a mountainous region of Chiapas where crime, violence and land disputes are rife. Pérez also led several marches against violence, which has brought him several death threats. Chipas Gov. Rutilio Escandón posted on X that he condemned 'the cowardly assassination of father Marcelo Pérez. 'We will collaborate with all the authorities so his death doesn't go unpunished and those guilty face the courts,' Escandón said. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/catholic-priest-mexico-killing-455bc3fb6fe5005b7e47d4758e4c63cd	2024-10-20T09:54:40-07:00	
Hundreds gather in central London to mourn death of singer Liam Payne	LONDON (AP) — Hundreds gathered Sunday in London’s Kensington Gardens to mourn Liam Payne as fans around the world grieved for the One Direction singer who died this week. Directioners, as supporters of the massively successful boy band are known, left tributes in London, Glasgow, Paris, Sydney and New York this weekend as they celebrated the life of the 31-year-old who died Wednesday after falling from a hotel balcony in Buenos Aires. In London, they clapped and sang after gathering near a statue of Peter Pan, the fictional boy who never grew up created by J.M. Barrie. The mourners, mostly young women, left heart shaped balloons, photographs and flowers at the base of the statute, which sits next to a narrow path next to a waterway known as The Long Water. Mindful of the crowds in the limited space, organizers asked fans to leave their tributes then move away to allow others to approach the statue. Fans Lauren Anderson and Natasha Bradley, both 23, said they wanted to be with others who shared their grief. 'Your parents, they don’t really understand how much (One Direction) really meant to you growing up,' Bradley said, explaining why she came to the park. The vigils followed those that took place outside the Casa Sur Hotel in the chic Palermo neighborhood of Argentina’s capital immediately after Payne fell from his third-floor hotel room. The four surviving members of One Direction issued a joint statement saying they were 'completely devastated' by the death of their bandmate. In Paris' Tuileries Gardens, hundreds of fans — many of them crying and carrying flowers — gathered to remember Payne. They sang songs and consoled each other. Some lit candles. Others brought photos and artwork of Payne, as well as notes, letters and bouquets. About 400 people attended the gathering, overlooking Paris’ historic Place de la Concorde. Distraught 26-year-old Emilie Houdinet said she’d been a fan of the band since 2011. 'They helped me. They were there throughout my adolescence to age 18. They were a bit like dads to us,' she said. 'They were just a boys band but they were very important to us.' One Direction rose to worldwide popularity soon after the band was formed in 2010 from five young singers who auditioned for the X Factor, a British TV talent show. The band broke up in 2016 after producing five albums that sold more than 70 million copies. ___ Associated Press writer John Leicester in Paris contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/britain-liam-payne-vigil-kensington-gardens-c14bec35ea2b14c27bf29368cfeed4b8	2024-10-20T09:22:12-07:00	
A group of 2,000 migrants in southern Mexico depart for the US weeks before election	TAPACHULA, Mexico (AP) — A group of about 2,000 migrants left Mexico's southern border Sunday hoping to reach the country's north and ultimately the United States. The development comes weeks before the U.S. presidential election, in which immigration has been a key issue. Some migrants, like Venezuelan Joel Zambrano, believe a new administration in the U.S. could put an end to asylum appointments through an online system called CBP One. 'That is what makes us fearful. They say this could change because they could both close the CBP One appointment and all the services that are helping migrants,' he said. Both the lack of jobs in Mexico's south due to a new wave of incoming foreigners and a delay in asylum appointments in the U.S. have motivated more groups of migrants to leave the region in the past month. 'The situation in my country is very bad, the president doesn't do anything for us. We spent a week by the border, but getting documents takes time,' said Honduran Roberto Domínguez, 48. 'The documents we get are only for us to be in Tapachula and we cannot leave the city.' The group leaving Sunday was the third and the largest since the beginning of the administration of new Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who so far has made no changes in immigration policies established by her predecessor, Andrés Manuel López Obrador. Groups of 800 and 600 migrants left the region earlier in October. Activist Luis García Villagrán estimates about 40,000 migrants are currently stranded in southern Mexico. ___ Follow AP’s global migration coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/migration	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-migration-south-us-elections-a79f782a126dad73cd7ca784e6fc03d7	2024-10-20T08:36:32-07:00	
Indonesia's new president announces Cabinet. It's the largest in the country's history	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto announced his Cabinet late Sunday, hours after he was inaugurated. The lineup of 109 ministers, vice ministers and head of national agencies was the largest in the country’s history, and he named it the 'Red and White Cabinet,' referring to the colors of Indonesia’s national flag. Subianto became the eighth president of Southeast Asia’s largest economy on Sunday. The Cabinet of Subianto’s predecessor, Joko Widodo, had 34 ministers and head of government agencies. Subianto has said earlier that he needs a strong administration, even though analysts said that his 'fat' Cabinet would bloat the bureaucracy. 'I want to create a strong government that would unite our multicultural society and diverse political interests,' Subianto said before inviting more than 100 people for interviews at his residence last week. 'It must be a big coalition, and some will say my Cabinet is fat.' The Cabinet features politicians from a coalition of seven parties who supported his victory in the February election, and figures allied with Widodo’s Cabinet, who were reappointed to continue their jobs under Subianto’s presidency. Analysts said the move was a political reward to Widodo for the latter’s tacit support in the election. Subianto was sworn in with his new vice president, 37-year-old Surakarta ex-Mayor Gibran Rakabuming Raka. He chose Raka, who is Widodo’s son, as his running mate, with Widodo favoring Subianto over the candidate of his own former party. The former rivals became tacit allies, even though Indonesian presidents don’t typically endorse candidates. Subianto was a longtime rival of the Widodo, who ran against him for the presidency twice and refused to accept his defeat on both occasions, in 2014 and 2019. But Widodo appointed Subianto as defense chief after his reelection, paving the way for an alliance despite their rival political parties. During the campaign, Subianto ran as the popular outgoing president’s heir, vowing to continue signature policies like the construction of a multibillion-dollar new capital city and limits on exporting raw materials intended to boost domestic industry. Backed by Widodo, Subianto swept to a landslide victory in February’s direct presidential election on promises of policy continuity. Subianto reappointed nearly half of Widodo’s Cabinet members, including Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati, making her the first person to hold the ministry under three different presidents. Indrawati, 62, who has served as the executive director of the International Monetary Fund and managing director of the World Bank, is one of Indonesia’s longest-serving finance ministers, having held the post for long stretches under Presidents Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and Joko Widodo. She has earned considerable respect in international circles, particularly for her reforms of the chaotic Indonesian taxation system and her role in steering Indonesia through the global financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. 'We regularly consulted with each other to discuss strategies for strengthening the Finance Ministry and the state finances to support his programs,' Indrawati told reporters after meeting with Subianto last week. Other ministers from Widodo’s Cabinet include Interior Minister Tito Karnavian, Trade Minister Zulkifli Hasan, Energy Minister Bahlil Lahadalia and State-Owned Enterprises Minister Erick Thohir. Subianto has announced an ambitious goal of increasing annual economic growth to 8% by the end of his five-year term, and embarking on an ambitious spending program, including an increase in defense spending, hikes in civil servants’ salaries, and a program to give 83 million children free meals.	https://apnews.com/article/indonesia-new-cabinet-prabowo-subianto-6b1f915d584c823aa16dbc38374c739c	2024-10-20T08:16:58-07:00	
Cubans struggle as power not fully restored to the island after days of blackout	HAVANA (AP) — Many Cubans were waiting in anguish on Sunday as electricity on much of the island has yet to be totally restored after days of blackout. Some neighborhoods had electricity restored in Cuba’s capital, where 2 million people live, but most of Havana remained dark. The impact of the blackout goes beyond lighting, as services like water supply also depend on electricity to run pumps. People resorted to cooking with improvised wood stoves on the streets before the food went bad in refrigerators. In tears, Ylenis de la Caridad Napoles, mother of a 7-year-old girl, says she is reaching a point of 'desperation.' The failure of the Antonio Guiteras plant on Friday, which caused the collapse of the island's whole system, was just the latest in a series of problems with energy distribution in a country where electricity has been restricted and rotated to different regions at different times of the day. People lined up for hours on Sunday morning to buy bread in the few bakeries that could reopen. Some Cubans like Rosa Rodríguez have been without electricity for four days. 'We have millions of problems, and none of them are solved,' Rodríguez said. The blackout was considered to be Cuba’s worst in two years after Hurricane Ian made landfall as a Category 3 storm in 2022 and damaged power installations. It took days for the government to fix them. This year, some homes have spent up to eight hours a day without electricity. There is no official estimate for when the blackout will end. Even in a country that is used to outages as part of a deepening economic crisis, Friday’s collapse was massive. The Cuban government has announced emergency measures to slash electricity demand, including suspending school and university classes, shutting down some state-owned workplaces and canceling nonessential services. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/cuba-power-outage-blackout-struggles-e5330cbf1d7ffc8dab62b69e1782869f	2024-10-20T06:00:33-07:00	
Yehuda Bauer, prominent Israeli Holocaust scholar, dies at 98	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Yehuda Bauer, one of Israel’s foremost Holocaust scholars who shaped the way people around the world study and learn about the Holocaust, has died in Jerusalem. He was 98. No specific cause of death was given by the Yad Vashem, Israel's national Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem, which announced his death Friday evening. Bauer published dozens of books and founded numerous international Holocaust education initiatives over a career that spanned more than six decades. He spoke Czech, Slovak, German, Hebrew, Yiddish, English, French and Polish, and learned Welsh while studying at Cardiff University in Wales. His mastery of languages allowed him to study source material in its original form and connect directly with audiences across the world. 'One of his important points was that the Holocaust is not only a particular event that affected particular people, but that the Holocaust was also universal,' said Dr. David Silberklang, a senior historian at the International Institute for Holocaust Research at Yad Vashem who worked closely with Bauer for years. 'Once it happened, and human beings did what they did, it has entered the playbook, the potential of what human beings could do and therefore could be done again,' he said. Bauer was born in Prague in 1926. As a teenager, his family was able to flee Europe in 1939 and came to British Mandate Palestine via Romania. After returning from university in Wales, he joined Kibbutz Shoval in southern Israel and studied at the Hebrew University. He lived in Jerusalem for the last decades of his life. Bauer launched his academic career in the 1960s, during a time when people in Israel were just starting to talk more openly about the Holocaust. In the immediate years after the Holocaust, as many survivors were shattered and trying to build their lives, very few people spoke openly about what had happened. Silberklang said that the country needed time and perspective before it could start examining the Holocaust under an academic lens, and that Bauer was one of the first wave of scholars to begin rigorous research on a topic that had previously been too painful to discuss. In Israel, shame and guilt swirled around perception that European Jews had gone 'like sheep to the slaughter.' Bauer’s research delved into different aspects of Jewish resistance and began to change the narrative of how victims of the Holocaust had found ways to resist the Nazis beyond just armed struggle, such as smuggling or continuing to observe religious or cultural traditions. Some of his most well-known publications include 'American Jewry and the Holocaust,' probing the American response to WWII; 'Jews for Sale?' about negotiations to rescue Jews during the Holocaust; 'Death of the Shtetl' about the decimation of the small Jewish communities in Europe; and 'Rethinking the Holocaust,' examining fundamental questions about how to define and explain the Holocaust and how or whether the Holocaust can be compared to other genocides. Bauer was known for directly engaging with non-academic audiences and spoke widely around the world. With European heads of state, Bauer helped create the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) in 1998, a coalition of more than 35 countries that requires its members to devote government funding to Holocaust education and commemoration. With IHRA, Bauer also helped author the Working Definition of Antisemitism, which is used by many governments and organizations to help define hate crimes and discrimination against Jews. Bauer was awarded the Israel Prize, one of the country’s highest honors, in 1998. Silberklang said Bauer remained engaged and active until the end of his life, including writing Op Eds and contributing to academic discussions. Silberklang said Bauer disagreed with the comparison of Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack against Israel to the Holocaust, noting that the Palestinian militant group is not as strong or organized as the Nazis and the state of Israel exists to provide a military response. A lover of music, Bauer had a deep baritone and was known to sing duets with some of his academic partners or break out into traditional Welsh folk songs he learned as a university student, Silberklang said. He is survived by two daughters, three step-children, and numerous grandchildren.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-holocaust-scholar-yehuda-bauer-dead-febc76ad8836b85019781f55599526ec	2024-10-20T03:19:17-07:00	
French league condemns homophobic chants made by PSG fans about Marseille and Rabiot	PARIS (AP) — The French soccer league has condemned homophobic chants made by some Paris Saint-Germain fans during the home game against Strasbourg on Saturday. PSG is playing its bitter rival next Sunday in Marseille and the offensive slurs were made about the club and its midfielder Adrien Rabiot. He is a former PSG player who made more than 200 appearances for the club from 2012-19, and his move to Marseille is seen as a betrayal. 'These latest discriminatory chants made by Paris Saint-Germain supporters are unacceptable when, at the same time, the whole of professional soccer has been working to ban homophobic behavior and chants from stadiums,' the league, known as LFP, said in a statement. While the chanting was happening, the stadium announcer at Parc des Princes twice asked for the chants to stop and was jeered. The LFP said its disciplinary committee would look into evidence. Last season, some PSG players received a one-match suspended sentence by the league's disciplinary committee for offensive chants aimed at Marseille after a home league match. Ousmane Dembélé, Achraf Hakimi, Randal Kolo Muani and Layvin Kurzawa were filmed using insults while celebrating at the end of a 4-0 win against Marseille. The four players issued apologies. That match was also marred by homophobic chanting by sections of PSG fans targeting Marseille players. As a result, the league ordered the closure of the Auteuil stand behind one of the goals for two matches, including one that was suspended. The French government also condemned the chants and said France's sports minister Gil Avérous will meet with the LFP president early next week to discuss measures to stop this happening again. French champion PSG hosts PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League on Tuesday. PSG fans are banned from attending next Sunday's game in Marseille at Stade Velodrome for security reasons, with a history of clashes between rival fans. The rivalry between the clubs has been one of the most vehement in French soccer since the 1990s, when Marseille was enjoying its heyday and PSG was becoming more ambitious with the backing of television broadcaster Canal Plus. PSG has been bankrolled by Qatari investors QSI since 2011 and has become the most successful French club domestically with 12 league titles — two more than Marseille and Saint-Etienne. Although Marseille has not won the league since 2010 it still claims the ultimate bragging right over PSG. Marseille is the only French club to win the Champions League, beating Italian giant AC Milan 1-0 in the 1993 final, while PSG lost its only final 1-0 against Bayern Munich in the pandemic-shortened 2020 campaign. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer	https://apnews.com/article/psg-homophobic-chants-marseille-rabiot-18c54ca03ac50b2713deae307c3f2c62	2024-10-20T01:37:25-07:00	
Palestinian officials say 87 dead or missing after Israeli strikes on northern Gaza	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — At least 87 people are dead or missing after Israeli strikes on multiple homes in the northern Gaza Strip overnight and into Sunday, the territory's Health Ministry said. It said another 40 people were wounded in the strikes on the town of Beit Lahiya, which was among the first targets of Israel’s ground invasion nearly a year ago. There was no immediate comment on the strikes from the Israeli military, which said it was 'continuing to operate across Gaza in both aerial strikes and ground operations.' Israel has been carrying out a major operation in the urban Jabaliya refugee camp, also in northern Gaza, for the last two weeks. The military says it launched the operation against Hamas militants who had regrouped there. The north has already suffered the heaviest destruction of the war, and has been encircled by Israeli forces since late last year, following the deadly Hamas' attack on Israel. Israel ordered the entire population of the northern third of Gaza, including Gaza City, to evacuate to the south in the opening weeks of the war and reiterated those instructions earlier this month. Most of the population fled last year, but around 400,000 people are believed to have remained in the north. Palestinians who fled the north at the start of the war have not been allowed to return.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-lebanon-10-20-2024-42ea48ce0f6a31d53a25dc50f16796bc	2024-10-20T00:48:04-07:00	
Kyiv launches more than 100 drones over Russia as a missile strike on Ukraine injures 17	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russian air defenses shot down more than 100 Ukrainian drones Sunday over Russia’s western regions, Moscow officials said, while 17 people were injured in the Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih in a ballistic missile attack. The Russian Defense Ministry said 110 drones were destroyed in the overnight barrage against seven Russian regions. Many targeted Russia’s border region of Kursk, where 43 drones were reportedly shot down. Social media footage appeared to show air defenses at work over the city of Dzerzhinsk in the Nizhny Novgorod region, close to a factory producing explosives. Local Gov. Gleb Nikitin wrote on social media Sunday that four fighters had been injured repelling a drone attack over Dzerzhinsk's industrial zone, but did not give further details. Such large-scale aerial attacks are still relatively rare over Russia 2 1/2 years after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. A similar attack at the end of September saw Russia’s Ministry of Defense report the destruction of 125 drones across seven regions. Meanwhile, 17 people were injured in Ukraine’s Kryvyi Rih after the city was hit with two Russian ballistic missiles, officials said Sunday. The attack late Saturday evening damaged homes and businesses, said local administration head Oleksandr Vilkul. In a statement on social media, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Russia had launched some 800 guided aerial bombs and more than 500 attack drones over Ukraine in the past week alone. 'Every day, Russia strikes our cities and communities. It is deliberate terror from the enemy against our people,' he said, renewing calls for continued air support from the country’s allies. 'United in defense, the world can stand against this targeted terror.' ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-drone-strike-missiles-kryvyi-rih-b6d8d5f42fcb3c08d839410fea64afa8	2024-10-19T23:58:53-07:00	
Iraq's Kurdish region goes to the polls with a flagging economy and political infighting top of mind	IRBIL, Iraq (AP) — Residents of Iraq’s semi-autonomous northern Kurdish region went to the polls in long-awaited parliamentary elections Sunday under the shadow of ongoing rivalries, economic instability, and unresolved disputes with Baghdad. The primary competitors are the two dominant Kurdish parties: the Kurdistan Democratic Party and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. Historically, these two parties have controlled different parts of the region, with the KDP overseeing Irbil and Dohuk and the PUK governing Sulaymaniyah. This division has frequently led to political deadlock. The parliamentary elections, originally set for 2022, were postponed several times amid disputes over the election law and procedures. Ministry of Interior personnel and peshmerga forces — the regional military — voted in special elections Friday, with the general public voting Sunday. In Friday’s special election, the KDP secured a significant lead, capturing 60% of the votes, while the PUK got around 30%. The New Generation Movement, an opposition party that has seen a gradual rise in support, garnered 5.3% of the total, up from 3% in the 2018 special election. In that special election, the KDP garnered 40% of the vote and the PUK 28.5%. While New Generation’s appeal continues to grow, particularly among younger voters frustrated with the traditional political system, it still faces significant challenges in competing with the well-established dominance of the KDP and PUK. The region’s economic struggles are voters’ primary concern. Despite its oil wealth, the Kurdish region faces significant economic issues, including delayed payment of salaries to civil servants, fluctuating oil prices, and budget cuts from Baghdad. The public is deeply dissatisfied with the economy and lack of opportunities, and many blame political leaders for mismanagement. 'People want to have electricity and get paid their salary on time, and to have more jobs. This is all they want,' said Ghazi Najib, who went to the polls in Irbil. Corruption is also among the central issues in the election. For years, the regional government has faced allegations of nepotism and lack of transparency. Many voters, particularly in the younger generation, are calling for reforms to address these concerns. Many voters, however, have lost hope for reforms and are also skeptical of opposition parties’ ability to make changes, given the longstanding hold the two major parties have over the political landscape. Political cooperation with the central government is another key electoral issue. Relations between Irbil and Baghdad have remained tense since a 2017 referendum over independence for the Kurdish region, particularly over issues of oil revenue sharing and budget allocations. Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed al-Sudani in a recent visit to Irbil said, 'We are committed to ensuring the rights of the Kurdish people, but this must be done within Iraq’s constitution.' In certain areas, the current elections are significantly influenced by security concerns since Islamic State sleeper cells are still active in areas that are disputed between the regional and central governments. 'We hope that Kurdistan will be more developed, and to see more safety and reconstruction in Kurdistan,' said Jamila Mohammed Amin, a voter in Irbil, using the region's local name. 'All political parties and entities should work together and achieve these goals and protect it against enemies.' ___ Associated Press journalist Salar Salim in Irbil contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/iraq-kurdish-region-elections-krg-kdp-puk-21784b4ca26ded5ef15d2ccb3ff04f25	2024-10-19T23:07:33-07:00	
German authorities arrest Libyan man suspected of planning attack on Israeli Embassy	BERLIN (AP) — German authorities said Sunday that they have arrested a Libyan national with suspected ties to the extremist Islamic State group who was allegedly planning a firearms attack on the Israeli Embassy. Police and other security forces detained the man on Saturday evening in Bernau, a town just outside of Berlin, and searched his home there, the Federal Prosecutor's Office said in a statement. The prosecutor’s office said the suspect was a Libyan national whom they identified only as Omar A. 'He intended to carry out a high-profile attack with firearms on the Israeli Embassy in Berlin,' the statement said. In his planning, the statement added, 'the accused exchanged information with a member of IS in a messenger chat.' Security forces also searched the home of another person who is considered a witness and not a suspect, the prosecutor's statement said. Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said that German security authorities 'struck in time to thwart possible plans to attack the Israeli Embassy in Berlin.' 'This shows that protecting Jewish and Israeli institutions in our country is vital and of the utmost importance to us,' she added. The suspect brought on Sunday before an investigating judge at the country’s highest court, the Federal Court of Justice in Karlsruhe. Israeli Ambassador Ron Prosor thanked the German security authorities 'for ensuring the security of our embassy,' German news agency dpa reported. News of the case first came from the Bild newspaper, which reported that a heavily armed elite police unit stormed the suspect’s home in Bernau. It said German authorities acted after receiving a tipoff from an unspecified foreign intelligence agency. 'We are acting with the utmost vigilance and attention in view of the high threat posed by Islamist, antisemitic and anti-Israel violence,' Faeser said. According to Bild, the suspect is a 28-year-old who arrived in Germany in November 2022 and applied for asylum. Dpa reported that his asylum request was rejected. Justice Minister Marco Buschmann also warned Sunday of a 'very serious' threat of Islamist terrorism in Germany. 'Israeli institutions are particularly often the target of terrorists,' he told dpa. A sharp increase in antisemitic incidents has been recorded in Germany since Hamas' attack on Israeli on Oct. 7, 2023, which triggered the ongoing wars in the Middle East.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-extremism-arrest-633b63aed3a28d74381279a970a9c7d9	2024-10-19T22:48:15-07:00	
Moldovans cast votes to choose president and decide on EU path as Russian interference claims spike	CHISINAU, Moldova (AP) — Moldovans cast their ballots in two key votes Sunday that could determine whether the European Union candidate country, which neighbors Ukraine, remains on a pro-Western path amid allegations that Russia has tried to undermine the electoral process. Incumbent President Maia Sandu was the favorite to secure another term in office in a presidential race in which 11 candidates were running. Voters will also choose 'yes' or 'no' in a referendum on whether to enshrine in the country’s constitution its path toward the 27-nation EU. Polls by WatchDog, a Chisinau-based think tank, showed a clear majority of more than 50% support the EU path. The referendum needed a one-third turnout to be valid. Polling stations opened at 7 a.m. (0400 GMT) and are expected to close at 9 p.m. (1800 GMT). By 8 p.m., more than 1.5 million voters — about 50% of eligible voters — had cast ballots, according to the Central Electoral Commission. By 6 p.m., 42% had voted in the EU referendum, passing the validation threshold. 'I think that all the efforts of Russia to meddle in our elections and attempting to limit the participation of our citizens so far failed,' Iulian Groza, executive director of the Institute for European Policies and Reforms think tank, told The Associated Press. 'We are way beyond the threshold of one-third.' If Sandu fails to win an outright majority Sunday, a runoff will be held on Nov. 3, which could pit her against Alexandr Stoianoglo, a Russia-friendly former prosecutor general who is polling at around 10%. The two pivotal ballots are held amid ongoing claims by Moldovan authorities that Moscow has intensified an alleged 'hybrid war' campaign to destabilize the country and derail its EU path. The allegations include funding pro-Moscow opposition groups, spreading disinformation, meddling in local elections, and backing a major vote-buying scheme. U.S. national security spokesman John Kirby echoed those concerns this week, saying in a statement that 'Russia is working actively to undermine Moldova’s election and its European integration.' Moscow has repeatedly denied it is interfering in Moldova. 'In the last several months, Moscow has dedicated millions of dollars to influencing Moldova’s presidential election,' Kirby said. 'We assess that this money has gone toward financing its preferred parties and spreading disinformation on social media in favor of their campaigns.' In early October, Moldovan law enforcement said it had uncovered a massive vote-buying scheme orchestrated by Ilan Shor, an exiled pro-Russia oligarch who currently resides in Russia, which paid 15 million euros ($16.2 million) to 130,000 individuals to undermine the two ballots. Shor was convicted in absentia last year and sentenced to 15 years in prison on fraud and money laundering in the case of $1 billion that went missing from Moldovan banks in 2014. He denied the allegations, saying 'the payments are legal' and cited a right to freedom of expression. Shor’s populist Russia-friendly Shor Party was declared unconstitutional last year and banned. Constantin Celac, a 37-year-old multimedia producer, said in central Chisinau that he cast his ballots in favor of Sandu and EU integration because 'it is the best way' forward for Moldova. He said that while he does have concerns about Russian meddling, 'I trust our government … to fight against them.' On Thursday, Moldovan authorities foiled another plot in which more than 100 young Moldovans received training in Moscow from private military groups on how to create civil unrest around the two votes. Some also attended 'more advanced training in guerrilla camps' in Serbia and Bosnia, police said, and four people were detained for 30 days. Sandu cast her own ballot in the capital on Sunday and told the media that 'Moldovans themselves must choose their own fate, and not others, nor the dirty money or the lies.' 'I voted for Moldova to be able to develop in peace and liberty,' she said. A pro-Western government has been in power in Moldova since 2021, a year after Sandu won the presidency. A parliamentary election will be held next year. Moldova, a former Soviet republic with a population of about 2.5 million, applied to join the EU in the wake of Russia’s full-scale invasion of neighboring Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, and was granted candidate status that summer, alongside Ukraine. Brussels agreed in June to start membership negotiations. Loredana Godorogea, a 29-year-old IT manager who lives in Chisinau, said she also voted in favor of the incumbent president and the path toward the EU. 'I think in the next five years we can be more close economically with the European Union, and I also think a big factor will be the war in Ukraine,' she said.	https://apnews.com/article/moldova-elections-referendum-eu-russia-sandu-9411ab04ffb3230a83a4f8751c4e2414	2024-10-19T22:23:03-07:00	
Indonesia swears in Prabowo Subianto as the country's eighth president	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — Prabowo Subianto was inaugurated Sunday as the eighth president of the world’s most populous Muslim-majority nation, completing his journey from an ex-general accused of rights abuses during the dark days of Indonesia’s military dictatorship to the presidential palace. The former defense minister, who turned 73 on Thursday, was cheered through the streets by thousands of waving supporters after taking his oath on the Quran, the Muslim holy book, in front of lawmakers and foreign dignitaries. Banners and billboards to welcome the new president filled the streets of the capital, Jakarta, where tens of thousands gathered for festivities including speeches and musical performances along the city’s major throughfare. Wearing a blue Betawi traditional cloth and a dark baseball cap, Subianto stood up in the sunroof of a white van and waved, occasionally shaking peoples' hands, as his motorcade struggled to pass through the thousands of supporters calling his name and chanting 'Good luck Prabowo-Gibran,' filling the road leading from the parliament building to the presidential palace. 'I see a firm and patriotic figure in him,' said Atalaric Eka Prayoga, a 25-year-old Jakarta resident. 'That’s a figure we need to lead Indonesia.' 'I have high hopes that he can build Indonesia to be more advanced and improve the current gloomy economic situation,' said another resident, Silky Putri. Subianto was a longtime rival of the immensely popular President Joko Widodo, who ran against him for the presidency twice and refused to accept his defeat on both occasions, in 2014 and 2019. But Widodo appointed Subianto as defense chief after his reelection, paving the way for an alliance despite their rival political parties. During the campaign, Subianto ran as the popular outgoing president’s heir, vowing to continue signature policies like the construction of a multibillion-dollar new capital city and limits on exporting raw materials intended to boost domestic industry. Backed by Widodo, Subianto swept to a landslide victory in February’s direct presidential election on promises of policy continuity. Subianto was sworn in with his new vice president, 37-year-old Surakarta ex-Mayor Gibran Rakabuming Raka. He chose Raka, who is Widodo’s son, as his running mate, with Widodo favoring Subianto over the candidate of his own former party. The former rivals became tacit allies, even though Indonesian presidents don’t typically endorse candidates. But how he’ll govern the biggest economy in Southeast Asia — where nearly 90% of Indonesia’s 282 million people are Muslims — remains uncertain after a campaign in which he made few concrete promises besides continuity with the popular former president. Subianto, who comes from one of the country’s wealthiest families, is a sharp contrast to Widodo, the first Indonesian president to emerge from outside the political and military elite who came from a humble background and as president often mingled with working-class crowds. Subianto was a special forces commander until he was expelled by the army in 1998 over accusations that he played a role in the kidnappings and torture of activists and other abuses. He never faced trial and went into self-imposed exile in Jordan in 1998, although several of his underlings were tried and convicted. Jordanian King Abdullah II bin Al-Hussein was expected to attend Sunday’s ceremony, but canceled at the last minute because of escalating Middle East tensions, instead deciding to send Foreign Affairs Minister Nancy Namrouqa as his special envoy. Subianto and Abdullah met in person in June for talks in Amman on humanitarian assistance to people affected by the war in Gaza. Subianto, who has never held elective office, will lead a massive, diverse archipelago nation whose economy has boomed amid strong global demand for its natural resources. But he’ll have to contend with global economic distress and regional tensions in Asia, where territorial conflicts and the United States-China rivalry loom large. Leaders and senior officials from more than 30 countries flew in to attend the ceremony, including Chinese Vice President Han Zheng and leaders of Southeast Asia countries. U.S. President Joe Biden sent Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. Adm. Samuel Paparo, the U.S. Commander of the Indo-Pacific Command, was also among the American delegation. Army troops and police, along with armored vehicles, fire trucks and ambulances, were deployed across the capital, and major roads were closed to secure the swearing-in. The election outcome capped a long comeback for Subianto, who was banned for years from traveling to the United States and Australia. He has vowed to continue Widodo’s modernization efforts, which have boosted Indonesia’s economic growth by building infrastructure and leveraging the country’s abundant resources. A signature policy required nickel, a major Indonesian export and a key component of electric car batteries, to be processed in local factories rather than exported raw. He has also promised to push through Widodo’s most ambitious and controversial project: the construction of a new capital on Borneo, about 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles) away from congested Jakarta. A rousing speaker, Subianto railed against widespread corruption in his inauguration speech, saying many people are unbale to get jobs, children are malnourished and their schools are not well maintained. 'Too many of our brothers and sisters are below the poverty line, too many of our children go to school without breakfast and do not have clothes for school,' Subianto said. Before February’s presidential election, he also promised to provide free school lunches and milk to 78.5 million students at more than 400,000 schools across the country, aiming to reduce malnutrition and stunted growth among children. 'We must dare to see all of this and we must dare to solve all of these problems,' Subianto said Sunday. He also pledged to continue a non-aligned foreign policy and to be a good neighbor. 'We will stand against all colonialism and we will defend the interests of oppressed people worldwide,' Subianto said. Indonesia is a bastion of democracy in Southeast Asia, a diverse and economically bustling region of authoritarian governments, police states and nascent democracies. After decades of dictatorship under President Suharto, the country was convulsed by political, ethnic and religious unrest in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Since then, it has consolidated its democratic transition as the world’s third-largest democracy, and is home to a rapidly expanding middle class. ___ Associated Press journalists Edna Tarigan and Andi Jatmiko contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/indonesia-new-president-prabowo-subianto-sworn-44f1cb606ab8aa825b20b7f154ba9721	2024-10-19T18:43:15-07:00

Children greet King Charles III and Queen Camilla outside a Sydney church	SYDNEY (AP) — King Charles III and Queen Camilla were greeted by children Sunday outside a Sydney church in their first public appearance of their Australian visit. Charles’ arrival Friday marked the first reigning British monarch visit to Australia since his late mother Queen Elizabeth II made her 16th journey to the distant nation in 2011. Charles, 75, is being treated for cancer, which has led to a scaled-down itinerary. The couple spent a rest day on Saturday at Admiralty House, the official Sydney residence of the monarch’s representative in Australia, Governor-General Sam Mostyn. The royals' first public engagement was at a service at St. Thomas’ Anglican Church in North Sydney. As Charles and Camilla made their way to the front of church, Sunday school children waving Australian flags cheered and shook hands with the couple. Inside, dozens of phones pointed in their direction, while excited whispers echoed through the room. After the service, the king and queen were greeted outside by hundreds of cheering people hoping to catch a glimpse or snap a photo. Sunday’s service was restricted to the local congregation, with only a few special guests allowed to attend, such as Mostyn and New South Wales state Governor Margaret Beazley. A small group of protesters demonstrated nearby under a banner that read, 'Empire Built on Genocide.' The couple later attended the New South Wales state Parliament to commemorate the 200th anniversary of Australia's first legislature. Charles gifted Parliament an hourglass, which is traditionally used to limit the duration of lawmakers' speeches. 'So with the sands of time encouraging brevity, it just remains for me to say what a great joy it is to come to Australia for the first time as sovereign and to renew a love of this country and its people which I have cherished for so long,' Charles said. It is Charles’ 17th trip to Australia and the first since he became king in 2022. The couple will attend a reception in the national capital, Canberra, on Monday. All government leaders of Australia’s six states have declined invitations to attend, which monarchists have interpreted as a snub. The non-attendants are all republicans who would prefer an Australian citizen as the nation’s head of state, rather than Britain’s monarch. On Wednesday, Charles will travel to Samoa, where he will open the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. ___ This story corrects that the king gave the hourglass, he did not receive it.	https://apnews.com/article/sydney-church-king-charles-royals-visit-australia-8f0ac202a948d450bbcfe3532e915536	2024-10-19T16:53:42-07:00	
What to know about the electrical grid failure that plunged Cuba into darkness	HAVANA (AP) — Millions of people in Cuba were left without electricity for two days after the nation's energy grid went down when one of the island's major power plants failed. The widespread blackout that swept across the county was the worst in years. Authorities were able to restore power to some people by Saturday, but it was unclear when the power would be fully restored across the country. Here are a few things to know: What happened and why? About half of Cuba was plunged into darkness on Thursday evening, followed by the entire island on Friday morning after the failure of the Antonio Guiteras thermoelectric plant in Matanzas Province east of Havana. Even in a country that for decades has been accustomed to frequent outages amid a series of economic crises, the grid failure was unprecedented in modern times, aside from incidents involving powerful hurricanes, such as one in 2022. Even as Cuba worked to fix the power problems Saturday, the country issued hurricane watches for the far eastern Guantanamo, Holguin and Las Tunas provinces as a tropical storm developed into Hurricane Oscar, the 10th hurricane of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season. Authorities said the outage that began Thursday stemmed from increased demand from small- and medium-sized companies and residences’ air conditioners — as many as 100,000 additional ones this year alone. They also blamed breakdowns in old thermoelectric plants that haven’t been properly maintained because of a lack of hard currency due to U.S. sanctions, as well as insufficient fuel to operate some facilities. Has this happened before? While some homes have spent up to eight hours a day this year without electricity as the grid has grown more unstable, the current power failure is considered Cuba’s worst in years. Officials said that 1.64 gigawatts went offline during peak hours, about half the total demand at the time. The government implemented emergency measures to slash demand, suspended classes, and shut down some state-owned workplaces and canceled non-essential services. Another major collapse occurred two years ago after Hurricane Ian, an intense Category 3 storm, damaged power installations and the government took days to fix them. Any political consequences? It's unknown how Cubans will react if the current blackout endures or recurs. But problems in the electrical grid have helped sparked street protests several times in recent years, including large demonstrations in July 2021 that led to international criticism of the government for its harsh response. There were also smaller demonstrations due to blackouts in October 2022 and March of this year. Authorities now say changes to electricity rates for small- and medium-sized companies, which have proliferated since they were first authorized by the communist government in 2021, are being considered. What's next? Officials said the state-owned power company UNE was using distributed generation to provide power to some areas of the island and that a gas-fired thermoelectric plant was starting operations. Cuba gets its power from huge thermoelectric plants like Antonio Guiteras and some smaller ones, which require crude oil to operate. The country produces about half of the crude needed, but must purchase some of the rest on the international market, which can be difficult and costly due to U.S. sanctions. It has also depended on allies like Venezuela and Russia for cheaper fuel. Authorities have been working since last year on a project to upgrade the island’s electrical grid through the use of alternative power sources. A project to build 31 centers generating solar energy is under way and projected to be completed next year. 'We are devoting absolute priority to addressing and solving this highly sensitive energy contingency,' Cuba’s President Miguel Díaz-Canel wrote on X. 'There will be no rest until its restoration.' ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/cuba-power-outage-explained-f610223f714afe994c3ad9658bb4de7d	2024-10-19T15:18:44-07:00	
US investigating unauthorized release of classified documents on Israel attack plans	WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. is investigating an unauthorized release of classified documents that assess Israel's plans to attack Iran, three U.S. officials told The Associated Press. A fourth U.S. official said the documents appear to be legitimate. The documents are attributed to the U.S. Geospatial Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency and note that Israel continues to move military assets in place to conduct a military strike in response to Iran's blistering ballistic missile attack on Oct. 1. They were sharable within the 'Five Eyes,' which are the U.S., Great Britain, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. The documents, which are marked top secret, were posted online to Telegram and first reported by CNN and Axios. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. The investigation is also examining how the documents were obtained — including whether it was an intentional leak by a member of the U.S. intelligence community or obtained by another method, like a hack — and whether any other intelligence information was compromised, the official said. As part of that investigation, officials are working to determine who had access to the documents before they were posted, the official said. The documents emerged as the U.S. has urged Israel to take advantage of its elimination of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and press for a ceasefire in Gaza, and has likewise urgently cautioned Israel not to further expand military operations in the north in Lebanon and risk a wider regional war. However, Israel's leadership has repeatedly stressed it will not let Iran's missile attack go unanswered. In a statement, the Pentagon said it was aware of the reports of the documents but did not have further comment.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-iran-us-documents-attack-e7e23d09a2f1fc14498e64b38d74576f	2024-10-19T15:11:32-07:00	
Vasso Papandreou, champion of women in Greek politics, dies at 79	ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Vasso Papandreou, a trailblazing Greek politician who served as a government minister, European commissioner and leading advocate for women’s representation in politics, has died at her home in an Athens suburb. She was 79. No cause of death was given, but she had been in poor health for several years. Her funeral was held Saturday outside Aegio, near the town of her birth in southern Greece, and was attended by former Socialist prime minister Costas Simitis and other veteran politicians. Politicians across party lines paid tribute to Papandreou following her death Thursday, recognizing her contributions to Greece and dedication to social justice. 'Even though we found ourselves on opposite sides, I must admit she was a strong personality ... she earned the devotion of her friends and the respect of her opponents,' said the conservative Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis. Papandreou was a founding member of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement in 1974. She was unrelated to the party founder, Andreas Papandreou, but they had a brief affair in the mid-1970s, after which she left for the U.K. to complete her graduate studies. She served in various ministerial positions in the Costas Simitis governments from 1996 to 2004, including minister of economic development, minister of interior, and minister for the environment, physical planning and public works. Papandreou broke barriers as Greece’s first female European Commissioner from 1989 to 1992, overseeing employment, industrial relations and social affairs in the second commission led by Jacques Delors and was admired for her strong advocacy of democratic rights. A champion for women’s representation, Papandreou led efforts to increase female participation in Greek politics. She successfully pushed for legislation requiring 33% female representation on candidate lists, starting with municipal elections in 2002 — building a foundation for greater gender balance in Greek politics. Throughout her career, she advocated for workers’ rights, educational opportunities and support for mothers and individuals with special needs. Papandreou won election to Parliament in six consecutive elections, from 1993 to 2009. For her first election, in a year when the Panhellenic Socialist Movement returned to power, she had prepared for a candidacy in the central Athens multi-seat constituency, but was shifted to the much larger Athens B constituency, in the capital’s suburbs, which, at that time, had 32 seats. The result was that she received a still-standing record 256,831 preference votes, many from female PASOK supporters who intended their vote as a rebuke to the party leadership. In late 1994, she and three other lawmakers, including Simitis, formed what was called 'the Group of Four' aiming to push the ailing party founder, Andreas Papandreou, into retirement. The group met several times at her home to coordinate their strategy. Andreas Papandreou finally bowed out in 1996 after his health took a significant downturn and was succeeded as prime minister and party leader by Simitis. Born on Dec. 9, 1944, Papandreou studied economics in Athens before earning a Ph.D. from the University of Reading in the U.K., where she started her career as an academic before shifting to politics as Greece emerged from a seven-year military dictatorship.	https://apnews.com/article/greece-vasso-papandreou-politics-minister-women-3e0283811d247d4fcb3f687b1a48061d	2024-10-19T12:35:16-07:00	
Singer Zayn postpones US tour after the death of his former bandmate Liam Payne	English singer Zayn Malik on Saturday postponed a planned tour to the U.S. following the death of his former One Direction bandmate Liam Payne. Zayn, as the singer often goes by, wrote on X that he’d made the decision 'Given the heartbreaking loss experienced this week.' He said the dates for the U.S. leg of his 'Stairway to the Sky' tour would be rescheduled for January and he'd post the new dates within the coming days. Zayn had gigs scheduled next week in San Francisco and Las Vegas, and the following week in Los Angeles, Washington D.C. and New York. 'Your tickets will remain valid for the new dates,' Zayn wrote. 'Love you all and thank you for your understanding.' Payne, 31, was found dead Wednesday after falling from a hotel balcony in Buenos Aires. His death prompted an outpouring of shock and sadness from friends, collaborators and fellow musicians. Payne's sister Ruth Gibbins was the latest to share her thoughts in an Instagram tribute. 'I don't believe this is happening. Many times have I poured my heart out publicly with pride about Liam but never much about life as his sister,' she wrote. She said her brother was 'born with music in his veins' and that what she loved most about him was his ability to make her laugh. 'I don't feel this world was good enough or kind enough to you,' she wrote. One Direction was the internet's first boy band with a level of fame comparable to Beatlemania. Band members in their teens had to cope with their sudden fame and then navigate a breakup while trying to build solo careers. The exact circumstances of Payne's death remain unclear although Argentine authorities said there were suspicious elements and drugs were possibly involved. The results of toxicology tests are expected in the coming weeks.

A small blast in Myanmar's second-biggest city damages Chinese Consulate	BANGKOK (AP) — The Chinese Consulate in Myanmar’s second-largest city has been slightly damaged by an explosive device, but there were no casualties, the military, independent media and a city resident said Saturday. No public claims of responsibility were made for the attack on Friday in Mandalay. China is a major ally of Myanmar’s military, which came to power after ousting the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in 2021 but is now fighting fiercely against resistance forces challenging its rule. The military said in a statement sent to journalists on Saturday evening that roof tiles on the two-story Chinese Consulate were damaged by a explosion Friday afternoon. The security forces are investigating in order to arrest the 'terrorists' behind the blast, it said. The army is engaged in nationwide fighting against pro-democracy guerrillas and ethnic minority militias. It was forced onto the defensive late last year when ethnic armed organizations dealt it major defeats in the country’s northeast, seizing important territory along the border with China. Those gains, made by armed ethnic groups who separately maintained their own good relations with China, have weakened the army’s position all over the country, causing Beijing concern about the military government’s stability. China has reportedly sought to have some of the more powerful ethnic minority groups with which it maintains good ties to discourage the groups that seized territory in the northeast from continuing their offensive, which they launched in October last year. China was widely believed to have initially given its tacit approval to that offensive, which was seen as a way of curbing rampant criminality, particularly large-scale online scamming carried out in enclaves, which also involved human trafficking. The criminal enterprises were largely run by ethnic Chinese, embarrassing Beijing. China, along with Russia, is a major arms supplier to Myanmar’s military. It also is Myanmar’s biggest trading partner and has invested billions of dollars in Myanmar’s mines, oil and gas pipelines and other infrastructure. The military government is shunned and sanctioned by many Western nations for its 2021 takeover and for major human rights violations. Myanmar's independent media have reported that Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, the head of the ruling military council, would travel to China in the coming weeks for the first time since taking power Independent online media including The Irrawaddy and Khit Thit, on Saturday also reported the attack with an explosive device on the Chinese Consulate in Mandalay’s Chanmyathazi township. A Chanmyathazi resident living near the consulate told The Associated Press that the already strict security around the site has since been tightened, with nearby roads closed after the explosion. He spoke on the condition of anonymity because he feared being arrested by the military. The shadow National Unity Government, the main group coordinating opposition to military rule, condemned the attack on the consulate in a statement, saying that it will persistently oppose any action that may cause racial and religious conflict.	https://apnews.com/article/china-consulate-attack-myanmar-bombing-mandalay-c5be224fc967cab8fdcf065a14c260b8	2024-10-19T11:00:05-07:00	
Ukraine’s ‘victory plan’ receives mixed reactions from Western allies	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s plan to end Ukraine’s nearly three-year war with Russia has received mixed reactions from Western allies so far. The 'victory plan' that Zelenskyy outlined at home and abroad includes a formal invitation for Ukraine to join NATO and permission to use Western long-range missiles to strike military targets in Russia — two steps Kyiv's allies have been reluctant to support before. U.S. backing is crucial if Zelenskyy is to get support from other allies for proposals he believes are necessary to strengthen Ukraine’s position on the battlefield and ahead of any peace negotiations. But analysts say the Biden administration is unlikely to make a decision before the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 5, as it may not appeal to voters. 'They seem to be just doing very little now and waiting for the election,' said Phillips O'Brien, professor of strategic studies at the University of St. Andrews, Scotland. 'So much of the strategy will live or die in Washington.' Analysts said the plan is a step in the right direction for Ukraine's military efforts. They also described it as ambitious, given allies’ fears of escalation with nuclear-armed Russia. Ukraine has previously secured Western support for requests once deemed unrealistic, such as Patriot air defense systems and F-16 jets. Presenting the plan now puts on the radar for the next U.S. administration, analysts said, though it's unknown how the next president will receive it. After returning from making his case to the European Council, Zelenskyy said he expects the White House to provide feedback. 'They will be here soon with some form of response,' he said. Will the plan bring victory to Ukraine? Zelenskyy laid out the five-point plan as Ukraine’s troops struggle to hold back Russian slow but steady advances in eastern Ukraine. The plan includes three 'secret annexes' that were presented only to some leaders. It also addresses partners’ concerns about Ukraine’s strategy after the failed summer 2023 counteroffensive. Zelenskyy described the main goal as 'to strengthen us and force Russia to come to the negotiating table with all partners.' The plan won’t immediately alter the battlefield situation, but it will help Ukraine wear down Russia and give more means to keep going in the attrition war. 'I think people were potentially expecting some sort of more operational plan on winning the war,' said Justin Crump, a former British tank commander who heads Sibylline, a strategic advisory firm. 'That’s a naive opinion to have expected a plan to have provided operational details that would obviously be of use to the enemy.' Some Ukrainian analysts blame the name of the plan, adding that it was likely chosen for marketing purposes. Ukrainian analyst Yurii Bohdan said the goal is get resources. 'To win such war (of attrition), Ukraine needs to increase its resilience and exhaust its opponent,' said Hlib Voloskyi, an analyst from a Ukrainian think tank, Come Back Alive Centre of Initiatives. 'The side that falls last wins.' What was the allies’ response? U.S. reaction was muted and noncommittal, though it did issue a new $425 million package of security assistance for Ukraine the day that Zelenskyy presented the plan to lawmakers. 'It’s not my position to publicly evaluate his plan,' Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said. 'We have been supporting him by providing security assistance in a major way for 2 1/2 years. We are going to continue to do that.' In Europe, reactions ranged from categorical opposition to strong support. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot stated in Kyiv on Saturday that he will work with Ukrainian officials to rally other nations to get behind the proposal. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz stood by his refusal to supply Taurus long-range cruise missiles to Kyiv. 'Our position is clear: We are supporting Ukraine as strongly as possible,' he said. 'At the same time, we are taking care that NATO does not become a party to the war so that this war doesn’t culminate in an even bigger catastrophe.' Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, widely seen as having the warmest relations of any EU leader with Russian President Vladimir Putin, called Zelenskyy’s plan 'more than frightening' in a Facebook post. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov mocked Zelenskyy’s plan as 'ephemeral,' and Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova called it 'a set of incoherent slogans.' What's at stake for Ukraine? Without an invitation to join NATO, Ukraine won’t have an 'assurance that its geopolitical future will not be a bargaining chip with Russia,' said Ukrainian analyst Hlib Voloskyi. Ukrainian officials say there are no other guarantees for Ukraine besides NATO to protect against Russia's aggression after the war. Zelensky made ambiguous comments suggesting that nuclear weapons are the only other security alternative. Some thought he was talking about self-made nuclear weapons, sparking strong reaction among Ukrainians, many of whom were pessimistic about the prospects for an invitation to NATO. Zelensky later clarified that he was highlighting the dire situation for Ukraine by referencing the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, in which Ukraine relinquished its nuclear arsenal in exchange for security guarantees from major nuclear powers, including the U.K., the U.S., and Russia. Without Western support, Ukraine will struggle to endure a protracted war with Russia, backed by North Korea, Iran, and China. If Ukraine falls, it will be forced to negotiate on Russia’s terms. 'Getting help from outside is a key part of winning the war,' O’Brien said. ___ Associated Press reporters Danica Kirka in London, Geir Moulson in Berlin, Tara Copp and Aamer Madhani in Washington contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/victory-plan-ukraine-russia-war-zelenskyy-1a66e6b1655fcaa421526ad174e618bd	2024-10-19T10:38:29-07:00	
Iraq moves to revoke Saudi broadcaster's license after report angered militia supporters	BAGHDAD (AP) — Iraq’s commission governing media announced Saturday that it would take steps to revoke the license of a Saudi television station to operate in the country. That came hours after dozens of supporters of Iraqi militias stormed and looted the office of the broadcaster, MBC, in Baghdad in protest over a report that described a number of Iranian-linked militant figures — including a prominent Iraqi militia leader — as 'terrorists.' The report on 'terrorists' who had been killed this century mentioned former al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden alongside a roster of Iran-backed figures. They included Hamas leaders Ismail Haniyeh and Yahya Sinwar, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, a veteran Iraqi militant who was the deputy commander of the Popular Mobilization Forces, an umbrella group of mostly Shiite paramilitaries and founder of the Kataeb Hezbollah, or Hezbollah Brigades. Iraq’s Media and Communications Commission said in a statement that MBC had violated the country’s broadcasting regulations through 'attacks on the martyrs, leaders of victory and heroic resistance leaders who are fighting the battle of honor against the usurping Zionist entity,' referring to Israel, and that it would order its executive office to cancel the station’s work license. The station had already closed its doors following the attack. Saudi Arabia's regulatory authority for media subsequently announced that it had referred 'officials of a TV channel to investigation due to a news report that violates the Kingdom’s media regulations and policy.' It didn't name MBC. The controversy came against the backdrop of heightened regional tensions surrounding the wars between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, and Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Iranian-backed militias in Iraq have played a minor role in the conflict, launching drone attacks on bases housing U.S. troops in the country in retaliation for Washington’s support of Israel’s involvement in the wars and, increasingly in recent months, firing at targets within Israel.	https://apnews.com/article/iraq-saudi-arabia-tv-station-mbc-license-b9967708309d6a5342661448840f59e2	2024-10-19T10:02:07-07:00	
Demonstrators in France praise Gisèle Pélicot's courage in harrowing drug and rape trial	PARIS (AP) — Women and men demonstrated together Saturday in Paris and other French cities in support of Gisèle Pélicot and against sexual violence highlighted by the harrowing trial of her ex-husband and dozens of other men being prosecuted for rapes while she was drugged and unconscious. The demonstrations outside Paris' criminal court, in the southeastern city of Lyon and elsewhere underscored how Pélicot's courage in speaking out about her ordeal is inspiring people in France and beyond, even as they've been horrified by the scale and brutality of the abuse she suffered over the course of a decade. Since the Sept. 2 beginning of the extraordinary trial, during which Pélicot has faced 51 of her alleged rapists, she has been praised for her composure and decision to keep the hearings public — after the court initially suggested that they be held behind closed doors. 'She has decided to make this an emblematic trial,' said Elsa Labouret, one of the Paris demonstrators and a spokesperson for the women’s group 'Osez le féminisme!' (Dare to be feminist!) 'Victims don’t have to do what she did. They have a right to have their anonymity protected. It’s not necessarily a duty of any victim. But what she decided to do is very, very important because now we cannot ignore the violence that some men can resort to,' she said. Demonstrators denounced what they said is laxity from the French justice system toward sexual violence and fears of being raped and assaulted that they said stalk women day-in, day-out. Placards they held up read: 'Shame must change sides,' 'Stop the denial,' 'Not your punching ball' and 'We are all Gisele. Are you all Dominique???' Dominique Pélicot admitted during the trial that for nearly a decade, he repeatedly drugged his unwitting wife and invited dozens of men to rape her while she lay unconscious in their bed. He told the court that he also raped Gisèle and that the 50 other men also standing trial understood exactly what they were doing. She has divorced him since his arrest. The trial is expected to run until December. The defendants range in age from 26 to 74. Many of them deny having raped Gisèle Pélicot, saying her then-husband manipulated them or that they believed she was consenting. 'You can never know who is a rapist or who is a monster. Like, it could be your neighbor, it could be anyone,' said Paris demonstrator Khalil Ndiaye, a student. 'It’s really disgusting somehow to think that it could be people that you know, people that you hang out with every day and, like, they could do things like that.' He said he regards Gisèle Pélicot as an icon. 'Because in her pain, she decided not to give up and not to just lie down,' he said. 'She decided to fight. And we’re all here today because she’s fighting and she’s inspiring us to fight, too.'	https://apnews.com/article/france-rape-trial-gisele-pelicot-abuse-3c43489858f17f1577017f5a94f695ff	2024-10-19T09:43:22-07:00	
Hurricane Oscar makes landfall in the Bahamas and heads toward Cuba	MIAMI (AP) — Hurricane Oscar made landfall early Sunday in the southeastern Bahamas and was heading toward Cuba, an island recently beleaguered by a massive power outage. The National Hurricane Center in Miami said the storm's center arrived on Great Inagua island. It is expected to produce a dangerous storm surge that could translate into significant coastal flooding there and in other areas of the southeastern Bahamas. Two to four inches of rainfall are expected, with isolated areas seeing up to six inches. Forecasters said five to 10 inches of rain are expected across eastern Cuba through Tuesday, with some isolated locations getting up to 15 inches. Oscar formed Saturday off the coast of the Bahamas and brushed past the Turks and Caicos islands to the south. The National Hurricane Center earlier characterized the storm as 'tiny,' but hurricane warnings were in place Sunday for southeastern Bahamas and portions of Cuba. The storm’s maximum sustained winds were clocked at 80 mph (130 kph) with higher gusts. Its center was located about 150 miles (240 kilometers) east-northeast of Guantanamo, Cuba. The storm was heading west at 12 mph (19 kph) and was expected to reach Guantanamo or Holguin, Cuba, on Sunday afternoon at hurricane strength. The hurricane's approach comes as Cuba tries to recover from its worst blackout in at least two years, which left millions without power for two days last week. Some electrical service was restored Saturday. Philippe Papin of the National Hurricane Center said it was somewhat unexpected that Oscar became a hurricane Saturday. 'Unfortunately the system kind of snuck up a little bit on us,' Papin said. Hours earlier Tropical Storm Nadine formed off Mexico’s southern Caribbean coast. It degenerated into a tropical depression as it moved over land.	https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-tropical-weather-oscar-nadine-02649631f0ca88ab3b0f643b51541da9	2024-10-19T09:14:09-07:00	
Main zoo in North Macedonian capital shut down after avian flu case detected	SKOPJE, North Macedonia (AP) — The main zoo in North Macedonia’s capital Skopje was closed Saturday after authorities confirmed the presence of a highly pathogenic strain of bird flu. According to a press statement, the flu was detected in a goose that died in a pond. 'Laboratory results confirmed a case of the presence of a pathogenic strain of the Avian influenza H5N1 virus,' the statement said. Authorities immediately put down dozens of ducks, geese, chickens and one jackdaw, which inhabited the same pond. The zoo will be closed for at least three weeks. During that period, authorities will disinfect the place, inspect other animals and apply other biosecurity measures aimed to prevent the spread of the disease. The last cases of bird flu in North Macedonia, all in wild birds, were detected in 2022. The virus can cause heavy losses in the poultry industry and lead to restrictions on the import and export of live birds and poultry products. Highly pathogenic strains of avian flu can also be transmitted to humans. Founded in 1926, Skopje’s zoo is one of the most visited places in the capital, with hundreds of thousands of visitors each year, not only from the country but also from across the Western Balkans. In the past, the zoo had been the target of much criticism over the animals’ living conditions. Starting in 2008, authorities poured large sums of money into improvements, working with the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA) to bring the zoo up to modern standards.	https://apnews.com/article/avian-flu-zoo-shutdown-goose-biosecurity-522ee65ebb5664ecf5a3ba3150693698	2024-10-19T08:59:04-07:00	
Video published by Ukraine purports to show North Korean soldiers in Russia	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A video purporting to show dozens of North Korean recruits lining up to collect Russian military fatigues and gear aims to intimidate Ukrainian forces and marks a new chapter in the 2 1/2-year war with the introduction of another country into the battlefield, Ukrainian officials said. The video, which was obtained by Ukraine’s Center for Strategic Communications and Information Security, which operates under the Culture and Information Ministry, is said to show North Korean soldiers standing in line to pick up bags, clothes and other apparel from Russian servicemen. The Associated Press could not verify the video independently. 'We received this video from our own sources. We cannot provide additional verification from the sources who provided it to us due to security concerns,' said Ihor Solovey, head of the center. 'The video clearly shows North Korean citizens being given Russian uniforms under the direction of the Russian military,' he said. 'For Ukraine, this video is important because it is the first video evidence that shows North Korea participating in the war on the side of Russia. Now not only with weapons and shells but also with personnel.' The center claims the footage was shot by a Russian soldier in recent days. The location is unknown. It comes after the head of Ukrainian military intelligence, Kyrylo Budanov, said in local media reports that about 11,000 North Korean infantrymen were currently training in eastern Russia. He predicted they would be ready to join fighting by November. At least 2,600 would be sent to Russia’s Kursk region, where Ukraine launched an incursion in August, he was quoted as saying. 'The emergence of any number of new soldiers is a problem because we will simply need new, additional weapons to destroy them all,' Solovey told AP. 'The dissemination of this video is important as a signal to the world community that with two countries officially at war against Ukraine, we will need more support to repel this aggression.' The presence of North Korean soldiers in Ukraine, if true, would be another proof of intensified military ties between Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Last summer, they signed a strategic partnership treaty that commits both countries to provide military assistance. North Korean weapons have already been used in the Ukraine war.	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-russia-ukraine-video-d84e70171378f30b5dabd0cbe27a5cec	2024-10-19T06:51:13-07:00	
Cuba gets some electricity back after major power outage left millions in the dark	HAVANA (AP) — Cuba's government on Saturday said that some electricity was restored on the island after one of the country's major power plants failed and left millions without electricity for two days. Energy Minister Vicente de la O Levy said the country had 500 megawatts in its electrical grid early Saturday, as compared to 3 gigawatts that are normally generated. He posted on X that 'several substations in the west now have electricity.' O Levy also said two thermoelectric power plants are back and two more will resume their operations 'in the next few hours.' About half of Cuba was plunged into darkness on Thursday evening, followed by the entire island on Friday morning after one of the plants failed. Havana's electricity company said in a statement earlier on Saturday that a part of its western system was disconnected 'after the exit of one of the plants that was delivering service.' That issue has left some parts of the city in the dark once again. The streets of Cuba's capital, where 2 million people live, were quiet on Saturday, with few cars driving by after a night that was lit by candles and lamps. The impact of the blackout goes beyond lighting, and services like water supply also depend on electricity to run pumps. This is considered to be Cuba's worst blackout in two years, after a category 3 hurricane damaged power installations and it took days for the government to fix them. This year the electricity service worsened, with several homes in the dark for hours every day. In addition to the Antonio Guiteras plant, whose failure on Friday affected the entire national system, Cuba has several others and it wasn’t immediately clear whether or not they remained functional. There is no official estimate for when the blackout will end. Even in a country that is used to outages as part of a deepening economic crisis, Friday’s supply collapse was massive. The Cuban government has announced emergency measures to slash electricity demand, including suspending classes, shutting down some state-owned workplaces and canceling nonessential services. Officials said that 1.64 gigawatts went offline during peak hours, about half the total demand at the time. Local authorities said the outage, which started in a smaller scale on Thursday, stemmed from increased demand from small and medium-sized companies and residences’ air conditioners. Later, the blackout got worse due to breakdowns in old thermoelectric plants that haven’t been properly maintained and the lack of fuel to operate some facilities. Changes to electricity rates for small- and medium-sized companies, which have proliferated since they were first authorized by the communist government in 2021, are also being considered. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/cuba-power-outage-blackout-minister-8c1447bb14f4105f18317986fa949dc8	2024-10-19T05:55:55-07:00

Guatemalan judge grants investigative journalist Zamora house arrest and his family celebrates	GUATEMALA CITY (AP) — The family of a Guatemalan journalist on Saturday celebrated his transfer to house arrest following his jailing for more than two years amid his daily newspaper's anti-corruption investigations. José Rubén Zamora founded El Periódico, which specialized in anti-corruption reporting and closed a year ago. 'At last, he can defend himself as he always should have, free from a baseless and abusive process,' his son José Carlos Zamora said in a statement. 'We are delighted by this long-awaited moment and deeply grateful for the support and solidarity that sustained us. There is still a long road ahead, but this marks a victory for my father, our family, and freedom of the press in Guatemala.' Judge Erick García Alvarado ruled that Zamora should be released because his preventive arrest in one of the cases had already expired. Zamora, 68, had been imprisoned since July 2022, when he was charged with money laundering, amounting to around $38,000, and in June 2023 he was sentenced to six years in prison. The sentence was overturned by an appeals court because of errors in the process, but he's waiting to see if he will be granted a retrial. International organizations had been calling for Friday's hearing to take place so the journalist could be freed from imprisonment. Many of them said that Zamora had been jailed because of his investigations into those in power. Zamora has said previously that he was exposed to psychological torture during his imprisonment, spending long hours without daylight, isolation and being awakened several times a night by guards. The Guatemalan journalist told reporters after his release that he's both happy and calm after the decision, but that he would go to a hospital to regain his health. 'As for the prosecutor (Rafael Curruchiche, who heads the prosecutor’s office that accuses him), the attorney general would do well to open a scholarship fund to send them to study law again,' Zamora said. Guatemalan President Bernardo Arévalo, who took office earlier this year, celebrated the journalist's release from prison. 'Zamora returns home. Justice is beginning to arrive, the dark cycle is going to end,' Arévalo posted on X. Eight journalists and columnists from El Periódico, which was founded in 1996, have left the country since Guatemala's prosecutor's office started investigating them. Zamora was initially convicted and sentenced to six years in jail over the first charges against him and was imprisoned in July 2022. The decision was later overruled, but he didn't leave jail because of another case against him. Curruchiche told reporters that he hopes Zamora will face justice now that he is free.	https://apnews.com/article/guatemala-investigative-journalist-zamora-released-house-arrest-c3eb82dbd44c86e6c10b02b68b933a1d	2024-10-19T04:42:23-07:00	
Israeli footage showing the last minutes of Hamas leader's life sets off a debate over his legacy	The world’s final glimpse of Hamas’ leader was rough and raw, showing him wounded and cornered as he sat in a bombed-out Palestinian home and faced down the Israeli drone filming him, hurling a stick at it. For Israel, the scene was one of victory, showing Yahya Sinwar, the architect of Oct.7, broken and defeated. But many in the Arab and Muslim world — whether supporters of Hamas or not — saw something different in the grainy footage: a defiant martyr who died fighting to the end. Clips from the released drone footage went viral on social media, accompanied by quotes from Sinwar's speeches in which he declared he would rather die on the battlefield. An oil painting of a masked Sinwar sitting proudly on an armchair was widely shared, apparently inspired by the last image of him alive. 'By broadcasting the last minutes of the life of Yahya Sinwar, the occupation made his life longer than the lives of his killers,' Osama Gaweesh, an Egyptian media personality and journalist, wrote on social media. In Gaza, reactions to Sinwar’s death were mixed. Some mourned his killing, while others expressed relief and hope that it could bring an end to the devastating war triggered by the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel that he is said to have directed. Across the Arab and Muslim world, and away from the devastation in Gaza, opinions varied. One thing, though, was clear. The footage was hailed by supporters and even some critics as evidence of a man killed in confrontation who at least was not hidden in a tunnel surrounded by hostages as Israel has said he was for much of the last year. Three days after he was killed, Israel’s military dropped leaflets in south Gaza, showing another image of Sinwar lying dead on a chair, with his finger cut and blood running down his forehead. 'Sinwar destroyed your lives. He hid in a dark hole and was liquidated while escaping fearfully,' the leaflet said. 'I don’t think there is a Palestinian leader of the first rank who died in a confrontation (like Sinwar), according to what the leaked Israeli version shows,' said Sadeq Abu Amer, head of the Palestinian Dialogue Group, an Istanbul-based think tank. Sinwar's demise was different Unlike Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in his hotel room in Iran, or the leader of Lebanon’s Hezbollah group Hassan Nasrallah, bombed in an underground bunker by dozens of massive munitions, Sinwar was killed while apparently fighting Israeli forces, more than a year after the war began. Iran, the Shiite powerhouse and a main backer of Hamas, went further. It contrasted Sinwar’s death with that of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, Tehran’s archenemy. In a statement by Iran’s U.N. Mission, it said Saddam appeared disheveled out of an underground hole, dragged by U.S. forces while 'he begged them not to kill him despite being armed.' Sinwar, on the other hand, was killed in the open while 'facing the enemy,' Iran said. In a strongly worded statement, the Cairo-based Al-Azhar, the highest seat of Sunni Muslim learning in the world, blasted Israel’s portrayal of Sinwar as a terrorist. Without naming Sinwar, the statement said the 'martyrs of the resistance' died defending their land and their cause. In Israel, the army’s Arabic-speaking spokesperson, Avichay Adraee, described Sinwar as 'defeated, outcast, and persecuted.' Many celebrated the news of the killing of the architect of the Oct. 7 attack. Video posted online showed a lifeguard on a Tel Aviv beach announcing the news to applause, while Israeli media showed soldiers handing out sweets. Residents of Sderot, a town that was attacked by Hamas militants, were filmed dancing on the streets, some wrapped in Israeli flags. On Telegram, some shared pictures of a dead Sinwar, likening him to a rat. But there were also protests from families of hostages and their supporters who want Israeli leaders to use the moment to bring the hostages home. Some are energized, not demoralized Susan Abulhawa, one of the most widely read Palestinian authors, said the images released by Israel were a source of pride. Israel 'thought that publishing footage of Sinwar’s last moments would demoralize us, make us feel defeat,' she wrote on X. 'In reality, the footage immortalizes Sinwar and galvanizes all of us to have courage and resolve until the last moment.' In the Palestinian territories and Lebanon, some remembered with him with respect, while others expressed anger. 'He died as a fighter, as a martyr,' said Somaia Mohtasib, a Palestinian displaced from Gaza City. For Saleh Shonnar, a resident of north Gaza now displaced to the center, tens of thousands of Palestinians were killed. 'Hundreds, tens of senior leaders were martyred and replaced with new leaders.' In Khan Younis, Sinwar’s birthplace, mourners in a bombed-out mosque recited the funeral prayer for a Muslim when the body is missing. Israel has kept Sinwar's body. Dozens of men and children took part in the prayers. And in Wadi al-Zayne, a town in Lebanon’s Chouf region with a significant Palestinian population, Bilal Farhat said Sinwar’s death made him a symbol of heroic resistance. 'He died fighting on the front line. It gives him some sort of mystical hero aura,' Farhat said. Some Palestinians took to X to criticize Sinwar and dismiss his death in comparison to their own suffering. One speaker on a recorded discussion said there is no way of telling how he died. Another blamed him for 18 years of suffering, calling him a 'crazy man' who started a war he couldn’t win. 'If he is dear, we had many more dear ones killed,' one yelled. In the long run, the think tank’s Abu Amer said, the effect of the support and empathy for Sinwar after his death is unlikely to change the Arab public’s view of Oct. 7 and what followed. 'Those who supported Oct. 7 will continue to, and those who opposed Oct. 7 — and they are many — will keep their opinions, even if they show sympathy or admiration for him. Most Palestinians are now focused on ending the war,' he said. ___ Khaled reported from Cairo.

Romania scrambles fighter jets second time this week over breach of airspace	BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — Romania raised fighter jets early on Saturday for the second time this week after an unidentified object breached its airspace by the Black Sea, the Ministry of Defense said. The small object was detected over the Black Sea moving toward Romania, a European Union and NATO member, at around 2:30 a.m, the ministry said in a statement. Romania shares a 650-kilometer (400-mile) border with Ukraine and has previously complained over Russian drones entering its airspace as Moscow attacks Ukrainian targets along the Black Sea and Danube River. Fragments of Russian drones have also been repeatedly found on Romanian territory near the Ukrainian border. Two F-18 jets of the Spanish Air Force and two F-16s of the Romanian Air Force were dispatched but did not spot the target, which disappeared from the radar, the ministry said. Two Spanish F-18s and two Romanian F-16s also were dispatched on Thursday in a similar incident.	https://apnews.com/article/romania-fighter-jets-russia-ukraine-17a5220542937a1deb6971e110c2ad21	2024-10-19T03:31:36-07:00	
France vows support for Ukraine's plan to end Russian invasion	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot pledged his support for Ukraine’s plan for ending the 2 1/2-year war with Russia, telling reporters in Kyiv on Saturday that he will work with Ukrainian officials to secure other nations’ backing for the proposal. Unveiled by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy earlier this week, Kyiv’s so-called 'victory plan' hopes to compel Russia to end its invasion of Ukraine through negotiations. The proposal is being considered by Ukraine’s Western partners, whose help is vital for Kyiv to resist its bigger neighbor. A key element would be a formal invitation into NATO, which Western backers have been reluctant to consider until after the war ends. 'A Russian victory would be a consecration for the law of the strongest and would push the international order toward chaos,' Barrot said at a joint press conference with his Ukrainian counterpart, Andrii Sybiha. 'That is why our exchanges should allow us to make progress on President Zelenskyy’s victory plan and rally the greatest number possible of countries around it.' Since the 2022 invasion, France has been one of Ukraine’s staunchest military, diplomatic and economic supporters in Europe. It is currently training and equipping what will become a full new brigade of Ukrainian soldiers for front-line deployment. French President Emmanuel Macron has also previously pushed for a policy shift from Ukraine’s Western allies that could change the complexion of the war — allowing Kyiv to strike military bases inside Russia with sophisticated long-range weapons provided by Western partners, which include missiles from France. Long-range strikes are a key part of Zelenskyy’s five-point plan but have been met with reluctance by Kyiv’s allies so far. Barrot also announced that France would deliver the first batch of Mirage 2000 combat jets to Ukraine in the first three months of 2025, with Ukrainian pilots and mechanics also trained to fly and maintain them. 'By resisting against the invader with exceptional courage, you are not only fighting for Ukraine’s territorial integrity, but you are also holding a front line that separates Europe from Vladimir Putin’s Russia, that separates freedom from oppression,' the French minister said in Kyiv. Russia and Ukraine exchange POWs Barrot’s visit coincided with a prisoner swap between Russia and Ukraine late Friday night that included 190 POWs traded by the two sides under a deal negotiated by the United Arab Emirates. Among the 95 Ukrainians were 34 Azov fighters who defended Mariupol and the Azovstal steelworks, the fortress-like plant in the now-occupied city of Mariupol where their last-ditch stand became a symbol of resistance against Moscow’s invasion. 'Ninety-five of our people are home again. These are the warriors who defended Mariupol and ‘Azovstal,’ as well as the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kharkiv, Kyiv, Chernihiv, and Kherson regions,' Zelenskyy wrote in a post on X. The head of the Azov Brigade, Denys Prokopenko, said on Facebook that 34 Azov fighters had been returned, but that another 900 remained in Russian captivity. A well-known Ukrainian human rights activist and service member, Maksym Butkevych, was also among the 95 exchanged. His release was announced by the ZMINA Human Rights Center, the organization that he co-founded. The swap follows the repatriation of 501 dead soldiers to Ukraine Friday in what appeared to be the biggest repatriation of war dead since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. Most of the soldiers were killed in action in the eastern Donetsk region of Ukraine, mostly around the city of Avdiivka that Russian forces captured in February after a long and grueling battle, Ukraine’s Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War said in a statement. Russia also received the bodies of 89 of its soldiers, Russian lawmaker Shamsayil Saraliyev told reporters. Elsewhere, the Russian Ministry of Defense said that it shot down 16 Ukrainian drones over Russia’s Bryansk, Rostov, and Belgorod regions in the early hours of Saturday morning. Local social media channels shared images that appeared to show a blaze at a factory in the Bryansk region specializing in microelectronics. Russian authorities did not confirm the strike. ___ Associated Press writers John Leicester in Le Pecq, France, and Katie Marie Davies in Manchester, England, contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-france-pows-22dbb9037a98c3185ca3a0e3470e074a	2024-10-19T01:28:12-07:00	
Train hits and kills 2 wild elephants in Sri Lanka as 2 of its fuel-carrying tankers derail	COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) — A train carrying thousands of gallons of fuel hit a herd of wild elephants in northeast Sri Lanka, killing two of the giant mammals and injuring one other as two of its tankers got derailed, authorities said. The collision happened in the town of Minneriya — about 200 kilometers (124 miles) from the capital, Colombo — renowned for its nature park and wildlife. The train driver told The Associated Press that the herd of nearly 20 elephants suddenly tried to cross over the railway track Friday. 'There was about 10 meters (32 feet) between us. So, we couldn’t do anything. We pressed the breaks to their maximum capacity, but there was nothing much we could do. At least four elephants were knocked down.' N.W. Jayalath said. The train had eight tankers — five carrying diesel and another three petrol, each with a capacity of 50,000 liters (about 132,000 gallons), Jayalath said. Two of the petrol tankers got derailed, causing a significant leakage and severely damaging railway tracks and forcing authorities to suspend the train services on that line, he added. The train compartment harboring the conductor also got derailed. The train also had two other railway personnel besides the driver. None of the four were injured. 'This is the first time I saw this kind of incident,' V.J. Jackson, a Minneriya resident, said. 'We came here after hearing the honking of the train and the screaming of the elephants. We saw elephants lying everywhere and the train had derailed.' Hasini Sarathchandra, the publicity officer of the wildlife department said the two elephants were killed on site while the injured one was treated and released back to its herd. Minneriya National Park draws thousands of tourists each year hoping to see elephants in their wild habitats. It is part of the 'elephant corridor that connects Kaudulla and Wasgamuwa National parks' which allows for elephant sightings year-round. Though elephants are revered in the Indian Ocean island nation, they are endangered with their numbers dwindling from about 14,000 in the 19th century to 6,000 in 2011, according to the country’s first elephant census. Elephant-train collisions have gone up in recent years in Sri Lanka, with wild elephants attempting to cross over railway tracks in search of food and water. They are increasingly vulnerable because of the loss and degradation of their natural habitat and many venture closer to human settlements in search of food. Some are killed by poachers or farmers angry over damage to their crops. According to the government statistics, seven elephants have died this year after being knocked down by trains while 24 died in 2023.	https://apnews.com/article/sri-lanka-wild-elephants-train-collision-minneriya-48c7bbb66002fcee122956061f8edcfc	2024-10-19T00:41:41-07:00	
First migrants sent to Albania for processing are returned to Italy	SHENGJIN, Albania (AP) — An Italian navy ship on Saturday took back to Italy the first 12 migrants from newly opened asylum processing centers in Albania following a court decision in Rome. The court ruling on Friday represents an early stumbling block to a five-year deal between Italy and Albania for Tirana to host 3,000 migrants per month picked up by the Italian coast guard. They will be vetted for possible asylum in Italy or to be sent back to their countries. Italian Premier Minister Giorgia Meloni has hailed the deal as a new 'model' to handle illegal migration. The court in Rome rejected the detention of 12 of the migrants, arguing they cannot be sent back to their countries or origin -- Bangladesh and Egypt -- because the court did not deem them to be safe enough. The Italian navy ship took the 12 from the port of Shengjin, 66 kilometers (40 miles) northwest of the capital Tirana. After arriving there this week, the four other migrants had already been rejected by center staff, two as vulnerable after undergoing health checks and two for being minors. Each migrant’s detention must be reviewed by special migration courts in Italy under Italian law. Meloni slammed the judges following the ruling, and said that deeming countries such as Bangladesh and Egypt unsafe means that virtually all migrants would be barred from the Albania program, making it unworkable. Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi said the government would appeal the ruling. Speaking to reporters during a trip to Lebanon, Meloni said she would convene a Cabinet meeting Monday to discuss the issue. 'We’ll meet to approve some norms that will allow us to overcome this obstacle,' Meloni said. 'I believe it’s up to the government and not magistrates to establish which countries can be considered safe.' Although Bangladesh and Egypt are not at war or facing any large refugee crises, the judges in Rome said their decision was based on recent international rulings that consider discrimination or persecution in even a part of a country as grounds for such a determination. Italy has agreed to welcome those migrants who are granted asylum, while those whose applications are rejected face deportation directly from Albania. The controversial agreement to outsource the housing of asylum-seekers to a non-EU member country has been hailed by some countries that, like Italy, are experiencing a high level of migrant arrivals. The agreement was endorsed by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen as an example of 'out-of-box thinking' in tackling the issue of migration into the European Union. Human rights organizations considered it as setting a dangerous precedent. ___ Semini reported from Tirana.

Australian authorities respond to a reported bomb scare on a New Zealand flight	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Australian authorities responded on Saturday to a reported bomb scare on flight from New Zealand to Sydney. Police said there was no threat. Air New Zealand flight 247 remained on the Sydney Airport tarmac with its passengers aboard for hours due to a bomb threat, news media reported. Australian Federal Police said they had responded to an incident on board an aircraft that was en route to the airport. 'Investigations are continuing. There is no threat to the community,' a police statement said. Air New Zealand said in a statement there was a 'security incident' on the flight. 'We are working with the local authorities and following standard protocols established for such incidents. The safety and security of all passengers and crew is our utmost priority,' an airline statement said.	https://apnews.com/article/australia-new-zealand-flight-bomb-threat-e83e27e33111fee5563df073210b980f	2024-10-19T00:04:25-07:00	
Strike launched toward Israeli prime minister's house	JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel’s government said a drone was launched toward the the prime minister’s house Saturday, with no casualties. Sirens wailed Saturday morning in Israel, warning of incoming fire from Lebanon, with a drone launched toward Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s house in Caesarea, the Israeli government said. Neither he nor his wife were home and there were no casualties, said his spokesperson in a statement. The strikes into Israel come as its war with Lebanon’s Hezbollah — a Hamas ally backed by Iran — has intensified in recent weeks. Hezbollah said Friday that it planned to launch a new phase of fighting by sending more guided missiles and exploding drones into Israel. The militant group’s longtime leader, Hassan Nasrallah, was killed in an Israeli airstrike in late September, and Israel sent ground troops into Lebanon earlier in October. A standoff is also ensuing between Israel and Hamas, which it’s fighting in Gaza, with both signaling resistance to ending the war after the death of Hamas’ leader Yahya Sinwar this week. On Friday, Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said Sinwar’s death was a painful loss but noted that Hamas carried on despite the killings of other Palestinian militant leaders before him. 'Hamas is alive and will stay alive,' Khamenei said.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-news-10-18-2024-c49911f11a40b7d81b21bc8568ecfe11	2024-10-18T22:40:37-07:00	
EU candidate Moldova to hold two pivotal votes as officials denounce Russian 'hybrid attacks'	MAGDACESTI, Moldova (AP) — On a frigid evening in a village near Moldova’s capital, President Maia Sandu warned locals of Russian meddling as she seeks reelection and touted joining the European Union as the only way forward. Her message came days before key votes that could help to determine the country’s future. Sandu is seeking a second term in office in a presidential election Sunday in which she is opposed by several pro-Moscow candidates out of a total of 11. A 'yes' or 'no' referendum will also be held the same day on whether to enshrine the path toward joining the EU in the country's constitution. 'This decision will influence our lives not only for the next four years,' the pro-Western president told the crowd from an outdoor bandstand in Magdacesti, about 10 miles (16 kilometers) from the capital, Chisinau. 'This decision will influence our lives for decades to come.' A campaign flyer handed out by young supporters at the rally said that criminal groups paid 15 million euros ($16.2 million) last month to 130,000 individuals in a major vote-buying scheme 'to cause destabilization and chaos' in Moldova, a country of about 2.5 million. The purported scheme revealed on Oct. 3, which allegedly paid people through Russian banks, was linked to Ilan Shor, an exiled pro-Russia oligarch whose populist Russia-friendly Shor Party was declared unconstitutional last year and banned. It heightened concerns that Moscow was stepping up efforts to undermine the pivotal votes. Shor, who was convicted in absentia last year to 15 years in jail on fraud and money laundering in the case of $1 billion that went missing from Moldovan banks in 2014, denied allegations of illegally paying voters, saying 'the payments are legal' and cited a right to freedom of expression. Hours before Sandu’s appearance in Magdacesti on Thursday, Moldovan authorities said they foiled another plot in which more than 100 young Moldovans received training in Moscow by private military groups on how to create civil unrest, including using nonlethal weapons to create 'mass disorder' around the two votes. Some received 'more advanced training in guerrilla camps' in Serbia and Bosnia, authorities said, and four were detained for 30 days. A source close to law enforcement, who wasn't authorized to speak to the media about a sensitive national security matter, told The Associated Press that some of the young people implicated had criminal records or hailed from difficult families and were offered several thousand euros to attend. 'We expect Russian pressure to increase, not to decrease, and the closer we’ll be getting to the EU, the bigger the pressure will be from Russia,' said Stanislav Secrieru, the president’s national security adviser. 'We’re trying to find the right balance between freedoms and security.' He added that Moldovan law enforcement had strengthened in the face of 'intensive hybrid attacks' against Moldova, a former Soviet republic, since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of neighboring Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. Since then, Moldova has faced multiple crises including errant missiles landing on its territory, a severe energy crisis after Moscow dramatically reduced gas supplies, rampant inflation and recurring anti-government protests by pro-Russia parties. A pro-Western government has been in power since 2021, a year after Sandu won the presidency, and a parliamentary election will be held next year. Moldovan authorities have repeatedly said that Russia is conducting a vast 'hybrid war' against it — by funding pro-Moscow opposition groups, spreading disinformation, and meddling in local elections — to destabilize the country and try to derail its EU path. These concerns were echoed by the U.S., U.K., and Canada this summer in a joint statement, which alleged 'the Kremlin’s use of criminal groups' were trying to undermine Moldova’s democratic institutions. Russian actors, they said, were carrying out a plot to influence the outcomes of votes and 'intend to incite protests' should the outcomes prove unfavorable to Moscow. Russia has repeatedly denied that it's interfering in Moldova. In the bustling Stefan cel Mare park in central Chisinau, Ana Maria, a 30-year-old medical doctor, says the two upcoming votes will determine if Moldovans 'are all on the same page' regarding EU integration, but is also concerned about Russian influence. 'I think that most of us have some family member working in the EU, or who lives or studies there, more than in Russia,' she said. 'The Russian disinformation is rather worrying. It’s easier to maneuver people that are not well informed.' In recent weeks, large social media platforms such as Meta and Telegram announced they had removed fake accounts in Moldova that railed against the EU, Sandu, and expressed 'supportive commentary' about pro-Russia parties. The large majority of Moldovans speak Romanian as their first language, and the rest speak Russian. Relations between Chisinau and Moscow significantly soured after Moldova applied to join the 27-nation EU in the wake of the war next door, and was granted candidate status in June 2022, alongside Ukraine, and agreed in June to start membership negotiations. 'We believe that by 2030, the Republic of Moldova will be ready for accession and we will work day and night for this goal,' Sandu said in Magdacesti, 'but for that, we need the positive decision of our citizens.' The latest polls indicate that Sandu is leading the presidential race with more than 35% of the vote, while Alexandr Stoianoglo, a pro-Russian former prosecutor general, trails her at around 10%. However, if Sandu fails to win an outright majority in the first round she could face Stoianoglo in a run-off two weeks later. The EU referendum also shows a clear majority of more than 50% support the EU path but requires a one-third turnout to be valid. The polls also do not include Moldova's large diaspora, many of whom live and work in the EU. Several analysts and officials the AP spoke to in Chisinau expressed concerns that the number of voters registered nationally exceeds the latest population data, and that the discrepancy means that more votes are needed for the EU referendum to reach the threshold. Secrieru said Russian proxies could rally already established networks on the eve of the ballot urging them to boycott the EU vote. 'What they think is realistic is to depress participation in order to kill the referendum,' he said. The same source told the AP that tactics could be employed on Sunday to create chaos by disrupting voting infrastructure with tactics such as false bomb threats or cyberattacks. Iulian Groza, executive director of the Institute for European Policies and Reforms think tank, described the upcoming votes as a 'historic moment' in which turnout will be key. 'The choice is clear: either Moldova adheres and continues to advance toward the West, toward accession to the European Union, or is dragged by Russia proxies back into the hands of Russian influence,' he told the AP in his downtown Chisinau office. 'What will count very much is the ability of the citizens to mobilize … not to let others to choose their future.' Ivan Chesov, a 68-year-old retired construction engineer, said he believes that Moldova is 'closer to Europe' and that people should express their wishes by casting their ballots. 'I think there are chances for the referendum to pass,' he said, 'if people wake up and see the reality.' Back at the rally in Magdacesti as night drew in and the young and old mingled in the cold, Sandu told locals that the EU would help Moldova to develop and modernize and urged them to vote. 'We have no time to wait ... so many years have passed in which Moldova did not develop as it could have developed,' she said.	https://apnews.com/article/moldova-election-eu-referendum-russia-639974a2d3acd8d647e787ede0fcbe24	2024-10-18T22:03:58-07:00	
Belgrade's landmark Hotel Yugoslavia faces likely demolition, with many opposed	BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Belgrade’s iconic Hotel Yugoslavia, once a symbol of progress in the former socialist state of Yugoslavia that broke apart in the 1990s and a favorite gathering place for local residents as well as world leaders, now stands in eerie silence awaiting its likely demolition. The once-bustling landmark — a leading example of modernist architecture when it was built in the 1960s — has fallen into disrepair, its future clouded by debates over its historical significance and the push for advanced development. Its white facade, once polished and welcoming, is marred by crumbling concrete and graffiti. Inside, debris litters once-pristine red carpeted floors, while scattered pieces of broken furniture hint at the opulence that once filled its rooms and lobbies: Faded velvet armchairs, torn bed mattresses, sagging curtains and broken windows are all that remain of the luxury that once was. The wood-paneled presidential suite where top dignitaries would stay is now home to pigeons that fly in through the shattered glass. As the Serbian capital grapples with hectic growth and new high-rises that dot its skyline, the almost certain fate of the hotel has sparked controversy, with some seeing it as a relic worth preserving and others envisioning new possibilities rising from its ruins. In its heyday after it received its first guests in 1969, it was a five-star hotel boasting one of the biggest chandeliers in the world made of 40,000 Swarovski crystals and 5,000 bulbs. Its guest list included Queen Elizabeth II, United States Presidents Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter, astronauts including Neil Armstrong, and Belgian and Dutch royals. The hotel, with a spectacular view of the Danube River in the capital's New Belgrade district, was damaged in NATO bombing in 1999 in an armed intervention over Serbia’s bloody crackdown on Kosovo Albanian separatists. Only parts of the hotel were fully renovated, and it kept receiving guests until a few months ago, when private investors announced plans to demolish the structure and build a new one in its place. Two 150-meter (500-foot) -tall towers containing a luxury hotel, offices and private apartments will be built, according to the new owners. Asked why the landmark hotel needs to be completely destroyed instead of incorporated into the new project, Zivorad Vasic, a spokesperson for the investors, said there were several reasons. 'One is during the bombing in 1999, quite a lot of parts of the hotel were destroyed. Second, the hospitality industry completely and tremendously changed. When you look at hotels now and how they looked before, they were completely different,' he said. Architect and tourist guide Matija Zlatanovic, who often takes tourists to the hotel to explain its rich history, said the plans for the new hotel are 'quite controversial,' especially because 'there are valid concerns about the size of the buildings that are going to be erected here.' 'It follows the trend of towerization of Belgrade and the erection of enormous high rises all over,' he said. 'And we yet have to see about the impact that they’re going to have on this neighborhood.' Neighbors who face living in the future shadows of the planned skyscrapers are not happy. Some are holding weekly protests against the new project, saying they will stop the demolition with their bodies if necessary. Svetlana Gojun, one of the protesters, said Hotel Yugoslavia 'represents a huge part of our history.' 'Half the world came to this hotel, from actors, musicians, politicians, writers,' she said. 'Everyone is tied to this hotel. The whole world knows about that hotel. And now we will allow something like that to disappear?'	https://apnews.com/article/serbia-hotel-yugoslavia-demolition-belgrade-3070e34868d217d447e473da9ef5d8e7	2024-10-18T21:05:39-07:00	
Freedom of expression threatened more seriously in Gaza than in any recent conflict, UN expert says	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Freedom of expression has been threatened more seriously in Gaza than in any recent conflict, with journalists targeted in the war-torn territory and Palestinian supporters targeted in many countries, a United Nations expert said Friday. Irene Khan, the U.N. independent investigator on the right to freedom of opinion and expression, pointed to attacks on the media and the targeted killings and arbitrary detention of dozens of journalists in Gaza. 'The banning of Al Jazeera, the tightening of censorship within Israel and in the occupied territories, seem to indicate a strategy of the Israeli authorities to silence critical journalism and obstruct the documentation of possible international crimes,' she said. Khan also sharply criticized the 'discrimination and double standards' that have seen restrictions and suppression of pro-Palestinian protests and speech. She cited bans in Germany and other European countries, protests that were 'crushed harshly' on U.S. college campuses, and Palestinian national symbols and slogans prohibited and even criminalized in some countries. The U.N. special rapporteur also pointed to 'the silencing and sidelining of dissenting voices in academia and the arts,' with some of the best academic institutions in the world failing to protect all members of their community, 'whether Jewish, Palestinian, Israeli, Arab, Muslim, or otherwise.' While social media platforms have been a lifeline for communications to and from Gaza, Khan said, they have seen an upsurge in disinformation, misinformation and hate speech — with Arabs, Jews, Israelis and Palestinians all targeted online. She stressed that Israel’s military actions in Gaza and its decades of occupation of Palestinian territories are matters of public interest, scrutiny and criticism. Khan earlier presented her report on 'the global crisis of freedom of expression arising from the conflict in Gaza' to the General Assembly’s human rights committee. She said Israel responded to it, explained the country’s laws, and 'took the position that the conflict in Gaza was not really of global significance, and my mandate should not engage with it.' Israel’s U.N. mission declined to comment on her press briefing. The surprise attacks in southern Israel led by Hamas militants who controlled Gaza on Oct. 7, 2023, killed about 1,200 people, mainly civilians, and led to the abduction of about 250 others, around 100 of whom are still hostages. Israel’s military offensive in retaliation has killed more than 42,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which doesn’t distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority were women and children. Khan, a former secretary-general of Amnesty International, stressed that 'no conflict in recent times has threatened freedom of expression so seriously or so far beyond its borders than Gaza.' She said attacks on the media 'are an attack on the right to information of people around the world who want to know what is happening there.' Khan said she has called on the U.N. General Assembly and Security Council to take measures to strengthen the protection of journalists 'as essential civilian workers.' ' Journalism should be seen as essential as humanitarian work,' she said. The information industry has changed, Khan said, and the issue of access to conflict situations by international media representatives — who have been banned from Gaza by Israel — must also be affirmed. 'It has to be clarified that it is not okay to just deny access to international media,' she said. Without naming any countries, Khan asked why nations that pride themselves as champions of the media have been silent in the face of unprecedented attacks on journalists in Gaza and the West Bank. 'My main message is that what is happening in Gaza is sending signals around the world that it is okay to do these things because it’s happening in Gaza and Israel is enjoying absolute impunity — and others around the world will believe that there will be absolute impunity, too,' Khan said.	https://apnews.com/article/un-freedom-expression-attacks-journalists-palestinians-israel-4ee19abb793df9b9fcce4364df7f2efe	2024-10-18T20:46:05-07:00	
Cher, Foreigner, Mary J. Blige, Dionne Warwick inducted into Rock & Roll Hall of Fame	CLEVELAND (AP) — Pure pop kicked off the inductions at the the Rock &amp; Roll Hall Fame induction ceremony on Saturday as Dua Lipa and Cher sang 'Believe' before ceding the stage to a medley of rump shakers by funk masters Kool &amp; the Gang, rock classics by Foreigner and Peter Frampton, and a powerhouse performance by gospel icon Dionne Warwick, bringing the house down at 83. The inductees this year also included: Mary J. Blige, A Tribe Called Quest, Ozzy Osbourne, Dave Matthews Band and posthumous recognition for Jimmy Buffett, MC5, Alexis Korner, John Mayall, Norman Whitfield and Big Mama Thornton. 'Where do I even begin? Cher is not one person,' Zendaya said when inducting Cher. 'Her name is just as legendary as her legacy.' Zendaya noted that Cher, 78, is the only woman to have a No. 1 hit on a Billboard chart in each of the past seven decades. 'Cher has got the goods,' Zendaya said before the singer performed a rocking version of 'If I Could Turn Back Time.' In her speech, Cher said she was inspired by Cinderella and thanked her mother for instilling in her to always get back up after defeat. 'The one thing I got from my mom is to never give up,' she said. 'I never give up. I'm talking to the women — down and out, we keep going.' Chuck D inducted Kool &amp; the Gang, saying 'This is a long-due celebration.' The band had 12 Top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 including the 1980 chart-topper 'Celebration' as well as 'Cherish,' 'Get Down On It,' 'Jungle Boogie,' 'Ladies Night' and 'Joanna.' They’ve been eligible for the hall since 1994. The Roots helped the band do a medley of hits that got the crowd grooving led by Robert 'Kool' Bell — bass guitarist, co-founder and last original member — and longtime singer James 'JT' Taylor. Confetti shot into the arena and Taylor asked the crowd to use their cellphone lights as he read off the names of 10 members who were critical to the band's success. Dr Dre inducted Blige, who is credited with creating a completely new category of music — hip-hop soul. The nine-time Grammy-winner’s best-known song is 'Family Affair″ from her triple-platinum 2001 album 'No More Drama.' 'When you listen to Mary, you understand you’re not alone in heartbreak,' Dre said. Blige, wearing shiny black hat, a sparkly dress and long black gloves and boots, sang a mix of her hits, including 'Love No Limit,' 'Be Happy' and 'Family Affair.' At the end of her set, a dancer brought up a cloak to wrap around her, in an echo of James Brown. She thanked her fans, her mom — a single mother raising children in the projects — and Method Man and Dr. Dre, who helped her earn a Grammy and an Emmy. 'Move with grace. Trust the journey,' she advised. 'You are worthy.' Warwick arrived at the ceremony only a few days after attending a memorial to her longtime friend and collaborator, Cissy Houston, in Newark, New Jersey. Teyana Taylor called her 'truly one of a kind' as well as telling off the teleprompter operator for not putting 'Ms.' before her name. Jennifer Hudson sang 'I’ll Never Love This Way Again' and was joined by Warwick, who also sang 'Walk On By.' Warwick said this year was the third time she was nominated for the Hall. 'I am so pleased to be here,' she said. 'I'm just going to say this and get off the stage: Thank you, thank you, thank you.' Dave Chappelle helped induct A Tribe Called Quest — Q-Tip, Jarobi, Ali Shaheed Muhammad and the late Phife Dawg — the lone hip-hop group to make the cut this year. Chappelle said the group incorporated 'jazz and soul in a way hip-hop had never seen' and they also proved you could be 'cool and not necessarily gangster.' Queen Latifah, Busta Rhymes, Common, The Roots and De La Soul were on hand to perform a medley of Tribe hits, including 'Bonita Applebum,' 'Scenario' and 'Can I Kick It?' Sammy Hagar introduced Foreigner, and thanked their fans for their tenacity to demand inclusion. The English-American rockers — with hits like 'Cold as Ice,' and 'Waiting for a Girl Like You' — topped the charts in the 1970s and ’80s but never made it into the Hall — much less a ballot — until last year, despite being eligible for more than 20 years. Hagar noted that Foreigner currently tours without any original members. 'That's how good the songs are,' he said. 'Who deserves this more than Foreigner?' Demi Lovato and Slash joined the touring Foreigner for 'Feels Like the First Time' and Hagar then took lead for 'Hot Blooded.' Kelly Clarkson thrilled with a powerful 'I Want to Know What Love Is' but the arena erupted when original singer Lou Gramm joined her. Gramm thanked guitarist Mick Jones, sidelined in New York by Parkinson’s disease. Saturday's induction ceremony was held at the Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse in Cleveland, where the Hall has promised to return to every few years. A TV special with performance highlights will air on ABC on Jan. 1. Roger Daltrey of The Who inducted Frampton. 'It’s about bloody time!' he said. 'Peter has had the most amazing career of all time. It’s probably easier to name the people he hasn’t worked with than the people he has,' Daltrey said. Frampton earned his way into the Hall in large part on the strength of his 1976 live double album 'Frampton Comes Alive!,' buoyed by the hit songs 'Show Me the Way' and ″Baby, I Love Your Way.' Daltrey noted Frampton has always played with a wide smile. A fittingly grinning Frampton — who played at last year's ceremony to honor Sheryl Crow — brought on Keith Urban to trade licks on 'Do You Feel Like I Do' and showed why he is considered one of rock's great guitarists. He hooked up his famous talk box effect and the crowd roared. 'I really am a lucky guy to have this amazing career,' he said, thanking David Bowie for resurrecting his professional life after it had spun out. Dave Matthews — before his band's inducement — helped honor Buffett with an acoustic version of the late singer-songwriter’s 'A Pirate Looks at Forty.' James Taylor then came out to call Buffett — who popularized beach bum soft rock with the escapist song 'Margaritaville' — 'larger-than-life but at the same time right-sized and always authentic.' Taylor, Kenny Chesney and Mac McAnally then performed Buffett's 'Come Monday.' Artists must have released their first commercial recording at least 25 years before they’re eligible for induction. Nominees were voted on by more than 1,000 artists, historians and music industry professionals. John Sykes, president of entertainment enterprises at iHeartMedia and the chairman of the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame Foundation, said before the ceremony that he and the Hall are trying to bring the inductions back to rock's roots, not expand the category. 'What I’m trying to do is bring over the aperture back up to where it was in the late '50s, where you had Brenda Lee and Hank Williams right next to Fats Domino, Elvis Presley, the Beatles. It was, at that time, this gumbo of artists. It kind of narrowed down over the years. All I can do is bring it back to its original roots.'	https://apnews.com/article/rock-roll-hall-fame-2024-ceremony-631f31bd3ef6d72bd58c532ed380c031	2024-10-18T19:07:49-07:00	
Israel unearths Hezbollah's web of tunnels in southern Lebanon	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli forces have spent much of the past year destroying Hamas’ vast underground network in Gaza. They are now focused on dismantling tunnels and other hideouts belonging to Hezbollah militants in southern Lebanon. Scarred by Hamas’ deadly raid into Israel last year that sparked the war in Gaza, Israel says it aims to prevent a similar incursion across its northern border from ever getting off the ground. The Israeli military has combed through the dense brush of southern Lebanon for the past two weeks, uncovering what it says are Hezbollah’s deep attack capabilities — highlighted by a tunnel system equipped with weapons caches and rocket launchers that Israel says pose a direct threat to nearby communities. Israel’s war against the Iran-backed militant group stretches far inside Lebanon, and its airstrikes in recent weeks have killed more than 1,700 people, about a quarter of whom were women and children, according to local health authorities. But its ground campaign has centered on a narrow patch of land just along the border, where Hezbollah has had a longstanding presence. Hezbollah has deep ties to southern Lebanon Hezbollah, which has called for Israel’s destruction, is the Arab world’s most significant paramilitary force. It began firing rockets into Israel a day after Hamas' attack. After nearly a year of tit-for-tat fighting with Hezbollah, Israel launched its ground invasion into southern Lebanon on Oct. 1 and has since sent thousands of troops into the rugged terrain. Even as it continues to bolster its forces, Israel says its invasion consists of 'limited, localized and targeted ground raids' that are meant to destroy Hezbollah infrastructure so that tens of thousands of displaced Israelis can return home. The fighting also has uprooted more than 1 million Lebanese in the past month. Many residents of southern Lebanon are supporters of the group and benefit from its social outreach. Though most fled the area months ago, they widely see the heavily armed Hezbollah as their defender, especially as the U.S.-backed Lebanese army does not have suitable weapons to protect them from any Israeli incursion. That broad support has allowed Hezbollah to establish 'a military infrastructure for itself' within the villages, said Eva J. Koulouriotis, a political analyst specialized in the Middle East and Islamic militant groups. The Israeli military says it has found weapons within homes and buildings in the villages. Hezbollah built a network of tunnels in multiple areas of Lebanon With Israel’s air power far outstripping Hezbollah’s defenses, the militant group has turned to underground tunnels as a way to elude Israeli drones and jets. Experts say Hezbollah's tunnels are not limited to the south. 'It’s a land of tunnels,' said Tal Beeri, who studies Hezbollah as director of research at The Alma Research and Education Center, a think tank with a focus on northern Israel’s security. Koulouriotis said tunnels stretch under the southern suburbs of Beirut, where Hezbollah's command and control are located and where it keeps a stockpile of strategic missiles. She said the group also maintains tunnels along the border with Syria, which it uses to smuggle weapons and other supplies from Iran into Lebanon. Southern Lebanon is where Hezbollah maintains tunnels to store missiles — and from where it can launch them, Koulouriotis said. Some of the more than 50 Israelis killed by Hezbollah over the past year were hit by anti-tank missiles. In contrast to the tunnels dug out by Hamas in the sandy coastal terrain of Gaza, Hezbollah's tunnels in southern Lebanon were carved into solid rock, a feat that likely required time, money, machinery and expertise. An Israeli military official said that using prior intelligence, Israel had found 'hundreds and hundreds and hundreds' of underground positions, many of which could hold about ten fighters and were stocked with rations. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with military rules, said troops were blowing up the tunnels found or using cement to make them unusable. The group used tunnels during the monthlong 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war, but the network has been expanded since, even as a United Nations cease-fire resolution compelled Lebanese and U.N. forces to keep Hezbollah fighters out of the south. In mid-August, Hezbollah released a video showing what appeared to be a cavernous underground tunnel large enough for trucks loaded with missiles to drive through. Hezbollah operatives were also seen riding motorcycles inside the illuminated tunnel, named Imad-4 after the group’s late military commander, Imad Mughniyeh, who was killed in Syria in 2008 in an explosion blamed on Israel. Hezbollah's tunnels could be hindering Israel's mission Israeli troops are pushing through southern Lebanon using tanks and engineering equipment, and air and ground forces have struck thousands of targets in the area since the invasion began. The military recently said it found one cross-border tunnel that stretched just a few meters into Israel but did not have an opening. Israel also exposed a tunnel shaft that was located about 100 meters (yards) from a U.N. peacekeepers ’ post, although it wasn't clear what the precise purpose of that tunnel was. Israel says the tunnels are stocked with supplies and weapons and are outfitted with lighting, ventilation and sometimes plumbing, indicating they could be used for long stays. It says it has arrested several Hezbollah fighters hiding inside, including three on Tuesday who were said to have been found armed. The Israeli military official said many Hezbollah fighters appear to have withdrawn from the area. Lebanese military expert, Naji Malaeb, a retired brigadier general, said he assessed that Hezbollah’s tunnels were preventing Israel from making major gains. He compared that achievement to the war in Gaza, where Hamas has used its tunnels to bedevil Israeli forces and stage insurgency-like attacks. Israeli authorities insist the mission in Lebanon is succeeding. It says it has killed hundreds of Hezbollah fighters since the ground operation in Lebanon began, though at least 15 Israeli soldiers have been killed during that time. Israel has encountered Hezbollah’s tunnels before. In 2018, Israel launched an operation to destroy what is said were attack tunnels that crossed into Israeli territory. Beeri said that six tunnels were discovered, including one that was 1 kilometer (1,000 yards) long and 80 meters (87 yards) deep, crossing some 50 meters (yards) into Israel. Israel believes Hezbollah was planning an Oct. 7-style invasion For Israel, the tunnels are evidence that Hezbollah planned what Israel says would be a bloody offensive against communities in the north. 'Hezbollah has openly declared that it plans to carry out its own Oct. 7 massacre on Israel’s northern border, on an even larger scale,' Israeli military spokesman Rear. Adm. Daniel Hagari said the day troops entered Lebanon. Israel has not released evidence that any such attack was imminent but has expressed concern that one might be launched once residents return. Former Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed by Israel last month while in an underground bunker, had signaled in speeches that Hezbollah could launch an attack on northern Israel. In May 2023, just months before Hamas’ attack, Hezbollah staged a simulation of an incursion into northern Israel with rifle-toting militants on motorcycles bursting through a mock border fence bedecked with Israeli flags. Hezbollah officials have at times framed calls for an attack against Israel as a defensive measure that would be taken in times of war. ___ Mroue reported from Beirut.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-ground-invasion-tunnels-2f22d95269bdf3b5fa1304816f2fee81	2024-10-18T19:01:56-07:00	
This is the beginning': 91-year-old sister of longest death row inmate sees hope in his acquittal	HAMAMATSU, Japan (AP) — Hideko Hakamada, 91, spent much of her life working to free her brother from nearly a half-century on death row. Now that he has been acquitted she feels that the siblings are beginning a new chapter of their lives. She backed her brother, Iwao Hakamada, the world’s longest-serving death row inmate, through decades of frustrating, at times apparently hopeless, legal wrangling as his mental condition worsened. 'No matter what people said about me, I lived my own life and appreciated my freedom. I did not belittle myself as the sister of a death row inmate. I lived without shame,' she told The Associated Press in an exclusive interview at her home in the central Japanese city of Hamamatsu. 'My little brother only happened to be a death row inmate.' While working as an accountant to support herself, she helped cover her brother’s legal costs, made regular long trips to Tokyo to see him on death row and helped shape public opinion in his favor. It wasn’t easy, and there were times she felt helpless. 'I was desperately working to win him a retrial, because that was the only way to save his life,' she said. But sometimes she felt 'at a loss and even unsure who I should be fighting against. … It was like I was fighting against an invisible power.' To maintain a sense of herself, outside of her brother's legal fight, she invested her savings and took out loans to have a building constructed. She now rents out apartments in the building, where the siblings live. Iwao Hakamada, a former boxer, was acquitted in September by the Shizuoka District Court, which said police and prosecutors had collaborated to fabricate and plant evidence against him, and forced him to confess with violent, hourslong, closed interrogations. Earlier in the week, he received in the mail his voting ticket for Oct. 27 parliamentary elections, a verification his civil rights are being restored. Though he was freed from his solitary death row cell after a 2014 court order for a retrial, his conviction was not cleared and his rights were not fully restored until the recent decision. Hideko Hakamada said she is 'filled with happiness' over the acquittal, and that being able to vote 'means he has finally been allowed back into society.' 'I will definitely go vote with him. It doesn’t matter which candidate' he votes for, she said. 'To me what’s important is that he casts a vote.' Her brother's long death row confinement took a toll on his mental health. He often drifts between reality and his imagination. He understands his acquittal but doesn’t seem to be fully convinced, she said. Because of his difficulty carrying on a conversation and to avoid stress, Iwao Hakamada could not speak with the AP and left while his sister was interviewed. Volunteers took him on his daily ride and a brief walk. His supporters say he thinks he is going out 'patrolling' as a guardian for the neighborhood. He was convicted of murder in the 1966 killing of an executive at a miso bean paste company and three of his family members in Hamamatsu. He was sentenced to death in a 1968 district court ruling, but was not executed because of the lengthy appeal and retrial process in Japan’s labyrinth-like criminal justice system. It took 27 years for the Supreme Court to deny his first appeal for a retrial. His second appeal for a retrial was filed in 2008 by his sister, and that request was granted in 2014. Hideko Hakamada said her brother’s training as a professional boxer helped him survive. She maintained a rock-solid trust in her brother, who was the closest to her among their six siblings. For his first few years in prison, her brother wrote to his mother every day, repeating that he was innocent, asking about his mother’s health and expressing optimism about his fate. 'I am innocent,' he wrote in a letter to his mother while on trial in 1967. After the top court finalized his death penalty in 1976, Hideko Hakamada noticed changes in her brother. He expressed fear and anger at being falsely accused. 'When I go to sleep in a soundless solitary cell every night, I sometimes cannot help cursing God. I have not done anything wrong,' he wrote to his family. 'What a cold-blooded act to inflict such cruelty on me.' The only way for her to make sure he was alive was to go to visit him in person at the Tokyo Detention House. She could only see him for up to 30 minutes per visit. She also arranged care packages of fruit and sweets. There were times he refused to meet, presumably because of the deterioration of his mental health. Executions are carried out in secrecy in Japan, and prisoners are not informed of their fate until the morning they are hanged. In 2007, Japan began disclosing the names of those executed and some details of their crimes, but disclosures are still limited. Japan and the United States are the only two countries in the Group of Seven advanced nations that have capital punishment. Hakamada was the world’s longest-serving death row prisoner and only the fifth death row inmate to be acquitted in a retrial in postwar Japan, where prosecutors have near-perfect conviction rates and retrials are extremely rare. Hideko Hakamada wants that changed, based on the lessons learned from her brother’s case, which has raised criticism about prosecutorial actions. She rarely complained about her ordeal or the harsh public comments she faced or her fear that her brother would be executed despite her belief that he was wrongfully accused. She has been praised for her positive attitude and strength. But, she says, 'It is Iwao who deserves praise for surviving, for walking out of confinement after more than 50 years.' As her brother’s legal fight dragged on, she decided to build a home so she could feel a sense of achievement for herself. 'That became something to strive for,' she said. To stay fit enough for her regular trips from Hamamatsu to Tokyo to visit her brother, she started exercising every morning, a mix of stretching and gymnastic exercises. She still keeps up with her morning routine. 'I’m 91, but age has nothing on me. People say ordinary 91-year-olds live more quietly, but that's not what I’m doing. I want to do everything I can while I’m still in good health,' she said. 'I’m not done yet,' she said, with a laugh. 'This is the beginning.'	https://apnews.com/article/japan-death-row-inmate-sister-hideko-hakamada-50c65d210df27b91e2b95d0c9bff39c9	2024-10-18T17:30:26-07:00	
North Korea claims it discovered the remains of a South Korean drone in its capital	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea said Saturday it found the remains of a South Korean drone during a search in its capital, Pyongyang, claiming the drone proved the South’s military was behind the alleged drone infiltrations over the city’s skies earlier in the month. The North’s official Korean Central News Agency released photos showing a seemingly damaged aircraft with wide, V-shaped wings and winglets. It said a joint investigation by North Korea’s military and state security agencies concluded that the aircraft, which it said was found on Oct. 13, was the same type of drone that appeared in a South Korean military parade earlier in October. North Korea accused South Korea of flying drones over the night skies of Pyongyang three different times this month to drop anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets. It threatened to respond with force if such flights occur again. The aircraft allegedly found in Pyongyang was likely one of the drones that were used to drop leaflets, North Korea’s Defense Ministry said, but further examinations were needed to verify that. Should South Korea deny that the aircraft was used to drop leaflets, that would only confess to a separate infiltration of North Korea’s airspace by the South’s military, the ministry said. If North Korea confirms another violation of its territorial ground, airspace and waters by the South’s military, that will be regarded as a 'declaration of war and an immediate retaliatory attack will be launched,' the ministry added. South Korea’s military didn’t immediately respond to North Korea’s report about the alleged drone discovery. South Korea’s defense minister initially made a vague denial after the North's Oct. 11 accusation that the South sent drones over Pyongyang. The South’s military adjusted its response hours later, saying it couldn’t confirm whether or not the North’s claims were true. Tensions on the Korean Peninsula are now at their worst in years as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ramps up his weapons tests and threats, and expands military cooperation with Russia, with South Korea claiming the North dispatched troops to support Russia’s war against Ukraine. The animosity has been exacerbated by Cold War-style psychological warfare campaigns between the Koreas in recent months. Since May, North Korea has sent thousands of balloons carrying paper waste, plastic and other trash to drop on the South. The South’s military has responded by using loudspeakers at the border to broadcast propaganda and K-pop to North Korea. North Korea is extremely sensitive to any outside criticism of Kim’s authoritarian government and his family’s dynastic rule.	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-south-drones-pyongyang-leaflets-c4e618792ee487715098c7aa271c4b34	2024-10-18T15:57:35-07:00	
Japan's ruling party headquarters is attacked with firebombs and suspect is arrested	TOKYO (AP) — A man threw several firebombs into the headquarters of Japan’s ruling party in Tokyo Saturday, then crashed his car into the fencing of the prime minister's residence, Tokyo police said. There were no reports of injuries. The man, identified by police as Atsunobu Usuda, 49, was arrested on the spot on charges of obstructing the performance of official duties, although additional charges can be added later. Although the motive for the attack was not immediately clear, Japanese media reports said social media posts believed to be Usuda's showed him complaining about the sums of money required to run for office under Japanese law, implying Usuda had political ambitions. The media reports also quoted unidentified sources as saying Usuda had taken part in protests against nuclear plants. Usuda was not immediately available for comment. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party is increasingly unpopular with the public due to a ballooning money scandal involving dubious funding and suspected tax evasion. The party declined to comment on Saturday’s attack, referring all queries to the police. Voting for the lower house of Parliament is set for Oct. 27. Some tarnished politicians lost the official backing of the ruling party but are running as independents. The party recently chose a new leader, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, hoping to present a new image. But polls show its popularity plummeting, although it’s still unclear whether they will lose their majority grip on the lower house in the upcoming election given the splintered opposition. Some candidates have been heckled, which is relatively rare in Japanese culture. The Liberal Democrats have ruled Japan almost continuously over recent decades. They are credited with leading Japan as it became an economic powerhouse from the devastation of World War II. Then-Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was assassinated in 2022, while making a speech for a ruling party candidate during a parliamentary election. The killer used a handmade firearm, saying he resented Abe because his mother gave all the family money to the Unification Church, and he saw Abe as affiliated with that church. Such ties are still ongoing with some ruling party politicians. ___ Yuri Kageyama is on X: https://x.com/yurikageyama	https://apnews.com/article/japan-crime-elections-politics-ldp-491eb0635a348793e679212d2dbb40cf	2024-10-18T14:41:25-07:00

UN expands arms embargo on Haiti to all types of arms and ammunition	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The U.N. Security Council voted unanimously Friday to expand the arms embargo in Haiti to all types of weapons and ammunition, expressing grave concern at the extremely high levels of gang violence and criminal activities in the impoverished Caribbean nation. The resolution authorizes the 193 U.N. member nations to take 'appropriate steps to prevent the illicit trafficking and diversion of arms and related materiel in Haiti.' U.N. experts have said increasingly sophisticated weapons that end up in the hands of gang members and criminals are being trafficked from the U.S., especially from Florida. The resolution also extends a travel ban and asset freeze on individuals on the U.N. sanctions blacklist for a year. In late September, the council committee monitoring sanctions on Haiti added two people to the list, which included five gang leaders. One was Elan Luckson, leader of the Gran Grif gang, which killed at least 115 people in the town of Pont-Sondé in the Artibonite region next to the capital in early October in one of the biggest massacres in Haiti in recent history. The other was Victor Prophane, a former member of the Haitian parliament accused of being involved in arms trafficking. The power of gangs in Haiti has grown since the 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse, and they are now estimated to control up to 80% of the capital, Port-au-Prince. They also have moved into surrounding areas. The surge in killings, rapes and kidnappings has led to a violent uprising by civilian vigilante groups. The Security Council voted unanimously in early October to extend the mandate of the Kenya-led multinational force trying to help the Haitian National Police quell the gangs. The leaders of Kenya and Haiti last week urged international partners to honor their commitment to the U.N.-backed force in Haiti, saying the mission needs more resources and that its budget will run out in March 2025. Kenyan President William Ruto, who met with Haiti Prime Minister Garry Conille in Nairobi a week ago, said Kenya would deploy 600 additional officers next month to join the 400 officers already in the country. Nearly two dozen police officers and soldiers from Jamaica are also in Haiti, but the numbers fall significantly short of the 2,500 pledged by various countries, including Chad, Benin, Bangladesh and Barbados, for the mission. The council resolution adopted Friday, co-sponsored by Ecuador and the United States, also encourages the Haitian government to reinforce the management of police weapons, ammunition as well as seized arms and 'to strengthen border and customs control to curb illicit trafficking and diversion.' It extends the panel of experts monitoring the implementation of sanctions for 13 months. Ecuador’s political coordinator, Irina Barba Bustos, told the council after the vote that sanctions are part of the comprehensive response that is essential to address the crisis in Haiti and promote a political solution and a peaceful and prosperous future for its people. The arms embargo previously applied to 'small arms, light weapons, and ammunition.' The resolution expands it to include 'arms and related materiel of all types.' Bustos said the expansion of the arms embargo 'bolsters our efforts to combat transnational organized crime, which uses all forms of violence against the civilian population, particularly against women.'	https://apnews.com/article/haiti-gangs-sanctions-arms-embargo-un-a68d75f117e803372189a44e9f8eec37	2024-10-18T13:25:12-07:00	
What's next for Hamas after its leader Yahya Sinwar's death?	BEIRUT (AP) — The killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar by Israeli forces in Gaza this week leaves the Palestinian militant group considering new leadership for the second time in less than three months. Will Hamas now turn away from its hard-line wing or will it double down, and what will it mean for the group’s future and for the revival of cease-fire and hostage exchange negotiations between Hamas and Israel? Sinwar replaced Hamas' previous leader, Ismail Haniyeh, after Haniyeh was killed in July in a blast in Iran that was widely blamed on Israel. As an architect of the Oct. 7, 2023, attack in southern Israel that sparked the war in Gaza, Sinwar was a defiant choice at a time when some expected the militant group to take a more conciliatory approach and seek to end the conflict. Sinwar’s killing appeared to be a chance front-line encounter with Israeli troops on Wednesday. Sinwar's death has little immediate impact on Hamas Killing Sinwar marked a major symbolic victory for Israel in its yearlong war against Hamas in Gaza. But it has also allowed Hamas to claim him as a hero who was killed in the battlefield, not hiding in a tunnel. While the group is on the defensive and has been largely forced underground in Gaza, it continues to fight Israeli forces in the enclave and to exert political influence. Bassem Naim, a Qatar-based member of the group's political bureau, said in a statement that Israel had killed other Hamas leaders, including its founding leader, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, and his successor, Abdel Aziz Rantisi, who were killed by airstrikes in 2004. 'Hamas each time became stronger and more popular, and these leaders became an icon for future generations,' he said. The impact of Sinwar's death on military operations in Gaza remains to be seen. But Sadeq Abu Amer, head of the Turkey-based think tank Palestinian Dialogue Group, said that 'there will be no significant impact on the political structure of Hamas.' When Sinwar was appointed, 'the situation was basically arranged so that Hamas could manage its political affairs and manage the organization independently of Sinwar' because of the difficulties of communication between Sinwar and Hamas' political leaders outside of Gaza, he said. Most matters were managed by 'collective leadership' between the head of the group’s Shura Council and officials in charge of the West Bank, Gaza and regions abroad, he said. The notable exception: Sinwar controlled all matters related to Israeli hostages in Gaza. The search for a replacement Sinwar’s term was a temporary one and would have expired in the second half of 2025. 'Hamas will not move urgently at the present time to choose a head of the political bureau,' Thabet al-Amour, a political analyst in Gaza, said. He noted that Khalil al-Hayya, Sinwar’s deputy based in Qatar, was already managing executive affairs and can continue to do so. Abu Amer agreed that Hamas might opt to keep running with the current 'formula of collective leadership.' Another possibility, he said would be the election of one of the three regional leaders: al-Hayya, who is in charge of Gaza; Zaher Jibril, in charge of the West Bank; or Khaled Mashaal, in charge of areas outside of the Palestinian territories. The group also might select a leader without publicly announcing the name 'for security reasons,' he said. Who are the contenders? If Hamas names a replacement for Sinwar, Khaled Mashaal and Khalil al-Hayya, both members of Hamas' political leadership based in Qatar, are widely considered the most likely contenders. Al-Hayya had served as Sinwar’s deputy and as the head of the group’s delegation in cease-fire negotiations, both in the current war and during a previous conflict in 2014. He is a longtime official with the group and survived an Israeli airstrike that hit his home in Gaza in 2007, killing several of his family members. Al-Hayya is seen as close to Iran, but as less of a hard-liner than Sinwar. He was close to Haniyeh. In an interview with The Associated Press in April, al-Hayya said Hamas was willing to agree to truce of at least five years with Israel and that if an independent Palestinian state were created along 1967 borders, the group would dissolve its military wing and become a purely political party. Mashaal, who served as the group's political leader from 1996 to 2017, is seen as a relatively moderate figure. He has good relations with Turkey and Qatar, although his relations with Iran, Syria and Hezbollah have been troubled due to his support for the Syrian opposition in the country's 2011 civil war. Moussa Abu Marzouk, a founding member of Hamas and the first head of its political bureau, is another potential candidate who is seen as a moderate. Some have suggested that Sinwar’s brother, Mohammed, a key military figure in Gaza, could replace him — if he is still alive. Al-Amour downplayed that possibility. 'Mohammed Sinwar is the head of the field battle, but he will not be Sinwar’s heir as head of the political bureau,' he said. Rather, al-Amour said the death of Sinwar, 'one of the most prominent hawks within the movement,' is likely to lead to 'the advancement of a trend or direction that can be described as doves' via the group’s leadership abroad. Cease-fire negotiations In the first public statement by a Hamas official after Sinwar's death, al-Hayya appeared to take a hard line on negotiations for a cease-fire deal that would see the release of some 100 Israeli hostages captured in the Oct. 7 attack that sparked the war and who are believed to be held in Gaza. There will be no hostage release without 'the end of the aggression on Gaza and the withdrawal (of Israeli forces) from Gaza,' al-Hayya said. But some believe that the group may now moderate its stance. In particular, Mashaal 'shows more flexibility when it comes to collaborating with the Qataris and Egyptians to reach cease-fire in Gaza, which would also have a positive impact on the situation in Lebanon,' Saad Abdullah Al-Hamid, a Saudi political analyst, said. But Sinwar's death could leave some 'practical difficulties in completing a prisoner exchange,' Abu Amer said. The Gaza-based leader was 'the only one in the Hamas leadership who held the secrets of this file,' he said, including the location of all the hostages. ——— Associated Press staff writer Fatma Khaled in Cairo contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/hamas-israel-sinwar-khalil-hayya-khaled-mashaal-a1c44df5cdabf0cf6459db9ea6eaa9b8	2024-10-18T10:30:26-07:00	
Cuba’s electrical grid goes offline after one of the island's major power plant fails	HAVANA (AP) — Cuba’s electrical grid went offline Friday after one of the island’s major power plants failed, the energy ministry said. The announcement came hours after the government announced that one of the nation’s main thermoelectric plants, La Antonio Guiteras, had ceased operations at about 11 a.m. local time, with authorities saying it was only offline temporarily. Hours earlier, Prime Minister Manuel Marrero had sought to assauge concerned citizens about the blackout that began Thursday evening. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below. HAVANA (AP) — A massive outage left millions of Cubans without power and prompted the government Friday to implement emergency measures to slash demand, including suspending classes, shutting down some state-owned workplaces and canceling non-essential services. Cuban officials said that the blackout, which started late Thursday, saw 1.64 gigawatts go offline during peak hours in the early evening, about half the total demand at the time. 'The situation has worsened in recent days,' Prime Minister Manuel Marrero said in a special address on national television in the early hours of Friday. 'We must be fully transparent ... we have been halting economic activities to ensure energy for the population.' During his address, Marrero was accompanied by Alfredo López, the chief of UNE, said the outage stemmed from increased demand from small- and medium-sized companies and residences’ air conditioners, as well as breakdowns in old thermoelectric plants that haven’t been properly maintained and the lack of fuel to operate some facilities. Changes to electricity rates for small- and medium-sized companies, which have proliferated since they were first authorized by the communist government in 2021, are also being considered, Marrero said. Marrero sought to placate people’s concerns about the outage, citing an expected influx of fuel supply from Cuba's state-owned oil company. Even in a country accustomed to frequent outages amid a deepening economic crisis, the size of Thursday night’s blackout left millions of Cubans on edge. Residents shut their doors and windows they typically leave open at night, and candles or lanterns were visible inside their homes. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/cuba-power-outage-blackout-4ae305120a99fec17c79e7621e8dac4b	2024-10-18T09:52:25-07:00

One of the largest solar projects in the US opens in Texas, backed by Google	One of the largest solar projects in the U.S. opened in Texas on Friday, backed by what Google said is the largest solar electricity purchase it has ever made. Google executive Ben Sloss said at the ribbon cutting, about two hours south of Dallas, that the corporation has a responsibility to bring renewable, carbon-free electricity online at the same time it opens operations that will use that power. Google expects to spend $16 billion through 2040 globally to purchase clean energy, he said. U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, who attended, said the solar project is a posterchild for the administration's efforts to incentivize manufacturers and developers to locate energy projects in the U.S. 'Sometimes when you are in the middle of history, it’s hard to tell, because you are in the middle of it,' she said. 'But I'm telling you right now that we are in the middle of history being made.' SB Energy built three solar farms side by side, the 'Orion Solar Belt,' in Buckholts, Texas. Combined, they will be able to provide 875 megawatts of clean energy. That is nearly the size of a typical nuclear facility. In total, Google has contracted with clean energy developers to bring more than 2,800 megawatts of new wind and solar projects to the state, which it says exceeds the amount of power required for its operations there. Google, Amazon and Microsoft have all recently announced investments in nuclear energy to power data centers, too, as the tech giants seek new sources of carbon-free electricity to meet surging demand from data centers and artificial intelligence. Google has a commitment to get all of its electricity without contributing to climate change, regardless of time of day or whether the sun is up, but neither it nor other large companies are meeting those commitments with the rise of artificial intelligence. The International Energy Agency forecasts that data centers’ total electricity consumption could reach more than 1,000 terawatt-hours in 2026, more than doubling from 2022. Estimates suggest one terawatt-hour can power 70,000 homes for a year. The demand for power is also growing globally as buildings and vehicles electrify. People used more electricity than ever last year, placing strain on electric grids around the world. In August, Google said it planned to invest more than $1 billion in Texas this year to support its cloud and data center infrastructure. Google will use about 85% of the project’s solar power for data centers in Ellis County and for cloud computing in the Dallas region. In Ellis County, Google operates a data center campus in Midlothian and is building out a new campus in Red Oak. The rest of the solar power will go to the state’s electrical grid. Thousands of sheep graze in the area, maintaining the vegetation around the solar arrays. 'This project was a spreadsheet and a set of emails that I had been exchanging and a bunch of approvals and so on. And then you come over the rise over there and you see it laid out in front of you and it kind of takes your breath away, right? Because there’s this enormous field of solar arrays,' Sloss said during the ceremony. 'And we actually collectively have done this. That is amazing.' SB Energy said most of the solar farm components are made in the United States, and that's only possible because the climate law formally known as the Inflation Reduction Act spurred clean energy manufacturing. The company expects the projects to be the first to qualify for an extra tax credit the law affords for using domestic content. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Ivory Coast dissolves student unions after deaths and a police raid	DAKAR, Senegal (AP) — Ivory Coast's government has announced a ban on all student unions following the deaths of two students and the arrest of 17 suspects in a confrontation between police and a student association with connections to some of the most powerful people in the country. The ban on Thursday came after a government raid on student housing controlled by a student union, known by its French acronym FESCI, that the government says was connected to the deaths. The National Security Council said that officers discovered large caches of weapons as well as several 'illegal businesses' within the student housing complex on the main campus of the University of Abidjan. The arrests targeted FESCI's leadership, including the general secretary, Sié Kambou, who was arrested in connection with the killings, according to a filing by chief prosecutor Koné Oumar. 'No crime can be committed in the FESCI environment without the named Sié Kambou being informed of it,' the court filing said. In a statement on Friday, FESCI called the decision 'a flagrant violation of the right to association, assembly and peaceful demonstration conferred by the Constitution' and denied any involvement in the deaths. The ban was the culmination of a government response to the death last month of FESCI member Agui Deagoué. According to the statement from the public prosecutor's office, Deagoué was Kambou's main rival within the union and was kidnapped off the street on his way to a meeting with him. FESCI was created in 1990 as a student association, but the group soon found itself at odds with then President Félix Houphouët-Boigny, who had its leaders arrested for what he deemed illegal meetings and demonstrations. After Houphouët-Boigny's rival, Laurent Gbagbo, came to power in 2000, FESCI enjoyed a privileged status, and authorities looked the other way as members attacked opposition supporters on and off campus. In 2011, Gbagbo lost a presidential election, but refused to concede defeat, triggering an outbreak of violence in which FESCI and its former leaders allegedly attacked the outgoing government's opponents. One of FESCI’s former leaders, Charles Blé Goudé, faced trial for crimes against humanity at the International Criminal Court in The Hague, Netherlands, but was acquitted in 2019. 'FESCI was an avant-garde association serving students and pupils in Cote d’Ivoire,' Julien-Geoffroy Kouao, an Abidjan-based political scientist, told The Associated Press, using the French name for the country. 'Unfortunately, today it has deviated to become an association whose instruments of action are violence.' FESCI took control of much of the student housing across the country from the mid-2010s, and according to students, has been charging exorbitantly high rates for rooms that were often crowded or poorly maintained. But the union, whose 100,000 members make up a third of the Ivory Coast's student body, has been defended by some. FESCI as an organization shouldn't be blamed for the actions of some of its members, Désiré N’Guessan Kouamé, a local politician, told the AP. 'Today, some people call it a criminal (organization). Fine, but we must recognize that in any organization or society, there are black sheep,' Kouamé said. Following the decision by the National Security Council, government workers began to demolish the group's headquarters, but given FESCI's role in administering student housing, some students expressed doubt it would be enough to force the organization to close or even to dent its power significantly.	https://apnews.com/article/ivory-coast-students-deaths-fesci-unions-ban-1a67ea2e6cc253d9f73c44eab7d98f72	2024-10-18T08:42:13-07:00	
Gangs attack neighborhoods across Haiti's capital in new wave of violence	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — Multiple gangs attacked several communities in the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince on Friday, setting fire to homes and a church as bullets whizzed through the area. At least one woman was killed as gangs opened fire in Solino, St. Michel, Tabarre 27 and other neighborhoods, with panicked residents calling radio stations since late Thursday pleading for help. A police union also called for help Thursday on X, saying it had information that multiple gunmen were preparing to invade Solino. 'Immediate action is required!' it wrote. A spokesman for Haiti’s National Police didn't immediately respond to a message for comment. Radio Télé Métronome reported that the swearing in of Haiti's provisional electoral council scheduled for Friday in downtown Port-au-Prince was moved to a safer area. As the attacks continued, six officials from the Bahamas arrived in Haiti Friday to join a U.N.-backed mission led by Kenyan police to help quell gang violence. The officials are the first of a contingent of 150 soldiers from the Bahamas expected in upcoming months. It wasn't clear what prompted the latest attack, which comes just days after Haitian and Kenyan police launched an operation killed at least 20 suspected gang members in an area controlled by the 400 Mawozo gang that operates mainly in Tabarre. Gangs control 80% of Port-au-Prince, although communities like Solino have been fighting attempts by gunmen to control it.	https://apnews.com/article/haiti-gang-violence-attack-portauprince-90e0a57167393e874b85ac4017d2c31d	2024-10-18T07:11:30-07:00	
What to know about Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader who was killed in Gaza	Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader who was killed by Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip, was the mastermind behind the Oct. 7 attack on Israel that sparked the war. He rose to the top position in August after the killing of the previous leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in an explosion in Iran that was blamed on Israel. On Thursday, Israel said troops in Gaza had killed Sinwar. A top Hamas political official confirmed the death Friday. Some things to know about Sinwar: From refugee camp to Hamas militant Sinwar was born in 1962 in a refugee camp in the Gaza town of Khan Younis. He was an early member of Hamas, which was formed in 1987. He eventually led the group's security arm, which worked to purge it of spies for Israel. Israel arrested him in the late 1980s and he admitted to killing 12 suspected collaborators, a role that earned him the nickname, 'The Butcher of Khan Younis.' He was sentenced to four life terms for offenses that included the killing of two Israeli soldiers. A prison leader while jailed in Israel Sinwar organized strikes in prison to improve working conditions. He also studied Hebrew and Israeli society. He survived brain cancer in 2008 after being treated by Israeli doctors. Sinwar was released from prison in 2011 by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as part of an exchange for an Israeli soldier captured by Hamas in a cross-border raid. Rise to Gaza power with a reputation for ruthlessness When Sinwar returned to Gaza, he quickly rose through Hamas' leadership ranks with a reputation for ruthlessness. He was widely believed to be behind the 2016 killing of another top Hamas commander, Mahmoud Ishtewi, in an internal power struggle. Sinwar became head of Hamas in Gaza, effectively putting him in control of the territory, and worked with Haniyeh to align the group with Iran and its proxies around the region while also building the group's military capabilities. The October attack on Israel Sinwar, along with Mohammed Deif, the head of Hamas' armed wing, is believed to have engineered the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel. The attack killed about 1,200 Israelis, mostly civilians, and the militants took some 250 people hostage, sparking the war with Hamas. The conflict has killed over 42,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to local health authorities, who do not distinguish combatants from civilians. Hamas said it launched the attack in retaliation for Israel's treatment of Palestinians and to push the Palestinian cause back onto the world agenda. Israel said it killed Deif in an attack in July.	https://apnews.com/article/sinwar-hamas-gaza-israel-0ca09c4c9d03e4113ca80c0c8fc28e97	2024-10-18T07:04:30-07:00	
Yahya Sinwar, Hamas' top leader and a mastermind of the Oct. 7 attack on Israel, is dead at 61	BEIRUT (AP) — Yahya Sinwar, Hamas’ top leader and a mastermind of the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the longest, deadliest and most destructive war in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, was killed by Israeli forces in Gaza. He was 61. In Gaza, no figure loomed larger in determining the war’s trajectory than Sinwar. Obsessive, disciplined and dictatorial, he was a rarely seen veteran militant who learned Hebrew over years spent in Israeli prisons and who carefully studied his enemy. He worked on bringing Hamas closer to the Iran-led alliance after it moved away following the start of Syria’s conflict in 2011. His death came in what appeared to be a chance front-line encounter with Israeli troops on Wednesday. Israel declared Thursday that the troops had killed him. A top Hamas political official confirmed the death Friday. The secretive figure feared on both sides of the battle lines engineered the surprise Oct. 7, 2023, attack into southern Israel, along with the even more shadowy Mohammed Deif, head of Hamas’ armed wing. Israel said that it killed Deif in a July airstrike in southern Gaza that killed more than 70 Palestinians. Soon after, Hamas’ leader in exile, Ismail Haniyeh, was killed while visiting Iran in an explosion that was blamed on Israel. Sinwar was then chosen to take his place as Hamas’ top leader, though he was in hiding in Gaza. Palestinian militants who carried out the October 2023 attack killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250 others, catching Israel’s military and intelligence establishment off guard and shattering the image of Israeli invincibility. Israel’s retaliation was crushing. The conflict has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not distinguish combatants from civilians. It also has caused widespread destruction in Gaza, and left hundreds of thousands of people homeless and many on the verge of starvation. Sinwar held indirect negotiations with Israel to try to end the war. One of his goals was to win the release of thousands of Palestinians held in Israeli jails, much like the deal that got him released more than a decade ago. The war he ignited drew in Hezbollah, eventually leading to another Israeli invasion of Lebanon, and led Iran and Israel to trade fire directly for the first time, raising fears of an even more expansive conflict. To Israelis, Sinwar was a nightmarish figure. The Israeli army’s chief spokesperson, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, called him a murderer 'who proved to the whole world that Hamas is worse than ISIS,' referring to the Islamic State group. Always defiant, Sinwar ended one of his few public speeches by inviting Israel to assassinate him, proclaiming in Gaza, 'I will walk back home after this meeting.' He then did so, shaking hands and taking selfies with people in the streets. Among Palestinians, he was respected for standing up to Israel and remaining in impoverished Gaza, in contrast to other Hamas leaders living more comfortably abroad. But he was also deeply feared for his iron grip in Gaza, where public dissent is suppressed. In contrast to the media-friendly personas cultivated by some of Hamas’ political leadership, Sinwar never sought to build a public image. He was known as the 'Butcher of Khan Younis' for his brutal approach to Palestinians suspected of collaborating with Israel. Sinwar was born in 1962 in Gaza’s Khan Younis refugee camp to a family that was among hundreds of thousands of Palestinians driven from what is now Israel during the 1948 war surrounding its creation. He was an early member of Hamas, which emerged from the Palestinian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood in 1987, when the coastal enclave was under Israeli military occupation. Sinwar convinced the group’s founder, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, that to succeed as a resistance organization, Hamas needed to be purged of informants for Israel. They founded a security arm, then known as Majd, which Sinwar led. Arrested by Israel in the late 1980s, he admitted under interrogation to having killed 12 suspected collaborators. He was eventually sentenced to four life terms for offenses that included the abduction and killing of two Israeli soldiers. Michael Koubi, a former director of the investigations department at Israel’s Shin Bet security agency who interrogated Sinwar, recalled the confession that stood out to him the most: Sinwar recounted forcing a man to bury his own brother alive because he was suspected of working for Israel. 'His eyes were full of happiness when he told us this story,' Koubi said. But to fellow prisoners, Sinwar was charismatic, sociable and shrewd, open to detainees from all political factions. He became the leader of the hundreds of imprisoned Hamas members. He organized strikes to improve conditions. He learned Hebrew and studied Israeli society. He was known for feeding fellow inmates, making kunafa, a treat of shredded dough stuffed with cheese. 'Being a leader inside prison gave him experience in negotiations and dialogue, and he understood the mentality of the enemy and how to affect it,' said Anwar Yassine, a Lebanese citizen who spent about 17 years in Israeli jails, much of the time with Sinwar. Yassine noted how Sinwar always treated him with respect even though he belonged to the Lebanese Communist Party, whose secular principles conflicted with Hamas’ ideology. During his years in detention, Sinwar wrote a 240-page novel, 'Thistle and the Cloves.' It tells the story of Palestinian society from the 1967 Mideast war until 2000, when the second intifada began. 'This is not my personal story, nor is it the story of a specific person, despite the fact that all the incidents are true,' Sinwar wrote in the novel’s opening. In 2008, Sinwar survived an aggressive form of brain cancer after treatment at a Tel Aviv hospital. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu released him in 2011 along with about 1,000 other prisoners in exchange for Gilad Schalit, an Israeli soldier captured by Hamas in a cross-border raid. Netanyahu was harshly criticized for releasing dozens of prisoners held for involvement in deadly attacks. Back in Gaza, Sinwar closely coordinated between Hamas’ political leadership and its military wing, the Qassam Brigades. He also cultivated a reputation for ruthlessness. He is widely believed to be behind the unprecedented 2016 killing of another top Hamas commander, Mahmoud Ishtewi, in an internal power struggle. He also married after his release. In 2017, he was elected head of Hamas’ political bureau in Gaza. Sinwar worked with Haniyeh to realign the group with Iran and its allies, including Lebanon’s Hezbollah. He also focused on building Hamas’ military power.	https://apnews.com/article/yahya-sinwar-hamas-leader-killed-obituary-gaza-6965bea4270313c1f1501335c705ac9a	2024-10-18T06:20:37-07:00	
Russia returns 500 dead soldiers to Ukraine as world leaders mull next steps	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia on Friday returned to Ukraine the bodies of 501 soldiers, Ukrainian authorities said, in what appeared to be the biggest repatriation of war dead since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. Most of the soldiers were killed in action in the eastern Donetsk region of Ukraine, mostly around the city of Avdiivka that Russian forces captured in February after a long and grueling battle, Ukraine’s Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War said in a statement. Law enforcement agencies and forensic experts will identify the victims, who will then be handed over to family members for burial, it said. The war is believed to have killed tens of thousands of soldiers on each side, though there are no official or independently collated figures. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy this week disclosed parts of his so-called ‘victory plan’ aimed at compelling Russia to end the war through negotiations. That proposal is being considered by Ukraine’s Western partners, whose help is vital for Kyiv to resist its bigger neighbor. A key element would be a formal invitation into NATO, which Western backers have been reluctant to consider until after the war ends. Russian President Vladimir Putin said Friday that Moscow is prepared to enter talks. He welcomed peace proposals previously tabled by China and Brazil, saying they could 'serve as a good basis for a search for peace.' Those proposals have failed to convince Kyiv. Speaking during a meeting with media leaders from the BRICS bloc of developing economies, Putin ruled out any concessions regarding the status of the four Ukrainian regions that Moscow illegally annexed in September 2022, saying that 'those are our territories.' That would be unacceptable for Ukraine. U.S. President Joe Biden met Friday in Berlin with some European leaders and said that Ukraine’s Western allies must keep up their support for Kyiv. Zelenskyy says Russia is getting help from China, Iran and North Korea. South Korea’s spy agency said Friday that North Korea has dispatched troops to support Russia against Ukraine. The head of Ukrainian Military Intelligence, Kyrylo Budanov, was quoted as saying 11,000 North Korean troops are currently training in Russia to join the fight against Ukraine. Budanov told defense news website The War Zone on Thursday that the first 2,600 North Korean soldiers are preparing to reinforce the Russian army in Kursk, the Russian border region where a Ukrainian incursion has held land since early August. The fighting has continued unabated while world leaders debate their next steps. Russia launched 135 Shahed drones, as well as some other unidentified drones, at various parts of Ukraine on Thursday night, the Ukrainian air force said, in what was one of the biggest single drone barrages of the war. Most of the drones were intercepted, the air force said. There was no official word on casualties or damage. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-soldier-bodies-pows-0fbe8d63b27f96cbbb0275af5807d776	2024-10-18T05:57:08-07:00	
Afro-Colombians fight the effects of gold mining through biodiversity projects in a violent region	SAN ISIDRO, Colombia (AP) — In an outdoor classroom surrounded by snake specimens preserved in jars, teacher Melqui Mosquera proudly talks about the nature reserve he set up in a Colombian region environmentally devastated by illegal mining. There are fish ponds with species native to the northwestern Choco region that were wiped out of the Atrato River due to contamination. A walk uphill leads to crystal water streams teeming with fish, jungle vegetation and chirping birds — a rare sound in many parts of the river now as wildlife has been pushed deep into the canopy by the loud machinery. Thanks to the support of a community council that liaises with the groups, mining has not yet reached the El Guayacan nature reserve, which was founded in 2013 with 13 hectares and today boasts over 200. Mosquera is pushing to achieve official legal status for the reserve, which could force the government to provide more protection. Mosaquera's reserve is one of many initiatives by ethnic communities in this impoverished region to fight back against the environmental devastation inflicted upon the Atrato, a river that weaves around some 750 kilometers (470 miles) through northern Colombian jungles. With no visible state presence and armed groups encroaching on the land for gold, these projects contain some of the last forms of protection for biodiversity in the region, supporting native plant life and fish populations no longer sustained by barren land and polluted waters. Outside the reserve, signs of devastation are everywhere The reserve in San Isidro is reachable only by boat. The marking of the Gaitanista Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, or Gulf Glan — the letters AGC — is spray painted on the government-placed sign upon entry to the port. It's the country’s most powerful crime group and it controls the illegal gold mining operations that engulf the town. An enormous makeshift mining dredge dominates the entrance to San Isidro. Upon arrival, Associated Press journalists were approached by men patrolling the river by boat who warned not to record images of the machinery. 'We have clashed with them (AGC),' said 60-year-old Mosquera. 'Because there’s a part here with gold, you see. They’ve tried to take over to mine it.' The waters of the Atrato River, long a community life source, have been contaminated through years of intense gold mining which tears up the riverbed, leaks poisonous mercury into the waters and deforests the surrounding land. Mosquera has noticed worsening levels in biodiversity along the Atrato, especially on the Quito River tributary on which San Isidro is located. He says fish no longer breed there. 'On the banks of the rivers there were many roots, many branches, which was the refuge of the fish,' he said. 'Now there’s no more refuge, because mining has taken it all away.' Colombia’s environment ministry said Minister Susana Muhamad has been coordinating efforts with the Ministry of Defense 'to protect this important ecosystem.' But the AP saw no state presence along the river during its three-day visit to various locations along the river, and residents said it has been a long time since any operations have taken place against illegal mining infrastructure. Colombia will host the United Nations Biodiversity Conference, known as COP16, this month, a follow up to the 2022 biodiversity conference in Montreal, aimed at halting the rapid destruction of nature. Muhamad will serve as the conference’s president. Illegal gold mining in South America, and all the problems it brings, is one of the biggest threats to preserving biodiversity. But in Mosquera's classroom, the causes of the deforestation and contamination from mining are never discussed, out of fear of reprisals. Many of the student's families are involved in mining, as well as with armed groups, he said. 'We feel tied up... we know that we can’t talk. The mining part we can’t even mention in the classroom,' Mosquera said. 'We talk to students about global, regional environmental damage, but we don’t talk to them about what is going on here.' In Paimado, a group of women reforest the land Forty minutes by boat down the Atrato leads to the town of Paimado, where a group of women form another environmental project. At 6 a.m., rain lashes down while Dioselina Palacios, 49, carries a bag of fertilizer on her head and mounts a small wooden boat. A couple of minutes to the other side of the river to a plot of land degraded by mining and she is soon mixing soil collected from a nearby forest with the fertilizer, which was bought from a local woman who produces it in Paimado. Then, plant seedlings are brought from nearby forests and are replanted with the fertilizer. When they have grown, they are planted on the degraded land. Illegal gold mining with heavy machinery meant trees were ripped out and the land is left rocky and sedimented. Hugh swaths of land remain sunken where diggers excavated all they could in search of the lucrative metal. 'We are doing this work to see if we can replace a little bit of what has been lost,' said another of the women, Nereida Romaña, 65, wearing a green T-shirt with a print of the project's logo. 'Before, when there were no illegal machines, you lived a good life here ... Now you can’t even get fish.' Agricultural engineer David Antonio Navas, who supports the project, Asociacion Nuestra Casa Comun, or Our Community House Association, as part of Colombia’s Cordoba University, said the women have been taught how to stabilize the soil, and to collect different kinds of seeds in the forest like timber and fruit trees that are native to the area to take to the nurseries. 'Organic fertilizers are made from local resources, like organic waste we have from food, shells, skins,' he said. 'We don’t bring anything. All the resources we need for the soil, for pests, for everything, is already in the community.' Most of the women taking part in the small reforestation project say they have worked in gold mining for most of their lives to make a living. Palacios continues to today, with little other income possibilities. As part of Afro-Colombian tradition, the woman plant native trees in the area only during a full moon. They have also sown medicinal plants important in their culture. As impoverished region's gold is quickly vanishing, mothers like Palacios worry what will be left economically and environmentally for the next generations. Navas believes the communities should be paid to help reverse the damage caused to their ecosystem by third parties. 'We are aware that it should be the communities that support this process of restoration of degraded areas by mining,' he said. 'For this they should have a salary that allows them to generate the income to cover their needs.' But Palacios fears that despite all the initiatives, something has been permanently lost. 'I don’t think it’s going to come back again. It was a thick jungle,' she said. 'They work and they leave lots of holes and it’s not the same anymore.' ___ Follow Steven Grattan on X: @sjgrattan ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Prague bans nighttime pub crawls to deal with drunk and rowdy visitors	PRAGUE (AP) — The Czech capital has approved a ban on organized nighttime pub crawls, which have caused misery for residents and authorities alike. The popular outings of tourist groups moving from bar to bar in Prague’s historic district have been one of the outcomes of overtourism felt across Europe. Attracting more than 7 million tourists last year, Prague finally opted for the ban, which will take effect in November, after trying to deal with groups of rowdy and drunk visitors for years. It was adopted to address disturbing noise at night, garbage on the streets, and security and reputational concerns, said Adam Zabranský, a member of the city’s council who drafted the proposal that was approved this week. Zabranský said that the aim wasn't to prevent people from having a drink in this beer-loving country, but 'we don’t want to support cheap alco-tourism that’s unfortunately still quite common in Prague,' Zabranský told The Associated Press. The ban will be enforced by the city police force between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. with organizers of the pub crawls violating it facing fines of up to 100,000 koruna ($4,300). The radical move came after the previous efforts to deal with the issue failed, including the appointment of a night mayor in 2019, a city official whose job was to minimize the impact of nightlife on residents. 'It would be great if the owners of the establishments take their share of responsibility,' Zabranský said. 'As it is, the residents in the busy areas face the negative consequences while the bar owners participating in the pub crawls make profit and don’t care about the problems.' The move is part of the city’s long-term strategy to promote cultural tourism and in general to attract people to stay longer than just for a weekend and come back again. 'People coming to experience culture behave differently than those who arrive to drink all weekend long,' Zabranský said. An agency organizing the pub crawls called the ban 'a populist move,' while a group of dozens of participants on Thursday apparently enjoyed their experience. '(The pub crawl) was very nice,' Melissa Haine from Germany said. 'I think it's very funny, and you get to know new people.' The latest move by Prague doesn’t mean that visitors would face obstacles to tasting local beer in a country that is the world’s largest consumer of the drink per capita. 'Czechia has exceptional potential in beer tourism, thanks to its long history of brewing, unique breweries and the current trend of experiential and sustainable tourism,' said František Reismüller, the head of the country’s tourist authority. 'Our goal is to show that beer travel can be not only about tasting great beer, but also about learning about Czech culture, traditions and history.' ___ Stanislav Hodina contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/prague-pub-crawl-ban-tourism-18503491848410be28bfc02b48245548	2024-10-18T03:56:46-07:00

Liam Payne’s 1D bandmates, Cheryl, Simon Cowell and more mourn singer	LONDON (AP) — Friends, collaborators and fellow musicians have expressed shock and sadness over the death of former One Direction singer Liam Payne, who died in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on Wednesday at age 31. A look at some of the reactions: __ 'We’re completely devastated by the news of Liam’s passing. In time, and when everyone is able to, there will be more to say. But for now, we will take some time to grieve and process the loss of our brother, who we loved dearly. The memories we shared with him will be treasured forever.' — the surviving members of One Direction, Niall Horan, Louis Tomlinson, Harry Styles and Zayn Malik, in a statement. 'We are heartbroken. Liam will forever live in our hearts and we’ll remember him for his kind, funny and brave soul. We are supporting each other the best we can as a family and ask for privacy and space at this awful time.' — Payne’s family, in a statement. 'Liam was not only a pop star and a celebrity, he was a son, a brother, an uncle, a dear friend and a father to our 7 year old son. A son that now has to face the reality of never seeing his father again. What is troubling my spirit the most is that one day Bear will have access to the abhorrent reports and media exploitation we have seen in the past two days. It is breaking my heart further that I cannot protect him from that in his future.' — Cheryl, the Girls Aloud singer and mother of Payne's son Bear Grey Payne, on Instagram. 'Liam had an energy for life and a passion for work that was infectious. He was the brightest in every room and always made everyone feel happy and secure. ... We got to live out our wildest dreams together and I will cherish every moment we had forever.' — Horan, on Instagram. 'Liam lived wide open, with his heart on his sleeve, he had an energy for life that was infectious. He was warm, supportive, and incredibly loving. The years we spent together will forever remain among the most cherished years of my life. I will miss him always, my lovely friend.' — Styles, on Instagram. 'A message to you Liam if you’re listening, I feel beyond lucky to have had you in my life but I’m really struggling with the idea of saying goodbye. I’m so grateful that we got even closer since the band, speaking on the phone for hours, reminiscing about all the thousands of amazing memories we had together is a luxury I thought I’d have with you for life. I would have loved to share the stage with you again but it wasn’t to be.' — Tomlinson, on Instagram. 'I lost a brother when you left us and can’t explain to you what I’d give to just give you a hug one last time and say goodbye to you properly and tell you that I loved and respected you dearly. I will cherish all the memories I have with you in my heart forever.' — Malik, on Instagram. 'This is so difficult to put in words right now. I went outside today, and I thought about so many times we had together. I wanted to let you know what I would always say to the thousands of people who would always ask me. What is Liam like? And I would tell them you were kind, funny, sweet, thoughtful, talented, humble, focused. And how much you loved music. And how much love you genuinely had for the fans.' — Simon Cowell, mentor to One Direction and 'X Factor' judge who helped form the band, on Instagram. 'Talking about Liam in the past tense is utterly heartbreaking. He was such a loving and kind soul. I will treasure the moments I got to spend with him.' — James Corden, on Instagram. 'I’m devastated. He had the kindest soul, I will never forget. I loved working with him so much – he was just such a joy to be around on and off stage.' — singer Rita Ora on X. 'Just a boy.' — Anne Twist, mother of Styles, posted on Instagram with a broken-heart emoji. 'We are heartbroken by the sad passing of Liam Payne,' — 'X Factor' official account, on X.

Liam Payne wow I can’t believe it prayers up for the family.' — rapper Juicy J, who had Payne sing on the 2016 track 'You,' on X. 'RIP Liam… I can’t believe this is real… absolutely heartbreaking.' — producer and DJ Zedd, who collaborated with Payne on the 2017 song 'Get Low,' on X.	https://apnews.com/article/liam-payne-death-reactions-one-direction-band-tribute-f08045886ebff903fbc3addc62dcb836	2024-10-18T03:28:06-07:00	
Hezbollah vows a new phase in the war, as Israel says it has killed Hamas leader Sinwar	JERUSALEM (AP) — The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah vowed to launch a new phase of fighting against invading Israeli troops Friday, a day after Israel said its forces in the Palestinian enclave of Gaza had killed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, the chief architect of last year’s brutal attack on Israel that sparked the current war. Sinwar’s killing in what appeared to be a chance frontline encounter with Israeli troops offers a potential window to shift the dynamic in the Gaza war even as Israel presses its offensive against Hezbollah along its northern border with Lebanon and continues its aerial bombardment in other areas of Lebanon. Both Hamas and Hezbollah are backed by Iran, which hailed Sinwar as a martyr who can inspire others in challenging Israel. Israel has pledged to destroy Hamas politically in Gaza, and killing Sinwar was a top military priority. Hamas has not yet commented directly on the Israeli announcement, but photos which were apparently taken by Israeli troops on the scene showed the body of a man who appeared to be Sinwar half-buried in rubble with a gaping wound in his head. A statement issued by one of Hamas’ political leaders abroad Friday seemed to be a reference to Sinwar's death and said Israel is mistaken if it 'believes that killing our leaders means the end of our movement and the struggle of the Palestinian people.' Hamas political bureau member Bassem Naim, who is usually based in Qatar, said that past leaders in the organization had also been killed and 'Hamas each time became stronger and more popular, and these leaders became an icon for future generations to continue the journey towards a free Palestine.' He added that it is 'painful and distressing to lose beloved people, especially extraordinary leaders' but that the Palestinian militant group is sure it will be 'eventually victorious.' When asked if the statement was a confirmation of Sinwar’s death, however, Naim said it was not. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a speech announcing the killing Thursday night that 'our war is not yet ended.' But many, from the governments of Israel's allies to exhausted residents of Gaza, expressed hope that Sinwar’s death would pave the way for an end to the war. Iran’s mission to the United Nations issued a statement honoring Sinwar, emphasizing that he died on the battlefield and not in hiding, unlike the Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, who was hanged in 2006. 'When U.S. forces dragged a disheveled Saddam Hussein out of an underground hole, he begged them not to kill him despite being armed. Those who regarded Saddam as their model of resistance eventually collapsed,' the statement said. 'However when Muslims look up to martyr Sinwar standing on the battlefield — in combat attire and out in the open, not in a hideout, facing the enemy — the spirit of resistance will be strengthened.' More than 1 million people on both sides were killed during the brutal Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s that began when Hussein launched an invasion of Iran. In Lebanon, Hezbollah issued a statement early Friday saying its fighters have used new types of precision-guided missiles and explosive drones against Israel for the first time in recent days. The statement appeared to refer to an explosives-laden drone that evaded Israel’s multilayered air-defense system and slammed into a mess hall at a military training camp deep inside Israel last Sunday night, killing four soldiers and wounding dozens. The group also announced earlier this week that it fired a new type of missile called Qader 2 toward the suburbs of Tel Aviv. Hezbollah said its fighters were working according to 'plans prepared in advance' to battle invading Israeli troops in several parts of south Lebanon. It also announced several missile and artillery attacks on Israeli forces operating in villages in southern Lebanon’s border area overnight and Friday morning. In one case, the group said it fired a heavy missile barrage at Israeli soldiers who were trying to evacuate those wounded in an earlier strike. The group also said it had fired 'large missile salvos' at a military barracks in the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights and at the Zvulun area north of Haifa. Earlier this week, Hezbollah’s acting leader Naim Kassem warned that the group will continue to target wider areas of Israel unless a cease-fire is implemented in Lebanon. As Israel fought militants in Lebanon and in Gaza, its military said Friday that its forces had killed two militants who crossed into Israeli territory south of the Dead Sea from neighboring Jordan. Such infiltrations are relatively rare, especially as Israel has ramped up border security since the Hamas attack in October 2023. On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel’s security fence and stormed in, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not distinguish combatants from civilians. The war has destroyed vast swathes of Gaza and displaced about 90% of its population of 2.3 million people. ___ Abby Sewell and Bassem Mroue in Beirut contributed	https://apnews.com/article/sinwar-hezbollah-lebanon-killed-israel-hamas-39dde452082d4130556f13f87e700125	2024-10-18T02:07:03-07:00	
Body of Scottish independence champion Alex Salmond flown home from North Macedonia	LONDON (AP) — The body of former Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond was flown back to Scotland on a private jet Friday, six days after the politician died suddenly in North Macedonia. A trumpet sounded as Salmond’s coffin, draped in Scotland’s blue-and-white Saltire flag, was loaded onto the plane at Ohrid airport in the country’s southwest by six members of North Macedonia's military. The 69-year-old politician died of a heart attack on Saturday while attending a conference in the lake resort city. The flight, chartered by Scottish businessman Tom Hunter, landed Friday afternoon in Aberdeen, near Salmond's home in northeast Scotland. A bagpiper played as the coffin was carried from the plane and met by Salmond's relatives and members of his Alba political party. Plans are being put in place for a private family funeral along with a public memorial service. Salmond led the Scottish National Party for a decade and a half, taking Scotland up to the brink of independence from the United Kingdom in a 2014 referendum. He transformed the SNP from a fringe party to a dominant force in Scottish politics and served as first minister from 2007 to 2014. In the referendum, Scots rejected independence, with 55% voting against and 45% in favor. Salmond subsequently resigned and was replaced by his longtime ally, Nicola Sturgeon. Their later split dominated Scottish politics for years. In 2019, Salmond was charged with sexual assault and attempted rape after allegations by nine women who had worked with him as first minister or for the party. He was acquitted after a trial in March 2020. In 2021 he left the SNP and created a new party called Alba — the Scottish Gaelic word for Scotland — to press for a new independence referendum.	https://apnews.com/article/alex-salmond-body-repatriated-scotland-c0e90b9514424b0825474f650aa1918e	2024-10-18T01:39:51-07:00	
Patriots practice on Winston Churchill's old stomping grounds in London	LONDON (AP) — They’ll toil and sweat but hopefully without the blood and tears. A London game is more than just a typical road trip for NFL teams. It’s a chance to learn about local history, too. In fact, the New England Patriots and Jacksonville Jaguars — who play Sunday at Wembley Stadium — don’t even need to leave their practice facilities to do so. The Patriots trained Friday at the exclusive Harrow School, whose most famous alumnus is Winston Churchill. Farther out in the countryside, the Jaguars have been using a practice field that is nearly on top of a maze of World War II air raid shelters. Harrow consists of 324 acres on a hill overlooking London where Churchill spent his high school years before entering politics and leading Britain through World War II as prime minister. 'If any of the Pats players take a break from practice, they should walk around and see the school grounds because they’re quite grand,' said Lee Pollock, a director and senior adviser to the board of the International Churchill Society. A highlight is the Speech Room, where young Churchill recited 1,200 lines from the poem 'Lays of Ancient Rome' from memory and won a prize for the feat. 'At Harrow, he learned what he called the most noble thing in the world: the construction of a sentence in the English language,' Pollock said. Patriots coach Jerod Mayo noted another big character — a fictional one — from Harrow's more recent history. 'I’m definitely a big history guy and I would also say I just learned that there was a Harry Potter scene shot here as well, which I thought was pretty interesting,' Mayo said. Deatrich Wise Jr., a defensive end, said he already knew Churchill was an alum because 'someone said it on the way in.' Pockets of American politicians have long admired and quoted the cigar-chomping Churchill, and that's spilled over into sports too. San Diego Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh is a big fan. Kansas City Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker cited Churchill in a social media post about courage, though he's not the first to misattribute a quote to him. New York Jets owner Woody Johnson had a large Churchill portrait in his office at the U.S. embassy when he was ambassador to the United Kingdom under then-President Donald Trump. Outside of his wartime leadership, Churchill’s legacy is more complex. The Jags are close to history, too. To avoid German bombing in WWII, the London, Midland and Scottish Railway bought the Grove estate in Watford and moved its headquarters there. It was called 'Project X.' Air raid shelters were built and are still intact — explorers have posted videos online even though the entrances appear to be at least partially blocked. At one point they were being used as 'bat roosts,' according to historical records. The Grove luxury hotel where the Jags now regularly stay opened in 2003. Several entrances to the shelters are visible in the woods next to the Jags' practice field. Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence, speaking generally about the team's annual London trip, says he's always up for learning more about the region. 'I do enjoy history and learning about things,' he said on Wednesday. 'I don’t know a ton about the area, to be honest. Usually when we’re here it’s pretty busy and we’re kind of focused on the game and trying to win that, but I am intrigued and I think it’s cool just everything here at the Grove but also just in London — it’s so much older than in America. 'The history behind it,' Lawrence continued, 'you pick up bits as you go ... it is interesting hearing different things about it.' ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl	https://apnews.com/article/churchill-patriots-jaguars-ww2-london-740994b3d014a1dcddde9c64333c76b8	2024-10-18T00:34:12-07:00	
Rwanda shrugs off 'sportswashing' criticism in pursuit of a winning development formula	NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — He may be the president of a small, landlocked state in central Africa, but Paul Kagame has always had outsize dreams. In recent months, Rwanda’s president has embarked on perhaps the biggest of them all by pitching to bring a Formula 1 Grand Prix to a country that was mired in genocide 30 years ago but now sees itself as one of the continent’s leaders. Determined to overcome his country’s geographical disadvantages, Kagame has relentlessly pursued a political, diplomatic and economic strategy to make Rwanda an African heavyweight. In the past four years, he has sent troops to engage rebels in the Central African Republic and mount counterinsurgency operations in Mozambique. At home he has pursued economic reforms to lure foreign investors, transforming Rwanda into a country with a reputation as one of Africa’s least corrupt and most business friendly, despite Kagame’s own reputation as a democratic laggard. But when it comes to sport, his aspirations extend well beyond Africa. Since 2018, his government has secured sponsorship deals with some of Europe’s biggest soccer clubs, developed a partnership with the NBA and spent hundreds of millions of dollars in developing Rwanda’s sports facilities. Next year Rwanda will stage the world championships for bicycle road racing. Kagame himself has built a close working relationship with Gianni Infantino, the president of FIFA, which has opened an office in Rwanda and held its annual meeting there last year. Now he is taking the biggest step yet in his ambition to transform the country into a global sporting power, with F1 executives confirming that they are in exploratory talks with Kagame’s government about a possible Rwandan Grand Prix. Experts say that could require billions of dollars in investment and outlay. Given that Gross Domestic Product stands at just $14.1 billion and that there is at yet no track on which to host a race, the idea of a Rwandan Grand Prix might seem far-fetched. Yet with seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton pushing for an African F1 race and given Rwanda’s reputation as one of the continent’s more reliable and transparent states, it is not impossible either. Stefano Domenicali, F1’s chief executive, has described Rwanda’s proposal as 'serious', telling motorsport.com that 'they have presented a good plan.' 'We want to go to Africa, but we need to have the right investment, and the right strategic plan,' he added. The country’s motorsports profile may receive a boost when the FIA’s governing body hosts its annual general assembly and prize giving in Kigali, Rwanda’s capital, in December—the first time the ceremony has been held in Africa. Both the Kagame administration and F1 officials are reluctant to reveal details about what they describe as 'ongoing' discussions, but Rwandan government spokeswoman Yolande Makolo said hosting an F1 race would allow the country to move 'from being a consumer of sport to a participant in the business of sports.' 'Rwanda’s interest in Formula 1 aligns with our strategy to leverage sports for transformative impact,' she said. 'We seek every opportunity to drive forward Rwanda’s development, including through global sporting partnerships.' Rwanda is not alone in seeking an F1 race, with potential competitors also in Africa. South Africa, which hosted Africa’s last Grand Prix in 1993, and Morocco, which staged 13 races between 1925 and 1958, are also reportedly keen to reenter the fray. That Rwanda is bidding at all reveals much about how Kagame views sport as an economic and geopolitical weapon. If Rwanda can navigate the obvious economic risks, its ambitious sporting strategy could yield big dividends, both financially and diplomatically. The Seoul Olympics in 1988 helped South Korea transform its global image as an insulated, war-ravaged backwater to an emerging economy open to the world. Although no other sub-Saharan country has quite such a comprehensive and ambitious strategy, Rwanda is following the example of countries like Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Qatar, which have used sport — including the hosting of Grand Prix races — to boost their reputations abroad. Like them, Rwanda has faced criticism that it is using sport to distract attention from a chequered human rights record. Kagame, who secured 99.2 percent of the vote in July’s presidential election, is accused of using increasingly repressive methods to consolidate his 30-year grip on power. Critics of his ruling Rwandan Patriotic Front have experienced intimidation, arrest and even death. Meanwhile, the United Nations has accused Kagame’s government of stoking, funding and arming a rebellion in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda’s troubled neighbour to the east. The United States cut military aid to Rwanda in protest. Both Rwanda and its international sporting partners have faced accusations that they are using sport to divert attention from Kagame’s rights record, a practice known as 'sportswashing.' In August, two U.S. senators, Republican Marsha Blackburn and Democrat Jeff Merkley, wrote to the NBA accusing it of 'putting profit over principle' by forging close ties with the Rwandan government. Some European lawmakers have raised similar objections to question Rwanda’s sponsorship of soccer clubs Arsenal, Paris Saint Germain and Bayern Munich, a strategy Kagame’s government says will boost tourism. The prospect of a Rwandan F1 race has renewed such criticism. 'The critical question is what kind of due diligence Formula 1 did to ensure it lives up to its own stated human rights commitments and avoid contributing to laundering the Rwandan government’s human rights record,' said Clementine de Montjoye, senior researcher in the Africa division at Human Rights Watch. 'Rwanda’s partners should open their eyes and see Kigali’s wide-reaching human rights abuse for what it is: the consequence of three decades of impunity for the ruling Rwandan Patriotic Front.' Rwanda is far from the only country with a contentious rights record that has used sport to shape a different narrative about itself. Saudi Arabia, stung by scrutiny following the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018, has invested more than $10 billion in sport, including golf, F1 and soccer. Infantino has steered the men's 2034 World Cup hosting rights toward Saudi Arabia. Qatar, which has close commercial links with Rwanda, spent $230 billion on hosting the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Yet Rwanda is a financial minnow in comparison and depends on donor aid to fund 40 percent of government expenditure, leading to questions about the wisdom of seeking to emulate Gulf petrostates. 'The Saudis employed this sort of strategy to get people to forget about awkward things like dismembering journalists,' said Michela Wrong, author of 'Do Not Disturb,' a book critical of Kagame. 'But the difference is Saudi Arabia can afford these deals. Rwanda can’t. Rwanda is a very poor country, heavily dependent on subsistence agriculture and foreign aid, which is pouring millions of dollars into some of the world’s richest clubs. There is something innately distasteful about this.' There is little doubt that Kagame’s sports strategy is an economic gamble. Despite his business-friendly policies, Rwanda’s market has proved too small to lure significant inward investment, something that hosting big-ticket sporting events could go some way to address, particularly if it gains 'first mover advantage' by getting ahead of other African rivals. On the other hand, even richer states have struggled to make event hosting pay. 'Sporting events are incredibly expensive to stage and the net impact is very often negative rather than positive,' says Simon Chadwick, a professor of sport and geopolitical economy. 'For Rwanda, given its relative economic weakness, this will be a concern.'	https://apnews.com/article/rwanda-f1-sportswashing-kagame-1b4c178adaa2feef3c95bd2d8af0c425	2024-10-18T00:26:12-07:00	
Harris will campaign with the Obamas later this month in Georgia and Michigan	WASHINGTON (AP) — Vice President Kamala Harris will make her first campaign appearances with Barack Obama and Michelle Obama, two of the most popular figures in the Democratic Party, at get-out-the-vote events this month in Georgia and Michigan. It will be the former first lady's first time hitting the trail for Harris. Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, is set to appear with Obama in Georgia on Oct. 24 and with Mrs. Obama in Michigan on Oct. 26, according to a Harris campaign senior official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss events before they are officially announced. The official did not disclose the cities where Harris will join the Obamas. The former president recently campaigned for Harris in Pittsburgh and has appearances scheduled Friday and Saturday in Arizona and Nevada, respectively, and next week in Wisconsin and Michigan. Early voting opens statewide in Michigan on Oct. 26, and Harris and the former first lady will encourage supporters to cast their ballots as soon as possible, the official said. In Georgia, where early voting opened this past Tuesday, more than 310,000 people voted on the first day, a record. The Obamas endorsed Harris in July and spoke at the Democratic National Convention in August in Chicago. They remain prodigious fundraising draws and popular surrogates at large campaign events for Democratic candidates. It was previously announced that Mrs. Obama will headline a rally in Atlanta on Oct. 29, three days after joining Harris in Michigan. The rally, which will feature celebrities and civic leaders, is being hosted by When We All Vote, a nonpartisan civic engagement organization that the former first lady founded in 2018 to reach out to people who are less likely to become involved in politics and elections. Among the group's celebrity co-chairs are NBA players Stephen Curry and Chris Paul; musical artists Jennifer Lopez and Janelle Monáe; beauty influencer Bretman Rock; and actors Tom Hanks, Selena Gomez, Lin-Manuel Miranda and Kerry Washington. The friendship between Harris and the Obamas goes back 20 years, when the former president and current vice president met during his campaign for the U.S. Senate. She was an early supporter of his 2008 presidential campaign and went door-knocking for him in Iowa before the caucuses.	https://apnews.com/article/harris-barack-michelle-obama-b31b662260f8e22131123a0d32888b56	2024-10-18T00:01:54-07:00	
South Korean intelligence says North has sent troops to aid Russia's war in Ukraine	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea's spy agency said Friday that North Korea has dispatched troops to support Russia's war against Ukraine, a development that could bring a third country into the war and intensify a standoff between North Korea and the West. The National Intelligence Service said in a statement that Russian navy ships transferred 1,500 North Korean special operation forces to the Russian port city of Vladivostok from Oct. 8 to Oct. 13. It said more North Korean troops are expected to be sent to Russia soon. The North Korean soldiers deployed in Russia have been given Russian military uniforms, weapons and forged identification documents, the NIS said. It said they are currently staying at military bases in Vladivostok and other Russian sites such as Ussuriysk, Khabarovsk and Blagoveshchensk, and that they will likely be deployed to battle grounds after completing their adaptation training. The NIS posted on its website satellite and other photos showing what it calls Russian navy ship movements near a North Korean port and suspected North Korean mass gatherings in Ussuriysk and Khabarovsk in the past week. South Korean media, citing the NIS, reported that North Korea has decided to dispatch a total of 12,000 troops formed into four brigades to Russia. The NIS did not immediately confirm the reports. If confirmed, it would be North Korea's first major participation in a foreign war. North Korea has 1.2 million troops, one of the largest militaries in the world, but it lacks actual combat experience. Many experts question how much the North Korean troop dispatch would help Russia, citing North Korea’s outdated equipment and shortage of battle experience. Experts also said that North Korea likely received Russian promises to provide security support over the intense confrontations over its advancing nuclear program with the U.S. and South Korea. During a meeting in Pyongyang in June, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a pact stipulating mutual military assistance if either country is attacked, in what was considered the two countries’ biggest defense deal since the end of the Cold War. South Korea’s presidential office said in a statement that President Yoon Suk Yeol had presided over an emergency meeting earlier Friday to discuss North Korea’s troop dispatch to Russia. The statement said participants of the meeting agreed that North Korea’s troop dispatch poses a grave security threat to South Korea and the international community. But the presidential office gave no further details like when and how many North Korean soldiers have been sent to Ukraine and what roles they are expected to play. Russia has denied using North Korean troops in the war, with Presidential Spokesman Dmitry Peskov describing the claims as 'another piece of fake news' during a news conference last week, according to Russia media. Ukrainian media reported earlier this month that six North Koreans were among those killed after a Ukrainian missile strike in the partially occupied eastern Donetsk region on Oct. 3. On Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his government has intelligence that 10,000 troops from North Korea are being prepared to join Russian forces fighting against his country, warning that a third nation wading into the hostilities could turn the conflict into a 'world war.' 'From our intelligence we’ve got information that North Korea sent tactical personnel and officers to Ukraine,' Zelenskyy told reporters at NATO headquarters. 'They are preparing on their land 10,000 soldiers, but they didn’t move them already to Ukraine or to Russia.' NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said the western alliance 'have no evidence that North Korean soldiers are involved in the fight. But we do know that North Korea is supporting Russia in many ways, weapons supplies, technological supplies, innovation, to support them in the war effort. And that is highly worrying.' The U.S., South Korea and their partners have accused North Korea of supplying Russia with artillery shells, missiles and other equipment to help fuel its war on Ukraine Outside officials and experts say North Korea in exchange possibly received badly needed food and economic aid and technology assistance aimed at upgrading Kim’s nuclear-armed military. Both Moscow and Pyongyang have repeatedly denied the existence of an arms deal between the countries.	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-russia-ukraine-war-troops-south-spy-9cd563c5570f68e9b314976009682810	2024-10-17T23:59:17-07:00	
A baby died and 65 people were rescued when a migrant boat sank during Channel crossing attempt	PARIS (AP) — French maritime authorities said Friday a baby died and 65 people had to be rescued when a migrant boat sank as it attempted to cross the English Channel toward Britain. Late on Thursday, French rescuers noticed the overloaded boat was in trouble and that several people were in the sea. Rescuers used semi-rigid boats to take them out of the water and saved 65 people, France’s maritime authorities said in a statement. As searches were continuing, rescuers found a baby who was unconscious and was later declared dead by a doctor, the statement said. The rescued migrants were brought back to the French port of Boulogne-sur-Mer to be handled by health care services and the border police. A series of shipwrecks has made 2024 the deadliest in recent years on the English Channel. Four migrants, including a 2-year-old child, died earlier this month in two separate incidents in similar crossing attempts. Last month, at least 20 migrants died in several shipwrecks in the Channel. ___ Follow AP’s global migration coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/migration	https://apnews.com/article/migrants-channel-baby-death-france-britain-a4832ceebd01796963d05e75688eb503	2024-10-17T23:56:09-07:00	
Pakistan's Punjab province shuts schools for 2 days to contain protests over alleged on-campus rape	LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) — Authorities in Pakistan's eastern Punjab province shut all schools and universities for two days on Friday in an attempt to contain the spread of protests by students over an alleged on-campus rape. The closures in Pakistan's most populous province affect an estimated 18 million students. Tensions have been high on college campuses since reports of the alleged rape in the eastern city of Lahore spread on social media, and protests have broken out in four cities. In Gujrat in Punjab province, a security guard died in clashes between student protesters and police on Wednesday. Police arrested a person in connection with the death. The government and police have denied that any rape occurred on a campus of the private Punjab Group of Colleges in Lahore, the capital of Punjab. They are seeking the arrest of nearly three dozen people, including several journalists, saying they spread misinformation on social media that led to the protests. Students, however, announced they would hold a rally later Friday to demand justice for the alleged victim in the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan. The decision to shut all schools in Punjab came a day after hundreds of students ransacked a college building in the garrison city of Rawalpindi. Police fired tear gas and charged at the students, arresting more than 250 people. The protests appear to have begun spontaneously, as student unions have been banned in Pakistan since 1984. There are no organizations representing students, although political parties' youth wings exist. Separately, hundreds of supporters from the political party of imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan defied the ban on rallies and protested in Karachi and the northwestern city of Peshawar on Friday to oppose any amendments to the country's Constitution. Police swung batons and fired tear gas in Karachi to disperse the demonstrators. Khan's supporters could not hold any significant protests anywhere else due to the deployment of heavy police. Khan’s supporters say Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who replaced Khan after his ouster in 2022 in a no-confidence vote in parliament, wants to appoint judges of his own choosing and set up a new constitutional court in parallel with the Supreme Court. The government denies the allegations. Sexual violence against women is common in Pakistan but is underreported because of stigma in the conservative country. Protests about the issue have been rare. ___ Associated Press writers Asim Tanveer in Multan, Pakistan, and Riaz Khan in Peshawar, Pakistan, contributed to this story.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-punjab-bans-rallies-shut-schools-rape-41b44e196bf654e8f749d8c25ed41a02	2024-10-17T22:38:19-07:00	
Middle East latest: Hezbollah says its war with Israel is 'entering a new phase'	Lebanon’s Hezbollah militant group said Friday it is entering a new phase in its fight against invading Israeli troops, as the region continued to reckon with Israel's claim that top Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar has been killed in a battle with Israeli forces in Gaza the previous day. Hamas has still not responded to the Israeli announcement, but its ally Iran released a statement commemorating the Palestinian militant leader via its mission to the United Nations. Sinwar was a chief architect of the attack on southern Israel that precipitated the latest escalating conflicts in the Middle East. Many, from the governments of Israeli allies to exhausted residents of Gaza, expressed hope that Sinwar's death would pave the way for an end to the war, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a speech announcing the killing that 'Our war is not yet ended.' On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel’s security fence and stormed in, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not distinguish combatants from civilians. The war has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced about 90% of its population of 2.3 million people. ___ Here's the latest: Hezbollah says its war with Israel is entering ‘new phase’ BEIRUT — Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group says it is entering a new phase in its fight against invading Israeli troops, adding that it has introduced new weapons over the past days. A statement from the group’s operations room early Friday said that Hezbollah’s fighters have used new types of precision-guided missiles and explosive drones for the first time. The statement appears to refer to a drone laden with explosives that evaded Israel’s multilayered air-defense system and slammed into a mess hall at a military training camp deep inside Israel, killing four soldiers and wounding dozens. The group also announced earlier this week that it fired a new type of missile called Qader 2 toward the suburbs of Tel Aviv. The statement also said that Hezbollah’s air defense units shot down this week two Israeli Hermes 450 drones. Hezbollah said its fighters are working according to 'plans prepared in advance' to battle invading Israeli troops in several parts of south Lebanon. Iran commemorates Hamas leader whom Israel says it killed UNITED NATIONS — Iran’s Mission to the United Nations issued a statement honoring Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas, after Israel said Thursday he had been killed in fighting: 'When U.S. forces dragged a disheveled Saddam Hussein out of an underground hole, he begged them not to kill him despite being armed. Those who regarded Saddam as their model of resistance eventually collapsed. However when Muslims look up to martyr Sinwar standing on the battlefield — in combat attire and out in the open, not in a hideout, facing the enemy — the spirit of resistance will be strengthened. He will become a model for the youth and children who will carry forth his path for the liberation of Palestine. As long as occupation and aggression exist, resistance will endure, for the martyr remains alive and a source of inspiration.' Iran and Iraq fought a brutal war in the 1980s that began when Hussein launched an invasion of Iran. It killed more than 1 million people on both sides.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-hezbollah-mideast-latest-18-october-2024-45c743c656cb85410a2d2b2fc84d6934	2024-10-17T21:59:12-07:00	
Stock market today: Asian shares gain as China releases plan for market support	BANGKOK (AP) — Asian shares have mostly gained after China’s central bank released plans for supporting the stock market through share repurchases by companies and major shareholders. Beijing also reported that the Chinese economy slowed further in the last quarter, which spurred expectations the government will ramp up its latest stimulus efforts. The world's second-largest economy expanded at a 4.6% annual pace in July-September, down slightly from 4.7% in the previous quarter. Growth so far this year has averaged to 4.8%, below the official target of about 5%, as weakness in the property market has continued to weigh on demand. Meanwhile, the central bank issued guidelines for state banks to provide loans to companies and major shareholders for stock repurchases as part of an effort to stabilize China’s share markets, which have languished in recent years. The loans, which can be made only by 21 designated financial institutions, will have a maximum interest rate of 2.25%, the People’s Bank of China said in a statement that underscored plans for strict oversight of the effort to support the markets. The news helped drive a rally in Shanghai, where the Composite index was up 2.1% at 3,232.14. The benchmark for the smaller market in the southern city of Shenzhen jumped 3.2%. Shanghai’s benchmark has gained 9% in the past three months, though it had surged much higher last month with the release of new measures to counter the slowdown, before falling back as investors registered their disappointment over a lack of big government spending initiatives. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index gained 2.2% to 20,519.78. Also Friday, China’s large state-run banks cut their deposit rates, to 0.1% from 0.15% for demand deposits and to 1.1% from 1.35% for longer term deposits. Elsewhere in Asia, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 edged 0.2% higher to 38,798.48 and the Kospi in Seoul shed 0.6% to 2,594.40. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 gave up 0.9% to 8,283.20. The Taiex in Taiwan gained 1.9% and the SET in Bangkok was up 0.2%. India's Sensex slipped 0.2%. On Thursday, U.S. stocks drifted around their record heights Thursday following the latest signals that the U.S. economy continues to hum. The S&amp;P 500 finished virtually unchanged at 5,841.47 after flirting with its all-time high for much of the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.4% to 43,239.05, besting its own record set the day before. The Nasdaq composite added less than 0.1% to 18,373.61. Nvidia and other companies in the chip industry were some of the market’s strongest after global heavyweight Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported bigger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. But a 1.4% slide for Google’s parent company, Alphabet, and a 10.6% tumble for Elevance Health helped keep stock indexes in check. Elevance reported weaker profit for the latest quarter than expected. CSX fell 6.7% after falling short of analysts’ profit expectations for the latest quarter. The railroad also expects only modest volume growth the rest of the year as the Southeast rebuilds after two major hurricanes. In the bond market, Treasury yields rose following the latest encouraging reports on the U.S. economy. U.S. retailers made more in sales in September than in August, and underlying growth trends within the data were better than economists expected. A separate report, meanwhile, said fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week, a signal that layoffs nationwide are relatively low and aren’t damaging the job market. Such data bolster the hope that the economy could make a perfect escape from the worst inflation in generations, one that ends without a recession that many investors had seen as nearly inevitable. And with the Federal Reserve now cutting interest rates to keep the economy humming, the expectation among optimists is that stocks can rise even further. Critics, meanwhile, are warning that stock prices look too expensive given how much faster they’ve climbed than corporate profits. The European Central Bank on Thursday cut its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point. That helped send stock indexes higher by 1.2% in France and 0.8% in Germany. In other dealings early Friday, U.S. benchmark crude oil gained 25 cents to $70.92 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, was 20 cents higher at $74.65 per barrel. The dollar fell to 149.85 Japanese yen from 150.21 yen. The euro rose to $1.0843 from $1.0827. ___ AP Business Writers Stan Choe and Matt Ott contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-china-rates-cbcdd41e7ecc8cee33e9cd0e7ad0a612	2024-10-17T21:00:45-07:00	
UK Foreign Secretary Lammy says engagement with China is necessary at start of 2-day visit	BEIJING (AP) — Britain's foreign secretary has called engagement with China 'pragmatic and necessary' as he makes he makes the first visit by a Cabinet minister since the Labor government took control in July. David Lammy met Friday with Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang and was to hold talks with Foreign Minister Wang Yi later the same day. His two-day trip is an attempt to reset ties with Beijing after relations turned frosty in recent years over spying allegations, China’s support for Russia in the Ukraine war and a crackdown on civil liberties in Hong Kong, a former British colony now part of China. 'From stopping Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine, to supporting a global green transition, we must speak often and candidly across both areas of contention as well as areas for cooperation in the U.K.’s national interest,' Lammy was quoted as saying in a Foreign Office news release. The release said that Lammy would urge China to stop its political and economic support of the Russian war effort. The U.S. sanctioned two Chinese companies on Thursday for allegedly helping Russia build long-range attack drones used in the war in Ukraine. The Chinese Embassy in Washington said the allegations were false. Lammy will also visit Shanghai, where he will meet with British business leaders, the Foreign Office release said. China including Hong Kong is the U.K.’s fourth largest trading partner. Human rights groups demanded that Lammy press the Chinese government over its crackdowns on dissent in Hong Kong, Xinjiang and Tibet. The spokesperson for Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that securing the release of British citizen Jimmy Lai is a priority. The Hong Kong media publisher has been in custoday since December 2020 and will testify next month in his defense at a landmark national security trial.	https://apnews.com/article/uk-china-foreign-secretary-lammy-visit-b6f7da40b721b069e7469fc7cf55eb6b	2024-10-17T19:54:34-07:00	
As Biden meets with European allies, the possibility of another Trump term hangs over their talks	BERLIN (AP) — Even in Germany, it's hard for President Joe Biden to escape the topic of Donald Trump. The U.S. president meets Friday with European allies for closed-door conversations about Russia's war in Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East. But with the U.S. presidential election just weeks away and the race extremely tight, there are worries that a Trump victory could upset the relationships that Biden is hoping to pass on to Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee. Trump, the Republican nominee, has an appetite for tariffing key U.S. security partners. He's expressed indifference to the security of Ukraine, refusing to say during a presidential debate if he wants the U.S. ally to win its war against Russia. He's voiced doubts about coming to the defense of NATO members if they come under attack. Speaking aboard Air Force One on the way to Berlin, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan rejected the notion that Biden wants to 'Trump-proof' U.S. foreign policy, because of the political implications of that term. But Sullivan's stated goals seem designed to thwart efforts by a potential Trump administration to stop military aid to Ukraine after more than two years of fighting. 'What the president is trying to do is to make our commitment to Ukraine sustainable and institutionalized for the long term,' Sullivan said. 'And every other ally agreed that that was the responsible thing to do.' But Sullivan cautioned that Biden ultimately can only speak for himself, not what his potential successor might do. 'What President Biden can do is what he’s done for four years, which is lay out his vision of America’s place in the world and point the way forward based on what he thinks are in America’s national security interests and in the interests of our close allies,' Sullivan said. 'Beyond that, he can’t speak for anyone else and doesn’t intend to.' Trump has said his approach will help the U.S. economy and prevent foreign countries from taking advantage of the United States. He maintains that if he were still president, Russia would never have invaded Ukraine in 2022 and Hamas would never have attacked Israel in 2023. 'I will end the war in Ukraine, stop the chaos in the Middle East, and prevent World War III,' he said at a recent rally in Georgia. 'I can do that.' At home, the president has verbally tussled with Trump over falsehoods tied to the government's relief efforts after hurricanes Helene and Milton, with Biden saying the willingness of Trump and his allies to spread misinformation was 'un-American.' Harris, for her part, has voiced strong backing for Ukraine and tracks with Biden on support for Israel, while placing particular emphasis on the need to relieve the suffering of Palestinian civilians whose lives have been upended by the Hamas war. Biden has long said that his message to foreign leaders is that 'America is back' and engaged with allies after Trump's time in office. But the U.S. president recalled being met with skepticism: 'The comment that I hear most of all from them is they say, ‘We see America is back but for how long? But for how long?’' Biden did not want his term to end without visiting the German capital of Berlin, after having been to visit other key allies such as Japan, South Korea, France, India, the United Kingdom, Poland and Ukraine. He will start his Friday by going to Bellevue Palace and meeting with German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier. Biden is then slated to receive Germany's Order of Merit, an honor that was also bestowed on former U.S. President George H.W. Bush for his support of German reunification. Biden will then meet with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, the head of Germany's government. Biden and Scholz will later meet with French President Emmanuel Macron and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer before the U.S. president jets home late Friday afternoon. Biden and Scholz plan to discuss next steps in Ukraine and developments in Israel and Gaza after the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. They also intend to touch on Lebanon and Iran, and coordinate their approaches to China as well as their respective industrial and innovation strategies. The pair are also set to talk about the development of artificial intelligence and renewable energy resources. While Biden wants to use the trip to emphasize the importance of democratic values, he has no plans to hold a news conference to answer questions from reporters. Sullivan pushed back against the idea that a news conference would reflect democratic values after reporters raised the subject with him aboard Air Force One. 'I mean, honestly, I think invoking democracy and suggesting that President Biden is somehow insufficiently committed to it because of the structure of his press engagement on one day in Germany is a bit ludicrous,' Sullivan said.	https://apnews.com/article/biden-germany-ukraine-trump-harris-047d46d4ef80804ebee515ee5d2d449c	2024-10-17T19:26:45-07:00	
Right-wing influencers hyped anti-Ukraine videos made by a TV producer also funded by Russian media	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Kremlin could not have asked for better publicity at a better time when Ben Swann, a self-described independent journalist who promotes conspiracy theories, released a 12-part video series he promised would reveal dark truths about Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Swann’s flashy documentary-style videos were filled with innuendo, attacks on Zelenskyy’s character and commentary from guests sympathetic to Russia in its two-year war with Ukraine. The series, titled 'Zelenskyy Unmasked,' launched in April as Congress was debating increasing military assistance to Ukraine, and it quickly caught the attention of conservative social media influencers who hyped the project to their millions of followers. Among those who promoted the series was Donald Trump Jr., the former president’s eldest son. 'Curious about the billions of dollars and weapons Congress sent Ukraine?' Trump Jr. posted on X, Truth Social and Threads. 'You need to watch the first episode of the explosive 12-part series.' Unlike other conservative media personalities who last month expressed shock upon learning they may have been secretly financed by the Kremlin, Swann has no such qualms. He's worked for Russia’s state-owned media empire for years, with one of his companies earning millions of dollars for producing Kremlin-friendly shows. The creation of 'Zelenskyy Unmasked' and its viral spread reveal how widely Russia-backed talking points are traveling on social media — a trend that concerns current and former U.S. intelligence officials and disinformation experts. An investigation by The Associated Press also provides insights into the shadowy and profitable world of political influencers who are not required to disclose who is paying them, raising transparency concerns about their political endorsements in the largely unregulated realm of social media. Swann brought on a digital marketing firm to publicize 'Zelenskyy Unmasked,' and at least one creator acknowledged he was paid to promote the series. Dire warnings about Russian interference in U.S. politics The revelations about Swann’s work for Russia come as U.S. authorities have issued increasingly dire warnings about the threat posed by Russian disinformation campaigns. In addition to undermining Ukraine, the Kremlin is seeking to disrupt the presidential election and sow discord in the U.S. and elsewhere in the West, those officials have said. U.S. officials are particularly concerned about Russia’s covert efforts to take advantage of unwitting Americans to spread Moscow’s message and use artificial intelligence to quickly tailor false content. Russia’s influence operation also appears aimed at boosting support for GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has criticized Ukraine and praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, the officials said. Trump has dismissed evidence of Russian influence operations, and he and many of his supporters have mocked the broader U.S. government effort to highlight Kremlin propaganda efforts. Registered agent Swann filed paperwork with the Justice Department two years ago to register one of his companies as working for Russian state media. In an interview with the AP, Swann said he has kept his work for Russian interests separate from what he produces for U.S. audiences. He has done this, Swann said, by operating two companies — one that generates content for Russian media and another that produces independent journalism, like 'Zelenskyy Unmasked,' for U.S. audiences. 'The only connection is that I own both companies,' Swann said. The AP, however, found that there was some overlap in how the two entities operated. A handful of guests on 'Zelenskyy Unmasked' also appeared on RT shows produced by Swann, according to a review of RT’s video archives and records filed with the Justice Department. Swann’s shows for U.S. audiences and RT also have similar themes. The Zelenskyy series, for example, echoed Russian state media’s messaging that the Ukrainian president is a would-be autocrat who has duped the West into supporting a conflict that Russia will inevitably win. From TV anchor to working for Russian state media Swann, 46, was a longtime TV journalist before he was fired from an Atlanta station in 2018 after promoting the debunked 'Pizzagate' conspiracy that alleged Democrats were abducting children to serve as sex slaves. He has since became a social media star who portrays himself as someone daring to ask uncomfortable questions on tough topics — revolving around unfounded claims such as whether the Sandy Hook school shooter acted alone, the coronavirus vaccine was a money-making ploy by big pharmaceutical companies, and Israel was a 'participant' in the massacre of Oct. 7, 2023. Swann joined Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s anti-vaccine organization, Children’s Health Defense, in a lawsuit pending against several news organizations, including the AP, accusing them of violating antitrust laws by taking action to identify misinformation, including about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines. Swann said he worked as a correspondent for RT America, a cable channel that was part of a Russian state media outlet, until it went off the air following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. RT officials then asked if he wanted to produce shows for the network to air outside the U.S., Swann said. 'I said, ‘Well, I can’t produce shows for the United States, but if these shows are for overseas, I’ll help you produce them.’ So I started doing that for them, and we’ve been doing that ever since,' Swann said in a July interview. Producing shows at RT's old U.S. studios Swann said he produced 10 shows a week using RT America’s old studios in Washington, and he stressed that those shows don’t air in the U.S. or Western Europe, although they are visible across the globe on RT’s website. Under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, individuals must register with the Justice Department when they seek to influence U.S. policy and public opinion on behalf of foreign governments. Not doing so can result in criminal charges. Swann’s company, Rebel Media Productions, first registered with the Justice Department in August 2022, saying it worked for RT’s parent company and related entities. The disclosures show Rebel Media Productions was paid more than $6 million in less than two years by RT-related entities. RT, formerly known as Russia Today, is a major player in Russia’s sprawling propaganda apparatus, and a target of U.S. efforts to block Moscow’s covert influence. The Justice Department has said RT has links to Russian intelligence agencies, while the U.S. State Department recently unveiled new sanctions on Russian state media. The sanctions target RT’s parent organization, TV Novosti, which Swann contracted with for his Russia-related work. Stopped reporting work for Russia to Justice Department In February, Swann stopped reporting Rebel Media’s work for Russia to the Justice Department, even as his company kept producing RT shows. Swann said he ended that registration with the Justice Department because his attorneys told him it wasn’t necessary, despite his company’s continued work for RT. 'They said, ‘Why are you making things more difficult for yourself?’' Swann said. In response to the recent sanctions, Swann said his company last month severed all ties to RT. 'While we disagree with the censorship of our journalists, who were doing quality work on behalf of our client, we have and will continue to respect the rule of law,' Swann said in a statement. The Justice Department declined to comment. U.S. content funded by wealthy individuals Swann said he creates content — like the 'Zelenskyy Unmasked' series — for American viewers through another company, Truth in Media. Truth in Media, Swann said, isn’t profitable and is funded by wealthy U.S. individuals whom he refused to name. 'Most of them own very large companies,' he said, 'if not publicly traded companies.' Swann said the large payouts he received from Russian state media had not influenced his work on 'Zelenskyy Unmasked,' but he acknowledged Russia’s leaders probably liked the series’ tough take on Ukraine’s president. 'I don’t know, I assume they don’t like Zelenskyy,' Swann said. Many of the guests interviewed in 'Zelenskyy Unmasked' have been RT contributors and guests on its programs. That includes RT contributor Tara Reade, who briefly moved to Moscow after accusing President Joe Biden of assaulting her in the 1990s; former Ukrainian diplomat Andrii Telizhenko, who was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury on allegations he had close ties to a 'Russia-linked foreign influence network'; and Russell Bentley, an American citizen known to have fought with Kremlin-backed separatists and worked for Russian state media, who died earlier this year in Ukraine. Another guest who has appeared on RT shows and in the Zelenskyy videos is Scott Ritter, a former U.N. weapons inspector sympathetic to Russia whose upstate New York home was raided in August by the FBI. Ritter told the AP that FBI agents in their questioning made clear that they were investigating his Russia-related work but did not ask specifically about his work with Swann. Ritter provided the AP with a copy of an email he said was from a booking producer for Swann’s RT shows asking him to appear in the Zelenskyy series. Ritter said an email invitation he received to participate in 'Zelenskyy Unmasked' indicated that its executive producer was Sean Stone, who hosted an RT show and is the son of the filmmaker Oliver Stone. Sean Stone did not respond to requests for comment, and Swann did not respond to a question about Stone’s involvement on the series. Swann said his RT-linked company had passed along guest contact details to his business producing 'Zelenskyy Unmasked.' The two entities did not share staff, he said. An ‘explosive’ series Truth in Media began teasing the 'Zelenskyy Unmasked' videos earlier this year on its website, writing the 'explosive' 12-part series would answer 'who is really benefitting from the $100 billion the U.S. has sent Ukraine.' At that time, hard-right congressional Republicans were fighting a proposal to send more money and weapons to Ukraine. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Mike Turner and House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, both Republicans, said some GOP lawmakers had been heavily influenced by Russian talking points. Turner said on CNN that some of those talking points were being 'uttered on the House floor.' To promote 'Zelenskyy Unmasked,' Swann said he paid for advertising on social media but believes the series received its most substantial boost in viewership thanks to promotion from conservative influencers. Swann's videos that were embedded in X posts garnered tens of millions of views. 'When you have different influencers that you can send it directly to, who can watch it for themselves, decide if they like it, and then share it, that’s a pretty powerful tool,' Swann said. 'That’s more powerful than the actual marketing of it on Meta or X.' With the assistance of the tech firm Bright Data, the AP identified a core group of influencers who played a significant role in helping promote the series. Posts by those influencers were shared by at least 9,300 other unique X accounts that have 33 million total followers, according to an AP analysis of 'Zelenskyy Unmasked' X data created by Syracuse University’s Institute for Democracy, Journalism and Citizenship. Influencers use nearly identical language to promote series The spread of 'Zelenskyy Unmasked' highlighted how such influencers are playing increasingly pivotal roles in politics, and many have become de facto campaign surrogates for Democratic and Republican candidates. Trump told a core group of conservative content creators — who met in a 'war room' during the last presidential debate — that they 'are more important than I am.' Some of those same influencers promoted the series, using identical or similar language to what Swann or Truth in Media promoted online. Chaya Raichik, the founder of the far-right Libs of TikTok social media accounts, echoed Truth in Media’s promotion of the series, tweeting: 'Where did $100 billion of our tax dollars that Congress sent to Ukraine go? Watch ‘Zelensky Unmasked’ to find out!' Raichik did not respond to requests for comment. When Truth In Media promoted the third episode in the series, it tweeted, 'The list of rich and powerful people profiting off the war in Ukraine includes President Biden and his son, but they’re far from the only ones.' A few days later, C.J. Pearson, co-chair of the Republican National Committee’s Youth Advisory Council, wrote the exact same thing in a tweet about 'Zelenskyy Unmasked.' Others who touted the series were former Trump campaign attorney Jenna Ellis; Morgonn McMichael, a young creator linked to the right-leaning group Talking Points USA; and Andrew Giuliani, a former New York gubernatorial hopeful and the son of Trump confidant Rudy Giuliani. Ellis, McMichael and Giuliani did not respond to requests for comment from the AP. Conservative influencer Xaviaer DuRousseau, another member of the RNC's Youth Advisory Council, said he was paid to promote 'Zelenskyy Unmasked' on X through Urban Legend, an influencer marketing firm led by a former Trump administration staffer. DuRousseau did not disclose how much he was paid, said he was unaware of Swann’s work for Russian state media until interviewed by the AP and said he would carefully consider any future collaborations. 'Is there maybe an ulterior motive to you being against Ukraine? Potentially,' he said. 'But I would stress myself out so much if I researched every single person in this industry that thoroughly, to be honest.' Swann said Truth in Media hired Urban Legend to help with marketing, but didn’t know the details of its work. 'We didn’t know whether or not they were talking to influencers,' Swann said in a statement. Urban Legend declined to discuss its financial relationships with specific influencers. The company said in a statement that it had been unaware of Swann’s ties to RT and would no longer work with Truth in Media. Among Swann’s most influential promoters was the former president’s son, Trump Jr., who did not respond to requests for comment from the AP. In a tweet on April 5, Trump Jr. hailed the series as 'explosive' for exposing 'the truth behind the war in Ukraine!' The social media platform’s users added a community note to his tweet that noted Swann's ties to Russia and said his claims 'are likely to be disinformation.' The warning did not seem to deter Trump Jr. A few days later, he again took to X to praise Swann's work — in identical language. ___ Associated Press data journalist Aaron Kessler in Washington contributed to this report. —- Contact AP’s global investigative team at Investigative@ap.org or https://www.ap.org/tips/	https://apnews.com/article/social-media-influencers-ben-swann-russia-trump-jr-ukraine-zelenskyy-9d4281756246b94eda05c478f3dac203	2024-10-17T19:11:34-07:00	
Russia flaunts its many doomsday weapons to keep the West from ramping up support for Ukraine	This year has seen President Vladimir Putin repeatedly brandish the nuclear sword, reminding everyone that Russia has the world’s largest atomic arsenal to try to deter the West from ramping up support for Ukraine. He ordered his military to hold drills involving battlefield nuclear weapons with ally Belarus. He announced Russia will start producing ground-based intermediate range missiles that were outlawed by a now-defunct U.S.-Soviet treaty in 1987. And last month, he lowered the threshold for unleashing his arsenal by revising the country’s nuclear doctrine. Putin is relying on those thousands of warheads and hundreds of missiles as an enormous doomsday machine to offset NATO's massive edge in conventional weapons to discourage what he sees as threats to Russia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. A look at Russia's atomic arsenal and the issues surrounding it: Russia's strategic weapons The Federation of American Scientists estimated this year that Russia has an inventory totaling 5,580 deployed and non-deployed nuclear warheads, while the U.S. has 5,044. Together, that’s about 88% of the world’s nuclear weapons. Most of these are strategic, or intercontinental-range weapons. Like the U.S., Russia has a nuclear triad of ground-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, long-range bombers and ICBM-armed submarines. Since Putin came to power in 2000, the Kremlin has worked to upgrade the Soviet-built components of the triad, deploying hundreds of new land-based missiles, commissioning new nuclear submarines and modernizing nuclear-capable bombers. Russia's effort to revamp its nuclear forces has helped prompt the U.S. to launch a costly modernization of its arsenal. Russia has reequipped its land-based strategic missile forces with mobile Yars ICBMs and recently began deploying the heavy, silo-based Sarmat ICBMs — designated 'Satan II' missiles in the West — to gradually replace about 40 Soviet-built R-36M missiles. Sarmat has had only one known successful test, and reportedly suffered a massive explosion during an abortive test last month. The navy commissioned seven new Borei-class atomic-powered submarines, each with 16 Bulava nuclear-tipped missiles, and plans to build five more. They are intended to form the core of the triad’s naval component alongside a few Soviet-era nuclear subs still operating. Russia still relies on Soviet-built Tu-95 and Tu-160 strategic bombers carrying nuclear-tipped cruise missiles. Moscow has restarted production of the supersonic Tu-160 that was halted after the 1991 Soviet collapse, aiming to build several dozen modernized aircraft with new engines and avionics. Russia's non-strategic nuclear weapons The U.S. estimates that Russia has between 1,000 and 2,000 non-strategic, or tactical, nuclear weapons intended for use on the battlefield that typically are far less powerful than the strategic warheads capable of destroying entire cities. Russia has high-precision ground-launched Iskander missiles with a range of up to 500 kilometers (310 miles), which can be fitted with either a conventional or a nuclear warhead. The air force has a fleet of MiG-31 fighter jets that carry a hypersonic Kinzhal missile, which can be equipped with a nuclear or conventional warhead. Russia has widely used conventional versions of both Iskander and Kinzhal against Ukraine. As part of the Kremlin’s nuclear messaging, Russia and ally Belarus held drills to train their troops with the battlefield nuclear weapons in May, shortly after Putin began his fifth term. MAD and Russia’s nuclear doctrine Moscow and Washington have relied for decades on nuclear deterrence under the concept of mutually assured destruction — MAD for short — based on the assumption that an overwhelming retaliation would discourage either side from launching an attack. Russia’s nuclear doctrine adopted in 2020 envisaged using such ultimate weapons in response to a nuclear strike or an attack with conventional weapons that threatens 'the very existence of the Russian state.' Moscow hawks criticized that document as too vague, urging Putin to toughen it. Last month, he warned the U.S. and NATO allies that allowing Ukraine to use Western-supplied longer-range weapons for strikes deep inside Russia would put NATO at war with his country. He reinforced the message by announcing a new version of the nuclear doctrine that considers a conventional attack on Russia by a nonnuclear nation that is supported by a nuclear power to be a joint attack on his country — a clear warning to the U.S. and other allies of Kyiv. Putin also declared the revised document envisages possible nuclear weapons use in case of a massive air attack, holding the door open to a potential nuclear response to any aerial assault — an ambiguity intended to deter the West. Changes in the doctrine suggest Russia 'is doubling down on its strategy of relying on nuclear weapons for coercive purposes' in the war in Ukraine, said Heather Williams, director of the Project on Nuclear Issues at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, in a commentary. The future for arms control The 2010 New START U.S.-Russian arms reduction treaty, the last remaining arms control pact between Moscow and Washington that expires in 2026, limits each country to no more than 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads and 700 deployed missiles and bombers. In February 2023, Putin suspended Russia’s participation in New START, but vowed that Russia would abide by its limits. In July, Putin declared Russia will launch production of ground-based intermediate range missiles that were banned under the now-defunct U.S. Soviet INF Treaty. The 1987 pact banned missiles with a range of 500 to 5,500 kilometers (310 to 3,410 miles). He said Moscow will respond in kind to the planned deployment of U.S. intermediate-range missiles to Germany, taking steps to 'mirror' Washington’s move. Even as U.S.-Russian tensions soared to their highest point since the Cold War amid fighting in Ukraine, Washington has urged Moscow to resume dialogue on nuclear arms control. Putin rejected the offer, saying such negotiations are meaningless while the U.S. is openly seeking to inflict a strategic defeat to Russia in Ukraine. Resuming nuclear testing Russian hawks are calling for a resumption of nuclear tests to demonstrate Moscow’s readiness to use its atomic arsenal and force the West to limit aid for Kyiv. Putin said Russia could resume testing if the U.S. does so first, a move that would end a global ban in place after the demise of the USSR. Last month, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said the nuclear test range on the Arctic archipelago of Novaya Zemlya is ready to resume tests if the U.S. does so. Prospective new weapons In 2018, Putin revealed an array of new weapons, claiming they would render any prospective U.S. missile defenses useless. They include the Avangard hypersonic glide vehicle, capable of flying 27 times faster than the speed of sound and making sharp maneuvers to dodge an enemy’s missile shield. The first such units have already entered service. Putin also mentioned the nuclear-armed and atomic-powered Poseidon underwater drone, designed to explode near coastlines and cause a radioactive tsunami. Earlier this year, he said Poseidon tests are nearing completion, without giving details. Also under development is an atomic-powered cruise missile, a concept that dates to the Cold War. But the missile, called the Burevestnik, or Petrel, has raised skepticism among experts, who cite technological obstacles and radiation safety concerns. During tests in 2019, an explosion at a naval range on the White Sea reportedly involving the Burevestnik killed five engineers and two servicemen, and caused a brief spike in radiation. Putin said this year its development was in the final stages and the military has reportedly built a base for the missiles in the Vologda region of northwestern Russia. —- The Associated Press receives support for nuclear security coverage from the Carnegie Corporation of New York and Outrider Foundation.

An American was reportedly kidnapped from a southern Philippine town and a search is underway	MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The Philippine police said Friday it has launched a search after gunmen reportedly abducted an American national, who was shot in the leg as he tried to resist before being spirited away from a southern Philippine coastal town by speedboat. If confirmed to be a case of kidnapping for ransom, it would be the latest reminder of the long-running security problems that have hounded the southern Philippines, the homeland of a Muslim minority in the largely Roman Catholic nation. Police in Sibuco town in the southern province of Zamboanga del Norte tried to pursue the suspected abductors and their victim, who they identified as Elliot Onil Eastman, 26, from Vermont, after the reported abduction on Thursday night. 'We confirm that there was a report of the alleged abduction of an American national,' the regional police said in a statement. 'We want to assure the public, particularly the community of Sibuco, that we are doing everything in our power to secure the safe recovery of the victim.' The police asked the public to immediately provide any information that could help an ongoing investigation of the reported abduction. Two police reports seen by The Associated Press said that a resident of Sibuco, Abdulmali Hamsiran Jala, reported to police that four men in black clothing who were armed with M16 rifles and introduced themselves as police officers forcibly took Eastman, who tried to escape. One of the gunmen shot Eastman in the leg before dragging him into a speedboat then fled by sea further south toward the provinces of Basilan or Sulu, the police reports said. Policemen chased but failed to find the gunmen and Eastman and alerted other police and Philippine marine units in the region, according to the reports. Philippine authorities did not immediately provide background details of Eastman, but a person with a similar name has posted pictures and videos of himself on Facebook saying he had married a Muslim woman in Sibuco. The U.S. Embassy in Manila did not immediately respond to questions about the reported abduction. The southern Philippines has bountiful resources but has long been hamstrung by stark poverty and an array of insurgents and outlaws. A 2014 peace agreement between the government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, the largest of several Muslim separatist groups, has considerably eased widespread fighting in the south. Relentless military offensives have weakened smaller armed groups like the notoriously violent Abu Sayyaf group over the years, considerably reducing kidnappings, bombings and other attacks. The Abu Sayyaf group, which is listed as a terrorist organization by the United States and the Philippines, is an offshoot of decades-long Muslim separatist unrest in the south and carried out mass kidnappings for ransom, beheadings and bombings more than two decades ago in the southern region. They targeted American and other Western tourists and religious missionaries, most of whom were freed after ransoms were paid. A few were killed, including an American who was beheaded on the island province of Basilan and a U.S. missionary who was killed while Philippine army forces were trying to rescue him and his wife in 2002 in a rainforest in Sirawai town near Sibuco. The Philippines will hold mid-term elections next year for more than 18,000 local, national and congressional posts, mostly provincial mayors and governors. In the traditionally volatile south, crimes including kidnappings and extortion have traditionally spiked as rogue politicians try to raise funds to fuel their campaigns ahead of elections in the past but only a few and isolated incidents have been reported in recent years, according to authorities.	https://apnews.com/article/philippines-reported-abduction-american-sibuco-a7708d6483d43616df8cbddf65aed84e	2024-10-17T19:02:39-07:00	
Who is Prabowo Subianto, the former general who becomes Indonesia’s new president?	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — A wealthy ex-general with ties to both Indonesia’s popular outgoing president and the country's dictatorial past will be inaugurated as its leader Sunday. He has promised to continue his predecessor's widely popular policies, but his human rights record has activists, and some analysts, concerned about the future of Indonesia’s democracy. At the election in February, Prabowo Subianto, 73, presented himself as heir to the immensely popular President Joko Widodo, the first Indonesian president to emerge from outside the political and military elite. Subianto, who was then defense minister, vowed to continue the modernization agenda that has brought rapid growth and vaulted Indonesia into the ranks of middle-income countries. In a speech last month, Subianto, who’s also the chair of the Gerindra Party, reminded party members to always remain loyal to the nation, not to him. He also vowed his unwavering commitment to defend the people, even at the cost of his life. 'Once you smell I’m on the wrong path, please leave me,' Subianto said, 'My life, my oath … I want to die for the truth, I want to die defending my people, I want to die defending the poor, I want to die defending the honor of the Indonesian nation. I have no doubt.' But Subianto will enter office with unresolved questions about the costs of rapid growth for the environment and traditional communities, as well as his own links to torture, disappearances and other human rights abuses in the final years of the brutal Suharto dictatorship, which he served as a lieutenant general. Other than promising continuity, Subianto has laid out few concrete plans, leaving observers uncertain about what his election will mean for the country’s economy and its still-maturing democracy. A former rival of Widodo who lost two presidential races to him, Subianto embraced the popular leader to run as his heir, even choosing Widodo’s son as his running mate, a decision that ran up against constitutional age limits and has activists worried about an emerging political dynasty in the 25-year-old democracy. But for now, he appears to enjoy widespread support. He secured a majority in the election on Feb. 14, winning 59%, or more than 96 million votes in a three-way race, more than enough for victory without a runoff. Subianto was born in 1951 to one of Indonesia’s most powerful families, the third of four children. His father, Sumitro Djojohadikusumo, was an influential politician, and a minister under Presidents Sukarno and Suharto. Subianto’s father first worked for Sukarno, the leader of Indonesia’s quest for independence from the Dutch, as well as the first president. But Djojohadikusumo later turned against the leader and was forced into exile. Subianto spent most of his childhood overseas and speaks French, German, English and Dutch. The family returned to Indonesia after General Suharto came to power in 1967 following a failed left-wing coup. Suharto dealt brutally with dissenters and was accused of stealing billions of dollars of state funds for himself, family and close associates. Suharto dismissed the allegations even after leaving office in 1998. Subianto enrolled in Indonesia’s Military Academy in 1970, graduating in 1974 and serving in the military for nearly three decades. In 1976, Subianto joined the Indonesian National Army Special Force, called Kopassus, and was commander of a group that operated in what is now East Timor. Human rights groups have claimed that Subianto was involved in a series of human rights violations in East Timor in the 1980s and 1990s, when Indonesia occupied the now-independent nation. Subianto has denied those allegations. Subianto and other members of Kopassus were banned from traveling to the U.S. over the alleged human rights abuses they committed against the people of East Timor. The ban remained in place until 2020, when it was effectively lifted, enabling him to visit the U.S. as Indonesia’s defense minister. In 1983, he married Suharto’s daughter, Siti Hediati Hariyadi. Following further allegations of human rights abuses, Subianto was forced out of the military. He was dishonorably discharged in 1998, after Kopassus soldiers kidnapped and tortured political opponents of Suharto. Of 22 activists kidnapped that year, 13 remain missing. Several of his men were tried and convicted, but Subianto never faced trial. He never commented on these accusations but went into self-imposed exile in Jordan in 1998. A number of former democracy activists have joined his campaign, including Agus Jabo and Budiman Sudjatmiko, who in 1998 were listed as survivors of the abductions of democracy activists. Sudjatmiko left the governing Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle to join Subianto's campaign team. During a campaign event in January, he apologized publicly to the two former activists. 'I'm sorry ... I was chasing you in the past,' Subianto said, adding that he did so 'on the orders' of his superiors. Sudjatmiko said that reconciliation is necessary to move forward, and that international focus on Subianto’s human rights record was overblown. 'Developed countries don’t like leaders from developing countries who are brave, firm and strategic,' he said. Subianto returned from Jordan in 2008, and helped to found the Gerinda Party. He ran for the presidency twice, losing to Widodo both times. He refused to acknowledge the results at first, but accepted Widodo’s offer of the defense minister position in 2019, in a bid for unity. Adhi Priamarizki, a researcher at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, said that while many right activists have pointed out Subianto's checkered past, 'there are a lot of factors that actually can affect how he can or he will govern the country.' 'I would say that there’s going to be a good check and balance system, hopefully, fingers crossed,' Priamarizki said, 'But the most important thing is to ensure that civil society has space in order to provide or to be at the check and balance systems.' In the most recent election, Subianto respected the democratic process. He has vowed to continue Widodo’s economic development plans, which capitalized on Indonesia’s abundant nickel, coal, oil and gas reserves, leading Southeast Asia’s biggest economy through a decade of rapid growth and modernization that vastly expanded its networks of roads and railways. That includes includes the $30 billion project to build a new capitol city called Nusantara. A report by a coalition of NGOs claimed that Subianto’s family would profit from the Nusantara project, thanks to land and mining interests the family holds on East Kalimantan, the province where the new city is located. A member of the family denied the report’s allegations. Subianto and his family also have business ties to Indonesia’s palm oil, coal and gas, mining, agriculture and fishery industries. The former rivals became tacit allies: Indonesian presidents don’t typically endorse candidates, but Subianto chose Widodo’s son, 36-year-old Surakarta Mayor Gibran Rakabuming Raka, as his vice presidential running mate, and Widodo coyly favored Subianto over the candidate of his own former party. Subianto has also cultivated close ties with hard-line Islamists as a way of undermining Widodo in the 2014 and 2019 elections. But for the 2024 election, Subianto projected a softer image that has resonated with Indonesia’s large youth population, including videos of him dancing on stage and ads showing digital anime-like renderings of him roller-skating through Jakarta’s streets. 'We will be the president and vice president and government for all Indonesian people,' said Subianto during his victory speech. ___ Associated Press writer Edna Tarigan contributed to this report. ___ Find more AP Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific	https://apnews.com/article/indonesia-prabowo-subianto-general-president-8cd195ef82df36049db75cbc9bf1ca1d	2024-10-17T17:27:46-07:00

King Charles III's visit rekindles Australia's debate on ending ties to the British monarchy	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — King Charles III and Queen Camilla will arrive in Sydney on Friday for the first Australian visit by a reigning monarch in more than a decade, a trip that has rekindled debate about the nation’s constitutional links to Britain. The Sydney Opera House's iconic sails will be illuminated with images of previous royal visits to welcome the couple, whose six-day trip will be brief by royal standards. Charles, 75, is being treated for cancer, which led to the scaled-down itinerary. He is only the second reigning British monarch to visit Australia. His mother, Queen Elizabeth II, became the first 70 years ago. While the welcome will be warm, Australia's national and state leaders want the royals removed from their constitution. Monarchists expect the visit will strengthen Australians' connection to their sovereign. Opponents hope for a rejection of the concept that someone from the other side of the world is Australia's head of state. The Australian Republic Movement, which campaigns for an Australian citizen to replace the British monarch as head of state, likens the royal visit to a touring act in the entertainment industry. The ARM this week launched what it calls a campaign to 'Wave Goodbye to Royal Reign with Monarchy: The Farewell Oz Tour!' ARM co-chair Esther Anatolitis said royal visits to Australia were 'something of a show that comes to town.' 'Unfortunately, it is a reminder that Australia’s head of state isn’t full-time, isn’t Australian. It’s a part-time person based overseas who’s the head of state of numerous places,' Anatolitis told the AP. 'We say to Charles and Camilla: ‘Welcome, we hope you’re enjoying our country and good health and good spirits.’ But we also look forward to this being the final tour of a sitting Australian monarch and that when they come back to visit soon, we look forward to welcoming them as visiting dignitaries,' she added. Philip Benwell, national chair of the Australian Monarchist League, which campaigns for Australia’s constitutional links to Britain to be maintained, expects reaction to the royal couple will be overwhelmingly positive. 'Something like the royal visit brings the king closer in the minds of people, because we have an absent monarchy,' Benwell told the AP. 'The visit by the king brings it home that Australia is a constitutional monarchy and it has a king,' he added. Benwell is critical of the premiers of all six states, who have declined invitations to attend a reception for Charles in the national capital Canberra. The premiers each explained that they had more pressing engagements on the day such as cabinet meetings and overseas travel. 'It would be virtually incumbent upon the premiers to be in Canberra to meet him and pay their respects,' Benwell said. 'To not attend can be considered to be a snub, because this is not a normal visit. This is the first visit of a king ever to Australia.' Charles was drawn into Australia’s republic debate months before his visit. The Australian Republic Movement wrote to Charles in December last year requesting a meeting in Australia and for the king to advocate their cause. Buckingham Palace politely wrote back in March to say the king's meetings would be decided upon by the Australian government. A meeting with the ARM does not appear on the official itinerary. 'Whether Australia becomes a republic is ... a matter for the Australian public to decide,' said the letter from Buckingham Palace. The Associated Press has seen copies of both letters. Australians decided in a referendum in 1999 to retain Queen Elizabeth II as head of state. That result is widely regarded as a consequence of disagreement about how a president should be chosen rather than majority support for a monarch. After visiting Sydney and Canberra, which are 250 kilometers (155 miles apart), Charles will then travel to Samoa to open the annual Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. When his mother made the last of her 16 journeys to Australia in 2011 at the age of 85, she visited Canberra, Brisbane and Melbourne on the east coast before opening the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in the west coast city of Perth. Elizabeth's first grueling Australian tour at the age of 27 took in scores of far-flung Outback towns; an estimated 75% of the nation’s population turned out to see her. Australia then had a racially discriminatory policy that favored British immigrants. Immigration policy has been non-discriminatory since 1973 . Anatolitis noted that Australia is far more multicultural now, with most of the population either born overseas or with a overseas-born parent. 'In the ’50s, we didn’t have that global interconnectedness that we have now,' she said.	https://apnews.com/article/australia-king-charles-visit-sydney-dcb4baf655f28fc20068c5991f09f28f	2024-10-17T15:20:43-07:00

Kim stresses to North Korean troops they should treat South Korea as a hostile foreign enemy	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un reminded his troops to treat South Korea as a hostile foreign enemy and insisted that the North wouldn’t hesitate to attack its rival if the South infringes upon its sovereignty, state media said Friday. Kim’s comments at an army headquarters came after North Korea this week confirmed that it revised its constitution to define South Korea as 'a hostile state' and blew up front-line road and rail links that were once connected to the South. The steps punctuated Kim’s calls for North Korea to abandon its longstanding goals of reconciling with the South and reflect his intent to escalate tensions and increase leverage amid a deepening stalemate in diplomacy. Analysts see increasing risks of possible clashes along the rivals’ tense border areas, although it would be highly unlikely for the North to contemplate full-scale attacks in the face of superior U.S. and South Korean forces. During a visit to the headquarters of the North Korean People’s Army’s 2nd Corps on Thursday, Kim stressed to troops the importance of understanding that any use of offensive force against the South would constitute a 'legitimate retaliatory action against the hostile country, not the fellow countrymen.' He said the North’s detonation of the border road and rail sections on Tuesday demonstrated the North’s resolve to cut off persistent 'evil' relations with the South, which 'lasted century after century and the complete removal of the useless awareness about fellow countrymen and unreasonable idea of reunification.' He said the event was also a declaration that his troops wouldn’t hesitate to use physical force against the South, an 'apparent hostile country,' if it violates North Korea’s sovereignty, the North’s official Korean Central News Agency said. South Korea had no immediate comment on Kim’s remarks. North Korea has been making increasingly provocative threats against rival South Korea in recent weeks, including accusing the South of infiltrating drones to drop anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets over Pyongyang this month and threatening to attack if it happens again. South Korea has refused to confirm whether it sent drones but warned that North Korea will face an overwhelming response that would 'end its regime' if the safety of South Korean citizens is threatened. Tensions on the Korean Peninsula have spiked since 2022, as Kim used Russia’s war on Ukraine as a window to dial up his weapons testing activities and threats. Washington, Seoul and Tokyo have strengthened their combined military exercises in response and took steps to sharpen their nuclear deterrence strategies built around strategic U.S. assets. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol told the Associated Press earlier this month that North Korea will likely attempt to ramp up pressure with major provocations around the U.S. presidential elections in November, possibly including a long-range missile test or a nuclear test detonation, to grab Washington's attention. ___ Find more of AP's Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-kim-jong-un-south-hostile-foreign-state-troops-a24512f263dbd63f5f6eab8b569ab000	2024-10-17T14:31:53-07:00	
Efforts to combat deforestation in Colombia lag because of armed groups, report finds	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — Armed groups operating in Colombia's Amazon are tightening their grip on the region and that's stalling government efforts to tackle deforestation, according to a think tank report Thursday. The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) dissidents, known as EMC, have the ability to slow or accelerate deforestation at will, said the report by The International Crisis Group. Some of the former FARC members never signed and disagree with the 2016 FARC-Colombia peace deal. Others signed it but took up arms again, while others are new to the dissident ranks either as volunteers or forced fighters, said Rodrigo Botero, director of The Foundation for Conservation and Sustainable Development (FCDS). EMC is currently Colombia’s third largest armed group, with around 3,500 members. 'This group is the most directly responsible for deforestation in the last five years,' Botero said. 'More than half a million hectares have been lost in their control zones.' 'Over the last year,' he said, 'the EMC has given orders to the population to suspend deforestation, but this year they have increased it again.' More than 40% of Colombia is in the Amazon — an area roughly the size of Spain. The country has the world’s largest bird biodiversity. Fifteen percent of the Colombian Amazon has already been deforested, according to FCDS. Colombia’s first leftist administration under Gustavo Petro stakes much of its legitimacy on its environmental and peace agenda, Crisis Group researcher and report coauthor Bram Ebus told The Associated Press. 'However, as Colombia’s natural environment continues to suffer from the severe impacts of conflict dynamics and economic activities that fuel violence, his political legacy is at risk,' Ebus said. Colombia’s environment ministry said in a statement Thursday that saving the Amazon rainforest has been one of Petro’s main priorities and it has achieved a historic reduction of deforestation by 61% in the last two years. While acknowledging 'the difficulties with the dynamics of peace in the territory and the armed actors,' the ministry said it wants to build a forest development model that benefits Amazon communities, recovers the forest and stops illegal deforestation. Previous administrations opted for punitive measures against Amazon communities complicit in deforestation, while Petro offers incentives, proposing financial aid to support forest conservation and promote sustainable livelihoods, Ebus said. 'Nevertheless, the lack of territorial control hampers the implementation of these projects, as armed groups dominate the region, often preventing communities from benefiting from state-funded initiatives,' he said. The EMC is able to impose control over the forests through armed coercion, said Elizabeth Dickenson, Crisis Group senior analyst and report coauthor. She added that in late 2022 and March 2023 local commanders gave strict orders to communities to cease deforesting. 'Anyone who did would be subject to fines, forced community labor and even expulsion from the community,' Dickenson said. But early this year, the EMC lifted restrictions, so it could accelerate its revenue streams from deforestation, she said, adding that the group would force those deforesting to pay an extortion fee to operate. 'One of the things that was very alarming in researching this piece was the extent to which state authorities are not allowed to access areas that are under their (EMC) jurisdiction,' she said. 'So this includes national parks, protected areas.' Dialogue with the EMC is an uphill battle, Ebus said, noting the group has repeatedly violated previously agreed rules during ceasefires and blocked state agencies from entering territories under its control. 'If the Petro administration truly wants to protect the Amazon, it must first regain access to these areas, as armed groups currently are calling the shots,' he said. ___ Follow Steven Grattan on X: @sjgrattan __ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

What we know about Liam Payne's death, including some of the unanswered questions	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — Argentine authorities continue to investigate the death of former One Direction singer Liam Payne, who died Wednesday at age 31 after falling three stories from a hotel balcony in Buenos Aires. Payne was a beloved member of the group, which formed in 2010 after its members — Payne, Harry Styles, Niall Horan, Louis Tomlinson and Zayn Malik — auditioned for 'The X-Factor' singing competition series as solo acts and were brought together by judge Simon Cowell to form the band. They became one of the most successful boy bands of all time, with a loyal fan base of 'Directioners' and a meteoric rise to fame on par with Beatlemania. Here is what we know — and what remains unknown — about the star's untimely death. Police responded to hotel staff’s 911 call minutes before Payne’s fall Hotel staff at the Casa Sur Hotel in the chic Palermo neighborhood of Argentina’s capital where Payne was staying called the police Wednesday evening with concerns about a guest who they say was 'overwhelmed with drugs and alcohol.' Police rushed to the hotel and responded to the call just after 5 p.m. local time and they later confirmed they arrived just minutes before the fall. The hotel manager can be heard on a 911 call obtained by The Associated Press saying the guest was 'destroying the entire room' and added, 'We need you to send someone, please.' The manager’s voice became more anxious as the call went on, noting the room had a balcony. Prosecutors categorize Payne's death as 'suspicious' — here's why Officials said Payne's fall injuries alone were enough to cause his death, but prosecutors described Payne’s case as 'suspicious,' citing the likelihood that the star had been drinking alcohol and taking drugs. The office also confirmed all signs pointed to Payne being alone at the time of the incident and authorities have ordered a toxicology report. Whether the fall was intentional or accidental remains unknown, but the public prosecutor said the lack of defensive injuries on Payne’s hands indicated that 'he did not adopt a reflexive posture to protect himself and that he could have fallen into a state of semi- or total unconsciousness.' Police: Payne's hotel room was found in 'complete disarray' Buenos Aires police said they found Payne’s hotel room 'in complete disarray.' They saw 'various items broken' and recovered packs of clonazepam, a central nervous system depressant, energy supplements and other over-the-counter drugs strewn among his belongings. Forensics teams also reported that authorities recovered a whiskey bottle, lighter and cellphone from the internal courtyard where Payne’s body was found. Evidence collected from the scene, a statement from Argentine authorities added, suggested Payne 'was going through some kind of substance abuse episode.' In recent years, Payne had acknowledged struggling with alcoholism, saying in a YouTube video posted in July 2023 that he had been sober for six months after receiving treatment. Authorities continue to investigate Payne's death As police and prosecutors await the results of the toxicology report, they are continuing the investigation and trying to reconstruct Payne's final moments. Authorities said they took statements from three hotel employees and two women who had visited Payne in his hotel room hours before his fall. The two women had left the hotel by the time of the incident, the prosecution said. Payne's death spark media ethics questions as fake content swirls TMZ, a celebrity news site known for its scoops and tabloid sensibilities, initially included cropped photos of Payne's body after the fall that featured his identifying tattoos in their early reporting Wednesday. After receiving swift backlash, the site pulled the photos. In the updated version of the story, the outlet wrote, 'TMZ has seen a photo showing Liam’s body on the deck at the hotel with tables and chairs nearby' and proceeded to describe the tattoos and how the image helped to confirm early reports of Payne's death. Fans took to social media to express outrage at the outlet for its decision to share the photos. TMZ did not immediately return requests for comment. The photos are still circulating on social media, as well as a video of a man jumping from a building on fire that users are mistakenly taking as a video of Payne’s fall. Several other videos of falls or jumps from balconies have been circulating, as well. X’s 'community notes' feature, where readers can provide context and — in this case — debunk falsely represented content, are present on several, but not all posts. Here's how One Direction reacted to Payne's death The surviving members of One Direction — Horan, Tomlinson, Styles and Malik — put out a statement Thursday saying they are 'completely devastated' by Payne's death. 'In time, and when everyone is able to, there will be more to say. But for now, we will take some time to grieve and process the loss of our brother, who we loved dearly. The memories we shared with him will be treasured forever,' their statement concluded. Malik and Tomlinson also shared individual tributes on their Instagram pages Thursday, each writing again that Payne was a brother to them. ___ Huamani reported from Los Angeles.	https://apnews.com/article/liam-payne-death-what-to-know-83bd8655c4c70332d4a847b9d167f1fa	2024-10-17T13:38:18-07:00	
Indian government employee charged in foiled murder-for-hire plot in New York City	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department announced criminal charges Thursday against an Indian government employee in connection with a foiled plot to kill a Sikh separatist leader living in New York City. Vikash Yadav, 39, faces murder-for-hire charges in a planned killing that prosecutors first disclosed last year and have said was meant to precede a string of other politically motivated murders in the United States and Canada. Yadav remains at large, but in adding him to the indictment and releasing his name, the Biden administration sought to publicly call out the Indian government for criminal activity that has emerged as a significant point of tension between India and the West over the last year — culminating this week with a diplomatic flare-up with Canada and the expulsion of diplomats. 'The FBI will not tolerate acts of violence or other efforts to retaliate against those residing in the U.S. for exercising their constitutionally protected rights,' FBI Director Christopher Wray said in a statement. The criminal case was announced the same week as two members of an Indian inquiry committee investigating the plot were in Washington to meet with U.S. officials about the investigation. 'They did inform us that the individual who was named in the Justice Department indictment is no longer an employee of the Indian government,' State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters before the case against Yadav was unsealed. 'We are satisfied with cooperation. It continues to be an ongoing process. On Monday, Canada said it had identified India’s top diplomat in the country as a person of interest in the assassination of a Sikh activist there and expelled him and five other diplomats. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and police officials went public this week with allegations that Indian diplomats were targeting Sikh separatists in Canada by sharing information about them with their government back home. They said top Indian officials were then passing that information along to Indian organized crime groups who were targeting the activists, who are Canadian citizens, with drive-by shootings, extortions and even murder. India, for its part, has rejected the accusations as absurd, and its foreign ministry said it was expelling Canada’s acting high commissioner and five other diplomats in response. The murder-for-hire plot was first disclosed by federal prosecutors last year when they announced charges against a man, Nikhil Gupta, who was recruited by a then-unidentified Indian government employee to orchestrate the assassination of a Sikh separatist leader in New York. Gupta was extradited to the United States in June from the Czech Republic after his arrest in Prague last year. The rewritten indictment said Yadav recruited Gupta in May 2023 to arrange the assassination. It said Gupta, an Indian citizen who lived in India, contacted an individual at Yadav’s direction, believing the individual to be a criminal associate. Instead, the indictment said, the individual was a confidential source working with the Drug Enforcement Administration. Authorities said Yadav, a citizen and resident of India, directed the plot from India while he was employed by the Government of India’s Cabinet Secretariat, which houses India’s foreign intelligence service. Yadav has described his position as a 'Senior Field Officer' with responsibilities in 'Security Management' and 'Intelligence,' the Justice Department said. As the assassination plot was created in June 2023, Yadav gave Gupta personal information about the Sikh separatist leader, including his home address in New York City, his phone numbers and details about his day-to-day movements, which Gupta then passed along to the undercover DEA operative, according to court papers. Yadav directed Gupta to keep him updated regularly on the progress of the assassination plot, leading Gupta to send him surveillance photographs of the intended victim, Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, who advocated for the creation of a sovereign Sikh state. In a statement, Pannun said the indictment means the U.S. government has 'reassured its commitment to fundamental constitutional duty to protect the life, liberty and freedom of expression of the U.S. Citizen at home and abroad.' He added, 'The attempt on my life on American Soil is the blatant case of India’s transnational terrorism which has become a challenge to America’s sovereignty and threat to freedom of speech and democracy, which unequivocally proves that India believes in using bullets while pro Khalistan Sikhs believe in ballots.' ____ Neumeister reported from New York.	https://apnews.com/article/justice-department-india-murderforhire-a7621636336da5d15cdbad0d7a8ae562	2024-10-17T12:23:43-07:00	
One Direction were the internet's first boy band, and Liam Payne its grounding force	Liam Payne's voice is the first one heard in the culture-shifting boy band One Direction's debut single: 'What Makes You Beautiful' launches into a bouncy guitar riff, a cheeky and borderline gratuitous cowbell and then, Payne. 'You’re insecure, don’t know what for / You’re turning heads when you walk through the door,' he sings, in a few words assuring a cross-section of generations that he's got your back, girl, and you should like yourself a little bit more. Payne, who died Wednesday after falling from a hotel balcony in Buenos Aires, Argentina, at just 31, was also the last solo voice on the band's final single, 'History' — effectively opening and closing the monolithic run of one of the biggest boy bands of all time. While the exact circumstances of his death remain unclear — Buenos Aires police said in a statement that Payne 'had jumped from the balcony of his room,' although they didn't offer details on how they established that or whether it was intentional — in life, Payne was a critical part of the internet's first boy band, one that secured an indelible place in the hearts of millennial and Gen Z fans. How One Direction became the internet's first boy band Before One Direction became One Direction, its members auditioned for the U.K.'s 'The X Factor' separately. The judges decided to put five promising, but not yet excellent, boys into a group. They were Harry Styles, Niall Horan, Louis Tomlinson, Zayn Malik and Payne, who together finished third in the 2010 competition. As Rolling Stone contributing editor Rob Sheffield points out, it was an 'unprecedented' way for a boy band to get their start. 'They were sort of assigned to be together. And you don’t expect longevity out of that situation. Honestly, you don’t even expect one good pop record to come out of that situation,' he says. And yet, not only did it work, but One Direction essentially created 'a new template for pop stardom, really.' The show allowed Day 1 fans to follow their career before their official 2011 launch with 'What Makes You Beautiful.' Nascent fans could use rising social media platforms like Twitter and Tumblr to find community, draw attention to the group and, in the earliest days, speak directly to the members. 'I honestly made a Twitter so that I could keep up with One Direction, and that’s how I made so many different friends,' says Gabrielle Kopera, 28, a fan from California who remembers the band hosting livestreams and chats. 'Sometimes they would say something back and it was so much fun. I feel like that fan interaction doesn’t even happen anymore.' That feeling of accessibility reinforced the group's personality and relationship with fans, says Maura Johnston, a freelance music writer and Boston College adjunct instructor. 'The fact that they came up on this British TV show and they became this worldwide phenomenon, I don’t think that would have happened as acutely and as quickly and as immersive without social media, without Twitter or without people being able to mobilize around the globe,' she says. One Direction and their fans Millennial and Gen Z audiences practically grew up with One Direction, but the band was truly ubiquitous. That, Johnston says, is at least partially attributable to arriving in a very different media environment from today's. 'It was a lot more focused,' she says of the early 2010s. 'Algorithmic sorting of stuff hadn’t really taken hold. So, there was this broader, mass approach. ... They were one of the last gasps of that mass phenomenon, that anyone of any age, even if they weren't a fan, had to take notice to.' But it takes more than omnipresence to cultivate a loyal fanbase. And there were myriad reasons why listeners were attracted to One Direction. 'They were five very different musical personalities, along with five very different personalities,' says Sheffield. They broke the rules associated with traditional boy bands, too: 'They co-wrote many of their songs. They didn’t do, you know, corny, choreographed steps on stage,' he said. After the news of Payne's death, Kopera says she 'got so many messages from people I haven’t talked to in years reaching out because I think everyone kind of realized that it does feel like we just lost a family member.' That sentiment was mirrored in the masses of fans who gathered Wednesday outside Buenos Aires' Casa Sur Hotel, feeding a burgeoning makeshift memorial of flowers, candles and notes as police stood guard. 'I’ve always loved One Direction since I was little,' said Juana Relh, 18, outside Payne’s hotel. 'To see that he died and that there will never be another reunion of the boys is unbelievable, it kills me.' Liam Payne's place in the band, and its legacy Payne was a 'brooding' older brother-type in One Direction, says Johnston. He also co-wrote many songs, especially in their later career — like the Fleetwood Mac-channeling 'What A Feeling' and 'Fireproof.' 'He was this grounding force in the band,' Johnston says. In an Instagram tribute, Tomlinson called Payne 'the most vital part of One Direction.' 'His experience from a young age, his perfect pitch, his stage presence, his gift for writing. The list goes on. Thank you for shaping us Liam,' he wrote. 'I always remember that he was the responsible and the sensible one of the group, and I feel like he wore his heart on his sleeve,' Kopera says. Payne had recently been vocal about struggling with alcoholism, posting a YouTube video in July 2023 where he said he had been sober for six months after receiving treatment. Buenos Aires police said they found clonazepam — a central nervous system depressant — and other over-the-counter drugs in Payne's hotel room, along with a whiskey bottle in the courtyard where he was found. 'Looking at what happened to Liam, it just makes you feel even more sad, that it just feels like he needed help,' Kopera says. 'And it’s so scary to think about how the entertainment industry can just, like, eat up artists.' After One Direction disbanded in 2016, Payne's solo career — a single R&amp;B-pop album in 2019, 'LP1,' and a number of singles here and there — never took off the same way as some of his bandmates. He was 'the least successful,' Sheffield says. 'It’s safe to say that on the terms that he was going for, he didn’t really find what he wanted to do.' 'It's hard, transitioning from being a boy bander to be a pop star,' Johnston says. At Payne's solo shows, Sheffield explains, 'He would show a little montage of One Direction performing, which is the kind of thing you don’t do when you’re starting out as a solo artist. But fans took that in the spirit it was offered, which is a very generous statement that he’s like, ‘Yep, you’re here because of this history that we share, and I’m here because of that same history.’' Despite Payne's struggles and the tragedy of his death, Kopera is confident 'his legacy is going to always point back to One Direction.' For fans, the same is true. 'When I look back on One Direction, I’m like, that was my girlhood. One Direction was the soundtrack to growing up, and I’m so thankful for it,' she says. 'They really were just a group of normal boys.' ____ AP journalist Brooke Lefferts contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/one-direction-liam-payne-400a27d1ad01a3b53058aef8cbd38da4	2024-10-17T12:12:00-07:00	
Sinwar's killing opens up opportunity and much uncertainty for the war in Gaza	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel’s killing of Yahya Sinwar, Hamas’ top leader and the mastermind of the group’s Oct. 7 attack, is a dramatic turning point in the brutal yearlong war that it touched off. Sinwar’s killing on Thursday decapitates the Palestinian militant group that has already been reeling from months of assassinations up and down its ranks. And it is a potent symbolic achievement for Israel in its battle to destroy Hamas. The killing, coming just 10 days after Israelis and Palestinians marked a year since the deadliest fighting in their decades-old conflict erupted, could set the stage for how the remainder of the war plays out, or even prompt its conclusion — depending on how Israel and Hamas choose to proceed. Sinwar's death could serve as an off-ramp for Israel toward ending the war Sinwar, who was appointed head of Hamas after its previous leader was killed in a blast in July blamed on Israel, spent years building up Hamas’ military strength and is believed to have devised the Oct. 7, 2023, attack. After that assault, when Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people and abducted about 250 others, Israel pledged to destroy Hamas and kill each one of its leaders. With Sinwar at the top of that wanted list, his death is a major achievement for Israel. Analysts say Sinwar’s killing has presented Israel, which has struggled to articulate an exit strategy from Gaza, with an off-ramp to end the war. 'This would really be the cherry on the icing of the cake for Israel,' said Nomi Bar-Yaacov, an associate fellow of the International Security Program at the Chatham House think tank in London. 'It should be easier to reach a deal.' With the architect of the Oct. 7 attacks eliminated, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could now tell Israelis that one of the war's aims has been reached. Politically, that might allow him to be more flexible on a cease-fire deal that ends the war in exchange for hostages — a condition he has so far refused to accept, at least in part, critics say, because it could threaten his rule. Sinwar's death could have broader implications, depending on Israel's next moves Analysts said the achievement was such a gamechanger that it was an opportunity for Israel to signal that it is ready to end the fighting further afield in the region, including in Lebanon where Israel is battling Hezbollah. 'The opportunity to end the war entirely, as well as in Lebanon, ... it is entirely in our hands,' Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel’s National Security Council, told Israeli Channel 12 News, saying Israel must use Sinwar's death to present its conditions for ending the wars on both fronts. The families of hostages in Gaza had a similar message for Netanyahu. A group representing the families welcomed Sinwar's killing but recognizing the potential opportunity, called on Israel to reconcentrate its efforts toward negotiating a deal. 'Netanyahu, don't bury the hostages. Go now to the negotiators and the Israeli public and present a new Israeli initiative,' Einav Zangauker, whose son Matan is held in Gaza, said in a post on social media. Khaled Elgindy, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Middle East Institute think tank, cautioned that Netanyahu has shown few indications that he is looking for an end to the conflict, with the army intensifying its operations in the north of Gaza in recent weeks. 'The war ... is not over yet,' Netanyahu said in a video statement after the killing. Netanyahu rules with the support of two far-right parties that have threatened to topple the government if the war ends under a cease-fire deal. They repeated their opposition to a deal after Sinwar's killing. They are also supporters of establishing Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip, something the Israeli leader has publicly ruled out. Netanyahu, who is on trial for alleged corruption, has also seen his political fortunes rise throughout the war, after they plummeted in response to Hamas' attack last year. Prolonging the war allows him to enjoy boosts of support after whatever successes he notches. Other top Hamas officials may be more pliable Sinwar was seen as a hard-liner with close ties to Hamas’ armed wing, and throughout repeated cease-fire negotiations with Israel was seen as having the final word on any agreement for Gaza and the release of dozens of Israeli hostages. Sinwar's positions were directly at odds with Israel's. He stuck to demands for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and a lasting cease-fire — even as more than 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in the ongoing war, according to local officials, and much of the territory left in ruins. According to Elgindy, Sinwar’s death will likely give more flexibility and control to the group’s political leadership in Qatar. This includes Khalil al-Hayya and Khaled Mashaal, key Hamas delegates of the monthslong talks. Those leaders could be more responsive to pressure from Qatar, a key mediator that hosts some of Hamas' top leaders. Unlike Sinwar, these leaders are also not in hiding in Gaza, which could speed up progress on a deal. Hamas leaders have proved replaceable in the past For Hamas, Sinwar’s killing leaves a gaping hole in rhw militant group’s leadership, with its future in Gaza and beyond uncertain. It is a symbolic blow for a group already reeling from multiple assassinations of its leaders. An Israeli airstrike killed Marwan Issa, deputy leader of Hamas’ military wing in March. Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas' former political leader, was assassinated in the blast in Tehran in July blamed on Israel. Then in August, Israel said it killed Mohammed Deif, Hamas’ military chief and co-mastermind of the Oct. 7 attack, in an airstrike. Hamas has not confirmed that death. Elgindy called Sinwar's killing a 'major blow' to Hamas. But, he added, it was 'not fatal since everyone is replaceable.' Still, with so many leaders and commanders killed, at this point, it’s not clear who could fill his shoes. ___ Jeffery reported from Ramallah, West Bank.

US presidential election looms over IMF and World Bank annual meetings	WASHINGTON (AP) — Global finance leaders face a major uncertainty as they meet in Washington next week: Who will win the U.S. presidential election and shape the policies of the world’s biggest economy? Republican nominee former President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris have spoken little about their plans for the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. But their differing views on trade, tariffs and other economic issues will be on the minds of the finance leaders as they attend the financial institutions' annual meetings. IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva alluded to what’s at stake in a curtain-raiser speech Thursday ahead of the meetings. Without naming Trump, she warned that 'major players, driven by national security concerns, are increasingly resorting to industrial policy and protectionism, creating one trade restriction after another.' She said trade 'will not be the same engine of growth as before,' warning that trade restrictions are 'like pouring cold water on an already-lukewarm world economy.' Trump promises as president to impose a 60% tariff on all Chinese goods and a 'universal’’ tariff of 10% or 20% on everything else that enters the United States, insisting that the cost of taxing imported goods is absorbed by the foreign countries that produce those goods. However, mainstream economists say they actually amount to a tax on American consumers that would make the economy less efficient and send inflation surging in the United States. Trump has also embraced isolationism and heavily criticized multilateral institutions. During his first term, he signed an executive order to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, and replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. His administration blocked new appointments to the World Trade Organization appellate body as the terms of its judges expired, leaving the organization without a functional appellate body. World Bank President Ajay Banga, who also made a speech Thursday previewing the meetings, spoke directly about the election in a question-and-answer session with reporters. He credited Trump for increasing investment in the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development during his presidency, which offers loans to middle-income developing countries. 'Then the question will be, how will the nuances of each administration be different,' Banga said. 'I don't know yet so I'm not going to speculate on how to deal with them.' Harris has not specified her views on the World Bank or IMF, though even as she has embraced some tariffs, is more likely to continue the Biden administration approach favoring international cooperation over threats, The Biden-Harris administration has not eliminated tariffs imposed on China during the Trump administration and in May also slapped major tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, advanced batteries, solar cells, steel, aluminum and medical equipment. Harris met Banga in June 2023 when he began his five-year term as World Bank president and released a statement then that 'praised the steps taken to evolve the World Bank—including expanding its mission to include building resilience to global challenges like climate change, pandemics, fragility and conflict.' Georgieva who did not speak about the election directly in her speech, said: 'We live in a mistrustful, fragmented world where national security has risen to the top of the list of concerns for many countries. This has happened before — but never in a time of such high economic co-dependence. My argument is that we must not allow this reality to become an excuse to do nothing to prevent a further fracturing of the global economy.' ___	https://apnews.com/article/imf-world-bank-international-finance-2584e0b0c8c68698b1d4a43851d2a3a9	2024-10-17T10:58:53-07:00	
Homeland Security grants temporary status to Lebanese already in the United States	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration on Thursday announced temporary legal status for Lebanese citizens already in the United States, likely pleasing some Arab voters, including in the battleground state of Michigan. The announcement, together with an earlier offer in July, brings the number of Lebanese who will be able to stay in the country and become eligible for work authorization to about 11,000, according to the Homeland Security Department. The offer is for people already in the US on Wednesday and it is for a period of 18 months. Temporary Protected Status will allow Lebanese citizens to stay 'while the United States is in discussions to achieve a diplomatic solution for lasting stability and security across the Israel-Lebanon border,' Homeland Security said in a statement. They must have been in the United States on Wednesday. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have been forced to deal with conflict in Lebanon and across the Mideast in the final weeks of their White House campaign. Israeli forces and Hezbollah fighters have been clashing since Oct. 8, 2023, when the Lebanese militant group began firing rockets over the border in support of its ally Hamas in Gaza. In recent weeks, Israel has conducted a major aerial bombardment of Lebanon and a ground invasion that it says aims to push Hezbollah back from the border and allow displaced residents of northern Israel to return. Assad I. Turfe, deputy executive of Wayne County, Michigan, said TPS 'will provide critical support to Lebanese nationals, helping to reunite families here in America and offering relief from the challenges caused by the conflict.' Nearly 900,000 people were covered by TPS at the end of March, according to the Congressional Research Service. The 1990 law provides legal status to people already in the United States from countries hit by natural disasters or civil strife. In addition, some Palestinians, Lebanese, Liberians, and residents of Hong Kong living in the United States are covered by a similar program, called Deferred Enforcement Departure, which is run under the authority of the president instead of the Homeland Security Department.	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-immigration-temporary-protected-status-biden-f69bfbef8b43258ecf1860038d483e94	2024-10-17T09:36:59-07:00	
Harris says the killing of Sinwar is an opportunity 'to finally end the war in Gaza'	MILWAUKEE (AP) — Kamala Harris said Thursday that Israel's killing of Hamas' top leader offers 'an opportunity to finally end the war in Gaza,' talking plainly about next steps even as the pro-Palestinian demonstrators who gathered outside her campaign event underscored the complicated politics at play. The Democratic presidential nominee said the war 'must end such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom and self-determination.' 'It is time for the day after to begin,' she said, speaking from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee just moments after the White House released President Joe Biden's statement on the death of Yahya Sinwar. The administration's response to the killing of a chief architect of the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel was carefully choreographed, leaving room for the Harris to emphasize the push to end the war as she balances her loyalty to Biden. She's trying to shore up left flank voters who want to see an immediate end to the bloody conflict and have not said they will support her. With the presidential race at razor-thin margins and the election just a few weeks away, Harris is seeking to solidify support in battleground states. The Biden administration’s support for Israel has complicated her effort in metro Detroit, especially Dearborn, an area that is home to the nation’s largest Arab American community. The death earlier this month of a Dearborn resident killed in south Lebanon ignited anger in the traditionally Democratic area. Speaking Thursday in Flint, Michigan, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said she was hopeful for an end to the violence. 'Have the hostages returned and have a solution for long-term peace in the region. That’s everything that I think is so important. And, you know, any chance that we can do that, I think would be welcomed by so many people,' she said. At Harris' next stop in Wisconsin, at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse, students waiting for her said the end of the war was important. William Schauberger, a 24-year-old political science major, said he wasn't optimistic. 'Neither party will do really anything about it. I mean, especially when there were, you know, massive protests. And instead of doing anything about it, and trying to secure stuff, they just tended to, you know, ignore it and ... just denounce the protests,' he said. Harris has not proposed any policy shifts on Israel. But she has, of late, faced increasing pressure to articulate how she would govern differently from Biden. While Biden’s favorability ratings remain underwater, some of the biggest pieces of his legislative agenda, from infrastructure to lowering the costs of some prescription drugs, are popular, and signaling any daylight with the president on foreign policy at a time of global crises could be seen as reckless. Biden's written statement on Sinwar's death — released as he was traveling to Germany for a visit with Chancellor Olaf Scholz — focused on how U.S. intelligence helped the Israelis pursue Hamas leadership and noted that Israel had every right to 'eliminate the leadership and military structure of Hamas.' 'Today proves once again that no terrorists anywhere in the world can escape justice, no matter how long it takes,' Biden said. He said he would speak with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to 'congratulate them, to discuss the pathway for bringing the hostages home to their families and for ending this war once and for all, which has caused so much devastation to innocent people.' Israeli officials said Sinwar was killed in a battle with Israeli forces in Gaza. Foreign Minister Israel Katz called the killing a 'military and moral achievement for the Israeli army.' ___ Karnowski reported from La Crosse.

Biden says Sinwar's death is an 'opportunity' for a hostage deal and an end to war in Gaza	BERLIN (AP) — President Joe Biden said Thursday that the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar by Israeli troops is a 'good day for the world,' calling it an opportunity to free hostages held by the militant group and end the yearlong war in Gaza. 'Now’s the time to move on. ... Move toward a cease-fire in Gaza, make sure that we move in a direction that we’re able to make things better for the whole world,' Biden told reporters as he arrived in Berlin for a short visit. 'It’s time for this war to end and bring these hostages home. That’s what we’re ready to do.' U.S. officials expressed such measured optimism that the killing of a militant characterized by national security adviser Jake Sullivan as a 'massive obstacle to peace' might breathe new life into cease-fire talks that have failed to produce a breakthrough for months despite periodic signs of progress. 'Over the past few weeks, there have been no negotiations for an end to the war because Sinwar has refused to negotiate,' State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters. 'We now see an opportunity with him having been removed from the battlefield, being removed from the leadership of Hamas, and we want to seize that opportunity.' Biden spoke by phone with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to congratulate him on the mission that killed Sinwar. They also discussed 'how to use this moment to bring the hostages home and to bring the war to a close with Israel’s security assured and Hamas never again able to control Gaza,' according to a White House summary of the call. However, Netanyahu said Thursday that 'our war has not yet ended.' Besides seeking the release of hostages, Netanyahu has said Israel must keep long-term control over Gaza to ensure Hamas does not rearm — opening the possibility of continued fighting. Biden said he would be sending Secretary of State Antony Blinken to Israel in the coming days. In an earlier statement, the president compared the reaction to Sinwar's death to the feeling in the U.S. after the killing of al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden, who was responsible for the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. He said the killing of the mastermind of the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks on Israel 'proves once again that no terrorists anywhere in the world can escape justice, no matter how long it takes.' The inability to reach a cease-fire in Gaza and deliver the return of the hostages has bedeviled negotiators from the start. Hamas militants killed some 1,200 people in Israel in the attacks that launched the war and took about 250 hostage. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, about a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel's retaliatory offensive has destroyed much of the Gaza Strip and killed more than 42,000 Palestinians. The Gaza Health Ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but says more than half of those killed were women and children. The U.S. has been working with fellow mediators Egypt and Qatar on a cease-fire proposal since the war began a year ago, sending Blinken and other envoys to the Middle East multiple times to try to broker a deal without success. Last month, on Blinken’s 10th trip to the region since the war in Gaza began, he skipped Israel and withheld optimistic projections of a breakthrough. 'On multiple occasions over the past months, Sinwar rebuffed efforts by the United States and its partners to bring this war to a close through an agreement that would return the hostages to their families and alleviate the suffering of the Palestinian people,' Blinken said in a statement Thursday. The halting progress and seemingly conflicting priorities have caused friction in the Biden-Netanyahu relationship as the Israeli leader's pledge to achieve 'total victory' against Hamas has clashed with U.S. officials' concerns about large-scale civilian casualties in Gaza. Israeli leaders presented the killing of Sinwar as a moment for Hamas to surrender. The Biden administration also had urgently called for an immediate cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah to avoid the possibility of all-out war in the Middle East before shifting its message after Israel killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in an airstrike and pressed ahead with a ground invasion in Lebanon. Biden said with Sinwar’s death 'there is now the opportunity for a ‘day after’ in Gaza without Hamas in power, and for a political settlement that provides a better future for Israelis and Palestinians alike.' He praised U.S. special operations forces and intelligence operatives who helped advise Israeli allies on tracking and locating Sinwar and other Hamas leaders over the past year — though the U.S. said the operation that killed Sinwar was an Israeli one. Sullivan said Sinwar's removal from the battlefield does present an opportunity to find a way forward that gets the hostages home.' 'Now we will have to work to ensure that his death actually does deal the kind of long-term blow to Hamas that of all of us would like to see,' he said. ___ Miller reported from Washington.

Tech firms remove social media accounts of a Russian drone factory after an AP investigation	Google, Meta and TikTok have removed social media accounts belonging to an industrial plant in Russia's Tatarstan region aimed at recruiting young foreign women to make drones for Moscow's war in Ukraine. Posts on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok were taken down following an investigation by The Associated Press published Oct. 10 that detailed working conditions in the drone factory in the Alabuga Special Economic Zone, which is under U.S. and British sanctions. Videos and other posts on the social media platforms promised the young women, who are largely from Africa, a free plane ticket to Russia and a salary of more than $500 a month following their recruitment via the program called 'Alabuga Start.' But instead of a work-study program in areas like hospitality and catering, some of them said they learned only arriving in the Tatarstan region that they would be toiling in a factory to make weapons of war, assembling thousands of Iranian-designed attack drones to be launched into Ukraine. In interviews with AP, some of the women who worked in the complex complained of long hours under constant surveillance, of broken promises about wages and areas of study, and of working with caustic chemicals that left their skin pockmarked and itching. AP did not identify them by name or nationality out of concern for their safety. The tech companies also removed accounts for Alabuga Polytechnic, a vocational boarding school for Russians aged 16-18 and Central Asians aged 18-22 that bills its graduates as experts in drone production. The accounts collectively had at least 158,344 followers while one page on TikTok had more than a million likes. In a statement, YouTube said its parent company Google is committed to sanctions and trade compliance and 'after review and consistent with our policies, we terminated channels associated with Alabuga Special Economic Zone.' Meta said it removed accounts on Facebook and Instagram that 'violate our policies.' The company said it was committed to complying with sanctions laws and said it recognized that human exploitation is a serious problem which required a multifaceted approach, including at Meta. It said it had teams dedicated to anti-trafficking efforts and aimed to remove those seeking to abuse its platforms. TikTok said it removed videos and accounts which violated its community guidelines, which state it does not allow content that is used for the recruitment of victims, coordination of their transport, and their exploitation using force, fraud, coercion, or deception. The women aged 18-22 were recruited to fill an urgent labor shortage in wartime Russia. They are from places like Uganda, Rwanda, Kenya, South Sudan, Sierra Leone and Nigeria, as well as the South Asian country of Sri Lanka. The drive also is expanding to elsewhere in Asia as well as Latin America. Accounts affiliated to Alabuga with tens of thousands of followers are still accessible on Telegram, which did not reply to a request for comment. The plant's management also did not respond to AP. The Alabuga Start recruiting drive used a robust social media campaign of slickly edited videos with upbeat music that show African women smiling while cleaning floors, wearing hard hats while directing cranes, and donning protective equipment to apply paint or chemicals. Videos also showed them enjoying Tatarstan's cultural sites or playing sports. None of the videos made it clear the women would be working in a drone manufacturing complex. Online, Alabuga promoted visits to the industrial area by foreign dignitaries, including some from Brazil, Sri Lanka and Burkina Faso. In a since-deleted Instagram post, a Turkish diplomat who visited the plant had compared Alabuga Polytechnic to colleges in Turkey and pronounced it 'much more developed and high-tech.' According to Russian investigative outlets Protokol and Razvorot, some pupils at Alabuga Polytechnic are as young as 15 and have complained of poor working conditions. Videos previously on the platforms showed the vocational school students in team-building exercises such as 'military-patriotic' paintball matches and recreating historic Soviet battles while wearing camouflage. Last month, Alabuga Start said on Telegram its 'audience has grown significantly!' That could be due to its hiring of influencers, who promoted the site on TikTok and Instagram as an easy way for young women to make money after leaving school. TikTok removed two videos promoting Alabuga after publication of the AP investigation. Experts told AP that about 90% of the women recruited via the Alabuga Start program work in drone manufacturing.	https://apnews.com/article/alabuga-russia-africa-ukraine-war-shahed-drones-bc175c4c98d752dc298c23434637417e	2024-10-17T09:19:37-07:00	
Committee reviewing euthanasia in Canada finds some deaths driven by homelessness fears, isolation	LONDON (AP) — An expert committee reviewing euthanasia deaths in Canada’s most populous province has identified several cases where patients asked to be killed in part for social reasons such as isolation and fears of homelessness, raising concerns over approvals for vulnerable people in the country's assisted dying system. Ontario’s chief coroner issued several reports Wednesday — after an Associated Press investigation based in part on data provided in one of the documents — reviewing the euthanasia deaths of people who weren’t terminally ill. The expert committee's reports are based on an analysis of anonymized cases, chosen for their implications for future euthanasia requests. Canada’s legal criteria require a medical reason for euthanasia — a fatal diagnosis or unmanageable pain — but the committee's reports show cases where people were euthanized based on other factors including an 'unmet social need.' AP's investigation found doctors and nurses privately struggling with euthanasia requests from vulnerable people whose suffering might be addressed by money, social connections or adequate housing. Providers expressed deep discomfort with ending the lives of vulnerable people whose deaths were avoidable, even if they met the criteria in Canada's euthanasia system, known nationally as MAiD, for medical assistance in dying. 'To finally have a government report that recognizes these cases of concern is extremely important,' said Dr. Ramona Coelho, a doctor on the expert committee. 'We’ve been gaslit for so many years when we raised fears about people getting MAiD because they were poor, disabled or socially isolated.' In the case of a man identified as Mr. A, Ontario's expert committee questioned whether authorities tried hard enough to relieve his pain before he was euthanized. Mr. A was an unemployed man in his 40s with bowel disease and a history of substance abuse and mental illness. He was described as 'socially vulnerable and isolated.' Some committee members were alarmed that a psychiatrist suggested euthanasia during a mental health assessment. Mr. A was eventually picked up and driven to the location where he was killed by the health professional who euthanized him — a transgression of professional boundaries, according to some committee members. They said that might have 'created pressure and gave rise to a perception of hastening a person towards death.' Another case detailed Ms. B, a woman in her 50s suffering from multiple chemical sensitivity syndrome, with a history of mental illness including suicidality and post-traumatic stress disorder. She was socially isolated and asked to die largely because she could not get proper housing, according to the report. Committee members couldn’t agree whether her death was justified; some said that because her inadequate housing was the main reason for her suffering, she should have been disqualified from euthanasia. Others argued that 'social needs may be considered irremediable' if other options have been explored. Dr. Sonu Gaind, professor of medicine at the University of Toronto, said the coroner’s reports are alarming for numerous reasons, notably the handling of mental health conditions in those seeking euthanasia. 'What we’re doing in many cases is the opposite of suicide prevention,' he said, citing an example of a man in his 40s who had previously tried to kill himself and did not have a definitive diagnosis when his euthanasia was approved. Dr. Scott Kim, a physician and bioethicist at the National Institutes of Health in Washington, said the real issue is the permissive nature of Canada's law. Despite polls showing widespread support for expanding euthanasia access, he questioned whether most Canadians understand what is allowed and said it's 'baffling' that officials hadn't previously considered these issues. The expert committee made numerous recommendations, including assigning patient advocates to support people considering euthanasia and providing more guidance to doctors and nurses who assess requests from nonterminal patients. The committee noted that legally mandated safeguards likely were not met in nearly 2% of cases. Despite that, experts say, no doctors or nurses have ever been prosecuted. Trudo Lemmens, professor of health law and policy at the University of Toronto, said medical professional bodies and judicial authorities in Canada appeared 'unwilling to curtail practices that appear ethically problematic.' 'Either the law is too broad, or the professional guidance not precise enough,' Lemmens said. 'Or it is simply not seen as a priority to protect some of our most vulnerable citizens.' So far, Ontario is the only province or territory in Canada to release summaries of cases that could signal problems in euthanasia approvals. AP’s investigation also found data suggesting a significant number of people euthanized in Ontario when they weren't dying live in the province's poorest and most deprived areas. On Wednesday, the Ontario coroner released that as well, showing that people asking to be killed were more likely to require disability support and be socially isolated. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

Blaze ravages a brand new fire station in Germany that lacked a fire alarm	BERLIN (AP) — A brand new fire station in Germany, which was destroyed in a fire, causing millions of euros in damage and destroyed equipment did not have a fire alarm system, local media reported Thursday. The fire broke out early Wednesday morning at the Stadtallendorf fire station in Hesse and destroyed, among other things, the equipment hall and almost a dozen emergency vehicles, German news agency dpa reported. Initial estimates put the damage at between 20 million and 24 million euros ($21 million to $26 million). No one was injured. Local officials told dpa that no fire alarm system was installed in the building because experts had considered it not necessary — much to the astonishment of many observers now that the station has burned down. The fire broke out on an emergency vehicle belonging to the fire department, which contained lithium-ion batteries and an external power connection. The station opened less than a year ago, local media reported. 'I believe that what has happened will make many people think and act,' about improving fire protection requirements at fire stations, Norbert Fischer, the head of the State Fire Brigade Association of the state of Hesse, told dpa. Precisely because there is a lot of technology in fire stations and batteries are being charged, it would make sense to equip them with fire alarm systems, Fischer said, noting it was unclear whether such a system could have prevented the worst in Stadtallendorf. 'This fire spread at breakneck speed,' he said.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-fire-station-fire-alarm-system-blaze-f5abcb52a75886705a77fca5bc6bfd9b	2024-10-17T08:00:41-07:00	
Liam Payne and his bandmates all sought solo success after One Direction fame	LONDON (AP) — One Direction was one of the last boy bands from the age of mass-audience linear television and one of the first of the social media era. That helped propel them to a level of fame comparable to Beatlemania, but with the constant scrutiny of a world of smartphones and streaming. The band members, still in their teens, had to cope with the fame, then navigate the aftermath of its split while trying to build solo careers — challenges that have received renewed attention in the wake of band member Liam Payne's death on Wednesday. One Direction was put together by music mogul Simon Cowell after the teens auditioned separately for TV talent show 'The X-Factor' in 2010. They didn’t win, instead coming third in a final watched by 17 million people in the U.K., a quarter of the population. But they were signed by Cowell and had the first of several No. 1 hits with the now-pop classic 'What Makes You Beautiful' in 2012. British radio host Kevin Hughes called them 'one of the biggest selling U.K. bands since The Beatles, a huge global export and one of the biggest selling pop acts of the 21st century.' One Direction’s appeal rested partly on the members’ cheerful, cheeky ordinariness. The late filmmaker Morgan Spurlock said when he directed a documentary about One Direction in 2013 that 'part of the reason they’ve been so incredibly successful with their fans is that they are so incredibly grounded and normal.' After five studio albums and 70 million records sold, One Direction announced an indefinite hiatus in 2016. All the members embarked on solo careers, with varying degrees of success. LIAM PAYNE Payne, who died at 31 after falling from a hotel balcony in Argentina, became one of the main songwriters on One Direction’s albums. His first solo single, 'Strip that Down,' a power pop track featuring rapper Quavo, was a Top 10 hit in Britain in 2017. 'For You,' performed with Rita Ora, was a U.K. hit in 2018. Payne’s debut solo album, 'LP1,' was released in 2019, but didn’t make the U.S. Top 100. Payne had a son, now 7, with the former 'Girls Aloud' singer Cheryl — an 'X Factor' judge during One Direction's season. He was open about struggling with his mental health amid the pressures of fame. He spent time in rehab for alcoholism and in hospital with what he said were kidney problems. After a period of silence, Payne returned with a new single, 'Teardrops,' in March, saying in a statement that it 'marks the start of a new beginning.' The song failed to chart and a second album was reportedly put on hold before his death. ZAYN MALIK Malik precipitated One Direction’s demise when he left the group in 2015, saying he wanted 'to be a normal 22-year-old' for a while. His first solo single, 'Pillowtalk,' was released early in 2016 and topped the charts in both the U.S. and Britain. A duet with Taylor Swift, 'I Don’t Wanna Live Forever,' was a hit late the same year. Malik has released the solo albums 'Mind of Mine' in 2016, 'Icarus Falls' in 2018, 'Nobody is Listening' in 2021 and 'Room Under the Stairs' this year. The most recent adds a country sound to the R&amp;B-pop on which he’s built his career. Malik, who has spoken of struggles with anxiety and anorexia, has a daughter, born in 2020, with his on-off partner, model Gigi Hadid. In 2021, he was sentenced to 90 days’ probation after pleading no contest to harassing Hadid and her mother during an argument at the family home in Pennsylvania. NIALL HORAN The affable Irish member of One Direction released his first single, 'This Town,' in 2016, and debut album 'Flicker' the following year. Showcasing Horan’s talent for tuneful pop, it topped Billboard’s album chart. A second album, 'Heartbreak Weather,' came out in 2020 and a third, 'The Show,' was released in 2023, accompanied by a world tour this year — including a concert in Buenos Aires earlier this month attended by Payne. Horan has also served as a coach on TV talent series 'The Voice' in the U.S. LOUIS TOMLINSON Tomlinson made his solo debut with the single 'Just Hold On' in 2016. Several more singles followed before his debut album, 'Walls,' was released in 2020. It was a Top 10 hit in the U.S. and the U.K., as was his second album, 'Faith in the Future,' released in late 2022. Tomlinson released a live album, 'Live,' in 2024. In 2018, he appeared as a judge on 'The X Factor,' the show that made him famous. Tomlinson's other great love is soccer. He briefly played for his home town team, Doncaster Rovers, and he has been involved with the Soccer Aid charity fundraiser for UNICEF. He has a child with ex-girlfriend Briana Jungwirth. HARRY STYLES Musician, actor and style icon, Harry Styles is easily the biggest solo star spawned by One Direction. He released his first single, 'Sign of the Times,' later than the others, in 2017, but soon made up for lost time. His debut album, 'Harry Styles,' topped the album charts in the U.S., Britain and several other countries, while the second, 'Fine Line,' appeared in 2019 and included the Grammy-winning 'Watermelon Sugar.' His third album, 2022's 'Harry’s House,' topped British and U.S. charts, won album of the year at the Grammys and the Brit Awards, and was nominated for the cred-heavy Mercury Prize. The single 'As it Was' became his biggest hit yet, topping the Billboard Hot 100 for 15 weeks. Styles’ profile has been raised by a playful, adventurous fashion sense that includes a fondness for 1970s-inspired three-piece suits and bellbottomed jumpsuits. As an actor, Styles appeared as a World War II soldier in Christopher Nolan’s 'Dunkirk' before starring alongside Florence Pugh in Olivia Wilde’s dystopian thriller 'Don’t Worry Darling.' It premiered at the 2022 Venice Film Festival, where Styles’ red-carpet appearance drew throng of fans and the approving appraisal of fashionistas. He also starred in period romance 'My Policeman,' which premiered at the 2022 Toronto International Film Festival.	https://apnews.com/article/one-direction-members-solo-careers-liam-payne-188f5c6a452cad49abdbe492fae39b64	2024-10-17T06:38:44-07:00	
7 killed in suicide bomber attack at a cafe in Somalia's capital	MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) — Seven people died and six others were injured after a suicide bomber detonated an unidentified device at a café outside a police training school in Somalia’s capital, Mogadishu, police said Thursday. Police say the victims included officers and civilians who were having tea outside the General Kaahiye Police Academy on Thursday. The al-Qaeda linked militant group, al-Shabab, claimed responsibility for the attack through a statement published on its affiliate website. The group has in the past carried out attacks in Somalia. Resident Mohamed Ali said he heard a loud blast. 'The café was full of people enjoying their tea, and then everything was chaos,' he said. A paramedic at Madina Hospital told The Associated Press that several injured people were receiving treatment. 'We are working to rehabilitate the wounded, many of whom sustained severe injuries,' she said. Thursday's attack came two months after 37 people were killed in an attack on a public beach in Mogadishu. Somalia has been taking over security responsibilities from foreign troops who had been deployed under the African Transition Mission in Somalia, whose mandate ends in December.	https://apnews.com/article/somalia-alshabab-attack-mogadishu-216e2525751ebc2c489dce3881d5e9de	2024-10-17T06:15:41-07:00	
US imposes sanctions on Chinese companies accused of helping make Russian attack drones	WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Treasury on Thursday announced sanctions against two Chinese makers of drone engines and parts that the Biden administration said directly helped Russia build long-range attack drones used in the war in Ukraine. The U.S. has previously accused China of providing material support to Russia's military-industrial base to sustain the Kremlin's war against Ukraine, and the latest round of sanctions sought to target the 'direct activity' between Beijing and Moscow, according to senior Biden administration officials, who discussed the sanctions on the condition of anonymity before the measures were announced. Russia’s Garpiya series long-range attack drone, 'designed and produced in the People’s Republic of China in collaboration with Russian defense firms, has been used to destroy critical infrastructure and has resulted in mass casualties' during the war in Ukraine, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said in a statement. Beijing has insisted that it does not provide weapons to either Ukraine or Russia, and it has defended its trade with Russia as normal and above the board. The U.S. is imposing sanctions on Xiamen Limbach Aircraft Engine Company, which produces drone engines, and Redlepus Vector Industry, which has worked with a Russian entity already facing sanctions to facilitate the shipment of the drones to Russia. The administration officials said China should have known that the Russian entity, TSK Vektor, was a 'problematic actor.' They indicated that the two Chinese firms had been developing long-range attack drones with the Russians since the beginning of the year. The administration also announced sanctions against Artem Mikhailovich Yamshchikov, a Russian national described as the beneficial owner of TSK Vektor, and the Russian entity TD Vector, which has been involved in facilitating the shipments, the officials say.	https://apnews.com/article/china-russia-sanctions-united-states-ukraine-drones-49e4e56bb37ee46faf028f649df140b0	2024-10-17T06:09:34-07:00	
India denies Canadian allegation that it uses mobsters to target Sikh separatists in Canada	NEW DELHI (AP) — India's government on Thursday denied it was working with mobsters to target Sikh separatists in Canada as alleged publicly this week by Canadian officials in an escalating diplomatic dispute. India’s External Affairs Ministry spokesman Randhir Jaiswal denied that India was in cahoots with India-based mobsters in Canada and even suggested that Canadian authorities had been resisting India's attempts to extradite those people to India. 'It is strange that people who we asked to be deported' are being blamed by the Canadians for 'committing crimes in Canada,' Jaiswal said. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and police officials went public this week with allegations that Indian diplomats were targeting Sikh separatists in Canada by sharing information about them with their government back home. They said top Indian officials were then passing that information along to Indian organized crime groups who were targeting the activists, who are Canadian citizens, with drive-by shootings, extortions and even murder. The two sides ordered the expulsion of top diplomats this week in the deepening crisis over the accusations, including Canada’s allegation that t he diplomats were linked to the June 2023 killing of Sikh activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. The Nijjar killing has soured ties for more than a year, and despite Canada's assertion that it has forwarded evidence of its allegations to Indian authorities, the Indian government continues to deny it has seen any. Jaiswal said again on Thursday that Canada has provided no evidence of its allegations surrounding attacks on Sikh activists, contradicting Trudeau's statements this week that his country’s investigators have privately shared information with Indian counterparts and found them to be uncooperative. At the same time, Jaiswal accused Canada of failing to take action against Sikhs living in Canada who face terrorism charges in India and who are accused of being part of a Sikh secessionist campaign in India’s northern Punjab state. Jaiswal said India’s 26 extradition requests have been pending in Canada for a decade or more. He also said that several criminals had provisional arrest requests pending with Canadian authorities. 'Some of them are charged with terror and terror-related crimes (in India). So far, no action has been taken by the Canadian side on our requests. This is very serious,' Jaiswal said. India has repeatedly criticized the Canadian government for being soft on supporters of what is known as the Khalistan movement, which is banned in India but has support among the Sikh diaspora, particularly in Canada. The Royal Canadian Police said Monday it had identified India’s top diplomat in the country and five other diplomats as persons of interest in the Nijjar killing. The RCMP also said they uncovered evidence of an intensifying campaign against Canadians by agents of the Indian government. Nijjar, 45, was fatally shot last year in his pickup truck after he left the Sikh temple he led in Surrey, British Columbia. An Indian-born citizen of Canada, he owned a plumbing business and was a leader in what remains of a once-strong movement to create an independent Sikh homeland. Four Indian nationals living in Canada were charged with Nijjar’s murder and are awaiting trial.	https://apnews.com/article/india-canada-killing-diplomatic-row-6008c252542cb52af0e19fe41a70d55f	2024-10-17T06:04:55-07:00	
Africa's mpox deaths surpass 1,000 as health officials urge international support	KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) — The number of mpox -related deaths in Africa has surpassed 1,000, the head of the continent’s top public health agency said Thursday, warning of the continuing threat of cross-border contamination and a lack of rapid test kits. There were 50 mpox-related deaths in the past week, bringing the total to 1,100, indicating that authorities face a challenge in stemming outbreaks currently affecting 18 of the continent's 55 nations, said Jean Kaseya, director general of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 'We are still fighting with this outbreak,' Kaseya said. 'We don’t want to see all African countries affected.' Mpox belongs to the same family of viruses as smallpox but causes milder symptoms, including fever, chills and body aches. People with more serious cases can develop lesions on the face, hands, chest and genitals. Kaseya said the trend shows mpox in Africa 'is going out of control if we don’t act,' and urged international partners to honor their pledges to support Africa’s response. 'This is my clear message to our partners. We acknowledge their pledge, but we need quickly to translate pledge into concrete money to support the response,' he said. The estimated budget for a six-month plan put forward by Africa CDC and the World Health Organization is almost $600 million, with 55% allocated to the response to mpox in 14 affected nations and boosting readiness in 15 others. Zambia and Zimbabwe became the latest African countries to confirm mpox cases in the past week, Kenya recorded its first death from mpox, and a case was confirmed in a prison in central Uganda, according to Africa CDC. The case in Zambia was detected in a truck driver. Mpox, also known as monkeypox, had been spreading mostly undetected for years in Africa before a 2022 global outbreak in which wealthy countries quickly responded with vaccines from their stockpiles, while Africa received fewer doses despite pleas from its governments. WHO declared Africa’s outbreaks a global health emergency in August, with Congo as the epicenter. The total number of suspected cases in Africa since the beginning of the year now stands at 42,438, with 8,113 confirmed as mpox, according to Africa CDC. Mpox vaccinations have begun in Rwanda and Congo.	https://apnews.com/article/africa-mpox-deaths-international-help-6830e9c4000b2518ee12efb24cd6b07a	2024-10-17T06:04:00-07:00	
Who is Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar?	Israel says it is looking into the possibility that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, a mastermind of the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war in Gaza, has been killed in a military operation. His death, which has not yet been confirmed, would be a significant moment in Israel's yearlong offensive against the militant group and could complicate efforts to release dozens of hostages held in Gaza. Sinwar became the head of Hamas after the killing of the previous leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in an explosion in Iran in July that was widely blamed on Israel. Some things to know about Sinwar: From refugee camp to Hamas militant Sinwar was born in 1962 in a refugee camp in the Gaza town of Khan Younis. He was an early member of Hamas, which was formed in 1987. He eventually led the group's security arm, which worked to purge it of informants for Israel. Israel arrested him in the late 1980s and he admitted to killing 12 suspected collaborators, a role that earned him the nickname 'The Butcher of Khan Younis.' He was sentenced to four life terms for offenses that included the killing of two Israeli soldiers. A prison leader Sinwar organized strikes in prison to improve working conditions. He also studied Hebrew and Israeli society. He survived brain cancer in 2008 after being treated by Israeli doctors. Sinwar was among more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners released in 2011 by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as part of an exchange for an Israeli soldier captured by Hamas in a cross-border raid. Rise to Gaza power When Sinwar returned to Gaza, he quickly rose through Hamas' leadership ranks with a reputation for ruthlessness. He is widely believed to be behind the 2016 killing of another top Hamas commander, Mahmoud Ishtewi, in an internal power struggle. Sinwar became head of Hamas in Gaza, effectively putting him in control of the territory, and worked with Haniyeh to align the group with Iran and its proxies around the region while also building the group's military capabilities. The October attack on Israel Sinwar, along with Mohammed Deif, the head of Hamas' armed wing, is believed to have engineered the surprise Oct. 7 attack on Israel. The attack killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and sparked a war that has killed over 42,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to health authorities there. Hamas said it launched the attack in retaliation for Israel's treatment of Palestinians and to push the Palestinian cause back onto the world agenda. The International Criminal Court’s prosecutor sought arrest warrants in May for Sinwar, Deif and Haniyeh for their alleged roles in the attack. Israel said it killed Deif in a strike in July, while Hamas says he is still alive. Where would this leave Hamas? Sinwar has been in hiding since the attack, and cease-fire negotiators have said it can take several days to send and receive messages from him. Even before becoming Hamas' top leader, Sinwar was believed to have the final word on any deal to release hostages held by the militant group. Some 100 hostages remain in Gaza, around a third of whom are believed to be dead. It's unclear who would replace Sinwar, and what that might mean for the cease-fire efforts, which sputtered to a halt in August after months of negotiations brokered by the United States, Egypt and Qatar. Hamas has hundreds of thousands of supporters in Gaza, the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Palestinian refugee camps across the region. Several of its top leaders are based in Qatar, which has served as a mediator between Israel and the militant group. Israel has arrested and killed several top Hamas leaders and militant commanders over the years, and the militant group has quickly replaced them. But it has never fought a prolonged war against Israel, which says it has killed dozens of high-ranking militants and over 17,000 fighters, though it has not provided evidence for the latter figure. ___ This story has been updated to correct that not all of the approximately 1,200 people killed in the Oct. 7 attack were Israeli. ___ Find more of AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-sinwar-leader-2963dbc6e8ef040a00e588488cba33e7	2024-10-17T05:30:40-07:00	
Kenya's Parliament removes the deputy president from office in an impeachment trial	NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — Kenya’s Senate voted Thursday to remove Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua from office in an impeachment trial on corruption and other allegations, hours after the deputy president was taken to the hospital with chest pains. Senators approved five of 11 grounds for impeachment against Gachagua, making him the first sitting deputy president to be removed from office in impeachment proceedings. The vote on the first of the five counts was 54-13, well above the two-thirds majority required to convict and remove him from office. The lower house of Parliament, the National Assembly, voted 282-44 last week to impeach the deputy president. Gachagua had pleaded not guilty Wednesday to the 11 charges and had been expected to be cross-examined by lawyers from the Assembly in the afternoon. But the hearing was briefly adjourned after Gachagua was hospitalized and his lawyers asked for a pause to give him until Tuesday to appear before the chamber. However, Assembly lawyers said Gachagua's defense already had been presented and that the Senate was bound by the constitution to continue the proceedings. Gachagua faced allegations that included corruption, inciting ethnic divisions and support for anti-government protests that saw demonstrators storm the Parliament The case has highlights divisions within the ruling party of President William Ruto, and friction between Ruto and Gachagua over government policy. The deputy president had been accused of insubordination when he opposed the government's policy of forced evictions during heavy rains that caused flooding and deaths. During his defense before the Assembly last week, Gachagua said he believed the impeachment motion had the president’s nod, and he has asked legislators to make their decision 'without intimidation and coercion.' Ruto has not commented publicly on the impeachment. Gachagua's lawyer Paul Muite said Thursday that doctors told him the deputy president was suffering from 'intense chest pains' and needed 'complete rest.' Dan Gikonyo, a doctor at Karen Hospital, told journalists outside the facility that the deputy president would be observed for up to three days. 'Stress can cause heart problems and the DP is definitely in a lot of stress,' Dr. Gikonyo said. Earlier Thursday, lawyers had cross-examined witnesses presented by the Assembly the previous day, including the legislator who moved the impeachment motion and the anticorruption agency’s boss. At one point Gachagua’s legal team asked to expunge the affidavit of a key witness, the elected governor for the capital Nairobi, after the governor failed to turn up. The tensions over Gachagua's impeachment risk introducing more uncertainty for investors and others in East Africa’s commercial hub. Ruto, who came to office claiming to represent Kenya’s poorest citizens, has faced widespread criticism for his efforts to raise taxes in an effort to find ways to pay off foreign creditors. But the public opposition led him to shake up his cabinet and back off certain proposals.	https://apnews.com/article/kenya-deputy-president-impeachment-7d3348f0cf28a717a7b4bae7ad363a8a	2024-10-17T05:21:40-07:00	
Ukraine's former armed forces chief endorses 'victory plan' in first speech since his dismissal	LONDON (AP) — Ukraine's former commander-in-chief, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, on Thursday expressed his support for President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s 'victory plan,' despite the tensions between the two that led to his dismissal. 'Ukraine must clearly follow the plan,' Zaluzhnyi said in his first public appearance since his appointment as ambassador to the U.K. He told an audience at London’s Chatham House think-tank: 'But this list of steps primarily concerns those countries that should ultimately be interested in stopping the war.' The plan lays out Ukraine’s view on how to strengthen its positions before any potential negotiations with Russia to end the conflict. After briefing U.S. and other Western officials, Zelenskyy presented the key points publicly during a speech to the Ukrainian parliament on Wednesday. The plan includes a formal invitation for Ukraine to join NATO and permission to use Western-supplied longer-range missiles to strike military targets deep inside Russian territory — steps that have been met with reluctance by Kyiv’s allies so far. Zaluzhnyi asserted that NATO membership is the only viable security guarantee for his country, fully backing President Zelensky’s call for the alliance to extend an invitation to Kyiv. But the prospect of Ukraine joining NATO has left the alliance in a bind, with some members concerned it could escalate the conflict and risk direct confrontation with Russia. 'Declaring yet another freeze in the situation with Ukraine will not work,' said Ukraine’s former commander-in-chief. 'We want to have guarantees of security for ourselves and our children,' he said. Zaluzhnyi, who was in charge of armed forces during Ukraine's failed counter-offensive in the summer of 2023, said a shortfall in Western support during that period meant that Ukraine lost its chance to fend off Russia on its own. He said that missed opportunity turned the war into a protracted conflict where the way out 'seems rather doubtful and almost impossible,' and allowed Russia the chance to form an alliance with North Korea, Iran and China which Ukraine now cannot defeat without the help of Western partners. 'Against Ukraine now stands not only Russia, but also a quite powerful coalition of strong states,' he said. Such an 'alliance of authoritarian countries' may pose a security threat to the democratic world and the West 'should have made a plan to protect its democratic institutions,' he said. During the presentation of his plan in Brussels on Thursday, Zelenskyy said Kyiv has intelligence information that 10,000 troops from North Korea are being prepared to join Russian forces fighting against his country, warning that a third nation wading into the hostilities would turn the conflict into a 'world war.' Zelenskyy did not go into further details about the claim. As the war grinds through its third year, the mood in Ukraine is grim as its outmanned troops face difficulty holding back Russian advances, especially in the east. Although Moscow’s gains are incremental, the steady forward movement is making Kyiv feel it needs more large-scale Western help. The former armed forces chief stressed that Ukraine is battling Russia, which significantly outweighs it in resources, including in manpower. 'The only thing which works in the war is mathematics,' he said. Zaluzhnyi acknowledged the challenges his country faces with mobilization, emphasizing the need to reform recruitment practices inherited from the times Ukraine was a part of the Soviet Union. Despite his popularity, he has faced widespread criticism for failing to meet the army’s need for more troops. Conscription has become a sensitive issue as infantry shortages grow, which became one of the factors that allowed Russia to gain the initiative on the battlefield. 'We had to change it (the system),' he said but adding that Ukraine doesn’t have enough time to do it while the war with Russia lasts. 'The material side does not depend entirely on us, but in working with human resources, everything completely depends on Ukraine,' he said. Tensions between Zaluzhnyi and President Zelenskyy escalated following Ukraine’s 2023 counter-offensive, which failed to achieve significant territorial gains. In February, Zelenskyy dismissed Zaluzhnyi as military commander-in-chief in a move to revitalize efforts in the stalled war. Zaluzhnyi is widely respected among Ukrainian troops and considered a national hero. He is credited with stalling Russia’s full-scale invasion in the early days of the war and expertly pushing back Moscow’s troops. ——— Arhirova contributed from Kyiv	https://apnews.com/article/victory-plan-ukraine-russia-war-zelenskyy-zaluzhnyi-5634fc4a1c17a04b09a64c17b98c6512	2024-10-17T05:18:03-07:00	
After hurricane, with no running water, residents organize to meet a basic need	ASHEVILLE, N.C. (AP) — It takes water to flush a toilet and tens of thousands of North Carolinians have been without it since Hurricane Helene ripped through the state three weeks ago. When Lark Frazier went around asking her Asheville neighbors how they were doing as far as water to flush, several burst into tears over the stress of where to go to the bathroom and what to do with the waste. Some told her they were eating less to avoid going. Others said they were dumping poop in the yard and covering it with leaves. An elderly woman mentioned planning to scoop it out of the toilet with her hands. 'Not only is that horrifying and inhumane but it's dangerous for her to be handling her waste like that,' Frazier said. Since Helene swallowed mountain towns, damaged water infrastructure and killed nearly 250 people across the Southeast, local governments have been overwhelmed, and that's spurred community organizing and innovation. Frazier is one of the newly-minted leaders to have stepped up. She grew up in rural Colorado, using an outhouse for years before her family got a flush toilet. She drew on that experience, then came across the Emergency Toilet Guidebook online, published by the Regional Disaster Preparedness Organization in Oregon. She began fashioning rudimentary toilets and training others to do it, too. The concept is simple: line a sturdy bucket with a thick plastic bag, cover the top with a toilet seat or a water-resistant foam noodle for comfort, then drop in a handful of wood chips or other dry material after every use to absorb liquid and reduce odor. Pee should stay separate. 'Not having waste treated appropriately can absolutely lead to a major public health crisis,' said Sue Mohnkern, who developed the guidebook. Mishandling fecal matter can lead to cholera, dysentery and other serious, even fatal diseases. Mohnkern recommends everybody living in a disaster-prone area have an emergency toilet handy. Neither the city nor the county have released official guidelines on how to manage human waste without water to flush. Frazier called that lack of guidance 'astounding.' County spokesperson Lillian Govus said no county could give sufficient attention to every important issue in a disaster of this scale. City councilwoman Kim Roney has released a video explaining how to use an emergency toilet. The city set up the first water refill sites about a week after Helene, when some 136,000 people across the Southeast had nonoperational water providers, according to the EPA. Around 100,000 were in the Asheville area, although the city says that number has been reduced significantly in the past week. Still, thousands lack water, and it's unclear when it'll be back on. Those who can't get to these refill sites are getting missed, and here again, volunteers fil the gap. Molly Black and Elle DeBruhl, strangers before the storm, now coordinate an army of neighbors from dawn to dusk to get flush water to people. From Florida to Ohio to Texas, people have donated cube-shaped, 250-gallon, white plastic containers known as IBC totes that are often used on farms, in the chemical industry and disasters. A single tote can nearly fill a 6-foot pickup bed. Black and DeBruhl have organized people to haul the totes to ponds, fill them using pumps, then take them to where they're needed, like apartment buildings. Other neighbors and volunteers pick up the work from there, taking buckets of water to residents in need. 'I don’t even feel like I’m living my real life,' said DeBruhl, whose employer EY, a global accounting firm, gave her paid leave to serve her community following the storm. 'I went from a six-man tote operation to now I’m in charge of solving the nonpotable flushing water for the impacted area? Its crazy.' With cell service returned now, residents can text Black and DeBruhl’s grassroots group, Flush AVL — AVL is the shorthand for Asheville — to request a refill when their tote is empty. The group replenishes some 400 sites every other day. The city is helping with some of those, but this stopgap effort to preserve dignity and public health is mainly individuals donating their time and money. Govus applauded the volunteer efforts. 'It helps fill the gaps and meet peoples needs as we're working on systems and major processes to get people food, shelter and water,' she said. Yet another water solution is coming from people who still have water — because they have a well. Erik Iverson lives near a well owned by an urban farm that wanted to help after the hurricane. He laid two 200-foot lengths of plastic PEX pipe to route the well water to the road for public access. Then he added filtration and ultraviolet light in order to offer drinkable water in addition to the flush water (the city, however, recommends boiling all water sources). Now people driving by can access multiple spouts, operated by a foot pedal connected to a chain, touch-free to minimize germs spreading. 'With climate change this is probably not going to the be last time this happens,' Iverson said. 'No matter how resilient Asheville rebuilds their water system, it’s simply poor planning to not have this infrastructure in place to deal with something like this again.' Wine to Water, a global nonprofit focused on clean water, paid for the purification for this and nine other wells whose owners have agreed to community access. The private well owners 'benefit from having purified water on their property, and when this happens again, they can jump right into offering this purified water again. That is resilience,' Iverson said. Yet another grassroots group, Be Well AVL sprang up in the last two weeks and is pulling water from higher-capacity commercial wells offered up by local businesses, distributing it at apartments for low-income, elderly and disabled residents. They can't guarantee it's potable, given the official warning to boil water, but well water is typically cleaner than the pond water being distributed for flushing. Both sources are essential, said Grace Barron, an organizer with Be Well AVL. 'We absolutely need toilets to be flushed,' Barron said. And 'there's this other area of need for sanitation … washing dishes, clothing and bathing,' she said. There are infants in the community, she said, and they shouldn't be bathed in pond water. Barron, an Asheville resident of 18 years, said Hurricane Helene has reminded residents of the caring culture that was a foundation of the city before it ballooned into one of the most expensive places to live in the state. 'Mutual aid has been a part of our community prior to this,' she said. 'The community connections we had before have only grown.' __ Videojournalist Erik Verduzco contributed from Asheville. __ The Associated Press receives support from the Walton Family Foundation for coverage of water and environmental policy.

Hunger experts say the risk of famine in Gaza remains high	The Gaza Strip is still at risk of famine more than a year into the Israel-Hamas war, even as the number of people facing the most extreme level of hunger has declined in recent months, the international authority on hunger crises said Thursday. The findings come after the United States warned Israel that it might cut off military aid if its ally does not do more to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Hundreds of thousands of people there are displaced from their homes and packed into squalid tent camps and schools-turned-shelters. In recent weeks Israel has once again ordered the evacuation of the northern third of Gaza, and it launched another major military operation there. It allowed no food to enter the north for roughly the first two weeks of October before resuming shipments on Monday. According to the military's own figures, a little over 5,800 tons of food have entered all of Gaza so far this month, compared to nearly 76,000 in September, and not all of those shipments have reached people inside. More than 500 trucks remain trapped on the Gaza side of the border, where the U.N. says it has difficulty retrieving the cargo because of Israeli military operations, lawlessness and other obstacles. In a statement announcing a second shipment on Wednesday, the military said it will continue to act in accordance with international law 'to facilitate and ease the entry of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip.' 86% of Gaza's population faces crisis-level hunger or worse The latest findings on hunger in Gaza were released by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, an initiative set up in 2004 during the famine in Somalia that involves more than a dozen U.N. agencies, aid organizations, governments and other groups. It has repeatedly warned of famine over the course of the yearlong war, which was triggered by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack into southern Israel. Over 1.8 million people, or around 86% of Gaza's population, are experiencing crisis levels of hunger, defined as Phase 3 or higher on the IPC's five-point scale. Some 133,000 people, or around 6%, are at Phase 5, the highest level, known as catastrophic hunger. That is down from earlier periods of the war, when nearly a third of the population was at Phase 5. The IPC warned the situation could rapidly deteriorate, and that it expects catastrophic hunger levels to double in the coming months. It cited a slowdown in aid in recent weeks, the onset of what is typically a cold and rainy winter, and the harsh conditions people face in crowded tent camps with little in the way of food, clean water or toilets. 'One year into the conflict, the risk of famine persists throughout the whole Gaza Strip as conflict intensifies and winter approaches,' it said in the report. Israel has controlled Gaza's entire land border since May. The Israeli military body in charge of civilian affairs, known as COGAT, says it places no limits on humanitarian aid entering the territory and accuses U.N. agencies and aid groups of failing to promptly deliver it. Those groups say their efforts are severely hampered by Israeli restrictions, ongoing fighting and displacement, and the breakdown of law and order in many areas. At a public kitchen in central Gaza on Thursday, crowds of women and children lined up with empty pots to receive a thin tomato soup with peas and noodles. 'It’s been two weeks since we had enough food for ourselves and our children. A lot of food items disappeared from the markets because the crossings are closed,' said Mohammed Abed, who was displaced from Gaza City, in the northern part of the territory. 'We used to live a decent life, but now as you can see, we stand at kitchens to get a plate of food and bread,' said Aisha Saliby, who was also displaced from Gaza City. 'End the war and let us go back home safely.' Israel cut aid to the north for 2 weeks as it launched another offensive Israel allowed no food to enter northern Gaza for the first two weeks of October, according to the U.N.'s World Food Program, as it waged a major military operation there that is still ongoing. U.N. humanitarian officials said last week that aid entering Gaza is at its lowest level in months. Most residents of northern Gaza fled after evacuation warnings at the start of the war, and Israel has not allowed them to return. An estimated 400,000 people have remained there despite the harsh conditions. Palestinians say nowhere in the besieged territory feels safe. Many fear Israel will implement a surrender-or-starve plan proposed by former generals calling for a cutoff in aid, and for anyone who ignores evacuation orders to be classified as a militant. The Israeli government has not said whether it has adopted the plan, which rights groups say would violate international law. The IPC report said the latest evacuation orders 'have significantly disrupted humanitarian operations, and repeated displacements have steadily worn down people’s ability to cope and access food, water and medicine, deepening the vulnerability of entire communities.' In a letter over the weekend, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin warned Israel that if it did not increase the amount of humanitarian aid allowed into Gaza within the next 30 days it could risk losing U.S. weapons supplies for the ongoing wars against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. A similar letter sent in April — after an Israeli strike killed seven aid workers — led to an increase in humanitarian aid to the territory. But State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said this week that the supply dwindled again, falling by over 50% from its peak earlier this year. Israel has so far allowed two shipments into northern Gaza this week — a total of 80 trucks — and it says around 430 trucks have entered through the southern Kerem Shalom Crossing since the start of the month. That is far below the 350 trucks a day that the U.S. said were needed. The United States has spent nearly $18 billion on military aid to Israel since the war in Gaza began, according to a report for Brown University’s Costs of War project. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

Israel is DNA-testing a body from Gaza to see if it's Hamas' top leader Sinwar, an official says	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — The Israeli military said Thursday it was looking into whether Hamas’ top leader Yahya Sinwar was killed in a military operation in Gaza. Authorities were conducting DNA tests on a body to determine if it is him, an Israeli security official said. The military said in a statement that three militants were killed during operations in Gaza, without specifying where or elaborating further. It said the identities of the three were so far not confirmed, but it was 'checking the possibility' that one of them was Sinwar. The security official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation, said the tests on the body had not yet confirmed if it was Sinwar's. There was no immediate comment by Hamas on the report. Sinwar was one of the chief architects of Hamas’ attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and Israel has vowed to kill him since the beginning of its retaliatory campaign in Gaza. If confirmed, Sinwar's death could be a heavy blow to the militant group. He has been Hamas' top leader inside the Gaza Strip for years, closely connected to its military wing while dramatically building up its capabilities. Sinwar was chosen as Hamas's top leader after his predecessor, Ismail Haniyeh, was assassinated in July in an apparent Israeli strike in the Iranian capital Tehran. Israel has also claimed to have killed the head of Hamas' military wing Mohammed Deif in an airstrike, but the group has said he survived. President Joe Biden has been briefed on Israel's investigation into whether it killed Sinwar, and U.S. officials have been in close contact with Israeli officials throughout Thursday morning, according to a senior administration official. The report came as Israeli forces continued a more than week-old major air and ground assault in the Jabaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza. On Thursday, an Israeli strike hit a school sheltering displaced Palestinians, killing at least 15 people, including five children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. Fares Abu Hamza, head of Gaza Health Ministry’s local emergency unit, said dozens of people were wounded. He said the nearby Kamal Adwan Hospital was struggling to treat the casualties. 'Many women and children are in critical condition,' he said. The Israeli military said it targeted a command center run by Hamas and Islamic Jihad inside the school. It provided a list of around a dozen names of people it identified as militants who were present when the strike was called in. It was not immediately possible to verify the names. Israel has repeatedly struck tent camps and schools sheltering displaced people in Gaza. The Israeli military says it carries out precise strikes on militants and tries to avoid harming civilians, but its strikes often kill women and children. In a separate development, a building in central Beirut that houses offices of the Al Jazeera news network and the Norwegian Embassy was evacuated after a warning. Mazen Ibrahim, Al Jazeera’s Lebanon bureau chief, said the building’s administration received three calls telling everyone to leave the building, which he said also houses the embassies of Norway and Azerbaijan, as well as dozens of offices. He said it was unclear who called in the warning. Norwegian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Ragnhild Simenstad said the building was evacuated after a 'bomb threat,' without elaborating. Israel has ordered the evacuation of several buildings, as well as entire cities, towns and villages, as it strikes what it says are targets linked to the Hezbollah militant group. There have also been several instances of evacuation warning calls and text messages that turned out to be bogus, which Lebanese security agencies say they are investigating. Israel launched its campaign in Gaza to eliminate Hamas after the militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 others. Some 100 captives are still inside Gaza, about a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s offensive has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. It does not differentiate between civilians and combatants but says women and children make up a little more than half of the fatalities. Northern Gaza was the first target of Israel’s ground invasion nearly a year ago and has suffered the heaviest destruction of the war, with entire neighborhoods in Gaza City and other towns reduced to rubble. Most of the population fled after Israel issued evacuation orders in the opening days of the war, but about 400,000 are believed to have remained despite the harsh conditions. Earlier this month, Israel once again ordered the full-scale evacuation of the north, and allowed no food aid to enter the area for around two weeks. That led many Palestinians to fear that it had adopted a surrender-or-starve strategy suggested by former Israeli generals. Israel allowed two shipments of aid to enter the north earlier this week after the United States warned it might reduce its military aid if its ally did not do more to address the humanitarian crisis. Since the start of the conflict, Israeli forces have launched repeated operations into Jabaliya, a densely populated urban refugee camp dating back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation. The military says militants have repeatedly regrouped there after major operations. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo, Jeffery from Jerusalem.

The youngest woman to climb all of the world's 14 tallest peaks calls for novices to be regulated	KATHMANDU, Nepal (AP) — A British mountaineer who set the record as the youngest female to climb all the 14 tallest mountains in the world said Thursday that inexperienced climbers should not be allowed to climb the highest peaks because they run the risk of endangering their lives and others. Adriana Brownlee, 23, climbed Mount Everest at 20 in 2021 and earlier this month climbed Mount Shishapangma in China, completing her endeavor to scale all 14 peaks over 8,000 meters (26,247 feet) high. She said she has seen numerous climbers who lack training in basic skills and in coping with the unpredictable slopes of the high peaks. 'I have seen many examples of people in the mountains that should not really be there, that should have more training beforehand,' Brownlee told The Associated Press on Thursday in Nepal's capital, Kathmandu. 'We have had to support them and have had to help with like small things like how to put on crampons, how to put on harness.' She said mountaineering authorities should ensure that climbers attempting to scale the highest peaks have at least climbed smaller mountains to ensure they can handle the altitude and have the proper skills. Brownlee flew to Nepal this week alongside other climbers from Tibet including Nima Rinji Sherpa, who at age 18 is now the youngest person to climb the 14 peaks. There are generally no rules besides age restrictions on people who want to climb mountains as long as they are able to pay their permit fees. In Nepal, climbers need to be at least 16 years old. Brownlee said she was just 8 years old when she began dreaming of becoming a mountaineer like her father, who she said was her main inspiration. She said she now wants to scale unclimbed peaks in Nepal and explore mountains in other parts of the world. Brownlee and her partner have opened a mountaineering company in Nepal focusing on helping customers who are skilled and experienced enough to handle the harsh condition of the mountains. She said she hopes to inspire other young people to pursue their dreams. 'For me the message is that in life ... you can take any path you like to reach your goal,' she said. 'That goal might be totally unique to you and it's very important to keep at that and not to listen to rest of society what they have to say.'	https://apnews.com/article/nepal-c8acf5f744b838994adde62133f5c23e	2024-10-17T00:37:27-07:00	
Death of ex-One Direction member Liam Payne at 31 sends shockwaves around the world	BUENOS AIRES, Argentine (AP) — Shockwaves spread around the world Thursday at the death of Liam Payne, who shot to stardom as a member of British boy band One Direction and had to deal with intense global fame while still in his teens. Fans, music-industry figures and fellow musicians paid tribute to Payne, 31, who died after falling from a hotel balcony in Argentina. Buenos Aires police said Payne fell from the third floor of the Casa Sur Hotel in the trendy Palermo neighborhood of Argentina’s capital on Wednesday, resulting in 'extremely serious injuries.' Medics confirmed his death on the spot, the police said in a statement. Pablo Policicchio, the communications director for the Buenos Aires Security Ministry, said in a statement to The Associated Press that Payne 'had jumped from the balcony of his room.' Police rushed to the hotel in response to an emergency call just after 5 p.m. local time, he said, warning of an 'aggressive man who could be under the influence of drugs or alcohol.' The hotel manager can be heard on a 911 call obtained by the AP saying they had 'a guest who is overwhelmed with drugs and alcohol ... He’s destroying the entire room and, well, we need you to send someone, please.' The manager’s voice became more anxious as the call went on, noting the room had a balcony. Alberto Crescenti, head of the state emergency medical system, told Argentina’s Todo Noticias TV channel that authorities were investigating the circumstances of his death and conducting an autopsy. Payne was known as the tousle=headed, sensible one of the quintet that went from a TV talent show to a pop phenomenon with a huge international following of swooning fans. In recent years he had acknowledged struggling with alcoholism, posting a video in July 2023 to his YouTube channel where he said he had been sober for six months after receiving treatment. Representatives for Payne did not immediately return emails and calls. Rolling Stone Ronnie Wood, who performed with One Direction in 2014, said he was 'shocked and saddened.' 'God bless Liam, thinking of all his loved ones. He will be dearly missed,' Wood wrote on X. Paris Hilton also sent condolences on X, saying the news was 'so upsetting.' The Backstreet Boys said in a social media post that their hearts go out to 'Directioners around the world.' Dozens of One Direction fans flocked from across Buenos Aires to the Casa Sur Hotel after the news broke, forming lines that spilled into the cordoned-off street outside the hotel where police stood sentinel. Forensic investigators were seen exiting the hotel, from where Payne’s body was removed around three hours after the fall. Young women filming with their cellphones expressed shock and heartbreak as a makeshift memorial with rows of candles and bouquets quickly grew outside the hotel. 'I didn’t think he was going to die so young,' 21-year-old Isabella Milesi told the AP. Payne was one of five members of One Direction, which formed when they each auditioned for the British singing competition series 'The X Factor' in 2010, two years after Payne’s first attempt to get on the show. At 16 the second time around, Payne sang Michael Bublé’s version of 'Cry Me a River,' appearing nervous at the start but warming up with the audience’s cheers and applause. After each singer failed to make it through the competition as solo acts, Simon Cowell and his fellow judges combined Payne, Zayn Malik, Harry Styles, Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson into what would become one of the most successful boy bands — even though they lost the competition. Each member had their own persona, with Payne — who hailed from Wolverhampton in England's West Midlands region — known as the responsible one. The band became known for their pop sound and romantic hits like 'What Makes You Beautiful,' 'Night Changes' and 'Story of My Life.' Payne had prominent solos on songs including 'Stole My Heart' and 'Change Your Ticket,' co-writing several of the band’s hits. They had six Top 10 hits on the Billboard charts by the time they disbanded in 2016 and a highly loyal fan base, known as 'Directioners,' many of them teen girls. 'I’ve always loved One Direction since I was little,' said 18-year-old Juana Relh, another fan outside Payne’s hotel. 'To see that he died and that there will never be another reunion of the boys is unbelievable, it kills me.' With his meteoric rise to fame, Payne had said that it took some time to adjust to the public eye. 'I don’t think you can ever deal with that, it’s all a bit crazy for us to see that people get in that sort of state of mind about us and what we do,' he said in a 2013 interview with the AP after recounting an experience where a fan was in a state of shock upon meeting him. One Direction announced an indefinite 'hiatus' in 2016, and Payne — like each of his erstwhile bandmates — pursued a solo career, shifting toward EDM and hip-hop. While Styles became a huge solo star, the others had more modest success. Payne's 2017 single 'Strip That Down,' featuring Quavo, reached the Billboard Top 10, and stayed on the charts for several months. He put out an album 'LP1' in 2019, and his last release — a single called 'Teardrops' — was released in March. In 2020, to mark the 10th anniversary of One Direction, Payne shared a screenshot of a text message he sent to his father on the day he joined the group, which read: 'I’m in a boyband.' 'What a journey… I had no idea what we were in for when I sent this text to my dad years ago at this exact time the band was formed,' he wrote. Payne had a 7-year-old son, Bear Grey Payne, with his former girlfriend, the musician Cheryl who was known as Cheryl Cole when she performed with Girls Aloud. She was an 'X Factor' judge during One Direction’s season, although their relationship began years later. Payne was previously engaged to Maya Henry, from August 2020 to early 2022. Henry released a novel earlier this year that she said was based on their relationship. In addition to his son, he is survived by his parents, Geoff and Karen Payne, and his two older sisters, Ruth and Nicola. ___ Huamani reported from Los Angeles.

Biden is making quick trip to Berlin before US election to discuss Ukraine and democracy with allies	BERLIN (AP) — President Joe Biden has long believed diplomacy is about personal relationships — and he'll spend Friday in Berlin with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz as his time in office is on the cusp of ending. There is also a meeting with other leaders in the 'European Quad,' a group that in addition to Biden and Scholz includes French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre described Biden as having a 'close relationship' with Scholz, who early this year helped broker a multicountry prisoner swap that brought back to the United States the journalist Evan Gershkovich and former Marine Paul Whelan. The German leader told Biden before the deal in words to the effect, 'For you, I will do this.' 'He wanted to thank the chancellor for his partnership, for his leadership, as well as with Ukraine,' Jean-Pierre told reporters accompanying Biden on Thursday's Air Force One flight to Berlin. 'He wanted to thank him and so that's what you're seeing on this trip.' The whirlwind trip — Biden departed early Thursday and is due back in the U.S. on Friday night — is hardly a social visit. The U.S. and Germany have been the largest sources of aid to Ukraine as it fights to repel a Russian invasion. And with less than three weeks before the U.S. presidential election, Biden also feels obligated to ready allies for the possible return to the White House of Republican Donald Trump, who has antagonized U.S. friends while displaying an appreciation for Russian President Vladimir Putin. The administration said Biden has no plans while in Europe to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The two spoke on Wednesday about additional military aid, with the White House announcing $425 million in assistance, bringing the total support to more than $64 billion over two and a half years. In addition to Ukraine, Biden and Scholz plan to discuss European Union relations, democratic values, trade and technology issues, global supply chains, tensions in the Middle East and security issues in the Indo-Pacific region. While in Germany, Biden will also meet with its president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier. Earlier this month, the U.S. president had delayed a trip planned to Germany and Angola in order to oversee relief efforts ahead of Hurricane Milton making landfall in Florida. He now plans to visit Angola in December. The trip to Germany comes as Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, has entered an aggressive sprint to persuade and turn out voters in an election that could ultimately determine the future of Biden's legacy of having strengthened NATO and built up relations in Asia to counter China's influence. Trump has questioned America's commitment to defending NATO allies who are attacked, something that Biden called 'un-American' in February. 'The whole world heard it and the worst thing is he means it,' the president said. Trump has talked about applying tariffs on imports from U.S. allies in Europe and Asia, which could potentially strain relations with countries that could counter Russia, China and other rivals. 'Our allies have taken advantage of us more so than our enemies,' Trump said Tuesday at the Economic Club of Chicago. Trump declined to say whether he’s continued to speak with Putin since leaving office in January 2021 but added that it would not be a negative if he and the Russian leader had been in touch. Bob Woodward reorted in his new book 'War' that Trump and Putin have spoken seven times. 'But I will tell you that if I did, it’s a smart thing,' Trump said. 'If I’m friendly with people, if I can have a relationship with people, that’s a good thing and not a bad thing in terms of a country.' Jake Sullivan, Biden's national security adviser, said during Thursday's flight that he didn't know if the reporting was accurate, but 'obviously that would raise red flags if it were true.'	https://apnews.com/article/biden-election-germany-scholz-ukraine-democracy-bb4d92e39eec108ba526eb10f913f714	2024-10-17T00:07:34-07:00	
Bangladesh court issues arrest warrant for ex-Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina over deaths of protesters	DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — A special court in Bangladesh issued arrest warrants on Thursday for former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and 45 others, including her close aides, on charges of crimes against humanity during a student-led uprising in July and August that forced her to flee the country, a prosecutor said. Prosecutor B.M. Sultan Mahmud said the Dhaka-based International Crimes Tribunal under Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, the country's interim leader, issued the arrest warrants in response to two petitions submitted by the prosecution. He said the head of the tribunal, Golam Mortuza Majumdar, issued the orders in the presence of other judges. 'The tribunal first accepted our petition that involved Sheikh Hasina alone. Then we moved our second petition against 45 people that involved her close aides and others for the crimes against humanity. It was also accepted by the tribunal,' he said by phone. Hasina fled the country to India on Aug. 5 after weeks of violent protests over government job quotas in which hundreds of people died. Prosecutors said in the petitions that Hasina, her close aides and security agencies were responsible for killing the protesters and others. It is not clear if India will respond to any request from Bangladesh for Hasina's extradition under a mutual treaty. The tribunal's chief prosecutor, Muhammad Tajul Islam, earlier said they would seek help from Interpol, if necessary, to get Hasina back. The Yunus-led interim government has promised to try Hasina and others in her administration for alleged crimes involving the uprising against her and has invited the United Nations to help investigate the killings. Hasina also called for investigation as she questioned the killings, saying many deaths may have involved others beyond security agencies.	https://apnews.com/article/bangladesh-sheikh-hasina-arrest-warrant-isssued-f92d56b9c9930e9c6438c141c20f4b34	2024-10-16T23:51:02-07:00	
Vietnamese real estate tycoon found guilty of billions in fraud in government graft crackdown	HANOI, Vietnam (AP) — A Vietnamese real estate tycoon was convicted Thursday of fraudulently obtaining property worth billions of dollars in a case that has been a centerpiece of the government's crackdown on corruption. Truong My Lan was already convicted in April by the same Ho Chi Minh City court of fraud amounting to $12.5 billion — nearly 3% of the country's gross domestic product — in a separate case and sentenced to death by lethal injection. The trials were broken into two parts due to the number of allegations against her, and Thursday's verdict, which carries a maximum penalty of life in prison, adds to Lan's legal troubles as she awaits the appeal of her death sentence to be heard. Vietnam has handed down more than 2,000 death sentences in the past decades and executed more than 400 prisoners. It is a possible sentence for 14 different crimes but is generally only applied in cases of murder and drug trafficking. 'Standing here today is a price too expensive for me to pay. I consider this my destiny and a career accident,' the VNexpress online newspaper quoted Lan, the chairwoman of property developer Van Thinh Phat, as telling the judges in her closing statement last week. 'For the rest of my life, I will never forget that my actions have affected tens of thousands of families.' Thirty three others were tried as co-defendants in the case but details on the other verdicts were not immediately available. Lan's sentence was expected to be announced later in the day. In addition to obtaining property by fraud, Lan was also convicted of money laundering and illegal cross-border money transfer charges, according to state-run media. She was accused of raising $1.2 billion from nearly 36,000 investors by issuing bonds illegally through four companies, according to state media reports. She was also found guilty of siphoning off $18 billion obtained through fraud and for using companies controlled by her to illegally transfer more than $4.5 billion in and out of Vietnam between 2012 and 2022. It was not immediately clear if Lan would appeal the verdict and no date has yet been set for her appeal of her death penalty conviction to be heard. In the April conviction, she was found to have orchestrated financial fraud amounting to $12.5 billion for illegally controlling a major bank allowing loans that resulted in losses of $27 billion, according to state media reports. Lan’s arrest in October 2022 was among the most high-profile in an ongoing anti-corruption drive in Vietnam that has intensified since 2022. The Communist Party's 'blazing furnace' campaign has also touched the highest echelons of Vietnamese politics. Former President Vo Van Thuong resigned in March after being implicated in the campaign. Since 2016, thousands of party officials have been disciplined, including former President Nguyen Xuan Phuc and the former head of parliament, Vuong Dinh Hue, both of whom resigned. In all, eight members of the powerful Politburo have been ousted on corruption allegations, compared to none between 1986 and 2016. The anti-corruption drive began in 2013, but it wasn’t until 2018 that authorities began scanning the private sector. Since then, several owners of Vietnam’s fast-growing businesses have been arrested. The campaign had been the hallmark of Communist Party General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong, Vietnam’s top politician. who died earlier this year at age 80. The ideologue had called corruption a grave threat to the party and vowed that the campaign would be a 'blazing furnace' in which no one was untouchable. In another high-profile case, business tycoon Trinh Van Quyet was found guilty in August of defrauding stockholders of nearly $150 million by falsely inflating the value of his company. The Hanoi People's Court sentenced Quyet to 21 years in prison and convicted 49 co-defendants on a variety charges, with sentences ranging from probation to multiple years in prison. Lan and her family established the Van Thinh Phat company in 1992 after Vietnam shifted from a state-run economy to a more market-oriented approach that was open to foreign investors. She started out helping her mother, a Chinese entrepreneur, sell cosmetics in Ho Chi Minh City’s oldest market, according to the state media outlet Tien Phong. Van Thinh Phat became one of Vietnam’s richest real estate companies, with projects including luxury residential buildings, offices, hotels and shopping centers. This made her a key player in the country’s financial industry. Lan’s first trial shocked many Vietnamese. Analysts said the scale of the scam raised questions about whether other banks or businesses had similarly erred, dampening Vietnam’s economic outlook and making foreign investors jittery at a time when Vietnam is trying to position itself as the ideal home for businesses trying to diversify supply chains away from China. ___ Rising reported from Bangkok.	https://apnews.com/article/vietnam-tycoon-death-trial-corruption-lan-b63f5a33af8dcee3f4662b3360ce764c	2024-10-16T22:42:07-07:00	
Ukrainian president Zelenskyy heads to EU, NATO to seek backing for his 'victory plan'	BRUSSELS (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will seek support from European Union leaders on Thursday for what he is calling his ' victory plan ' to end the devastating war with Russia. Zelenskyy will address EU leaders at their summit in Brussels before shuttling across town to meet with NATO defense ministers. The EU is a key supporter of Ukraine — a candidate member of the 27-nation bloc — as it fights Russia's invasion that began more than 2 1/2 years ago. Zelenskyy outlined the five-point plan to Ukraine’s parliament on Wednesday without disclosing confidential elements that have been presented in private to key allies, including the United States. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte was muted in his response to the plan on Wednesday. On Thursday he said that Kyiv can rest 'absolutely assured that 32 allies are united in making sure that collectively, we will do whatever is needed to make sure that Ukraine can prevail, that (asterisk)Russian President Vladimir) Putin will not get his way.' Rutte reiterated that Ukraine’s place is among NATO’s ranks, but he would not say when it might join. Zelenskyy insists that a membership invitation is central to his 'victory plan' and would provide his country with the ultimate security guarantee to protect it from Russia. 'Ukraine will be a member of NATO in the future,' Rutte said. 'The question is exactly about the ‘when.’ I cannot answer that now.' However, Rutte said, Putin must understand that 'we are in this, if necessary, for the long haul. And obviously we want to be in a place where Zelenskyy and Ukraine, from a position of strength, is able to start talks with Russia.' Major points of the plan include an invitation for Ukraine to join NATO and permission to use Western-supplied longer-range missiles to strike military targets deep inside Russia — steps that have been met with reluctance by Kyiv’s allies so far. A draft copy of EU summit conclusions — a text that will likely be tweaked before publication at the end of Thursday's meeting — reaffirms the bloc's 'unwavering commitment to providing continued political, financial, economic, humanitarian, military and diplomatic support to Ukraine and its people for as long as it takes and as intensely as needed. Russia must not prevail.' Thursday's talks in Brussels come as Ukrainian troops are struggling to hold off better-equipped Russian forces, especially in the eastern Donetsk region where they are gradually being pushed back. Kyiv is surviving with Western help, but Ukraine says it is coming too slowly. Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda criticized slow Western decision-making over Ukraine and said it 'would be a great mistake to think that our hesitance is the best way to de-escalation.' If Western allies bolstered support to Kyiv, leading to gains on the ground for Ukrainian forces, 'then I think Putin would be pressed to go to negotiations table. Right now, he thinks he is prevailing,' he said when entering the EU summit. Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo said EU leaders 'have to give a strong signal and unified signal that we continue to support Ukraine as much and as long as needed.' At their summit in Washington in July, the 32 NATO members declared Ukraine on an 'irreversible' path to membership. But for now, NATO is in a holding pattern. Its biggest and most powerful member, the United States, is facing a presidential election. European allies expect little movement on Ukraine until a new president takes office in January. Beyond that, the United States and European heavyweight Germany remain deeply concerned about being dragged into a wider war with nuclear-armed Russia, and they lead a group of countries that oppose allowing Ukraine to join NATO until the conflict ends. ___ Corder reported from The Hague, Netherlands.	https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-zelenskyy-europe-victory-plan-summit-863bd5c70816449e3c92b7c1f767a2ff	2024-10-16T22:25:23-07:00	
Middle East latest: 28 killed in Israeli strike on shelter in Gaza, Palestinians say	Palestinian officials reported at least 28 dead, including four children, in an Israeli strike on a school being used as a shelter in Gaza on Thursday. Nearly 100 people were wounded in the strike in Jabaliya, according to the Gaza Health Ministry’s emergency unit in the north. The Israeli military said it is looking into whether Hamas’ top leader Yahya Sinwar was killed in a separate military operation in Gaza. Authorities were conducting DNA tests on a body to determine if it is him, an Israeli security official said. Syria’s military said an Israeli strike early Thursday wounded two civilians and damaged a military post. Israel regularly targets military sites in Syria linked to Iran and to Lebanon’s militant Hezbollah group and has escalated its campaign against Hezbollah in recent weeks, after a year of near-daily exchanges of cross-border fire. Lebanon says more than 2,300 people have been killed in the past year and 77% of public schools are out of service, either due to their use as shelters or their location in areas directly affected by the war. On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel’s security fence and stormed in, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not distinguish combatants from civilians. The war has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced about 90% of its population of 2.3 million people. Israel’s military says it has allowed 50 trucks of humanitarian aid into northern Gaza on Wednesday, after the United States warned it to boost aid efforts or risk losing weapons funding. The region has suffered heavy destruction and has been completely encircled by Israeli forces for nearly a year. ___ Here's the latest: Palestinian officials say death toll in Gaza school strike rises to 28 DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Palestinian medical officials say the death toll from an Israeli strike on a school where displaced people were sheltering has risen to 28. The Israeli military said the strike on Thursday targeted dozens of militants who were meeting inside the school in Jabaliya, in northern Gaza. Fares Abu Hamza, head of the Gaza Health Ministry’s emergency unit in the north, said the death toll had climbed to 28, with another 98 people wounded. Israel has been waging a large military operation in Jabaliya, an urban refugee camp dating back to the 1948 war, for more than a week now. It has once again called on all residents of northern Gaza to flee south, and it allowed no food aid to enter the north for around two weeks at the start of the month. Its forces have repeatedly returned to Jabaliya and other areas of Gaza after saying that militants had regrouped there. Philippines evacuate dozens of workers from Lebanon MANILA, Philippines — The Philippine government has evacuated dozens of Filipino workers from Lebanon, including one who urged thousands of compatriots to leave the war-hit nation before it’s too late. The 45 Filipino workers and two children who arrived Thursday in the Philippine capital were a fraction of about 10,000 to 11,000 Filipinos, many of whom have refused to leave their jobs in Lebanon for their poverty-stricken homeland. 'I hope they would return home because it has become too dangerous there,' Felicilda Aboc, a 56-year-old who has worked for 18 years as a house helper in Lebanon, told reporters at Manila’s international airport. She recounted how a powerful blast two days ago shook the house where she worked. The Philippine government has offered free chartered flights, cash and new livelihood training to encourage Filipinos in Lebanon to return home but has yet to issue a mandatory evacuation order. 'I was told that even if the bombs are in front of them, they may not go home as long as they still have employers,' Philippine Foreign Undersecretary Eduardo de Vega said of the many Filipinos in Lebanon. Israel's military looking into whether Hamas leader Sinwar was killed in Gaza JERUSALEM — The Israeli military says it is looking into whether Hamas’ top leader Yahya Sinwar was killed in a military operation in Gaza. The military said in a statement Thursday that three militants were killed during operations in Gaza, without elaborating. It said the identities of the three were so far not confirmed, but it was 'checking the possibility' that one of the three was Sinwar. Sinwar was one of the chief architects of Hamas’ attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. He was chosen as the group’s top leader following the assassination of Ismael Haniyeh in July in an apparent Israeli strike in the Iranian capital Tehran. German military says it intercepted drone off Lebanese coast BERLIN — The German military says a German navy ship deployed to the U.N. peacekeeping mission off the Lebanese coast has intercepted and brought down a drone. The military said a defense system on board the corvette, the Ludwigshafen am Rhein, brought the drone down in the water around 5 a.m. Thursday and that the drone’s explosive load detonated in the process. It said it did not know where the drone came from. The military didn’t specify the location of the ship at the time of the incident. The Ludwigshafen am Rhein is currently participating in the UNIFIL mission in Lebanon. Germany also has soldiers at the mission’s headquarters in Naqoura. Norwegian embassy in Beirut evacuated after receiving bomb threat OSLO, Norway — Norway's foreign ministry said the Norwegian embassy in Beirut was evacuated received a 'bomb threat' on Thursday. No one has been injured. A spokeswoman said the small number of Norwegian diplomats in Beirut were all safe. 'The acts of war in Lebanon make the security situation very unpredictable and tense. This threat is another example of that,' Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Ragnhild Simenstad said. 'The Foreign Ministry is continuously assessing the situation, including the safety of our colleagues who work in Beirut. The embassy has already implemented measures, as we have routines for in situations like this.' Strike on Gaza school-turned-shelter kills at least 15 An Israeli strike on a school sheltering displaced people in northern Gaza on Thursday killed at least 15 people, including four children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. The Israeli military said the strike targeted dozens of Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants who had gathered at the school. The strike hit the Abu Hussein school in Jabaliya, an urban refugee camp in northern Gaza where Israel has been waging a major air and ground operation for more than a week. ___ This item has been corrected to show four children were confirmed dead in the strike, not five. Read more here. Hezbollah official says the group will keep fighting ‘with all available means’ BEIRUT — A Hezbollah official says that the aim of the group’s military command is to keep fighting 'with all available means' to prevent Israel from achieving its goals and to eventually agree on a cease-fire. Legislator Hassan Fadlallah told reporters that since Israel’s invasion began on Oct. 1, Israeli troops have not been able to capture any village. Fadlallah said the aim of his group now is to stop the war but he refused to go into details saying that Lebanon’s parliament speaker and caretaker prime minister are leading the efforts. 'Our goal today is to end the aggression. We will not go into any detail related to the mechanism or solutions,' he said when asked whether Hezbollah still insists that it will only stop fighting once Israel’s offensive on Gaza stops. Fadlallah said that Israel has not been able to push deeper into Lebanon, stop Hezbollah rocket fire or create the conditions for its citizens to return to communities in the north near the border, which Israel says is its main war aim. Strike on Gaza tent camp kills 3 DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Palestinian medical officials say an Israeli strike on a tent camp in the Gaza Strip killed three men and wounded eight other people, including women and children. The bodies were taken to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah after the strike on Thursday. An Associated Press reporter counted the bodies. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. Israel has repeatedly struck tent camps and schools sheltering displaced people in Gaza. The military says it carries out precise strikes on militants who shelter among civilians, putting them in danger. Hamas-led militants triggered the war when they stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 others. Some 100 captives are still inside Gaza, about a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s offensive has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. It does not differentiate between civilians and combatants but says women and children make up a little more than half of the fatalities. Iranian foreign minister makes rare visit to Egypt to discuss tensions CAIRO -- Iran’s foreign minister has paid a rare visit to Egypt to discuss regional tensions linked to Israel’s war with Iran-allied groups in Lebanon and the Gaza Strip. Abbas Araghchi met with Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah El-Sissi and other top officials on Thursday to discuss ways of de-escalating tensions, according to an Egyptian statement. Egypt was the first Arab country to make peace with Israel and is a close U.S. ally. Araghchi visited Jordan, another close U.S. ally, on Wednesday. Israel has vowed to respond to an Iranian ballistic missile attack earlier this month, raising fears of a regionwide war that could draw in the U.S. and its allies. Egypt and Jordan have repeatedly called for a cease-fire in Gaza, and Egypt has been a key mediator between Israel and Hamas. Israel says it has killed local Hezbollah commander JERUSALEM — The Israeli military says it has killed a local Hezbollah commander in a southern Lebanese town near the border. The military said Thursday that an airstrike on Bint Jbeil killed Hussein Awada, who it said was in charge of firing projectiles into Israel from areas near the town. Israeli strikes in recent weeks have killed Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and most of his senior commanders. Also on Thursday, the Israeli military warned people to stay away from two buildings in the eastern villages of Saraaine and Tamnine, in the Bekaa Valley, where Israel has carried out scores of airstrikes over the past two weeks. Iranian commander repeats threats to Israel TEHRAN, Iran — The chief of Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard threatened Israel on Thursday with more missile barrages if it strikes Iran. 'Do not repeat your mistake — if you misbehave, if you strike anything of ours either in the region or in Iran, we will again hit you painfully,' said Gen. Hossein Salami in a funeral ceremony for Iranian Guard commander Abbas Nilforoushan, who was killed alongside the head of the Hezbollah militant group in Beirut in September. Salami said a missile barrage by Iran on Israel earlier in October in retaliation of killing Nasrallah and Nilforoushan was the 'tiniest' action by Iran. He said an air defense battery deployed to Israel by the U.S. will not prevent Iranian retaliation. 'We do know about your weakness, and you know too,' said Salami. Earlier this month, Iran launched some 180 missiles at Israel in retaliation for the death of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, killed in Iran in July, as well as Nilforoushan and Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who were killed in Israel strikes on Beirut in September. Iran is the main backer of Hezbollah and supports militant groups opposed to Israel across the region including Hamas. An Israeli strike wounds 2 in Syria, its military says DAMASCUS, Syria — Syria’s military says Israel carried out a strike early Thursday in the coastal city of Latakia, wounding two civilians and damaging a military post. The military statement that was carried by state media did not give further details. Israel regularly targets military sites in Syria linked to Iran and to Lebanon’s militant Hezbollah group. Those strikes have become more frequent after exchanges of fire along the Lebanon-Israel border began in October 2023, with Hezbollah attacking Israeli posts in support of the Palestinians and its ally, Hamas. The exchanges intensified over the past three weeks, and on Oct. 1, Israel began a ground invasion of southern Lebanon. US B-2 stealth bombers strike bunkers of Yemen’s Houthi rebels DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Long-range American B-2 stealth bombers launched airstrikes early Thursday morning targeting underground bunkers used by Yemen’s Houthi rebels, officials said. It wasn’t immediately clear what damage was done in the strikes. However, there are no previous reports of the B-2 Spirit being used in the strikes targeting the Houthis, who have been attacking ships for months in the Red Sea corridor over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. The Houthis’ al-Masirah satellite news channel reported airstrikes around Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, which the group has held since 2014. They also reported strikes around the Houthi stronghold of Saada. They offered no immediate information on damage or casualties. United States Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement that the B-2 bombers targeted 'five hardened underground weapons storage locations in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen.' The strike also appeared to be an indirect warning to Iran, the Houthis’ main benefactor, which has targeted Israel with ballistic missile attacks twice over the past year. The nuclear-capable B-2, which first saw action in 1999 in the Kosovo War, is rarely used by the U.S. military in combat as each aircraft is worth some $1 billion.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-hezbollah-mideast-latest-17-october-2024-b250e3c9d313e617d96977e406dea947	2024-10-16T21:41:36-07:00	
European Central Bank, seeing no signs of recession, cuts interest rates again	LONDON (AP) — The European Central Bank, which sets interest rates for the 20 countries that use the euro currency, does not expect the bloc to slide into recession as it cut borrowing costs once again Thursday in the wake of recent data showing inflation across the bloc falling to its lowest level in more than three years, and economic growth waning. The bank’s rate-setting council lowered its benchmark rate from 3.5% to 3.25% — its third reduction since June — at a meeting in Llubljana, Slovenia, rather than its usual Frankfurt, Germany, headquarters, and said the 'disinflationary process is well on track.' According to revised figures on Thursday, inflation across the 20-country eurozone, sank to 1.7% in September, the first time in three years that it has been below the ECB’s target rate of 2%. In a statement accompanying the decision, the ECB predicted an inflation pick-up in the coming months, before a return to its target in the course of next year. In a press briefing following the decision, ECB President Christine Lagarde gave few signals that the bank would be cutting interest rates again at the next policy meeting in December, stressing that the governing council is 'not pre-committing to a particular rate path.' She insisted that decisions will 'follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach.' Lagarde did acknowledge that the recent data on economic activity had come in 'somewhat weaker than expected,' pointing to a contraction in manufacturing sector and weaker exports. Even though Germany, Europe's powerhouse economy, saw output shrink in the second quarter, albeit by 0.1%, Lagarde said that she she didn't expect the eurozone economy overall to fall into recession, though she did note the downside risks that could emanate from the conflict in the Middle East and any new tariffs that Donald Trump may impose on European goods should he become U.S. president again. 'On the basis of the information that we have, we certainly do not see a recession,' she said. Economists think mounting evidence of an economic slowdown in the eurozone, particularly in Germany, will pile pressure on rate-setters to consider another cut to help bolster growth by making it even cheaper for businesses and consumers to borrow. In the second quarter of the year, the eurozone expanded by a modest quarterly rate of 0.2%. 'Although the ECB did not pre-commit to any specific rate path, we believe that downside risks to growth in a context of easing inflationary pressure will lead to more rate cuts starting in December and continuing in 2025,' said GianLuigi Mandruzzato, senior economist at EFG Asset Management. The ECB, which was created in 1999 when the euro currency was born, started raising interest rates in the summer of 2021, taking them up to a r ecord high of 4% in Sept. 2023 to get a grip on inflation by making it more expensive for businesses and consumers to borrow, but that has come at a cost by weighing on growth. One reason why inflation has fallen around the world — it's down at 2.4% in the U.S. and 1.7% in the U.K. — is that central banks dramatically increased borrowing costs from near zero during the coronavirus pandemic when prices started to shoot up, first as a result of supply chain issues built up and then because of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, which pushed up energy costs. Other central banks, such as the U.S. Federal Reserve, have also started to cut interest rates as inflation rates have fallen.	https://apnews.com/article/european-central-bank-interest-rates-inflation-4b2545966c179c893a8ff34421a2530f	2024-10-16T21:07:36-07:00	
Stock market today: Wall Street drifts around its records as the US economy keeps humming	NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are drifting around their records Thursday following the latest signals that the U.S. economy continues to hum. The S&amp;P 500 was 0.1% higher in midday trading and flirting with its record set early this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was adding 99 points, or 0.2%, to its own all-time high set the day before, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.2% higher, as of 11 a.m. Eastern time. Nvidia and other companies in the chip industry were helping to lead the way after global heavyweight Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported bigger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. TSMC credited strong demand related to smartphones and artificial intelligence, and its stock that trades in the United States jumped 13.1%. The 2.5% rise for Nvidia was the strongest force pushing upward on the S&amp;P 500, and it was a sharp turnaround from earlier in the week when a warning from a major Dutch supplier to the chip industry, ASML, sent stocks sinking across the industry. Because Nvidia and other tech stocks have grown so big, their movements pack extra weight on the S&amp;P 500 and other indexes. Treasury yields were also rising in the bond market following the latest encouraging reports on the U.S. economy. U.S. retailers made more in sales in September than in August, and underlying growth trends within the data were better than economists expected. The strength was 'all the more impressive in the face of stretched household finances, particularly among lower-income shoppers, and pre-election jitters,' according to Gary Schlossberg, market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. A separate report, meanwhile, said fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week, a signal that layoffs nationwide are relatively low and aren’t damaging the job market. Such data bolster the hope that has sent U.S. stocks to records: The economy could make a perfect escape from the worst inflation in generations, one that doesn’t end with a recession that many investors worried was nearly inevitable. And with the Federal Reserve now cutting interest rates to help the economy keep humming, the expectation among optimists is that stocks can rise even further. Critics, meanwhile, warn that stock prices look too expensive given how much faster they've climbed than profits for companies. Lower interest rates can ease the brakes off the economy, boost prices for investments and make borrowing bills less costly for households and businesses. And rates are heading lower around the world, with only a couple exceptions. The European Central Bank on Thursday cut its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point. That helped send stock indexes higher by 1.3% in France and 0.7% in Germany. They halted a run of losses that began the day in Asian stock markets, where Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 0.7% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dropped 1%. On Wall Street, insurer Travelers was another winner and rose 7.8% after reporting stronger profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Higher income made from its investments and elsewhere helped cover greater losses due to Hurricane Helene and severe wind and hail storms in multiple states. Blackstone also helped push indexes higher after the investor in real estate, hedge funds and other alternative investments reported stronger profit than expected. It climbed 4.5% after CEO Stephen Schwarzman said it's seeing broad-based acceleration across its businesses. They helped offset a 12.7% drop for Elevance Health, which reported weaker profit for the latest quarter than expected. The Blue Cross-Blue Shield insurer also cut its forecast for profit for the full year, saying it was dealing with a 'timing mismatch' between Medicaid rates and higher claims from customers. CSX fell 4.8% after falling short of analysts’ profit expectations for the latest quarter. The railroad also expects only modest volume growth the rest of the year as the Southeast rebuilds after two major hurricanes. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.09% from 4.02%. The two-year yield, which moves more closely with expectations for action by the Fed, rose to 3.98% from 3.94%. All the strong recent reports on the U.S. economy have forced traders to abandon bets that the Federal Reserve could cut its main interest rate by another half a percentage point in November. Instead, they're largely betting the Fed will move forward with a traditional-sized cut of a quarter of a percentage point, according to data from CME Group. That shift in expectations has helped push Treasury yields higher. ___ AP Business Writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-rates-china-earnings-17ae24422a6dd5c641f94597b0d99b1f	2024-10-16T20:13:22-07:00	
How a broke Argentine province is countering Milei's deep austerity cuts	LA RIOJA, Argentina (AP) — They look like cash, fit into wallets like cash and the governor promises they’ll be treated like cash. But these brightly colored banknotes aren’t pesos, the depreciating national currency of Argentina, or U.S. dollars, everyone’s money of choice here. They are chachos, a new emergency tender invented by the left-wing populist governor of La Rioja, a province in the country's northwest that went broke when far-right President Javier Milei slashed federal budget transfers to provinces as part of an unprecedented austerity program. 'Who would have imagined that one day I’d find myself wishing I’d gotten pesos?' said Lucia Vera, a music teacher emerging from a gymnasium packed with state workers waiting to get their monthly bonus of chachos worth 50,000 pesos (about $40). Across La Rioja's capital, 'Chachos accepted here' decals now appear on the windows of everything from chain supermarkets and gas stations to upscale restaurants and hair salons. The local government guarantees a 1-to-1 exchange rate with pesos, and accepts chachos for tax payments and utilities bills. But there’s a catch. Chachos can’t be used outside La Rioja, and only registered businesses can swap chachos for pesos at a few government exchange points. 'I need real money,' said Adriana Parcas, a 22-year-old street vendor who pays her suppliers in pesos, after turning down two customers in a row who asked if they could buy her perfumes with chachos. The bills bear the face of Ángel Vicente 'Chacho' Peñaloza, the caudillo, or strongman, famed for defending La Rioja in a 19th-century battle against national authorities in Buenos Aires. A QR code on the banknote links to a website denouncing Milei for refusing to transfer La Rioja its fair share of federal funds. After entering office in December 2023, Milei swiftly imposed his shock therapy in a bid to reverse decades of budget-busting populism that ran up Argentina's monumental deficits. The cuts squeezed all of Argentina’s 23 provinces but boiled over into a full-blown crisis in La Rioja, where the public payroll accounts for two-thirds of registered workers and the federal government’s redistributed taxes cover some 90% of the provincial budget. With just 384,600 people and little industry beyond walnuts and olives, La Rioja received more discretionary federal funds than any other last year except Buenos Aires, home to 17.6 million people. Yet the province’s poverty rate tops 66% — the result, critics say, of a patronage system long used to placate interest groups at the expense of efficiency. While Milei's reforms forced other provinces to tighten their belts and lay off thousands of employees, Governor Ricardo Quintela — an ambitious power broker in Argentina’s long-dominant Peronist movement and one of Milei’s fiercest critics — refused to absorb the strife of austerity. 'I’m not going to take food from the people of La Rioja to pay the debt that the government owes us,' Quintela told The Associated Press, portraying his chacho-printing plan as a daring stand against 10 months of crumbling wages, rising unemployment and deepening misery under Milei. La Rioja defaulted on its debts in February and August. A New York federal judge ordered the province to pay American and British bondholders nearly $40 million in damages in September. Argentina’s Supreme Court is taking up the case of the province’s refusal to charge consumers sky-high prices for electricity after Milei’s removal of subsidies. 'There’s an alternative path to the cruelty of policies that the president is applying,' Quintela said. He appeared confident, speaking as Milei’s approval ratings dipped below 50% for the first time since the radical economist came to power. But as Milei and his allies tell it, Quintela’s alternative offers little more than a return to Argentina’s habitual Peronist preserve of reckless spending — and insolvency — that delivered the unmitigated crisis that his government inherited. 'You were used to having your tie fastened for you and your shoes polished, but now, you’ve got to tie the knot yourself,' Eduardo Serenellini, press secretary of Milei’s office, snapped at La Rioja business leaders on a recent visit to the province. 'When you run out of cash, you run out cash.' Serenellini picked up a chacho note, then flicked it away like lint. Gov. Quintela’s gambit in the remote province has had little effect on Argentina’s federal finances, but that could change if more cash-trapped provinces catch on, as happened during Argentina’s terrible financial crisis of 2001, when a similarly brutal austerity scheme sent over a dozen provinces scrambling to print their own parallel currencies. Unlike two decades ago, when former President Néstor Kirchner, a Peronist, put an end to the chaos by redeeming 'patacones,' 'cecacores' and 'boncanfores' for pesos, President Milei has ruled out a bailout for La Rioja. 'We will not be accomplices to irresponsible people,' Milei warned in a recent interview with Argentine TV channel Todo Noticias. But the libertarian purist added that he couldn’t stop La Rioja from doing what it pleased, considering that Argentina's constitution allows for such desperate financial work-arounds. The chacho hit the streets in August after La Rioja’s legislature approved plans to run off $22.5 billion pesos worth of the currency to help cover up to 30% of public sector salaries. With La Rioja’s average income sinking below $200 per month and stores shuttering for lack of business, authorities doled out 8.4 billion pesos worth of the scrip in monthly bonuses in August and September, an effort to help workers cope with Argentina’s 230% annual inflation and spur the stricken local economy. To encourage the chacho's use, authorities promise to pay interest of 17% on bills held to maturity on December 31. 'The closer we get to the expiration date, the more we’ll see public confidence in the chacho increase,' said provincial treasurer advisor Carlos Nardillo Giraud. Most state workers interviewed in the many chacho lines spilling onto La Rioja’s sidewalks last month said they wanted to get rid of the bills as quickly as possible. 'Now the chacho is an alternative, an option for people who can’t make it to the end of the month,' said 30-year-old physics teacher Daniela Parra, mounting her boyfriend’s motorcycle with arms full of chachos, ready to spend them all in one go at the supermarket. 'Who knows what will it be next month?' On the streets, merchants said they felt locked in a catch-22. Rejecting chachos meant turning away customers with new spending power in a deep recession. But accepting chachos meant filling cash registers with money that’s worthless to foreign suppliers and already changing hands at a discount to pesos on the street. 'They've formed a system where you're forced to depend on the state for everything,' said Juan Keulian, the director of La Rioja’s Center for Commerce and Industry. 'There’s no choice in a place like this.' ___ Follow AP's Latin America coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/argentina-fake-money-economic-crisis-milei-peronism-bankrupt-province-30d478ec8292ccce27cb450ea1bb1c1a	2024-10-16T19:06:14-07:00	
Japan records trade deficit on weak yen, slowing exports	TOKYO (AP) — Japan racked up a trade deficit of 294.3 billion yen ($2 billion) in September, according to Finance Ministry data released Thursday, as exports fell to key destinations like China. For the first half of the April to March fiscal year, Japan’s trade deficit, or its imports subtracted from exports, was 3.1 trillion ($21 billion), the preliminary report showed. Japan’s exports in September fell 1.7% from the same month a year earlier in the first such decline in 10 months. Imports grew 2.1% from the previous year, on the back of a weak yen, which inflates their value. It was unclear if the drop, which was unexpected, reflected weaker demand in other major economies, since exports to other Asian countries rose. It also could be partly due to temporary disruptions like a recent typhoon. But slowing global demand remains a long-term worry for export-dependent Japan. The U.S. dollar has been trading at 149 yen Japanese yen levels recently, not far from its level a year ago but up from about 120 yen two years ago. Inflation and rising energy prices have also pushed up import costs. Exports rose 6.6% for the months from April through September to 53.55 trillion yen ($358 billion) as demand remained strong for computer chips. Imports grew 7% during that period to 56.66 trillion yen ($379 billion), as Japanese businesses and shoppers bought more U.S. products, the report said. In the first half of fiscal 2024, Japan recorded a nearly 4.3 trillion yen ($29 billion) trade surplus with the United States and a 3 trillion yen ($20 billion) deficit with China. ___ Yuri Kageyama is on X: https://x.com/yurikageyama	https://apnews.com/article/japan-trade-energy-deficit-currency-583416dd5f2ded1e1ca9667149342683	2024-10-16T18:50:29-07:00	
US long-range B-2 stealth bombers target underground bunkers of Yemen's Houthi rebels	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — U.S. long-range B-2 stealth bombers launched airstrikes early Thursday morning targeting underground bunkers used by Yemen's Houthi rebels, officials said. It wasn't immediately clear what damage was done in the strikes. However, there are no previous reports of the B-2 Spirit being used in the strikes targeting the Houthis, who have been attacking ships for months in the Red Sea corridor over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. The Houthis' al-Masirah satellite news channel reported airstrikes around Yemen's capital, Sanaa, which the group has held since 2014. They also reported strikes around the Houthi stronghold of Saada. They offered no immediate information on damage or casualties. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement that the B-2 bombers targeted 'five hardened underground weapons storage locations in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen.' The strike also appeared to be an indirect warning to Iran, the Houthis' main benefactor, which has targeted Israel with ballistic missile attacks twice over the past year. The B-2 would be used in any American attack on hardened Iranian nuclear facilities like Natanz or Fordo given it is the only aircraft in service that can drop the GBU-57, known as the 'Massive Ordnance Penetrator.' 'This was a unique demonstration of the United States’ ability to target facilities that our adversaries seek to keep out of reach, no matter how deeply buried underground, hardened, or fortified,' Austin said. Austin and the U.S. military's Central Command offered no immediate assessment on the damage done. However, Central Command said in a statement that initial assessments suggested no civilians had been killed. The Red Sea has become a battlefield for shippers since the Houthis began their campaign targeting ships traveling through the waterway, which once saw $1 trillion of cargo pass through it yearly. Houthis have targeted more than 80 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started in October 2023. They have seized one vessel and sunk two in the campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have included Western military vessels. The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the United Kingdom to force an end to Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran. The Houthis also continue to launch missiles targeting Israel and have shot down a number of U.S. military MQ-9 Reaper drones. The rebels have threatened new attacks in response to Israel's ground invasion of Lebanon and its killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. The description and locations named by the Houthis on Thursday correspond to known underground bases operated by the rebels, who have been locked into a stalemated war with a Saudi-led coalition since 2015 that’s decimated the Arab world’s poorest nation. The Houthis have refurbished tunnels that once held Scud missiles for Yemen when it was ruled by strongman Ali Abdullah Saleh during his 33-year reign, according to an analysis in April by the International Institute for Strategic Studies. Those sites include the al-Hafa and Jabal Attan military bases, the former Presidential House and the Yemen state television compound in Sanaa, analyst Fabian Hinz wrote. The Houthis have built what appears to be their own large-scale tunnel network near Saada as well, Hinz added. 'The fact that the Houthis began constructing major new installations after the agreement of the cease-fire with the Saudi-led coalition suggests that the group is focused on entrenching themselves and bolstering their military capabilities,' he wrote. Iran similarly relies on a network of underground missile bases. The nuclear-capable B-2, which first saw action in 1999 in the Kosovo War, is rarely used by the U.S. military in combat as each aircraft is worth some $1 billion. It has dropped bombs in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya as well. The aircraft are based at Whiteman Air Base in Missouri and typically conduct long-range strikes from there, though some B-2s were in Australia in September.	https://apnews.com/article/us-airstrikes-yemen-houthi-rebels-israel-hamas-war-99721f7f952d66d6da27e24dc3c189c3	2024-10-16T18:18:47-07:00	
Aging farmers face extreme temperatures as they struggle to maintain Japan's rice crop	KAMIMOMI, Japan (AP) — In the remote village of Kamimomi in Japan’s western Okayama prefecture, a small group of rice farmers began their most recent harvest in sweltering heat, two weeks sooner than usual. The prefecture is called 'the Land of Sunshine' because of its pleasant climate, but farmers working among the paddy fields and ancient rice terraces say that climate change is hurting the harvest of rice, long a cornerstone of Japan’s diet. 'Last year, an exceptional heat wave took the water out of the rice, which became small and thin,' rice farmer Joji Terasaka said. 'So I am worried about that this year because it will be just as hot.' This year Japan experienced its hottest July on record, with temperatures reaching 2.16 C (3.9 F) higher than average, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency. The globe has seen a 1.2 C (2.2 F) rise in average temperature since preindustrial times, and scientists agree that warming needs to be capped at 1.5 C (2.7 F) to stave off the worst effects of climate change. That includes even more powerful heat, storms and irreversible ice melt. Last year, Japan recorded a poor rice harvest nationwide because of exceptionally hot weather. Ministry data showed the country’s private-sector rice inventory fell to 1.56 million tons in June, the lowest level since records began in 1999. Last year was the hottest on record globally, though it’s feared that this year may top it. The drop in harvest in Japan was partly to blame for this year’s widespread summer rice shortage, according to officials. There were empty shelves in supermarkets, and some retailers are still enforcing purchase limits of one rice bag per customer. 'Perhaps people think that an increase of one degree Celsius in average temperature isn’t much. But it’s quite a big change for plants and crops,' says Yuji Masutomi, a researcher at the National Institute for Environmental Studies in Tsukuba, north of Tokyo. Masutomi said the rising temperatures not only influence the growth cycle and yield of rice, but also hurt the quality of the grain. When temperatures rise above 27 C, the buildup of starch inside rice grains is reduced. That causes the crop to take on a chalky appearance, and its value is reduced. At least a fifth of rice farms have reported a drop in quality from rising temperatures, according to a farming ministry report last year. 'Not only is the appearance not good; people say the taste drops too,' Masutomi said. For farmers in Kamimomi, there's another problem with working under exceptional heat. The average age of agricultural workers in Japan is nearly 69, among the oldest in the world, and older people are especially vulnerable to heatstroke. Toshimi Kaiami led a community project in Kamimomi that involved reviving some of the paddy fields abandoned because of the aging population. 'There are no longer any successors,' says Kaiami. 'We are heading toward extinction.' The community project divides labor among Kamimomi's farmers. But preparations for the harvest coincided with the hottest months of the year — April to September. 'It takes a half year to produce rice. The heat and the work that we have to endure during that time is really tough,' said rice farmer Mitsumasa Sugimoto, 77. To deal with climate change, the government is promoting the adoption of heat-resistant rice variants, including Sai no Kizuna, which was developed by a research center in Saitama prefecture, near Tokyo. Research organizations around the world have worked to produce more resilient strains of essential food like rice while introducing more heat and drought resistant grains like sorghum or millet. 'Last year and this year have been extremely hot, but even in those conditions, Sai no Kizuna maintained a certain level of quality,' said Naoto Ohoka, who manages rice breeding at Saitama’s Agricultural Technology Research Center. 'Its other characteristic is that it is very delicious.' The center cultivates more than a thousand types of rice strains, and through cross-pollination officials assess and select the best performers to develop new varieties. Sai no Kizuna was developed in 2012 to better withstand heat, a trait that has become more widely recognized recently as Japan sees hotter summers. The strain also stands up well against typhoon wind and certain pests and diseases. Researchers want to develop more resilient strains against heat as temperatures are projected to continue rising. Masutomi recommends that variants tolerant of temperatures up to 3 degrees Celsius higher should be introduced across Japan by the 2040s. But it’s a long process. It can take up to 10 years to develop a new variant. Once it’s approved for the market, farmers must then be convinced to switch to the new strain. The most widely grown variety is Koshihikari, which is less heat resistant. Even so, older farmers have shown a reluctance to switch to other varieties. Farming ministry data show that only around 15% of Japanese paddy fields have adopted heat resistance variants.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-climate-change-rice-farming-struggle-a569237462e65426587d48876145e825	2024-10-16T18:09:13-07:00

Liam Payne, former One Direction member, dies at 31 in Argentina hotel fall	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — Former One Direction singer Liam Payne, 31, whose chart-topping British boy band generated a global following of swooning fans, was found dead Wednesday after falling from a hotel balcony in Buenos Aires, local officials said. Buenos Aires police said in a statement that Payne fell from the third floor of the Casa Sur Hotel in the trendy Palermo neighborhood of Argentina's capital, resulting in 'extremely serious injuries.' Medics confirmed his death on the spot, the statement said. Pablo Policicchio, the communications director for the Buenos Aires Security Ministry, said in a statement to The Associated Press that Payne 'had jumped from the balcony of his room.' Police rushed to the hotel in response to an emergency call just after 5 p.m. local time, he said, warning of an 'aggressive man who could be under the influence of drugs or alcohol.' The hotel manager can be heard on a 911 call obtained by the AP saying they had 'a guest who is overwhelmed with drugs and alcohol ... He’s destroying the entire room and, well, we need you to send someone, please.' The manager's voice became more anxious as the call went on, noting the room had a balcony. Alberto Crescenti, head of the state emergency medical system, told Argentina’s Todo Noticias TV channel that authorities were investigating the circumstances of his death and conducting an autopsy. Payne had been vocal about struggling with alcoholism, posting a video in July 2023 to his YouTube channel where he said he had been sober for six months after receiving treatment. Representatives for Payne did not immediately return emails and calls. Dozens of One Direction fans flocked from across Buenos Aires to the Casa Sur Hotel after the news broke, forming lines that spilled into the cordoned-off street outside the hotel where police stood sentinel. Forensic investigators were seen exiting the hotel, from where Payne’s body was removed around three hours after the fall. Young women filming with their cellphones expressed shock and heartbreak as a makeshift memorial with rows of candles and bouquets quickly grew outside the hotel. 'I didn’t think he was going to die so young,' 21-year-old Isabella Milesi told the AP. Payne was one of five members of One Direction, which formed when they each auditioned for the British singing competition series 'The X Factor' in 2010, two years after Payne's first attempt to get on the show. At 16 the second time around, Payne sang Michael Bublé’s version of 'Cry Me a River,' appearing nervous at the start but warming up with the audience’s cheers and applause. After each singer failed to make it through the competition as solo acts, Simon Cowell and his fellow judges combined Payne, Zayn Malik, Harry Styles, Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson into what would become one of the most successful boy bands — even though they lost the competition. Each member had their own persona, with Payne — who hailed from Wolverhampton, a city in the West Midlands region of England — being known as the responsible one. The band became known for their pop sound and romantic hits like 'What Makes You Beautiful,' 'Night Changes' and 'Story of My Life.' Payne had prominent solos on songs including 'Stole My Heart' and 'Change Your Ticket,' co-writing several of the band's hits. They had six Top 10 hits on the Billboard charts by the time they disbanded in 2016 and a highly loyal fan base, known as 'Directioners,' many of whom were teen girls. 'I’ve always loved One Direction since I was little,' said 18-year-old Juana Relh, another fan outside Payne’s hotel. 'To see that he died and that there will never be another reunion of the boys is unbelievable, it kills me.' With his meteoric rise to fame, Payne had said that it took some time to adjust to the public eye. 'I don’t think you can ever deal with that, it’s all a bit crazy for us to see that people get in that sort of state of mind about us and what we do,' he said in a 2013 interview with the AP after recounting an experience where a fan was in a state of shock upon meeting him. After the group's dissolution, Payne — like each of his erstwhile bandmates — pursued a solo career, shifting toward EDM and hip-hop. His 2017 single 'Strip That Down,' featuring Quavo, reached the Billboard Top 10, and stayed on the charts for several months. He put out an album 'LP1' in 2019, and his last release — a single called 'Teardrops' — was released in March. Payne had a 7-year-old son, Bear Grey Payne, with his former girlfriend, the musician Cheryl who was known as Cheryl Cole when she performed with Girls Aloud. She was an 'X Factor' judge during One Direction's season, although their relationship began years later. Payne was previously engaged to Maya Henry, from August 2020 to early 2022. Henry released a novel earlier this year that she said was based on their relationship. In addition to his son, he is survived by his parents, Geoff and Karen Payne, and his two older sisters, Ruth and Nicola. ___ Huamani reported from Los Angeles.

North Korea says its revised constitution defines South Korea as 'hostile state' for first time	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea confirmed Thursday that its recently revised constitution defines South Korea as 'a hostile state' for the first time, two days after it blew up front-line road and rail links that once connected the country with the South. The back-to-back developments indicate North Korea is intent on escalating animosities against South Korea, increasing the danger of possible clashes at their tense border areas, though it’s highly unlikely for the North to launch full-scale attacks in the face of more superior U.S. and South Korea forces. The official Korean Central News Agency said Thursday that its recent demolition of parts of the northern sections of the inter-Korean road and rail links was 'an inevitable and legitimate measure taken in keeping with the requirement of the DPRK constitution which clearly defines the ROK as a hostile state.' DPRK stands for Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the North's official name, while ROK stands for Republic of Korea, the South's formal name. South Korea’s Unification Ministry condemned North Korea’s constitutional reference to South Korea as a hostile state, calling it 'an anti-unification, anti-national act.' It said the South Korean government will sternly respond to any provocations by North Korea and unwaveringly push for a peaceful Korean unification based on the basic principle of freedom and democracy. North Korea’s rubber-stamp parliament met for two days last week to rewrite the constitution but state media hadn't provided many details about the session. Leader Kim Jong Un had earlier called for the constitutional change at that parliamentary meeting to designate South Korea as the country’s main enemy, remove the goal of a peaceful Korean unification and define North Korea’s sovereign, territorial sphere. Thursday's KCNA dispatch gave no further details of the new constitution, except the description of South Korea. 'There may still be an internal propaganda review underway about the appropriate way to disclose the constitutional revisions, but this confirmation was expected,' said Ankit Panda, an expert with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Kim’s order in January to rewrite the constitution caught many foreign experts by surprise because it was seen as eliminating the idea of shared statehood between the war-divided Koreas and breaking away with his predecessors’ long-cherished dreams of peacefully achieving a unified Korea on the North’s terms. In the past months, North Korea has torn down monuments symbolizing rapprochement with South Korea and abolished state agencies handling inter-Korean relations. Some experts say Kim likely aims to guard against South Korean cultural influence and bolster his family's dynastic rule. Others say Kim wants legal room to use his nuclear weapons against South Korea by making it as a foreign enemy state, not a partner for potential unification which shares a sense of national homogeneity. They say Kim may also want to seek direct dealings with the U.S. in future diplomacy on its nuclear program, not via South Korea. 'North Korea has fallen so far behind the South that any social exchange or financial integration might look like paths to unification by absorption,' said Leif-Eric Easley, professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul. 'Pyongyang’s rejection of peaceful Korean unification is thus a strategy for regime survival and maintaining domestic control. This not only bodes ill for diplomacy but could also become an ideology motivating military aggression against Seoul,' Easley said. KCNA, citing North Korea’s Defense Ministry, reported that North Korea on Tuesday blew up the 60-meter (197 feet)-long sections of two pairs of the roads and railway routes — one pair on the western portion of the inter-Korean border and the other on the eastern side of the border. Largely built with South Korean money, the road and rail links were once a major symbol of now-dormant inter-Korean reconciliation movements. In the 2000s, the two Koreas reconnected the road and rail routes for the first time since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War, but their operations were halted later as the rivals bickered over North Korea's nuclear ambitions and other issues. Last week, North Korea said it would permanently block its border with South Korea and build front-line defense structures. South Korean officials said North Korea had been adding anti-tank barriers and laying mines along the border since earlier this year. Animosities between the Koreas increased in recent days, with North Korea accusing South Korea of flying drones over its capital Pyongyang three times this month and vowing strong military responses if similar incidents happen again. South Korea has refused to confirm whether it sent drones but warned that North Korea will face a regime demise if the safety of South Korean citizens is threatened. Many observers say North Korea won't likely launch a full-blown war because it knows its military is outgunned by the U.S. and South Korean forces, and that North Korea ultimately aims to use its advancing nuclear program as leverage to wrest sanctions relief from the U.S. But they say a miscalculation could still lead to border clashes. Intense outside attention has been on whether the North Korean constitutional change includes new legal, territorial claims around the Koreas' disputed western sea boundary, the site where several deadly skirmishes and bloodsheds happened in the past 25 years. 'South Korea and the United States need not overreact to North Korean moves. The recent drone incident raises the possibility of miscalculation and escalation,' Panda, the expert, said.	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-constitution-change-enemy-12a1ec860d84b106265d35676cb1a0b3	2024-10-16T12:56:11-07:00	
Helene and Milton are both likely to be $50 billion disasters, joining ranks of most costly storms	Monstrous hurricanes Helene and Milton caused so much complex havoc that damages are still being added up, but government and private experts say they will likely join the infamous ranks of Katrina, Sandy and Harvey as super costly $50-billion-plus killers. Making that even more painful is that most of the damage — 95% or more in Helene's case — was not insured, putting victims in a deeper financial hole. Storm deaths have been dropping over time, although Helene was an exception. But even adjusted for inflation, damages from intense storms are skyrocketing because people are building in harm's way, rebuilding costs are rising faster than inflation, and human-caused climate change are making storms stronger and wetter, experts in different fields said. 'Today’s storms, today’s events are simply vastly different from yesterday’s events. One of the things that we’re seeing is the energy content that these systems can retain is significantly greater than it used to be,' said John Dickson, president of Aon Edge Insurance Agency, which specializes in flood coverage. 'The weather seems to be, in many cases, moving faster than we as a society are able to keep pace with it.' In the last 45 years, and adjusted for inflation, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has counted 396 weather disasters that caused at least $1 billion in damage. Sixty-three of those were hurricanes or tropical storms. The $50 billion mark for direct losses is a threshold that differentiates 'truly historic events,' said Adam Smith, the economist and meteorologist who runs the list out of NOAA's National Center for Environmental Information in Helene-hit Asheville, North Carolina. Only eight hurricanes reached that threshold. Smith said he thought Milton and Helene have 'a very good shot' of joining that list. The first $50 billion hurricane was Andrew in 1992. The U.S. went 13 more years before Katrina topped the damages chart, then seven years until the third costly whopper, Sandy. Helene and Milton would make seven in the last seven years. Calculating damages is far from an exact science. The more complex and nastier storms are — like Milton and Helene — the longer it takes, Smith said. Damage is spread over different places and often a much larger area, with wind damage in some places and flood damage elsewhere. Helene, in particular, caused widespread flooding and in places not used to it. Estimates for those storms from private firms in recent days vary and are incomplete. There's three categories of damage: insured damage, uninsured damage and total economic cost. Many risk and insurance firms only estimate insured losses. Homeowner insurance usually covers wind damage, but not flood. Special insurance has to be bought for that. Flood insurance coverage rates vary by region and storms differ on whether they cause more wind or water damage. Helene was mostly water damage, which is less likely to be covered, while Milton had a good chunk of wind damage. Of the top 10 costliest hurricanes as compiled by insurance giant Swiss Re — not including Helene or Milton yet — insured damage is about 44% of total costs. But with Helene, Aon's Dickson estimated that only 5% of victims had insurance coverage for the type of damage they got. He estimated $10 billion in insured damage so doing the math would put total damage in the $100 billion to $200 billion range, which he called a bit high but in the ballpark. Insured losses for Milton are in the $50 billion to $60 billion range, he said. With Helene, Swiss Re said less than 2% of Georgia households have federal flood insurance, with North Carolina and South Carolina at 3% and 9%. In North Carolina's Buncombe County, where more than 57 people died from Helene's flooding, less than 1% of the homes are covered by federal flood insurance, the agency said. Risk modeling by Moody's, the financial services conglomerate, put a combined two-storm total damage estimate of $20 billion to $34 billion. Karen Clark and Company, a disaster modeling firm that uses computer simulations superimposed on storm and insurance data, wouldn't give total damage estimates for the storms. But the company figured insured losses alone were $36 billion for Milton and $6.4 billion for Helene. 'The economic losses are going up because we're putting more infrastructure and housing in harm's way,' said University of South Carolina's Susan Cutter, co-director of the Hazards Vulnerability and Resilience Institute, who added that climate change also plays a role. 'Human losses and deaths are going down because people are being a little bit more vigilant about paying attention to preparedness and getting out of harm's way.' Much of the damage is because of flooding. Studies show that hurricanes are getting wetter because of the buildup of heat-trapping gases from the burning of coal, oil and gas. Basic physics dictates that clouds hold 4% more moisture for every degree Fahrenheit (7% for every degree Celsius), and that falls as rain. 'There is scientific agreement that floods and flooding from these hurricanes is becoming more frequent and more severe. So it is likely that we’re going to be seeing a higher frequency of storms like Helene in the future,' said Karen Clark, who founded her namesake firm. 'It’s not really an insurance issue because it’s not privately insured. This is really a societal issue and political question. How do we want to deal with this?' Clark and several of the experts said it's time for society to think about where it builds, where it lives and if it should just leave dangerous areas and not rebuild, a concept called 'managed retreat.' 'At what point do you as an individual continue to build, rebuild, rebuild and rebuild versus saying ‘OK, I’ve had enough',' Cutter said. And when it comes to flood insurance, many homeowners in risky areas find it's too expensive, so they don't buy it, Clark said. But when a storm hits them, she said 'all of us as taxpayers, we're going to pay it because we know there are going to be federal dollars coming into those areas to help people rebuild. So all taxpayers, we're actually paying for people to live in risky areas.' __ Read more of AP’s climate coverage at http://www.apnews.com/climate-and-environment ___ Follow Seth Borenstein on X at @borenbears ______ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Trudeau says police went public with Indian diplomat allegations to prevent further violence	TORONTO (AP) — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday that Canada's national police force went public with its allegations against Indian diplomats this week because it had to disrupt violent acts in Canada including drive-by-shootings, extortions and even murder. The Royal Canadian Police said Monday it had identified India’s top diplomat in the country and five other diplomats as persons of interest in the June 2023 killing of Sikh activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. The RCMP also said they uncovered evidence of an intensifying campaign against Canadians by agents of the Indian government. 'We are not looking to provoke or create a fight with India,' Trudeau said. 'The Indian government made a horrific mistake in thinking that they could interfere as aggressively as they did in the safety and sovereignty of Canada. We need to respond in order to ensure Canadians safety.' Niijar's killing has strained bilateral relations between India and Canada for over a year and boiled over this week as the countries expelled each other’s top diplomats over those allegations and other alleged crimes in Canada. Trudeau said he has tried not to 'blow up' relations with India and that Canadian officials provided evidence privately with their Indian counterparts who, he said, have been uncooperative. 'The decision by the RCMP to go forward with that announcement was entirely anchored in public safety and a goal of disrupting the chain of activities that was resulting in drive by shootings, home invasions, violent extortion and even murder in and across Canada,' Trudeau said while testifying Wednesday before the Foreign Interference Commission in Ottawa. Trudeau said Indian diplomats have been passing information about Canadians to the highest levels of the Indian government which was then shared with organized crime, resulting in violence against Canadians. 'It was the RCMP's determination that that scheme needed to be disrupted,' he said. RCMP Commissioner Mike Duheme said Monday police have evidence allegedly tying Indian government agents to other homicides and violent acts in Canada. He declined to provide specifics, citing ongoing investigations, but he said there have been well over a dozen credible and imminent threats that have resulted in police warning members of the South Asian community, notably the pro-Khalistan, or Sikh independence, movement. Trudeau said India has violated Canada’s sovereignty. India has rejected the accusations as absurd. India has repeatedly criticized Trudeau’s government for being soft on supporters of the Khalistan movement who live in Canada. The Khalistan movement is banned in India but has support among the Sikh diaspora, particularly in Canada. Nijjar, 45, was fatally shot in his pickup truck after he left the Sikh temple he led in Surrey, British Columbia. An Indian-born citizen of Canada, he owned a plumbing business and was a leader in what remains of a once-strong movement to create an independent Sikh homeland. Four Indian nationals living in Canada were charged with Niijar’s murder and are awaiting trial. Trudeau noted his government could have gone public with the allegations when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi hosted the G20 Summit in September 2023, but chose not to. He met with Modi and expressed concerns privately then. 'It was a big moment for India welcoming all the leaders of the world to New Delhi for a very important summit and we had the opportunity of making it a very uncomfortable summit for India if we went public with these allegations ahead of time,' said Trudeau. 'We chose to continue to work with India behind the scenes to try and get India to cooperate with us.' Trudeau said that when he returned home India's response, particularly through the media, was to attack Canada. Trudeau later went public in Parliament with the allegation that the Indian government might have been involved in Niijar’s killing. He said there were about to be media stories detailing the allegation of India's possible involvement in the killing of a Canadian Sikh on Canadian soil. He said he went public because of worries about public safety. Canada’s foreign minister on Monday said violence in Canada has worsened since then. The British government said India should cooperate with Canada’s investigation into accusations that its government has been involved in an escalating number of violent crimes in Canada. In a statement, the British Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office said India's cooperation with Canada’s legal process 'is the right next step.' A U.S. State Department spokesman told a news conference Tuesday that the U.S. had long been asking India to cooperate with Canadian authorities.	https://apnews.com/article/canada-india-diplomats-violence-80e9a0d43faa7db99781563434d0f1e0	2024-10-16T10:35:35-07:00	
Long-ruling party leads in Mozambique's election as opposition candidate calls for strikes	MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) — Mozambique's ruling party candidate held a clear lead in early presidential election results Wednesday as his main challenger said he would not accept them and called them fraudulent. Daniel Chapo of the ruling Front for the Liberation of Mozambique, or Frelimo, is on course to win the vote, according to the provincial results, and succeed President Filipe Nyusi, who has served a maximum two terms. Frelimo has been in power in the southern African nation since independence from Portugal in 1975. Opposition candidate Venancio Mondlane, who is running as an independent, was second behind Chapo in the early count but repeated his claims that last week's election was marred by fraud and manipulation by Frelimo. Mondlane has also called on Mozambicans to hold a national strike on Monday in protest at what he called the 'deceit of the most shameful level of the regime.' Frelimo has often been accused of election rigging, which it denies. Many analysts raised concerns ahead of this election, saying Frelimo manipulates voter lists and traditionally has officials loyal to it working at polling stations. Mondlane and his supporters held a march in the northern city of Nampula on Wednesday, which was broken up by police. Police said Mondlane did not keep to an agreed route for the march and also accused him of encouraging his supporters to confront officers. Four people were arrested, police said. Frelimo has won every national election in Mozambique since the country's first in 1994. Frelimo came to power at independence but then fought a bloody 15-year civil war against rebel group Renamo, which later became the main opposition party and also contested this election. Mondlane was a member of the Renamo party before breaking away months before the election and standing as an independent. ___ AP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa	https://apnews.com/article/mozambique-election-frelimo-vote-6987692541d92a9c6a287be4af89a524	2024-10-16T10:30:58-07:00	
Italy expands its ban on surrogacy to overseas as critics say it targets same-sex couples	ROME (AP) — Italy on Wednesday criminalized citizens who go abroad to have children through surrogacy, a measure slammed by opponents as 'medieval' and discriminatory to same-sex couples. The measure extending a surrogacy ban in place since 2004 was promoted by Premier Giorgia Meloni's far-right Brothers of Italy party and its conservative coalition partner, the League, asserting that it protects women’s dignity. The Senate after a seven-hour debate passed the bill 84-58, the final step in the process after the Lower House's approval last year. Italians seeking surrogacy in countries such as the United States or Canada, where the practice is legal, can face up to two years in jail and up to 1 million euros ($1.1 million) in fines. The surrogacy ban applies equally to all couples. But same-sex parent advocates say it hits gay families particularly hard in a country struggling with record-low birthrates and where only heterosexual couples are allowed to adopt. Same-sex marriages are also banned in Italy, and LGBTQ+ couples have been fighting to obtain parental rights for the partner who is not the biological parent. Several lawmakers and LGBTQ+ activists protested in front of the Senate to oppose the law, some holding banners that read: 'Parents, not criminals.' 'When protectionism prevails, a social phenomenon is not erased,' opposition lawmaker Riccardo Magi said during the protest. 'It is simply relegated to a dark area, which the law doesn't reach. In that case, it’s easier for exploitation, abuse and rights violations to prevail.' 'We are very saddened because Italy has once again missed an opportunity to demonstrate that it is a country in line with what Europe and the world are,' said Cristiano Giraldi, the father of two 10-year-old children born from a surrogate mother in the U.S. The Catholic Church has strongly opposed surrogacy in Italy and abroad, with Pope Francis calling for a universal ban and criticizing what he called the 'commercialization' of pregnancy. At the same time, the Vatican’s doctrine office has made clear that same-sex parents who resort to surrogacy can have their children baptized. While commercial surrogacy contracts are common in the U.S. — including protections for mothers, guarantees of independent legal representation and medical coverage — they are banned in parts of Europe including Spain and Italy.	https://apnews.com/article/italy-surrogacy-pregnancy-overseas-ban-lgbtq-3f1181480a71a01166b38540e7c25103	2024-10-16T10:08:22-07:00	
A German in charge of England? Nationality matters less than it used to in international soccer	The question was inevitable. At his first news conference as England’s newly appointed head coach, Thomas Tuchel – a German – was asked on Wednesday what message he had for fans who would have preferred an Englishman in charge of their beloved national team. 'I’m sorry, I just have a German passport,' he said, laughing, and went on to profess his love for English football and the country itself. 'I will do everything to show respect to this role and to this country.' The soccer rivalry between England and Germany runs deep and it’s likely Tuchel’s passport will be used against him if he doesn’t deliver results for a nation that hasn’t lifted a men’s trophy since 1966. But his appointment as England’s third foreign coach shows that, increasingly, even the top countries in the sport are abandoning the long-held belief that the national team must be led by one of their own. Four of the top nine teams in the FIFA world rankings now have foreign coaches. Even in Germany, a four-time World Cup winner which has never had a foreign coach, candidates such as Dutchman Louis van Gaal and Austrian Oliver Glasner were considered serious contenders for the top job before the country’s soccer federation last year settled on Julian Nagelsmann, who is German. 'The coaching methods are universal and there for everyone to apply,' said German soccer researcher and author Christoph Wagner, whose recent book 'Crossing the Line?' historically addresses Anglo-German rivalry. 'It’s more the personality that counts and not the nationality. You could be a great coach, and work with a group of players who aren’t perceptive enough to get your methods.' Not everyone agrees. English soccer author and journalist Jonathan Wilson said it was 'an admission of failure' for a major soccer nation to have a coach from a different country. 'Personally, I think it should be the best of one country versus the best of another country, and that would probably extend to coaches as well as players,' said Wilson, whose books include 'Inverting The Pyramid: The History of Football Tactics.' 'To say we can’t find anyone in our country who is good enough to coach our players,' he said, 'I think there is something slightly embarrassing, slightly distasteful about that.' That sentiment was echoed by British tabloid The Daily Mail, which reported on Tuchel’s appointment with the provocative headline 'A Dark Day for England.' While foreign coaches are often found in smaller countries and those further down the world rankings, they are still a rarity among the traditional powers of the game. Italy, another four-time world champion, has only had Italians in charge. All of Spain’s coaches in its modern-day history have been Spanish nationals. Five-time World Cup winner Brazil has had only Brazilians in charge since 1965, and two-time world champion France only Frenchmen since 1975. And it remains the case that every World Cup-winning team, since the first tournament in 1930, has been coached by a native of that country. The situation is similar for the women’s World Cup, which has never been won by a team with a foreign coach, though Jill Ellis, who led the U.S. to two trophies, is a naturalized U.S. citizen born in England. Some coaches have made a career out of jumping from one national team to the next. Lars Lagerbäck, 76, coached his native Sweden between 2000-09 and went on to lead the national teams of Nigeria, Iceland and Norway. 'I couldn’t say I felt any big difference,' Lagerbäck told The Associated Press. 'I felt they were my teams and the people’s teams.' For Lagerbäck, the obvious disadvantages of coaching a foreign country were any language difficulties and having to adapt to a new culture, which he particularly felt during his brief time with Nigeria in 2010 when he led the African country at the World Cup. Otherwise, he said, 'it depends on the results' — and Lagerbäck is remembered with fondness in Iceland, especially, after leading the country to Euro 2016 for its first ever international tournament, where it knocked out England in the round of 16. Lagerbäck pointed to the strong education and sheer number of coaches available in soccer powers like Spain and Italy to explain why they haven’t needed to turn to an overseas coach. At this year’s European Championship, five of the coaches were from Italy and the winning coach was Luis de la Fuente, who was promoted to Spain’s senior team after being in charge of the youth teams. Portugal for the first time looked outside its own borders or Brazil, with which it has historical ties, when it appointed Spaniard Roberto Martinez as national team coach last year. Also last year, Brazil tried — and ultimately failed — to court Real Madrid’s Italian coach Carlo Ancelotti, with Brazilian soccer federation president Ednaldo Rodrigues saying: 'It doesn’t matter if it’s a foreigner or a Brazilian, there’s no prejudice about the nationality.' The United States has had a long list of foreign coaches before Mauricio Pochettino, the Argentine former Chelsea manager who took over as the men’s head coach this year. The English Football Association certainly had no qualms making Tuchel the national team’s third foreign-born coach, after Swede Sven-Goran Eriksson (2001-06) and Italian Fabio Capello (2008-12), simply believing he was the best available coach on the market. Unlike Eriksson and Capello, Tuchel at least had previous experience of working in English soccer — he won the Champions League in an 18-month spell with Chelsea — and he also speaks better English. That won’t satisfy all the nay-sayers, though. 'Hopefully I can convince them and show them and prove to them that I’m proud to be the English manager,' Tuchel said. ___ AP Sports Writer Jerome Pugmire in Paris contributed to this story. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer	https://apnews.com/article/tuchel-foreign-coaches-445022a9a692846545bb3ccdae6a9b93	2024-10-16T10:04:30-07:00	
A Palestinian student was asleep in his tent at a hospital when an Israeli strike brought an inferno	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Shaban al-Dalu was sleeping in his tent in a central Gaza hospital's courtyard, still recuperating from wounds from an Israeli strike on a mosque a week earlier, when a new strike hit, setting off an inferno. The 19-year-old university student and his 38-year-old mother, Alaa al-Dalu, were among five people killed as the blaze ripped through a tent camp sheltering hundreds of Palestinian families in the courtyard of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the central city of Deir al-Balah. Dozens of others, including children, were severely burned. Al-Dalu and his mother were sleeping in the tent along with his father and three siblings when the strike hit at around 1:30 a.m. on Monday. Mohammed al-Dalu, his fifth sibling, was sleeping nearby at his vendor's table when the explosion jolted him awake. He found his father and uncle, who lived in a neighboring tent, struggling to pull their families out of the fire The father, Ahmed al-Dalu, said he managed to rescue two of his sons and his daughter, but not his wife or eldest child, Shaban. 'My son was being burned in front of me,' he said, speaking at the hospital with burns on his face. 'I accepted the will of God in every sense of the word.' The Israeli military said it targeted militants hiding out among the displaced, without providing evidence to support its claim. It was the 7th Israeli attack on this hospital compound since March; three of them occurred in September, according to Doctors without Borders, which supports the hospital. The war began when Hamas attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 hostages. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which says women and children make up more than half the fatalities. It has displaced more than 1.9 million of Gaza's 2.3 million people. Over the course of the war, the military has repeatedly raided hospitals and struck crowded shelters and tent camps, alleging that Hamas fighters were using them as staging grounds for attacks, without showing evidence. Monday's strike brought chaos at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, as firefighters and displaced people attempted for hours to put out the blaze, using small fire extinguishers and buckets of water. Several secondary explosions went off, but their cause was not known. The courtyard was left covered in burned-out wreckage of shed and tents, made of wood and plastic sheets, with people's belongings inside. 'It’s a scene of devastation. Tents caught on fire while people were sleeping,' said Eliza Sabatini, a nurse with Doctors Without Borders who was working at the hospital. More than 60 people, including 10 children and 8 women, were wounded, most suffering severe burns. One man sobbed as he carried a toddler with a bandaged head in his arms. Another small child with a bandaged leg was given a blood transfusion on the floor of the packed Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza, where many wounded were rushed. Shaban al-Dalu, who would have turned 20 on Wednesday, memorized the Quran when he was young and cared for his siblings. A university student studying computer science, he would post videos on social media telling people his family’s displacement stories and his dream of leaving Gaza. In a video posted in March, filmed from their tent in the hospital's courtyard, he said his family fled their home in Gaza City's Rimal neighborhood just after the war began in October last year. Since then, he said, they had moved five times to escape fighting. 'We live in a very hard circumstance,' he said in the video. He launched an online fundraiser hoping to make enough money to get his family to Egypt. By Wednesday, it had raised more than $24,200 — though no one has been been able to leave Gaza since Israeli troops seized the crossing with Egypt in May. 'I used to have big dreams, but the war has ruined them,' he wrote on his GoFundMe page. 'Time feels like it’s stopped in Gaza, and we’re stuck in a never-ending nightmare.' On Oct. 6, he was reciting the Quran in a mosque near the hospital when an Israeli airstrike hit the place of worship, his brother Mohammed said. Shaban suffered a head wound that required 11 stitches and was still recuperating in the tent when Monday's strike hit. Shaban's father and the three siblings in the tent have all been left severely burned, some up to 70% of their body, Mohammed said. The body of his 11-year-old brother Adbel-Rahman is completely covered in bandages, and his sister's back and the left side of her face were badly burned, he said. Shaban's uncle, Abdel-Hayy al-Dalu, recalled how the families had thought they were safe when they arrived at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. 'We built tents - me and my brother - and sheltered here,' he said. 'We ruled out that it will be bombed since it’s a hospital.' After rescuing his wife and two daughters, Abdel-Hayy rushed to his brother’s tent, hoping to save his nephew and sister-in-law. 'We couldn’t help them,' he said. 'We were helpless.'	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-gaza-860f97a1fdab484aaec3a2a66ad39b5e	2024-10-16T09:45:04-07:00	
NATO shows no sign of letting Ukraine join soon and wants more details about its 'victory plan'	BRUSSELS (AP) — NATO showed no sign Wednesday it would invite Ukraine to join anytime soon as allies sought more information from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy about his 'victory plan' for ending the war with Russia. The plan centers on a request for NATO to move forward on the 'accelerated' membership application that Zelenskyy made two years ago to seek protection under the military alliance's security umbrella after Russia launched its full-scale invasion. NATO’s credibility is based on its collective security guarantee, Article 5 of its founding treaty. It’s a commitment by all 32 member countries to come to the aid of any member whose sovereignty or territory might be under attack. However, it does not apply to a partner country like Ukraine. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte declined to welcome the 'victory plan,' saying only that he and the allies 'take note' of it. He did not discuss when Ukraine might join the world’s biggest military alliance, beyond insisting that it would become a member. 'The plan has many aspects and many political and military issues we really need to hammer out with the Ukrainians to understand what is behind it, to see what we can do, what we cannot do,' Rutte said in his muted response at NATO headquarters in Brussels. 'We are in close contact with allies, with Ukraine, to see how we can take next steps,' he added. He declined to provide details about what more NATO wants to know, telling reporters only: 'I cannot give you all the insights about that.' For now, Rutte said, the focus must be on helping Ukraine to win back more territory and strengthen its hand for any future peace negotiations. Zelenskyy is due to explain elements of his plan on Thursday to leaders of the European Union, most of whom also stand among NATO's ranks. It all comes at a dark time for Ukraine. Its troops are struggling to hold off better manned and equipped Russian forces, especially in the eastern Donetsk region where they are gradually being pushed back. Kyiv is surviving with Western help, but Ukraine says it is coming too slowly. While outlining his plan on Wednesday, Zelenskyy told Ukrainian lawmakers that granting the country a NATO invitation would be a 'testament of (allies’) determination' to support its efforts. 'An invitation is a strong decision that requires nothing but determination,' he said. Ukraine’s future in NATO is something the alliance has weighed for 16 years. At their summit in Washington in July, the 32 members declared Ukraine on an 'irreversible' path to membership. To the uninitiated, however, little seems to have progressed since NATO leaders promised Ukraine and Georgia in 2008 that 'these countries will become members of NATO' one day. For now, NATO is in a holding pattern. Its biggest and most powerful member, the United States, is facing a presidential election. European allies expect little movement on Ukraine until a new president takes office in January. Beyond that, the United States and European heavyweight Germany remain deeply concerned about being dragged into a wider war with nuclear-armed Russia, and they lead a group of countries that oppose allowing Ukraine to join NATO until the conflict ends. In any case, NATO diplomats said, Ukraine’s borders would need to be clearly demarcated before it could join so that there can be no mistaking where the Article 5 guarantee would come into effect. Russian troops have seized about 20% of the country.	https://apnews.com/article/nato-ukraine-membership-russia-7a27716d4838edf2c0ff6d97df50478d	2024-10-16T08:41:05-07:00	
Europe's Airbus to lay off 2,500 as it tries to turn around its space and defense division	European aircraft maker and Boeing rival Airbus said Wednesday that it was laying off 2,500 workers as it tries to turnaround its struggling defense and space division. Airbus said it would implement other organizational changes as it faces ongoing challenges in the defense and space sector, including disrupted supply chains, the rapid evolution of warfare tactics and increasing costs. The announcement comes after the company had already begun making organizational changes in the division last year, which it said have begun 'bearing fruit.' 'We want to shape the division so it can act as a leading and competitive player in this ever-evolving market,' said Mike Schoellhorn, the CEO of Airbus's defense and space division. 'This requires us to become faster, leaner and more competitive.' The company's defense and space business struggled last year, notably taking a 477 million euro ($511 million) loss on the long-troubled A400M military transport plane, in part linked to unusually high inflation. The European space sector also was hit by the loss of access to Russia’s Soyuz rocket launchers and the failure of a new Vega-C rocket soon after takeoff from French Guiana in late 2022. Outside of that division, business has been booming for the aerospace giant. Airbus has outpaced Boeing for five straight years in plane orders and deliveries and its profits have soared. The bigger problem for Airbus has been keeping up with demand for commercial airplanes. As of June, the French manufacturer had an order backlog of 8,585 commercial aircraft. Meanwhile, Boeing can't seem to right its ship. At the beginning of the year, Boeing seemed finally to be recovering from two crashes of Max jets in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people in Indonesia and Ethiopia. Then, on Jan. 5, a door plug blew out of an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9, and the Virginia company has been reeling ever since. Boeing has since slowed manufacturing at the order of the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. It lost $355 million in the first quarter because of a decline in aircraft deliveries and compensation it paid to airlines for a temporary grounding of Max 9s. The Max was Boeing’s answer to Airbus’ A320 family of planes. Airbus employs more than 150,000 people worldwide, according to FactSet.	https://apnews.com/article/airbus-layoffs-defense-space-boeing-0f2090d5bdde75c4e85e7d48f55e5b31	2024-10-16T08:19:15-07:00	
Biden to travel to Germany this week, Angola in December for visits delayed by Hurricane Milton	WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden is heading to Germany Thursday and will visit Angola the first week in December, rescheduling visits that were postponed so he could remain in Washington to monitor the federal response to Hurricane Milton as it struck Florida. The White House confirmed Biden will depart for his quick trip to Berlin on Thursday. It will offer him the opportunity to huddle with his key ally, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, about their countries' support for Ukraine in its war with Russia as the conflict is at another critical moment. Biden's initial itinerary for the postponed trip included a meeting on the war in Ukraine with allied nations at an American military base in Germany before he was to continue on to Angola. The White House says that the gathering of representatives of the allied nations, partners in the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, will instead take place virtually next month. Still, the war in Ukraine will loom large during Biden's time in Berlin this week. Biden spoke by phone Wednesday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, but they will not meet while the president is in Germany. The two leaders discussed Zelenskyy's 'victory plan,' shortly after the Ukrainian leader presented it to his parliament . Zelenskyy is scheduled to present the five-point plan to the European Council on Thursday. Zelenskyy had previously spoken to Biden about the proposal. The plan includes an invitation for Ukraine to join NATO and permission to use Western-supplied longer-range missiles to strike military targets deep inside Russian territory — steps that have been met with reluctance by Kyiv’s allies so far. The White House on Wednesday declined to comment about the plan. 'We’re going to let the Ukrainians speak to their victory plan,' White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters. 'What we’re going to continue to do is show our support for the Ukrainians on the battlefield as they continue to beat back Russia.' Zelenskyy said in a statement following the call he also spoke to Biden about the U.S. and Ukraine potentially exploring ways to produce weapons together. The Biden administration also announced a further $425 million in military assistance to Ukraine, bringing its total to more than $64 billion in the two and a half years since Russia’s invasion. Wednesday’s package includes surface-to-air missiles to protect Ukrainian infrastructure from Russian attacks and long range rockets and artillery to help its war effort. Biden and Scholz recently spoke by phone to discuss the need for the countries to 'continue our strong collaboration on geopolitical priorities, including supporting Ukraine’s defense against Russian aggression,' according to the White House. Jean-Pierre said the trip was important to Biden, in part because of Germany's help with a complicated hostage swap with Russia. 'The president really wanted to make sure to go to Germany to thank Chancellor Scholz directly,' she said. Scholz in a speech before the German parliament on Wednesday said he was looking forward to Biden's visit. 'I would like to say that … President Biden stands for an incredible improvement in cooperation over recent years,' said Scholz, adding that he was grateful for the 'good collaboration' forged with the Democratic president. There's a significant measure of anxiety in Europe about what next month's U.S. presidential election could mean for Ukraine. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, has been in lockstep with Biden about the need to maintain robust economic and military support for Ukraine. Republican Donald Trump has said he would move to quickly to end the war the war with Russia should he regain the White House. Trump's running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, has said that the plan would include establishing a 'demilitarized zone' and that Ukraine would not reclaim territory that Russia occupies and would agree not to join NATO. Scholz has been one of Biden's closest global allies. In addition to his robust support for Ukraine, Scholz played a critical role in helping free Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, corporate security executive Paul Whelan, and others from Russian prisons in a multinational prisoner swap. As part of the biggest prisoner exchange in post-Soviet history, Scholz agreed to release Vadim Krasikov, a Russian who was convicted of the 2019 murder of a 40-year-old Georgian citizen who had fought Russian troops in Chechnya and later claimed asylum in Germany. Biden has not visited Africa since taking office in early 2021. Jean-Pierre said the coming visit to Luanda aims to 'recognize Angola’s role as a strategic partner and regional leader, and discuss increased collaboration on security, health, and economic partnerships.' ___ AP writers Geir Moulson in Berlin and Colleen Long in Washington contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/biden-germany-scholz-ukraine-angola-hurricane-milton-122b839208dce251e530b4e3d5156396	2024-10-16T07:42:24-07:00	
Cate Blanchett wants you to laugh at politics in ‘Rumours’	NEW YORK (AP) — You’d be hard pressed to find an upcoming film weirder than 'Rumours.' The biting commentary on the emptiness of political statements and the performances politicians put on starts off as a straight political satire focusing on the G7 world leaders, but then slips into a world of slow-yet-terrifying zombies; a mysterious, giant brain found in the middle of a forest with unexplained origins; and an AI chatbot bent on sexual entrapment. It goes from provocative to absurd within a few short scenes, with the G7 leaders no longer the subject of criticism, but the butt of the joke. And that’s kind of the whole point, according to its star and executive producer, Cate Blanchett. 'We’re all in such a state of heightened anxiety and fear with what’s going on with climate, what’s going on with the global political situation. We feel like we’re on the precipice of a world war and there’s a lot of people in positions of power who seem to be relishing that moment,' Blanchett told The Associated Press. She plays a fictional chancellor of Germany named Hilda Orlmann, the host of the conference who's more focused on optics than action. 'I think the audience will come to it with a need for some kind of catharsis. And because the film is ridiculous and terrifying ... I think they’ll be able to laugh at the absurdity of the situation we found ourselves in. I think it’s a very generous film in that way,' she said. The three directors, Guy Maddin and brothers Evan and Galen Johnson, said they wanted the film to feel like it had a 'generic wash of political disrespect' and to include some resonant critiques, but they didn’t want viewers to feel like they were leaving a lecture hall as they walked out of the theater. 'I’m preachy enough when I talk to people. I don’t want to make a movie that’s preachy, you know? I just favor movies that aren’t that. That just hit me with a little mystery of ... ‘What are you doing or seeing? What am I experiencing?’' Evan Johnson, who wrote the script, as well as co-directed, said. As for the more absurd plotlines, Maddin said he and his collaborators share 'a compulsion to come up with an original recipe.' And original it certainly is. In its straightforward opening act, leaders from the Group of 7 meet for their annual summit and try to draft a provisional statement for an unnamed crisis. Then, as the evening goes on and they struggle to string together a couple, meaningful sentences, they find themselves abandoned and subject to attack from 'bog people,' or well-preserved mummified bodies from thousands of years ago. Hijinks — and hilarity — ensue from there. Nikki Amuka-Bird, who plays the fictionalized British Prime Minister Cardosa Dewindt, said that while reading the script, she kept asking herself, 'What’s happening?' But the ridiculous plotline — including the apocalyptic invasion of zombie-like 'bog people' — was only part of the reason why she took on the project. 'This kind of total courage to genre splice in this way takes away any kind of apprehension or fear you might have about it because their (the directors’) tongues are firmly in their cheeks the whole time,' Amuka-Bird said. 'It’s a really imaginative exercise and it’s just fantastic to work with directors who can be that bold and take chances like that.' The cast is rounded out by a starry ensemble: Roy Dupuis is a melodramatic Canadian prime minister, Charles Dance is an American president with an inexplicable British accent, Denis Ménochet is a paranoid French president and Alicia Vikander makes an appearance as a frenetic leader from the European Commission. The title of the movie, Blanchett said, is meant to invoke the revered Fleetwood Mac album of the same name, which was made at a time when the bandmembers were reportedly 'all sleeping together and bickering and breaking up,' she said. 'What was surprising about it is you think, ‘OK, this is a film about the G7,’ but it’s like a sort of a daytime soap opera with these sort of trysts and liaisons and petty squabbles,' Blanchett said. 'It was such an unusual way to look at the mess we’re all in and the leadership that’s led us here.'	https://apnews.com/article/cate-blanchett-rumours-movie-politics-satire-guy-b87817592defdf14a839ef0a4e9c7f81	2024-10-16T07:11:23-07:00	
Q&A: Diego Luna and Gael García Bernal's 'La Máquina' explores masculinity and aging in boxing story	WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. (AP) — Separately, Diego Luna and Gael García Bernal are highly regarded actors. Together, they are a force to be reckoned with since starring in Alfonso Cuarón’s 2001 cult classic 'Y tu mamá también.' They have embarked on another on-screen project, co-starring in Hulu’s first Spanish-language production, 'La Máquina,' now streaming. That's 12 years after working together on the 2012 film 'Casa de Mi Padre.' 'Working with Gael is that. It’s returning to the familiar, to what has always been there,' Luna said at the series’ Los Angeles premiere. 'We’ve continued this connection and maintained it very easily.' 'La Máquina' tells the story of an aging boxer (García Bernal) whose manager and close friend (Luna) secures him one last chance at a comeback. Their final shot at victory is challenged when mysterious forces threaten the fight and life itself. The show is produced by Searchlight Television, along with Luna and García Bernal's production company El Corriente de Golfo. On set, showrunner Marco Ramirez says the synergy between Luna and García Bernal had him replacing scripted lines for the duo’s playful banter. 'They were kind of born to work together and born to riff with each other,' Ramirez said. 'I would be like, ‘This scene is fine. The writing is okay, but what they’re doing is so much better.'' Luna and García Bernal spoke with The Associated Press about how the series deals with aging and body image, as well as the role activism plays in their lives as actors and producers. The interview has been edited for clarity and brevity. AP: Your characters explore the themes of body image and aging from different points of view. Why was it important for you to share your character's perspective, and more broadly, a male perspective? LUNA: There is this monster we have to fight which is a pressure of like, ‘How do we look?’ We are on screens all the time and and we are televised 24/7. These two characters are struggling to let go and move into the next stage. It’s fascinating to create a parallel — and at the same time, make characters so different. This man, Andy, the guy that I portray, he's a guy who wishes to be seen, but he’s looking in the wrong places. It has to start from the inside, but he’s just looking at the outside — which is a metaphor for the world we’re living in, which stays on the surface so much. We’re so afraid of digging further or of going deeper. GARCÍA BERNAL: In regards to Esteban, the concept of aging comes for men in sports, particularly in boxing, in these contact sports. For women it's beauty and for men it's sports, where it kind of manifests in a very natural way. It’s incredible that at that point in your life — the athlete is finally enjoying what they're doing. You're finally starting to have fun — but that’s when the body is just not responding. It is a quite incredible process; you have your whole life in front of you but you have to step away from what you loved. You have to say goodbye — to success as well, which is really complicated. And sports is very, very cruel in that sense. AP: How do you combat that as an actor? In Hollywood, you’re in front of the camera all the time. How do you keep yourself from taking on the mindsets these characters have about aging? LUNA: We are in a very luxurious position, where what we do gets better and better with time. The characters that I can do now are the ones that I’ve been wanting to do for a long time. Just as life gets more complex, as maturity comes, your characters become more complex and interesting. There are some things I can do now that I'm a father. There's just some relations I understand much better now that I went through a long relation with my father. I lost him. Now, I have a lot to say there. The line between the professional and the personal is blurry in this journey we have — as actors or as storytellers. GARCÍA BERNAL: It is a privilege to be able to sublimate that as actors. Also, we had the fortune of growing up in very loving environments where we're not forced to think about (the negative aspects of aging). We're really far away from those concepts, but they might affect us in other ways. But there’s that moment that as friends, Diego and I have confessed to each other as friends like, ‘Man, I don’t play fútbol anymore. Why? Because I get hurt. And I cannot work if I'm—' It's a bit sad but it happens to everybody. LUNA: Now, I have to stretch in the mornings. AP: You chose to explore the dangers that journalists face in Mexico through Eiza González's character. What made you want to focus on this narrative approach? LUNA: To me, Eiza’s role is really important because it’s crucial — media plays a very important role in sports. It’s not a story about boxing, you know, but about what boxing generates in a community. Are we telling the story from the right angle? Are we really paying respect to those who dedicate their lives to sports? Inevitably, we talk about the country, and Mexico is an important subject of this TV series. What journalists are facing in Mexico is happening today and therefore it's a part of everything. AP: There's synergy to your working dynamic as producers. How do you use the platform you both have built to focus on injustices that are happening? GARCÍA BERNAL: It’s a natural part of our unspoken sort of deal with each other. It was in everything from the beginning. We were both interested in our environment, in what’s happening. And we found, in the cinema, a great way to express ourselves with complete and absolute freedom. And so we purposely always search for films that actually shed a light on all the gray areas that exist — to understand things a little bit more. LUNA: We’re part of the audience and as part of the audience, we are searching for that opportunity. The approach we have is to always be aware of that beautiful thing that happens in cinema when you find someone else’s story, when you give yourself the time, when you have the curiosity to listen and to get affected. AP: Diego, you go through a huge physical transformation with the prosthetics. What was an element for you, that last piece that helped you get fully into character as Andy? LUNA: It was the butt. Definitely. GARCÍA BERNAL: (laughs) LUNA: I was like, putting too many things (prosthetics) on the face, and suddenly the butt came in. I was like, ‘Oh, no, let’s get rid of this and this.’ We went too far and then pulled back a bit. If you see the real references we had, we basically stopped half way. It was an interesting process, an exciting one, a scary one also because, it took time to actually see it working. It wasn’t until I got a reaction from Gael and the rest that I was like, ‘Okay, I think we got it. This is working.’	https://apnews.com/article/la-maquina-gael-garcia-bernal-diego-luna-2eec1bcb2110bf20a7b76b326021079d	2024-10-16T06:44:55-07:00	
Amazon, Google make dueling nuclear investments to power data centers with clean energy	Amazon on Wednesday said that it was investing in small nuclear reactors, coming just two days after a similar announcement by Google, as both tech giants seek new sources of carbon-free electricity to meet surging demand from data centers and artificial intelligence. The plans come as the owner of the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear power plant said last month it plans to restart the reactor so tech giant Microsoft can buy the power to supply its data centers. All three companies have been investing in solar and wind technologies, which make electricity without producing greenhouse gas emissions. Now they say they need to go further in the search for clean electricity to meet both demand and their own commitments to cut emissions. Nuclear energy is a climate solution in that its reactors don’t emit the planet-warming greenhouse gases that come from power plants that burn fossil fuels, such as oil, coal and gas. The demand for power is surging globally as buildings and vehicles electrify. People used more electricity than ever last year, placing strain on electric grids around the world. Much of the demand also comes from data centers and artificial intelligence. The International Energy Agency forecasts that data centers’ total electricity consumption could reach more than 1,000 terawatt hours in 2026, more than doubling from 2022. Estimates suggest one terawatt hour can power 70,000 homes for a year. 'AI is driving a significant increase in the amount of data centers and power that are required on the grid,' Kevin Miller, Amazon Web Services’ vice president of global data centers, told The Associated Press, adding: 'We view advanced new nuclear capacity as really key and essential.' The United States is pursuing small modular reactors, a type of nuclear reactor that can generate up to roughly one-third the amount of power of a traditional reactor. Developers say small reactors will be built faster and at a lower cost than large power reactors, scaling to fit needs of a particular location. They aim to start spinning up electricity in the early 2030s, if the Nuclear Regulatory Commission gives permission to build and operate their designs and the technology succeeds. If new, clean power isn’t added as data centers are developed, the U.S. runs the risk of 'browning the grid,' or including more power that isn't made from clean sources, said Kathryn Huff, a former U.S. assistant secretary for nuclear energy who is now an associate professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. The reactors are currently under development, with none currently providing power to the electric grid in the U.S. Big investors can help change that, and these announcements could be the 'inflection point' that makes scaling up this technology truly possible, Huff said. Jacopo Buongiorno, professor of nuclear science and engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, echoed that, saying the industry needs customers who value the reliability and carbon-free attributes of nuclear and are willing to pay a premium for it at first, until a number of the next-generation reactors are deployed and the cost comes down. On Monday, Google said it was signing a contract to purchase nuclear energy from multiple small modular reactors that Kairos Power, a nuclear technology company, plans to develop. The news highlights 'the technologies that we’re going to need to achieve round the clock clean energy, not only for Google but for the world,' Michael Terrell, Google's senior director of energy and climate, told the AP. With Kairos, Google said it expects to bring the first small modular reactor online by 2030, with more to come through 2035. The deal is projected to bring 500 megawatts of power to the grid. For context, Google consumed more than 24 terawatt hours of electricity last year, according to the company's annual environmental report. One terawatt is equal to 1,000,000 megawatts. Meanwhile, Amazon's announcements Wednesday included working with utility Dominion Energy to explore putting a small modular reactor near its existing North Anna nuclear power station in Virginia. It's investing in reactor developer X-energy for its early development work, and collaborating with regional utility Energy Northwest in central Washington to put four of the X-energy reactors there. Combined, the three announcements could account for more than 5,000 megawatts of power by the late 2030s with the possibility of more. All of that is still likely only a small fraction of the company’s total energy consumption, a figure that Amazon does not report publicly. New reactor designs pair well with industrial applications because they can be built on a small footprint and generate reliable power, with some able to provide high-temperature heat too, at the site, said Doug True, chief nuclear officer at the industry trade association, Nuclear Energy Institute. 'It seems like a really good fit to support those facilities, and for a lot of different applications depending upon the amount of power that’s needed by the customer,' he said. Both Amazon and Google have committed to using renewable energy to address climate change. By 2030, Google has pledged to meet net-zero emissions, and run carbon-free energy every hour of every day on every grid where it operates. It says it has already matched 100% of its global electricity consumption with renewable energy purchases on an annual basis. However, the company has fallen short on decreasing its emissions. Amazon has said it would match all of its global electricity consumption with 100% renewable energy by 2030, and recently announced it met that goal early in 2023. Though the company has matched its consumption as far as purchases of an equivalent amount of renewable energy, that does not necessarily mean it is using that to power its operations. Amazon saw its electricity emissions drop 11%, but direct emissions — known as Scope 1 — increased 7%, according to its 2023 sustainability report. The company is also targeting net zero-carbon by 2040. ___ Read more of AP’s climate coverage at http://www.apnews.com/climate-and-environment ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

US official warns of growing North Korean military support for Russia's war	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell said Wednesday that Washington and its allies are 'alarmed' by North Korea’s nuclear and missile threats as well as its increasing military support for Russia's war in Ukraine, but said he couldn’t confirm Ukrainian claims that Pyongyang was also sending soldiers to fight for Moscow. Campbell spoke with reporters following discussions with South Korean and Japanese counterparts on reinvigorating an international pressure campaign against North Korea, which faltered in recent years amid a deepening divide at the U.N. Security Council. Earlier on Wednesday, Washington, Seoul and Tokyo announced plans with eight Western governments to launch a new multinational team to monitor the enforcement of sanctions against North Korea. Russia in March vetoed a U.N. resolution in a move that effectively abolished monitoring by U.N. experts of Security Council sanctions against North Korea, which prompted Western accusations that Moscow was acting to shield its arms purchases from Pyongyang to fuel its war in Ukraine. Campbell said there are signs that North Korea was increasing its support of materials, including artillery and missiles, to support Russia’s war on Ukraine, which he said was 'creating further instability in Europe.' He said the U.S. was still evaluating reports that North Korea was also sending personnel. 'We are concerned by them and ... we agreed that we will continue to monitor the situation closely,' Campbell said about the claims. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has claimed that North Korea is sending military personnel to help Russia’s war effort without providing details. Ukrainian media reported earlier this month that six North Koreans were among those killed after a Ukrainian missile strike on Oct. 3. North Korea has also been making increasingly provocative threats against rival South Korea, including accusing the South of infiltrating drones to drop anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets over Pyongyang and threatening to attack the South if it happens again. North Korea also on Tuesday blew up the northern sections of unused road and rail routes that once linked it with South Korea, in a choreographed demolition aimed at demonstrating its growing anger with South Korea’s conservative government. Tensions on the Korean Peninsula have spiked since 2022 as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un used Russia’s war on Ukraine as a window to dial up his weapons testing activities and threats. Washington, Seoul and Tokyo have strengthened their combined military exercises in response and took steps to sharpen their nuclear deterrence strategies built around strategic U.S. assets. Following his talks with Campbell and Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Masataka Okano, South Korean Vice Foreign Minister Kim Hong Kyun said that the countries condemn the North’s 'intentional moves to create tensions.' 'We have agreed to maintain a solid South Korea-U.S. combined posture to respond firmly to North Korean provocations and strengthen security cooperation through close coordination between South Korea, the U.S., and Japan,' Kim said.	https://apnews.com/article/us-south-korea-north-korea-russia-ukraine-campbell-103e27e415d8253c05d60514a0dec41a	2024-10-16T02:57:42-07:00	
China's leader makes rare visit to province facing Taiwan following major war exercises	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — China’s President Xi Jinping made a rare visit to a province facing Taiwan following military exercises that mobilized China's navy, air force, missile force and land troops to simulate a blockade of the self-governing island democracy that Beijing claims as its own territory and threatens to annex by force. Xi did not comment on the military exercises during his visit to Fujian province, according to the official Xinhua News Agency, but his visit came on the heels of China’s dispatch of a record 125 aircraft, as well as its Liaoning aircraft carrier and ships, in large-scale military exercises surrounding Taiwan and its outlying islands Monday. Xi has largely avoided public appearances and foreign travel over the past year, but bringing Taiwan under Beijing's control remains a priority for his administration as head of the ruling Communist Party and its military, the People's Liberation Army. Taiwan’s newly elected president Lai Ching-te has been vociferously criticized by Beijing for rejecting its position that Tawian is a part of China. The drills came four days after Taiwan celebrated the founding of its government on its National Day, when Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te said in a speech that China has no right to represent Taiwan and declared his commitment to 'resist annexation or encroachment.' Taiwan was a Japanese colony before being unified with China at the end of World War II. It split away in 1949 when Chiang Kai-shek’s Nationalists fled to the island as Mao Zedong’s Communists defeated them in a civil war and took power.	https://apnews.com/article/taiwan-china-xi-jinping-visit-fujian-8957861a959469918991eaca8b773616	2024-10-16T02:20:08-07:00	
Italy approves tight budget partly funded by a levy on banks and insurers	ROME (AP) — Italy’s far-right government has approved a budget for next year of about 30 billion euros ($33 billion), which officials say will be partly funded by a levy on Italian banks and insurers. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said late Tuesday that the government expected to raise some 3.5 billion euros from banks and insurance companies to ensure better public services, especially the country's struggling health service, and help the most vulnerable citizens. 'As we promised, there will be no new taxes for citizens,' Meloni wrote in a post on X. The 2025 budget law was agreed by ministers at a cabinet meeting late Tuesday, just in time to meet a deadline to submit the plan to the European Union. The measures still need to be approved by the Italian parliament, with a final vote expected by the end of the year. Economy and Finance minister Giancarlo Giorgetti had been under intense pressure for weeks to reconcile the need to speed up Italy’s deficit reduction — closely watched by the EU — with the government’s expensive electoral promises. 'Someone would call it an extra profit (tax), I call it a sacrifice,' Giorgetti said at a press conference on Wednesday, commenting on the new levy on banks and insurers. Government officials didn’t release details on the new financial levy. But some Italian media reported it would focus on temporarily removing deductions for lenders’ so-called deferred tax assets and increasing taxes on bankers’ stock options. The minister revisited a prior plan by the right-wing government, which has repeatedly criticized banks for gaining excessively from higher interest rates. A first attempt to tap lenders with a 40% windfall tax failed last year, after the move sparked a major selloff in Italian banking stocks, forcing the government to withdraw the plan. Vice-Premier Antonio Tajani said in a post on X that the new contribution from banks will 'not frighten the markets.' Giorgetti said on Wednesday that additional resources will also come from a 'spending review' imposed on Italian ministries, which have been asked to tighten their belts and propose spending cuts. The 2025 budget also includes permanent cuts to income tax and social contributions for middle- and low-income earners, one of Meloni's main electoral pledges. To fund the new package of measures, Italy will widen next year’s deficit to 3.3% of gross domestic product from an estimated 2.9%. Rome is under pressure to keep its accounts under control, after having being placed under special monitoring by Brussels for running deficits far in excess of the EU’s 3% limit and for not reducing its mammoth debt, now close to 3 trillion euros.	https://apnews.com/article/italy-budget-banks-insurers-levy-deficit-eu-taxes-f1535a88005a70dc9d30b25cbea9ba39	2024-10-16T02:17:02-07:00	
Students are injured in clashes with Pakistani police over reports of an on-campus rape	LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) — More than two dozen college students were injured in clashes with Pakistani police over reports of an on-campus rape of a young woman, officials said Wednesday. The students were hurt on Monday and Tuesday in the eastern city of Lahore in Punjab province after reports about the alleged rape spread on social media. Students initially protested on the campus of the private college but later gathered outside the provincial assembly, where they clashed with police. The college administration denied there was an assault, as did the young woman's parents. Sexual violence against women is common in Pakistan but is underreported because of the stigma attached to it in the conservative country. Protests about sexual violence against women are uncommon. A special committee formed by the provincial government said the alleged victim said she slipped at her home on Oct. 2 and was taken to a hospital, where she was treated until Oct. 11. It said the student was absent from college from Oct. 3 to 15. The Federal Investigation Agency said it was looking into the case, including identifying people who spread the reports on social media. Punjab's chief minister, the province's most senior official, said no rape had taken place. Maryam Nawaz, who is the niece of the current prime minister and daughter of a former prime minister, asserted that a vile and dangerous plan was hatched to mislead students. 'An incident happened and a security guard was arrested and accused of being involved,' Nawaz told a press conference on Wednesday. The Sustainable Social Development Organization said last month that there were 7,010 rape cases reported in Pakistan in 2023, almost 95% of them in Punjab. 'However, due to social stigmas in Pakistan that discourage women from getting help, there is a high chance that due to underreporting the actual number of cases may be even higher,' it said. This week's protests came less than a month after a woman said she was gang-raped when on duty during a polio vaccination drive in southern Sindh province. Police arrested three men. Her husband threw her out of the house after the reported assault, saying she had tarnished the family name.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-students-protest-campus-rape-lahore-241177c92924df13174f7247b73ba79d	2024-10-16T01:17:09-07:00	
More than 100 killed and 50 injured after a gasoline tanker explodes in Nigeria	ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — More than 100 people were killed and 50 others injured in northwestern Nigeria as they tried to scoop up fuel from an overturned petrol tanker, causing the vehicle to explode in flames, the emergency services said Wednesday. The accident occurred at midnight in Jigawa state's Majiya town after the tanker driver lost control of the vehicle while traveling on a highway, local police spokesperson Lawan Adam said. Ninety-seven people were 'burned to ashes' at the scene while eight others died at the hospital, Dr. Haruna Mairiga, head of the Jigawa State Emergency Management Agency, told The Associated Press. Deadly tanker accidents are common in Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country, where traffic regulations are not strictly enforced in many places and there is a lack of alternatives such as an efficient railway system to transport cargo. It is also common for people to salvage fuel with cups and buckets to take home after such accidents. The practice has become more common amid Nigeria's soaring fuel prices, which have tripled since the start of last year as Nigeria ended costly gas subsidies. The driver involved in the latest accident had traveled about 110 kilometers (68 miles) from the neighboring Kano state, police said. Residents who heard about the accident rushed to the scene and were scooping up fuel, 'sparking a massive inferno,' police spokesman Lawan Adam said. Videos that appeared to be from the scene showed a massive fire stretching across the entire area, with what appeared to be bodies littered at the scene. Residents in Majiya town were in mourning on Wednesday morning as locals held a mass burial for the victims. Most of the bodies were unrecognizable, the emergency services said. 'If they knew (about the danger), they wouldn’t have gone to fetch (the fuel),' said Mairiga, head of the emergency services. He said emergency services only arrived at the scene several hours after the accident. 'But the incident had already happened ... those caught up (in the fire) were burned to ashes,' Mairiga said. In one of the videos, the person who recorded the clip appeared to try to mobilize others to help the victims. 'It’s burning the body!' he shouted. 'He will die ... when the vehicle explodes there will be a problem.' Resident Sani Umar told the local Channels Television how the fire 'spread so quickly that many couldn’t escape.' 'People were running in all directions, screaming for help,' Umar said. 'This is a heartbreaking moment for us all,' said state police commissioner Ahmadu Abdullahi.	https://apnews.com/article/nigeria-gasoline-tanker-explosion-7af046fdb8016e79d14744666013fbf2	2024-10-16T00:21:36-07:00	
UK inflation falls to lowest level in over 3 years, cementing expectations for another rate cut	LONDON (AP) — Inflation in the U.K. has fallen to its lowest level for more than three years, official figures showed Wednesday, a drop that has cemented market expectations that the Bank of England will lower interest rates at its next policy meeting. The Office for National Statistics said consumer prices rose 1.7% in September, down from 2.2% the previous month, largely as a result of lower air fares and petrol prices. The decline was bigger than the 1.9% analysts had anticipated, and means that inflation is below the central bank's target rate of 2% for the first time since 2021. As a result, the bank's rate-setting panel is expected to further reduce its main interest rate when it meets again in early November to 4.75% from 5%. It previously cut borrowing costs in August, the first reduction since the early days of the coronavirus pandemic in early 2020. 'A quarter-point rate cut in November is now effectively a done deal, and this report certainly makes the path to a consecutive cut in December much clearer,' said Luke Bartholomew, deputy chief economist at abrdn, formerly Aberdeen Asset Management. Central banks around the world dramatically increased borrowing costs from near zero during the coronavirus pandemic when prices started to shoot up, first as a result of supply chain issues built up and then because of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine which pushed up energy costs. As inflation rates have fallen from multi-decade highs recently, they have started cutting interest rates. The bank is widely expected to reduce borrowing costs again at its next meeting in November, especially as it will have details of the government’s budget on Oct. 30. The new Labour government has said that it needs to plug a 22 billion pound ($29 billion) hole in the public finances and has indicated that it may have to raise taxes and lower spending, which would likely weigh on the near-term outlook for the British economy and put downward pressure on inflation.	https://apnews.com/article/britain-economy-inflation-interest-rates-b1151fecc47f2ac4747dc07ba3504987	2024-10-15T21:42:16-07:00	
First Italian ship with 16 intercepted migrants docks at Albanian port to process asylum request	SHENGJIN, Albania (AP) — An Italian navy ship on Wednesday docked at the Albanian port of Shengjin to bring the first group of 16 migrants intercepted in international waters. The naval ship Libra left the port of Lampedusa on Monday with 16 men — 10 from Bangladesh and six from Egypt — who were rescued at sea after departing from Libya, a ministry spokesman said. Last week Italy formally opened two centers in Albania where it plans to process thousands of asylum-seekers outside its borders. The centers will only house adult men, while vulnerable people such as women, children, the elderly and those who are ill or victims of torture will be accommodated in Italy. Families will not be separated. Italian Ambassador to Albania Fabrizio Bucci said Friday the two centers were ready to process migrants after the opening was delayed for months to consolidate the crumbling soil at one center, in Gjader where they will be accommodated. Though the center in Gjader has capacity for 3,000 migrants, it will start with 400 and increase to 880 in a few weeks. The number of people reaching Italy along the central Mediterranean migration route from North Africa has fallen by 61% in 2024 from 2023. According to the Italian Interior Ministry, as of Oct. 15, 54,129 migrants have arrived in Italy by sea this year, compared to 138,947 by the same date last year. Under a five-year deal signed last November by Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni and her Albanian counterpart, Edi Rama, up to 3,000 migrants picked up by the Italian coast guard in international waters each month will be sheltered in Albania. They will be screened initially on board the ships that rescue them before being sent to Albania for further screening. The two centers will cost Italy 670 million euros ($730 million) over five years. The facilities are run by Italy and are under Italian jurisdiction, while Albanian guards provide external security. The first center, an area in Shengjin, 66 kilometers (40 miles) northwest of the capital, Tirana, is used for screening newcomers. While the other center, about 22 kilometers (14 miles) to its east near the former military airport in Gjader, accommodates migrants during the processing of their asylum requests. Italian officials expect the Gjader center will never be at full occupancy but that depends on the flow of migrants brought to Albania. In Albania, the migrants retain their right under international and European Union law to apply for asylum in Italy and have their claims processed there, a move expected to take a maximum of 28 days, including any appeal case, to process. Italy has agreed to welcome those who are granted asylum. Those whose applications are rejected face deportation directly from Albania. The controversial agreement to outsource the housing of asylum-seekers to a non-EU member country has been hailed by some countries that, like Italy, are suffering a heavy burden of refugees. The agreement was endorsed by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen as an example of 'out-of-box thinking' in tackling the issue of migration into the European Union. But it has been slammed by human rights groups as setting a dangerous precedent. Rama has made it clear that no other country will be able to have such centers in Albania. He said Albania felt an expression of gratitude for the tens of thousands of Albanians who were welcomed by Italy when communism fell in 1991, or support extended by Rome during the economic turmoil in 1997 and in the aftermath of the 2019 earthquake. Meloni and her right-wing allies have long demanded that European countries share more of the migration burden. She has held up the Albania agreement as an innovative solution to a problem that has vexed the EU for years. ___ Follow Llazar Semini at https://x.com/lsemini	https://apnews.com/article/italy-albania-migrants-asylum-request-centers-arrival-3dd82dfd6414f8cee84b74ca15fa0b31	2024-10-15T21:15:04-07:00	
Israel strikes southern suburbs of Beirut for the first time in nearly a week	BEIRUT (AP) — Israeli jets struck the southern suburbs of Beirut early Wednesday for the first time in six days, Lebanese state media reported. The casualty count was not yet clear. The attack comes just one day after caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati said the United States government gave him some assurances of Israel easing its strikes in the Lebanese capital. Israel says it is striking Hezbollah assets in the suburbs, where the militant group has a strong presence, but it is also a busy residential and commercial area. The Israeli military said the Wednesday strike hit a weapons warehouse under a residential building. The Israeli military posted an evacuation warning on the X platform saying it is targeting a building in the Haret Hreik neighborhood. An Associated Press photographer who witnessed the strikes said there were three in the area. The first strike was documented less than an hour after the notice. Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel on Oct. 8 in solidarity with the Palestinian militant group Hamas, following their surprise attack on southern Israel. A year of low-level fighting escalated into all-out war last month, and has displaced some 1.2 million people in Lebanon. Elsewhere, Israeli strikes late Tuesday in the southern town of Qana killed 10 people and wounded 15 others, Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency said. Nuhad Bustanji, a spokesperson for the Lebanese Civil Defense, said one person was killed and 34 wounded, with the toll likely to rise as rescue efforts continue. It was not immediately possible to resolve the different tolls provided by authorities. Videos shared on social media showed the smoking ruins of what appears to be a building targeted in the strike with surrounding structures damaged as well. Local media said there were several strikes in the southern town Tuesday night. Qana was the site of an Israeli artillery strike on a United Nations compound that killed dozens of civilians in 1996.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-lebanon-hezbollah-news-10-16-2024-f18b2e0f5e05eb11a3c2ee29c16ed867	2024-10-15T21:10:50-07:00	
Stock market today: Asian shares track Wall St decline, as selling hits tech companies	BANGKOK (AP) — Markets were mostly lower in Asia on Wednesday after U.S. stocks pulled back from their records, dented by selling of technology and energy sector shares. Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 index fell 1.8% to 39,210.61, leading the declines, as tech stocks fell after Dutch computer chip equipment supplier ASML warned of a slower recovery in demand for semiconductors outside of the AI boom. Chip maker Tokyo Electron sank 9.8% and Lasertec Corp., which makes equipment to inspect chips, lost 13.4%. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 slipped 0.2% to 8,301.80. In Seoul, the Kospi shed 0.4% to 2,622.27, while Taiwan's Taiex slipped 0.5%. India's Sensex lost 0.2%. Chinese shares mostly advanced, rebounding after recent losses. Hong Kong's Hang Seng surged 0.9% to 20,501.77, while the Shanghai Composite index gained 0.4% to 3,214.01. On Tuesday, Wall Street pulled back from its records, with the S&amp;P 500 falling 0.8% to 5,815.26, a day after setting an all-time high for the 46th time this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.8% to 42,740.42, and the Nasdaq composite sank 1% to 18,315.59. Exxon Mobil dropped 3%, and energy stocks fell to some of Wall Street’s sharpest losses after oil prices tumbled more than 4%. A barrel of Brent crude, the international standard, has fallen back below $75 from more than $80 last week. Crude prices have been weakening as China’s flagging economic growth raises concerns about demand for oil. At the same time, worries have receded about Israel possibly attacking Iranian oil facilities as part of its retaliation against Iran’s missile attack early this month. Iran is a major producer of crude, and a strike could upend its exports to China and elsewhere. However, oil recovered in early Wednesday trading, with benchmark U.S. crude oil up 29 cents at $70.86 per barrel. Brent crude gained 26 cents to $74.51 per barrel. Nvidia was the heaviest weight on the S&amp;P 500 and fell 4.5%. The chip company's stock is still up 166.2% for the year so far on euphoria about the profits created by the boom around artificial-intelligence technology. In reporting ASML's latest quarterly results, its CEO Christophe Fouquet said AI continues to offer strong upside potential, but 'other market segments are taking longer to recover.' ASML’s stock traded in the United States fell 16.3%. 'Anxiety has also intensified with reports that the U.S. is considering new restrictions on chip exports to specific countries, particularly targeting Nvidia and AMD, citing national security concerns,' Anderson Alves of ActivTrades said in a commentary. Traders are watching for an earnings report from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp., due Thursday. TMSC's shares fell 1.9% on Wednesday. U.S. chipmaker Wolfspeed jumped 21.3% on Tuesday, trimming its loss for the year to 68.3%, after the Biden-Harris administration announced plans to provide up to $750 million in direct funding to the company. The money will support its new silicon carbide factory in North Carolina that makes the wafers used in advanced computer chips. Charles Schwab jumped 6.1%. More customers opened brokerage accounts at the company, helping to bring its total client assets to a record $9.92 trillion. Bank of America added 0.5%, and CEO Brian Moynihan said his company benefited from higher average loans and fees for investment banking and asset management. Walgreens Boots Alliance was another winner, up 15.8%, after topping analysts’ forecasts. The drugstore chain also said it will close about 1,200 locations over the next three years as it tries to turn around its struggling U.S. business. In the bond market, trading of Treasurys resumed after a holiday on Monday, and yields sank following a weaker-than-expected report on manufacturing in New York state. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.03% from 4.10% late Friday. Early Wednesday, the dollar was trading at 149.19 Japanese yen, down from 149.22 yen.

Mexico’s ex-public security chief sentenced to 38-plus years in US for taking cartel bribes	NEW YORK (AP) — The man once heralded as the architect of Mexico’s war on drug cartels was sentenced to more than 38 years in a U.S. prison on Wednesday for taking massive bribes to aid drug traffickers. Genaro García Luna, Mexico’s former secretary of public security, was convicted by a New York jury in 2023 of taking millions of dollars in bribes to protect the violent Sinaloa cartel that he was supposedly combating. He is the highest-level Mexican government official to be convicted in the United States. At his sentencing hearing before a federal judge in Brooklyn on Wednesday, García Luna continued to maintain his innocence and said the case against him was based on false information from criminals and the Mexican government. 'I have a firm respect for the law,' he said in Spanish. 'I have not committed these crimes.' García Luna, 56, led Mexico’s federal police before he served in a cabinet-level position as the top security official from 2006 to 2012 under then-President Felipe Calderón. At the time, García Luna was hailed as an ally by the U.S. in its fight on drug trafficking. But U.S. prosecutors said that in return for millions of dollars, he provided intelligence about investigations against the cartel, information about rival gangs and the safe passage of massive quantities of drugs. After the sentencing, Calderón said via the social platform X that he respects the court's decision but he never had 'verifiable evidence' of García Luna's criminal activities. Calderón said taking on the cartels 'was one of the most difficult decisions of my life. But I would do it again, because it is the right thing to do.' Earlier outside the courthouse, a group of about 15 protesters celebrated the verdict. Some held a banner that said, in Spanish, 'Calderon did know,' while others brandished signs denouncing his political party. Prosecutors had asked for a life sentence. García Luna's lawyers had argued that he should get no more than 20 years. U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan said he wasn't moved by past accolades that García Luna received for his work in the war on drugs. 'That was your cover,' Cogan said before imposing the sentence. 'You are guilty of these crimes, sir. You can’t parade these words and say, ‘I’m police officer of the year.’' Besides the sentence of 38 years and four months, the judge imposed a $2 million fine. During the trial, photos were shown of García Luna shaking hands with former President Barack Obama and speaking with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former Sen. John McCain. But prosecutors said García Luna secretly advanced a drug trafficking conspiracy that resulted in the deaths of thousands of American and Mexican citizens. He ensured that drug traffickers were notified in advance of raids and sabotaged legitimate police operations aimed at apprehending cartel leaders, they said. Drug traffickers were able to ship over 1 million kilograms of cocaine through Mexico and into the United States using planes, trains, trucks and submarines while García Luna held his posts, prosecutors said. During former Sinaloa kingpin Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzmán’s trial in the same court in 2018, a former cartel member testified that he personally delivered at least $6 million in payoffs to García Luna and that cartel members agreed to pool up to $50 million to pay for his protection. 'He enabled the cartel. He protected the cartel. He was the cartel,' Assistant U.S. Attorney Saritha Komatireddy told the judge Wednesday. García Luna enabled a corrupt system that allowed violent cartels to thrive and distribute drugs that killed multitudes of people, she added. 'It may not have been the defendant pulling the trigger, but he has blood on his hands,' Komatireddy said. Prosecutors also said García Luna plotted to undo last year's verdict by seeking to bribe or corruptly convince multiple inmates at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn to support false allegations that two government witnesses communicated via contraband cellular phones in advance of the trial. García Luna’s lawyer, Cesar de Castro, said the defense intends to appeal the sentence. He said his client is someone who 'has served his country' and has now lost his money, his reputation as well as policies he championed in Mexico. 'He has lost close to everything. All that remains is his wonderful family,' de Castro said. In Mexico, newly inaugurated President Claudia Sheinbaum briefly commented on the case Tuesday, saying: 'The big issue here is how someone who was awarded by United States agencies, who ex-President Calderón said wonderful things about his security secretary, today is prisoner in the United States because it’s shown that he was tied to drug trafficking.' García Luna’s arrest and conviction became a political cudgel that the governing party of Sheinbaum and her predecessor, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, used in this year’s Mexican presidential election against Calderón’s weakened National Action Party. They sought to paint García Luna as the poster child of corruption and Calderón as the man responsible for soaring violence from the drug war. López Obrador and now Sheinbaum turned away from direct confrontation with the cartels, instead focusing on what they consider root causes of violence, such as poverty. But the new strategy has failed to significantly lower the level of violence. López Obrador had a very different reaction in 2020 when U.S. authorities arrested former Mexican Defense Secretary Salvador Cienfuegos for allegedly colluding with a drug cartel. In that case, López Obrador accused the Drug Enforcement Administration of fabricating evidence against Cienfuegos and protested until the U.S. government dropped the charges. He was returned to Mexico, where he was promptly cleared and released. ___ Associated Press writers Fabiola Sánchez, María Verza and Christopher Sherman in Mexico City contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/genaro-garcia-luna-sentence-mexico-cartel-drugs-7be324edd8561f05c74e7437f62994df	2024-10-15T19:25:44-07:00	
A full-scale replica of Anne Frank's hidden annex is heading to New York for an exhibition	AMSTERDAM (AP) — The annex where the young Jewish diarist Anne Frank hid from Nazi occupiers during World War II is heading to New York. A full-scale replica of the rooms that form the heart of the Anne Frank House museum on one of Amsterdam's historic canals is being built in the Netherlands and will be shipped across the Atlantic for a show titled ' Anne Frank The Exhibition ' at the Center for Jewish History in Manhattan. 'For the first time in history, the Anne Frank House will present what I would call a pioneering experience outside of Amsterdam. To immerse visitors in a full-scale, meticulous recreation of the secret annex. Those rooms where Anne Frank, her parents, her sister, four other Jews, spent more than two years hiding to evade Nazi capture,' Anne Frank House director Ronald Leopold told The Associated Press in an interview detailing the upcoming exhibition. In July 1942, Anne Frank, then aged 13, her parents Otto and Edith, and her 16-year-old sister Margo went into hiding in the annex. They were joined a week later by the van Pels family — Hermann, Auguste and their 15-year-old son, Peter. Four months later, Fritz Pfeffer moved into the hiding place, also seeking to evade capture by the Netherlands' Nazi German occupiers. They stayed in the annex of rooms until they were discovered in 1944 and sent to the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration and extermination camp. Anne and her sister Margot were then moved to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where they both died of typhus in February 1945. Anne was 15. Her father, Otto, the only person from the annex to survive the Holocaust, published Anne's diary after the war and it became a publishing sensation around the world as a symbol of hope and resilience in the face of tyranny. Leopold said the New York exhibit promises to be 'an immersive, interactive, captivating experience' for visitors. It opens on Jan. 27, International Holocaust Remembrance Day, to mark the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. While the faithfully rebuilt annex of rooms will be the heart of the exhibit, it also will trace the history of Anne's family from their time in Germany, their move to the Netherlands and decision to go into hiding, to their discovery by Nazis, deportation, Anne's death and the postwar decision by her father to publish her diary. 'What we try to achieve with this exhibition is that people, our visitors will learn about Anne not just as a victim, but through the multifaceted lens of a life, as a teenage girl, as a writer, as a symbol of resilience and of strength. We hope that they will contemplate the context that shaped her life.' The exhibition comes at a time of rising antisemitism and anger at the devastating war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza that has now spread to the Hezbollah militia in Lebanon following the deadly Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attacks in southern Israel. 'With ever fewer, fewer, survivors in our communities, with devastating antisemitism and other forms of group hatred on the rise in the U.S. but also across the world, we feel ... our responsibility as Anne Frank House has never been greater,' Leopold said. 'And this exhibition is also in part a response to that responsibility to educate people to stand against antisemitism, to stand against group hatred.' Anne's diary will not be making the transatlantic trip. 'We unfortunately will not be able to travel with the diary, writings, the notebooks and the loose sheets that Anne wrote. They are too fragile, too vulnerable to travel,' Leopold said. Among 125 exhibits that are traveling from Amsterdam for the New York exhibition are photos, albums, artefacts such as one of the yellow stars Jews were ordered to wear in the occupied Netherlands, as well as the Best Supporting Actress Oscar won by Shelley Winters for her role in George Stevens’ 1959 film 'The Diary of Anne Frank.'	https://apnews.com/article/anne-frank-new-york-annex-diary-holocaust-8d093b71a48dcb84983a4ecf9d497747	2024-10-15T19:18:11-07:00

Takeaways from AP's report on euthanasia, doctors and ethics in Canada	TORONTO (AP) — Canada has arguably the world's most permissive system of euthanasia — the practice of doctors and nurse practitioners killing patients with an injection of drugs at their request. Canada allows euthanasia for people who aren't terminally ill but are suffering unmanageable pain. As Canada pushes to expand euthanasia and more countries move to legalize it, health care workers here are grappling with requests from people whose pain might be alleviated by money, adequate housing or social connections. And internal data obtained exclusively by The Associated Press from Canada’s most populous province suggest a significant number of people euthanized when they are in unmanageable pain but not about to die live in Ontario’s poorest areas. Here’s a look at the main takeaways from an AP investigation into euthanasia in Canada, commonly known there as medical assistance in dying, or MAiD. Some doctors fear providing euthanasia, even in legal cases Canada allows euthanasia for people with 'irremediable suffering' from serious but nonfatal medical conditions and disabilities. After euthanasia was legalized in 2016, doctors and nurses set up email discussion groups as confidential forums to discuss potentially troubling cases, with limited patient details. They're now run by the Canadian Association of MAiD Assessors and Providers, an educational and research organization. Dozens of messages provided to the AP by a participant in the forums — on condition of anonymity, due to the confidential nature of the messages and cases — show a fraught process where medical professionals test the limits of what conditions warrant euthanasia. In one case, a middle-aged worker whose ankle and back injuries made him unable to resume his previous job told his doctor the government’s measly support was 'leaving (him) with no choice but to pursue MAiD.' His doctor told forum participants the patient met legal criteria, with severe pain, strained social relationships and inability to work. Others agreed, but the doctor hesitated because the man cited reduced government payments as a key factor — and the doctor noted fear of being portrayed in the media as having euthanized someone 'in a case where services were inadequate.' Case of homeless people spark debate Cases of homelessness appear regularly on the private forums. One doctor wrote that although his patient had a serious lung disease, his suffering was 'mostly because he is homeless, in debt and cannot tolerate the idea of (long-term care) of any kind.' A respondent questioned whether the fear of living in a nursing home was truly intolerable. Another said the prospect of 'looking at the wall or ceiling waiting to be fed … to have diapers changed' was sufficiently painful. One provider said any suggestion they should provide patients with better housing options before offering euthanasia 'seems simply unrealistic and hence, cruel,' amid a national housing crisis. Data suggest marginalized people are affected Government officials have largely refuted the idea that socially disadvantaged people are being euthanized. But in Ontario, more than three-quarters of people euthanized when their death wasn’t imminent required disability support before their death in 2023, according to data from a slideshow presentation by the province’s chief coroner, shared with AP by both a researcher and a doctor on condition of anonymity due to its sensitive nature. Of people killed when they weren’t terminally ill, nearly 29% lived in the poorest parts of Ontario, compared with 20% of the province’s general population living in the most deprived communities, the data show. The figures suggest poverty may be a factor in Canada’s nonterminal euthanasia cases. But Dr. Dirk Huyer, Ontario's chief coroner, told AP that the data was only an early analysis and 'it’s tough to know exactly what it means,' saying that his job was only to present the statistics. Poverty doesn’t appear to disproportionately affect patients with terminal diseases who are euthanized, according to the leaked data. Experts say no other country with legal euthanasia has seen a marked number of deaths in impoverished people. Overall for Ontario, the data show, nonterminal patients account for a small portion of all euthanasia cases: 116 of 4,528 deaths last year. But the presentation and discussion among Ontario officials and medical professionals show rising awareness of euthanasia deaths for social reasons. Privately, officials admit concern Canadian officials have examined worrisome cases that haven't been publicly disclosed. A document from the Ministry of the Solicitor General in Ontario sent to all euthanasia providers in the province in May noted two cases of 'lessons learned' in nonterminal cases. The document was shared with AP by a doctor on condition of anonymity because it wasn’t authorized for release. In one, a 74-year-old patient who'd suffered blood pressure, a stroke and blindness was increasingly dependent on their spouse. The patient told their doctor they were interested in euthanasia, citing deteriorating vision loss and quality of life. Among other issues identified, officials wrote the patient's euthanasia was scheduled 'based on the spouse’s preference of timing' and questioned whether 'the patient’s death was genuinely voluntary.' Canada pushes boundaries Theo Boer, professor of health care ethics at Groningen University in the Netherlands, said that unlike other countries with legal euthanasia, Canada appears to be providing it for social reasons in some cases. 'That may be what Canadians want, but they would still benefit from some honest self-reflection about what is going on,' he said. Some of that reflection is happening in the confidential providers’ forums. They’ve debated whether it’s valid to euthanize people for obesity in several cases. They've also beem divided over ending the lives of people in mourning. Canada's government said it legalized euthanasia to reduce suffering and support individual autonomy — and polls have consistently shown public approval. But its laws are now being challenged on all sides. The advocacy group Dying with Dignity filed an August lawsuit in Ontario, alleging it’s 'discriminatory' to exclude mentally ill people from euthanasia. Meanwhile, a coalition of disability-rights organizations in another lawsuit argued that euthanasia legislation has resulted in the premature deaths of people with disabilities. ____ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

Years of war in Congo have created a dire mental health crisis. But little support is available	GOMA, Congo (AP) — For Nelly Shukuru, there was no way out. The fighting that forced her from her home, the squalid conditions in the displacement camp in eastern Congo, the hunger, all felt inescapable. The 51-year-old planned to hang herself. She said a neighbor stopped her just in time. 'In my mind, the suffering was permanent,' said the mother of six, seated in a health clinic. 'The people who have died are better off than I am.' Years of conflict in eastern Congo have created a dire mental health crisis. Aid groups say the number of people seeking care has spiked as fighting intensifies. Some of the worst affected struggle to survive in cramped, violent displacement sites that aren't conducive to recovery. The number of people who received psychosocial support in camps around the main city of Goma increased more than 200% between January and June compared to the same period last year — from 6,600 to more than 20,000 — according to aid group Action Against Hunger. The number of people reporting suicidal thoughts has jumped from about five a month at the beginning of the year to more than 120, it said. More than 100 armed groups have been vying for a foothold in mineral-rich eastern Congo near the border with Rwanda. The violence has escalated as the M23 rebel group, backed by Rwanda, has reemerged. The fighting has displaced millions. Over 600,000 shelter in camps near Goma. More people are experiencing anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder as well as insomnia and excessive alcohol and drug consumption, psychologists say. 'All around us there is war, and the number of people facing difficulty is increasing daily,' said Innocent Ntamuheza, a psychologist with Action Against Hunger. But little mental health support is available. Less than 30% of the requested $180 million for protection — which includes mental health services — in the humanitarian response plan has been funded this year, said the United Nations, which calls Congo one of the world’s most neglected crises. Shukuru said she considered killing herself in August after her drunk 21-year-old son struck her head with a rock because of a fight over a radio. Her children’s drinking had worsened since arriving in the camp because they were idle, she said. The family used to farm and attend church in their hometown of Sake but fled in February when it was bombed. Her husband, a construction worker, struggles to find jobs. The aid they receive isn't enough. Some of the camps for displaced families are less than a day's walk from the front lines. The camp where Shukuru lives was struck by shells in May that killed some 40 people and injured others, locals and aid groups said. Some armed men live among the camps' population. During a visit in August, The Associated Press saw men carrying guns and a truck of people in military fatigues drive through, chanting war songs. It wasn't clear if the people were with the military or self-defense groups. In the government's attempt to push back M23, it's been supporting militia groups under a coalition called the Wazalendo. But the groups, who previously fought government forces and each other, are accused of committing human rights abuses, locals and aid groups said. Some fighters and members of Congo's army, often stationed nearby, are also accused of sexual assault. A 38-year-old said she was raped by three armed men in a field while she was looking for food in May. The AP does not name people who have been sexually assaulted. The mother of eight has been seeking help at a clinic run by Doctors Without Borders, also known by its acronym MSF, but said she often can’t sleep at night and sees the men in her dreams. The constant presence of armed men in the camp makes it worse. 'It reminds me of the men who raped me,' she said. People relive traumatic incidents especially when it comes to rape, said Clementine Sifa, the mental health supervisor for MSF. In September, MSF said it treated an unprecedented number of survivors of sexual violence in Congo last year — more than 25,000 — with the trend continuing this year. The majority of people were treated in displacement camps in Goma. Lt. Col. Guillaume Ndjike, spokesman for Congo's army in the east, said the army is trying to protect people in the camps by conducting night patrols and setting up mobile police stations. He said armed men aren't allowed in the sites, and people accused of sexual assault or murder are apprehended and held accountable. Locals and aid workers say there is little accountability. Some aid groups are training community leaders to spot signs of people who might need mental health support and refer them to a clinic. They watch for people who are isolated, look stressed or have lost their jobs. Stigma surrounding mental health sometimes keeps people from proactively seeking it, they said. Those who have sought treatment say it's been helpful to learn ways to cope with anxiety and negative thoughts, including breathing techniques. Wrapping her arms around her chest and tapping her shoulders, Josephine Mulonda said the technique called 'butterfly hug' has helped reduce heart palpitations triggered by her husband's killing in January. The 52-year-old had depressive thoughts and worried how she would support their eight children. War Child, an organization focused on helping children in conflict, uses movement, song and play to help troubled youth express themselves. Dancing in a circle at a displacement site, children chant 'Let me cry, I’m crying.' The group also gives parents advice on listening to their children, said Isaac Rwamakuba, War Child's coordinator in Goma for emergency responses. But he said some of the most affected children lost families through death or separation. Last November, a 14-year-old was separated from her family when her town was attacked. The AP is not using her name due to the sensitivity of her situation. She is cared for by another family but fears being attacked when she walks for hours into the bush to find firewood to sell. She's considered ending her life to stop the suffering, she said. The psychological support from War Child helps at least momentarily, she said. She has no idea if her mother is alive. ___ The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

Canadian doctors who provide euthanasia struggle with the ethics of killing vulnerable patients	TORONTO (AP) — A homeless man refusing long-term care, a woman with severe obesity, an injured worker given meager government assistance, and grieving new widows. All of them requested to be killed under Canada’s euthanasia system, and each sparked private debate among doctors and nurses struggling with the ethics of one of the world’s most permissive laws on the practice, according to an Associated Press investigation. As Canada pushes to expand euthanasia and more countries move to legalize it, health care workers here are grappling with requests from people whose pain might be alleviated by money, adequate housing or social connections. And internal data obtained exclusively by AP from Canada’s most populous province suggest a significant number of people euthanized when they are in unmanageable pain but not about to die live in Ontario's poorest and most deprived areas. Some doctors fear moving forward even with cases that meet Canada’s legal requirements, which allow euthanasia for people with 'irremediable suffering' from serious but nonfatal medical conditions and disabilities. On private forums, doctors and nurses have expressed deep discomfort with ending the lives of vulnerable people whose deaths were avoidable, according to messages provided to AP by a participant on condition of anonymity due to their confidentiality. Some of the requests from the forums were approved and acted upon. Others were denied. But the discourse about patients who are poor, disabled or lonely shows a fraught process where medical professionals test the limits of what conditions warrant euthanasia. The controversial cases in the forums have never been disclosed through Canada’s oversight system, even in an anonymized manner. When Canada legalized assisted dying in 2016, officials said they wanted to reduce suffering and support individual autonomy and freedom of choice — and polls have consistently shown public approval. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised then that safeguards would prevent vulnerable people from being euthanized 'because you’re not getting the support and care you actually need.' But experts tasked with delivering euthanasia to people who aren't dying have called it 'morally distressing' and say the legal provisions are too vague to be protective, obliging doctors and nurses to at times end the lives of people they believe might otherwise be saved. 'I don’t want (euthanasia) to become the solution to every kind of suffering out there,' a physician wrote to colleagues on one of the private forums. Euthanasia programs are increasing Canada has the world’s fastest-growing program for euthanasia, the practice of doctors and nurse practitioners killing patients with an injection of drugs at their request. Medically assisted suicide — patients themselves taking prescribed, lethal medication — also is legal. But virtually all of Canada’s MAiD cases — as it’s widely known here, for medical assistance in dying – are euthanasia, with a doctor or nurse practitioner giving the fatal injection. Unlike many other countries, Canada doesn't require that patients exhaust all medical treatments before seeking death. After legalizing euthanasia in 2016, Canada broadened its law in 2021 to allow people with incurable, but not terminal, conditions – including disability alone – to seek a way to die. This vastly expanded the number of people eligible, and medical groups in some territories and provinces require doctors to inform, offer or help provide euthanasia to any patients who might qualify. Adults with serious, incurable conditions must have a written request approved by two independent doctors or nurse practitioners. Those with nonterminal cases must be informed of other ways to relieve their suffering, among other requirements, and there’s a minimum 90-day assessment period. As the eligibility pool has grown, so has criticism among academics, disability advocacy groups and religious communities. Doctors and nurses 'do not treat MAiD as an option of last resort,' said an August report published by the Christian think tank Cardus. The nonprofit organization Inclusion Canada regularly hears from people with disabilities who are offered euthanasia, including one disabled woman whose physiotherapist suggested it when she sought help for a bruised hip, said executive vice president Krista Carr. 'Our response to the intolerable suffering of people with disabilities is: 'Your life is not worth living,’' she said. 'We'll just offer them the lethal injection, and we'll offer it readily.' Doctors privately debate euthanasia cases When euthanasia was legalized, doctors and nurse practitioners set up email discussion groups as confidential forums to discuss potentially troubling cases, with limited patient details for privacy. They're now run by the Canadian Association of MAiD Assessors and Providers. Association President Dr. Konia Trouton told AP via email that providing euthanasia for vulnerability or financial reasons alone is 'completely forbidden.' Trouton said doctors and nurse practitioners consult with one another on the forums 'to gain insights and learn from the experiences of others.' The participant who shared some of the email discussions with AP provided dozens of messages raising questions about the medical and ethical complexities of euthanasia requests from people nationwide who weren't terminally ill. A middle-aged worker whose ankle and back injuries made him unable to resume his previous job told his doctor that the government’s measly support was 'leaving (him) with no choice but to pursue MAiD.' His doctor told forum participants the patient met legal criteria, with severe pain, strained social relationships and inability to work. Others agreed and assured the doctor the man was clearly in pain. But the doctor was hesitant because the man cited reduced government payments as a key factor. Cases of homelessness appear regularly and spark some of the most heated debate. One doctor wrote that although his patient had a serious lung disease, his suffering was 'mostly because he is homeless, in debt and cannot tolerate the idea of (long-term care) of any kind.' A respondent questioned whether the fear of living in the nursing home was truly intolerable. Another said the prospect of 'looking at the wall or ceiling waiting to be fed … to have diapers changed' was sufficiently painful. The man was eventually euthanized. One provider said any suggestion they should provide patients with better housing options before offering euthanasia 'seems simply unrealistic and hence, cruel,' amid a national housing crisis. Physicians said keeping their opinions out of assessments was difficult — and painful, given patients' emotions and desperation. Experts not linked to the forums said that while doctors and nurses need private space for discussion, the lack of transparency about controversial cases is alarming. 'The question about who gets euthanasia is a societal question,' said Kasper Raus, a researcher at Ghent University’s Bioethics Institute in Belgium. 'This is a procedure that ends people’s lives, so we need to be closely monitoring any changes in who is getting it. 'If not, the entire practice could change and veer away from the reasons that we legalized euthanasia.' Data suggest marginalized people are affected Critics have long warned that Canada’s policies have led to euthanasia among disadvantaged people whose deaths weren't imminent. Despite publicized cases of people asking to be killed because of insufficient support, government officials have largely refuted the idea that socially disadvantaged people are being euthanized. But in Ontario, more than three quarters of people euthanized when their death wasn't imminent required disability support before their death in 2023, according to data from a slideshow presentation by the province’s chief coroner, shared with AP by both a researcher and a doctor on condition of anonymity due to its sensitive nature. Of people killed when they weren’t terminally ill, nearly 29% lived in the poorest parts of Ontario, compared with 20% of the province's general population living in the most deprived communities, the data show. People euthanized with nonterminal conditions were 'more likely to live in neighborhoods where there’s higher levels of residential instability, higher material deprivation and greater dependency on government support,' Ontario Chief Coroner Dr. Dirk Huyer said during his May presentation. The figures suggest poverty may be a factor in Canada’s nonterminal euthanasia cases. But Huyer told AP that the data was only an early analysis and 'it’s tough to know exactly what it means,' saying that his job was only to present the statistics. Poverty doesn't appear to disproportionately affect patients with terminal diseases who are euthanized, according to the leaked data. And experts say no other country that has legalized euthanasia has seen a marked number of deaths in impoverished people. Overall for Ontario, the data show, nonterminal patients account for a small portion of all euthanasia cases: 116 of 4,528 deaths last year. But the presentation and discussion among Ontario officials and medical professionals show rising awareness of euthanasia deaths for social reasons. Privately, officials admit concern Health Canada, the government agency responsible for national health policy, publishes yearly reports of euthanasia trends but hasn’t released any review of cases that triggered ethical concerns. Marie-Pier Burelle, a spokeswoman for Health Canada, said in an email that 'lack of access to social supports or to health services is not and would never be part of eligibility criteria' for euthanasia. Burelle cited 'stringent safeguards to affirm and protect the inherent and equal value of every person’s life.' In private, though, Canadian officials have examined worrisome cases. A document from the Ministry of the Solicitor General in Ontario sent to all euthanasia providers in the province in May noted two cases of 'lessons learned' in nonterminal cases. The document was shared with AP by a doctor on condition of anonymity because it wasn’t authorized for release. In one, a 74-year-old patient who’d suffered high blood pressure, a stroke and blindness, among other difficulties, was increasingly dependent on their spouse and 'expressed their interest in MAiD to their family physician, due to their vision impairment and loss of hope for improvement of their vision and quality of life.' The report cited three instances where legally mandated safeguards were not met. Among them: No assessor or expert versed in the nonterminal condition was involved, and efforts to discuss alternatives to death were 'limited.' The report also said the procedure was scheduled 'based on the spouse’s preference of timing.' Officials questioned whether 'the patient’s death was genuinely voluntary and free of coercion.' Independent legal experts said those breaches could constitute violations of criminal law. Some push for more reflection Polls show that expanding access to euthanasia has long been supported across Canada. But the country appears to be pushing the boundaries of what’s socially acceptable, experts say, and that could have global implications, as countries including Britain and France move towards legalization. 'Canada seems to be providing euthanasia for social reasons, when people don't have the financial means, which would be a big taboo in Europe,' said Theo Boer, professor of health care ethics at Groningen University in the Netherlands. 'That may be what Canadians want, but they would still benefit from some honest self-reflection about what is going on.' Some of that reflection is happening in the confidential providers’ forums. They’ve debated whether it’s valid to euthanize people for obesity in several cases. One woman with severe obesity described herself as a 'useless body taking up space' — she'd lost interest in activities, became socially withdrawn and said she had 'no purpose,' according to the doctor who reviewed her case. Another physician reasoned that euthanasia was warranted because obesity is 'a medical condition which is indeed grievous and irremediable.' When a health worker inquired whether anyone had euthanized patients for blindness, one provider reported four such cases. In one, they said, an elderly man who saw 'only shadows' was his wife’s caregiver when he requested euthanasia; he wanted her to die with him. The couple had several appointments with an assessor before the wife 'finally agreed' to be killed, the provider said. She died unexpectedly just days before the scheduled euthanasia. Providers on the forum were divided over ending the lives of people in mourning. One case involved a woman in her 80s who required dialysis and lost her husband, sibling and cat in a six-week period. Her assessor said her suffering and request to die were tied to her husband’s death rather than any medical conditions. Some doctors said because she lost her husband — the protective factor that would make the other losses and suffering bearable — she qualified. Others recommended grief counseling instead. A provider referenced a similar case, in which a widow requested euthanasia within weeks of her husband’s death: 'Her whole life system crashed. I felt much ease in providing for her and had no pushback from the coroner.' Dr. Ellen Wiebe, who has euthanized more than 400 people in Canada, told AP that while poverty inevitably exacerbates suffering, improved housing and social situations have never changed a patient’s mind. 'The idea that because I’m disabled, I should lose my rights that undisabled people have is outrageous,' said Wiebe, who suffers from heart disease and uses a wheelchair. She predicted legal consequences if officials introduce more safeguards for euthanasia: 'We’ll just be back in court with somebody saying, ‘You interfered with my basic human rights.’' The government already faces challenges to its euthanasia laws on all sides. The advocacy group Dying with Dignity filed an August lawsuit in Ontario, alleging it's 'discriminatory' to exclude mentally ill people from euthanasia. A coalition of disability-rights organizations in a lawsuit last month argued that euthanasia legislation has resulted in premature deaths of people with disabilities. On euthanasia forums, doctors and nurses continue to struggle with cases of patients who aren’t fatally ill, lamenting that Canada’s health and social services can seem woefully inadequate. 'I have great discomfort with the idea of MAiD being driven by social circumstances,' one provider said. 'I don’t have a good solution to social deprivation either, so I feel pretty useless when I receive requests like this.' ____ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

In the heartland of Mexico's Sinaloa cartel, the old ways have changed and violence rages	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Cellphone chats have become death sentences in the continuing, bloody factional war inside Mexico's Sinaloa drug cartel. Cartel gunmen stop youths on the street or in their cars and demand their phones. If they find a contact who’s a member of a rival faction, a chat with a wrong word or a photo with the wrong person, the phone owner is dead. Then, they’ll go after everyone on that person's contact list, forming a potential chain of kidnapping, torture and death. That has left residents of Culiacan, the capital of Sinaloa state, afraid to even leave home at night, much less visit towns a few miles away where many have weekend retreats. 'You can’t go five minutes out of the city, ... not even in daylight,' said Ismael Bojórquez, a veteran journalist in Culiacan. 'Why? Because the narcos have set up roadblocks and they stop you and search through your cellphone.' And it’s not just your own chats: If a person is traveling in a car with others, one bad contact or chat can get the whole group kidnapped. That’s what happened to the son of a local news photographer. The 20-year-old was stopped with two other youths and something was found on one of their phones; all three disappeared. Calls were made and the photographer’s son was finally released, but the other two were never seen again. Residents of Culiacan had long been accustomed to a day or two of violence once in a while. The presence of the Sinaloa cartel is woven into everyday life there, and people knew to stay indoors when they saw the convoys of double-cab pickups racing through the streets. But never have they seen the solid month of fighting that broke out Sept. 9 between factions of the Sinaloa cartel after drug lords Ismael 'El Mayo' Zambada and Joaquín Guzmán López were apprehended in the United States after flying there in a small plane on July 25. Zambada later claimed he was kidnapped and forced aboard the plane by Guzmán López, causing a violent battle between Zambada’s faction and the 'Chapitos' group led by the sons of imprisoned drug lord Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzmán. Residents of Culiacan are mourning their old lives, when the wheels of the local economy were greased by cartel wealth but civilians seldom suffered — unless they cut off the wrong pickup truck in traffic. Juan Carlos Ayala, an academic who studies the anthropology of the drug trade at the Autonomous University of Sinaloa, said that following the arrests of Guzmán López and Zambada in July, a new generation of younger, more flashy and cosmopolitan drug lords have taken over. They fight with extreme violence, kidnapping and cellphone tracking — not the old kind of handshake deals their elders used alongside shootouts to settle matters. 'There is a new generation of leaders of drugs and organized crime here, that has other strategies,' Ayala said. 'They see that the tactic of shootouts hasn’t worked for them, so they go for kidnapping.' 'They catch one person, and he has messages from the rival group,' said Ayala. 'So they go after him to squeeze more information, and that starts a chain of hunting, to catch the enemy.' The new tactics are reflected in the huge wave of armed carjackings in and around Culiacan. Cartel gunmen used to steal the SUVs and pickups they favor for use in cartel convoys; but now they focus on stealing smaller sedans. They use these to go undetected in their silent, deadly kidnappings. Often, the first a driver knows is when a passing car tosses out a spray of bent nails to puncture his tires. Vehicles pull up front and rear to cut him off. The driver is bundled into another car. All that is left for neighbors to find is a car with burst tires, the doors open, the engine running, in the middle of the street. The State Council on Public Safety, a civic group, estimates that in the past month there have been an average of six killings and seven disappearances or kidnappings in and around the city every day. The group said about 200 families have fled their homes in outlying communities because of the violence. Culiacan is no stranger to violence — shooting broke out across the city in October 2019 when soldiers mounted a failed attempt to arrest another of Chapo Guzmán’s sons, Ovidio. Fourteen people were killed that day. A few days later, civic activist Estefanía López arranged a peace march and 4,000 residents turned out for it. When she tried to do something similar this year, she could get only about 1,500 people to attend a similar demonstration. 'We got a lot of messages beforehand from a lot of people who said they wanted to join and march, to support the cause, but who were afraid to come,' López said. There’s reason to be afraid: Last week, gunmen burst into a Culiacan hospital to kill a patient previously wounded by gunshots. In a town north of Culiacan, drivers were astonished to see a military helicopter seeking to corral four gunmen in helmets and tactical vests just yards from a highway; the gunmen were shooting back at the chopper. The government’s response to all this has been to blame the United States for stirring up trouble by allowing the drug lords to turn themselves in, and to send in hundreds of army troops. But irregular urban combat in the heart of a city of 1 million inhabitants — against a cartel that has lots of .50-caliber sniper rifles and machine guns — is not the army’s specialty. Squads of soldiers went into a luxury apartment complex in the city’s center to detain a suspect and they wound up shooting to death a young lawyer who was merely a bystander. López, the peace activist, has been asking for soldiers and police to be posted outside schools, so children can return to classes — most are currently taking classes online because their parents judge it too dangerous to take them to school. But police can’t solve the problem: Culiacan’s entire municipal force has been temporarily disarmed by soldiers to check their guns, something that’s been done in the past when the army suspects policemen are working for drug cartels. The local army commander recently acknowledged that it's up to the cartel factions — not authorities — when the violence will stop. 'In Culiacan, there is not even faith anymore that we will be safe, with police or soldiers,' López said, noting that that has had a clear effect on daily life and the economy. 'A lot of businesses, restaurants and nightclubs have been closed for the past month.' Laura Guzmán, the leader of the local restaurant chamber, said about 180 businesses in Culiacan have closed, permanently or temporarily, since Sept. 9 and almost 2,000 jobs have been lost. Local businesses tried to organize evening 'tardeadas' — long afternoons — for residents who were afraid to go out after dark, but they didn’t draw enough customers. 'Young people are not interested in going out right now,' Guzmán said. For those looking to get away from the violence temporarily, the seaside resort of Mazatlan used to be only 2½ hours away by car. But that’s not an option since last month when cartel gunmen hijacked passenger buses, forced the tourists off and burned the vehicles to block the road to Mazatlan. That leaves just one option, and one only open to some. 'Those who have the economic resources get out of the city by airplane to take a break,' Guzmán said. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-sinaloa-cartel-battles-culiacan-b18bbd3abb4ba528444fef3598bdf05a	2024-10-15T19:03:59-07:00	
Zelenskyy to unveil 'victory plan' to Ukrainian lawmakers after presenting it to Western allies	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was set to at least partially unveil a plan to win the war against Russia to his country's Parliament on Wednesday after weeks of dropping hints about the blueprint to lukewarm Western allies, including U.S. President Joe Biden. The plan — comprising military, political, diplomatic and economic elements — is considered by many as Ukraine’s last resort to strengthen its hand in any future cease-fire negotiations with Russia. Thus far, however, no country has publicly endorsed it or commented on its feasibility. Zelenskyy is keen to get the 'victory plan' in place before a new U.S. president is sworn in next year, though Ukrainian officials say neither presidential candidate will necessarily improve Kyiv’s standing in the war. Zelenskyy’s presentation to Parliament, announced on Monday by presidential adviser Serhii Leshchenko, comes during a bleak moment in Ukraine. The country’s military is suffering losses along the eastern front as Russian forces inch closer to a strategically significant victory near the crucial logistics hub of Pokrovsk. At every turn, Kyiv is outnumbered by Moscow: The country is struggling to replenish ranks with an unpopular mobilization drive; its ammunition stocks are limited; and Russia’s superiority in the skies is wreaking havoc for Ukrainian defensive lines. It’s not clear how much of his victory plan Zelenskyy will reveal on Wednesday; Leshchenko indicated that it would be fully unveiled, while other officials suggested that the president would not divulge its most sensitive elements to all lawmakers. Either way, the plan essentially puts Kyiv’s future in the hands of its allies. Without it, any deal with Russia would almost certainly be unfavorable for Ukraine, which has lost a fifth of its territory and tens of thousands of lives in the conflict. Kyiv would be unlikely to ever recover occupied territory, or receive reparations for widespread destruction across the country. Several elements of the plan have already come to light: making Ukraine a member of NATO; allowing the country to use Western long-range weapons to strike deep inside Russia; providing resources to strengthen Ukraine's air and other defenses, and intensifying sanctions against Russia. Ukraine's surprise military incursion into Russia’s Kursk region in August was also part of the plan, Zelenskyy told reporters. He said the 1,000 square kilometers (386 square miles) of territory captured by Ukraine — along with other provisions of the plan — will likely serve as a bargaining chip in negotiations with Russia. NATO’s Article 5 states that an attack against one member is considered an attack against all. Ukraine's inclusion in the alliance would deter Russian President Vladimir Putin from invading again, Ukrainian officials argue. Western leaders have so far been reluctant to guarantee an invitation, fearing escalation from Putin. Ukrainian officials were expecting feedback from Western allies at a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group at Ramstein Air Base in Germany, during which defense leaders from 50-plus partner nations gather to coordinate weapons aid for the war. Scheduled for this past weekend, the summit was postponed after Biden canceled his attendance in response to Hurricane Milton in the U.S. Zelenskyy has since toured Western capitals to present other key allies an outline of his vision. But none so far have given any indication they will support the plan. Some expressed concerns over the tight deadline set by Zelenskyy, who gave allies just three months to adopt the blueprint’s main tenets in late September. Thus far, the U.S. has been Kyiv’s main backer during the two-and-a-half-year war. But Biden has balked at the request to use long-range weapons to strike specific targets inside Russia, fearing a possible escalation in the war. Meanwhile, an intensifying conflict in the Middle East between Israel and Hezbollah that risks embroiling Iran has diverted Washington’s attention. Many expect Democratic nominee and Vice President Kamala Harris to continue Biden’s policy and maintain the status quo. Under Biden, U.S. assistance to Kyiv, though substantial, has consistently arrived too late to make a significant difference for Ukrainian forces. Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump has only said that he’d end the war quickly, without saying how. Meanwhile, Brazil and China have proposed alternate peace plans that Zelenskyy has rejected, saying they would merely pause the war and give Moscow time to consolidate its battered army and defense industry. ___ Follow AP's coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-victory-plan-unveiled-zelenskyy-parliament-f3525550f6986f590777193a7385c0c5	2024-10-15T19:03:35-07:00

An inmate convicted of the 1994 killing of a Japanese psychic was found dead in a Hawaii prison cell	HONOLULU (AP) — A Hawaii inmate convicted of the 1994 murder of a Japanese psychic and her son was killed in prison, authorities said. Staff at the Halawa Correctional Facility in Honolulu found Raita Fukusaku, 59, bleeding on the floor of his cell with head and neck trauma early Monday, according to the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. 'It was determined that the victim had been assaulted and stabbed by his cellmate, a 38-year-old male,' Honolulu police said in a public information bulletin. The cellmate was immediately removed and placed in a holding unit, the corrections department said. Authorities were still investigating Tuesday. The Honolulu medical examiner's office had not yet released a cause of death. Fukusaku was the first Japanese national to be extradited to the United States and convicted of murder, Hawaii News Now reported. He was serving a prison sentence for two counts of second-degree murder. He was found guilty in 1995 of killing Kototome Fujita and her son Goro Fujita, according to KITV, which reported that Kototome Fujita was found shot in her penthouse and that her son was found dead in his car in a parking structure of a Waikiki hotel. The condo unit and Goro Fujita's car were set on fire. Myles Breiner, Fukusaku's former attorney, told KHON-TV he never had any problems in the 30 years he's been in prison. 'He wasn’t gang-related, he seemed to rise above all that. He got along with all the staff,' Breiner said. 'I’m not satisfied with the fact that this occurred. This should not have occurred.'	https://apnews.com/article/hawaii-inmate-murder-japan-psychic-2d58d6c2fbb8b2053138f4e79b04a235	2024-10-15T14:04:29-07:00	
Japan’s Toho acquires North American animation company GKIDS, Studio Ghibli's US steward	The Japanese entertainment giant Toho has reached an agreement to acquire the Oscar-winning animation outfit GKIDS, the companies said Tuesday. The deal gives Toho an established North American distributor and sales operation in GKIDS, which has become a force in animation since its founding in 2008. As producer and distributor of artist-driven animation, GKIDS has brought acclaimed films like 'Song of the Sea,' 'The Breadwinner' and 'Wolfwalkers' to North American audiences and operated as the domestic stewards of the Studio Ghibli catalog. After 13 best animated feature Oscar nominations, GKIDS won the award earlier this year for Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli’s 'The Boy and the Heron.' Toho, meanwhile, is home to internationally recognized brands, from Godzilla to popular anime franchises like 'My Hero Academia' and 'Jujutsu Kaisen.' The company is hoping to grow and expand outside of Japan and had already worked with GKIDS for years, on releases like 'Weathering With You' and 'Spirited Away: Live on Stage.' Toho president and CEO Hiro Matsuoka said in a statement that GKIDS’ unique position in the U.S. market, 'dovetails perfectly with Toho’s own strengths and strategic mission. This partnership accelerates Toho’s goals to prioritize animation, develop international markets, and support IP creation, while bringing exceptional Japanese and animated content to global audiences.' GKIDS founder Eric Beckman will remain CEO, and Dave Jesteadt will stay president. Both said that the company will continue to operate as they have, 'but now with the backing of a highly complementary and legendary parent company.' The financial terms were not disclosed.	https://apnews.com/article/toho-acquires-gkids-f9fdd050059e585560aaf647d78fac86	2024-10-15T12:14:04-07:00	
Trump says it would be a 'smart thing' if he spoke to Putin, though he won't confirm he has	CHICAGO (AP) — Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday refused to say whether he's spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin since leaving office, as reported in journalist Bob Woodward's latest book. But if the two did speak, Trump said, it would be 'a smart thing' for the United States. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, was pressed on his communication with the Russian president during a wide-ranging — and sometimes contentious — interview with Bloomberg editor-in-chief John Micklethwait at the Economic Club of Chicago. Woodward reports in his book 'War' that Trump has had as many as seven private phone calls with Putin since leaving the White House and secretly sent the Russian president COVID-19 test machines during the height of the pandemic. A Trump campaign spokesperson previously denied the report. During Tuesday's interview, Micklethwait posed the question to Trump directly: 'Can you say yes or no whether you have talked to Vladimir Putin since you stopped being president? 'I don’t comment on that,' Trump responded. 'But I will tell you that if I did, it’s a smart thing. If I’m friendly with people, if I can have a relationship with people, that’s a good thing and not a bad thing in terms of a country.' Trump said that Putin, who invaded neighboring Ukraine and who has been accused of war crimes by the International Criminal Court, is well respected in Russia and touted his relationship with him, as well as the authoritarian leaders of North Korea and China. 'Look, I had a very good relationship with President Xi and a very good relationship with Putin, and a very good relationship with Kim Jong Un,' he said. Of Putin, he later added, 'Russia has never had a president that they respect so much.' Woodward reported that Trump asked an aide to leave his office at his Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago, so that the former president could have a private call with Putin in early 2024. The aide, whom Woodward doesn’t name, said there have been multiple calls between Trump and Putin since Trump left office, perhaps as many as seven, according to the book, though it does not detail what they discussed. Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung called the reporting false. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the reporting about the calls was 'not true.' Trump’s relationship with Putin has been scrutinized since his 2016 campaign for president, when he memorably called on Russia to find and make public missing emails deleted by Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent. Trump publicly sided with Putin over U.S. intelligence officials on whether Russia had interfered in the 2016 election to help him, and Trump has criticized U.S. aid to Ukraine as it tries to fend off Russia's attack. Later in Tuesday's interview, Trump refused to say whether he would commit to a peaceful transfer of power should he lose the November election. He also claimed there was a peaceful transfer of power after the 2020 election, despite his supporters' violent attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. 'Come on. You had a peaceful transfer of power compared to Venezuela,' Micklethwait responded. ___ Peoples reported from New York.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-putin-call-bob-woodward-war-e5c800ac94df73dc599b0dc8be8a3fb0	2024-10-15T10:09:18-07:00	
Mexican president acknowledges army killings of 3 civilians in a violent border city	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico’s new president acknowledged Tuesday that three civilians including a child died in two shootouts involving the military last week in a violent border city. President Claudia Sheinbaum said a soldier was killed in one of the shootouts, as well as two adults and an 8-year-old girl. She said the events on Friday and Saturday are under investigation. But Sheinbaum gave no sign of backing away from the outsized role that she and her predecessor have given to the armed forces. The events in Nuevo Laredo, across the border from Laredo, Texas, started Friday when a nurse, her husband and son found themselves on a road where soldiers were pursuing suspects’ vehicles. The husband, Víctor Carrillo Martínez, told local media there was a confrontation and his wife died in the crossfire. Sheinbaum said the soldier was apparently killed in an exchange of gunfire. 'It had to do with criminals who opened fire on an army vehicle,' she said. 'It is very important to say that Nuevo Laredo is where criminal groups have carried out the most attacks on the army and the National Guard.' The city has long been in the grip of the Northeast Cartel, an offshoot of the old Zetas gang. The second incident in Nuevo Laredo happened Saturday, when the 8-year-old and her grandmother were driving to a store and were caught in the middle of a pursuit by soldiers or National Guard officers. The grandmother told reporters that a military vehicle was pursuing an SUV and her car got stuck between them and the military opened fire. The Human Rights Commission of Nuevo Laredo said a young man’s tortured body was found nearby in a truck that the army and National Guard had been pursuing. Sheinbaum confirmed the two deaths, saying the shootings had involved the militarized National Guard. 'In case there has been any misbehavior by any member of the guard or the army, or any official, it will be punished,' she said. The Defense Department, which controls the National Guard, said it had no immediate comment on the shootings. Last week, the army was involved in another shooting that killed six migrants and wounded 10. In the incident near Tapachula, close to the border with Guatemala. soldiers claimed they heard 'detonations' and opened fire on a truck carrying migrants from Egypt, Nepal, Cuba, India, Pakistan and El Salvador. The dead included an 11-year-old Egyptian girl. The area is often used by migrant smugglers, but warring drug cartels also operate in the region. Former president Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who left office Sept. 30, gave the military an unprecedentedly wide role in public life and law enforcement. He created the militarized Guard and used the combined forces as the country’s main law enforcement agencies, supplanting police. But critics say the military is not trained to do civilian law enforcement work. 'For decades, when the army and the marines have been used in law enforcement, complaints of human rights violations have skyrocketed,' said security analyst David Saucedo. 'The armed forces operate with an extermination logic ... that is one of the reasons that many of us oppose militarization.' Military analyst Juan Ibarrola denied there was a lack of discipline on the part of the army. 'This is not a lack of training. Remember, Mexican soldiers have been in the streets and on the highways for 30 years,' Ibarrola said. 'A soldier knows very well he will not escape justice, unlike some others in Mexico.' But both said it reflected the severity of attacks that soldiers deal with in some parts of Mexico. 'There is also a problem of increased criminal activity,' said Saucedo. 'The National Guard, the army and the marines have been outgunned.' 'That is why these soldiers are on the defensive, on alert, and they open fire against the slightest indication of an attack against them.' The head of the Nuevo Laredo rights committee, Raymundo Ramos, said the armed forces have been allowed to operate above any civilian authority. 'It appears nobody wants to touch the military in this country,' he said. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-border-nuevo-laredo-soldiers-civilians-killings-d8f454c1cbcd8f2a95a3901e44f206e2	2024-10-15T09:25:06-07:00	
Becky G says 'Encuentros,' her second album of regional Mexican music, is a celebration of culture	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Last year, Mexican American singer Becky G released her first album of regional Mexican music, 'Esquinas.' Her newest album, 'Encuentros,' makes it clear that this is not a temporary interest: She's dedicated to exploring the folk music in depth, and by adding modern fusions. 'Obviously, a lot of people can say ‘You do it because it’s trendy,’' Becky G said in Spanish during a video interview from Los Angeles before the last Friday release of the album. 'I think what I found in myself, when we were creating ‘Esquinas,’ was something so real to me, something so sincere, something so vulnerable as an artist, that I felt so obsessed with the process. And we didn’t want to stop.' She says her fans have told her that when she sings regional Mexican music, they notice her voice takes on a different tone. She says they can hear Rebbeca — her real name — and her true essence beyond the Becky G pop persona. The album starts with 'XLAS NUBES,' which translates to 'By the Clouds,' a song that stands out for its acoustic guitar arrangements. According to Becky G, it stemmed from the vision of a person falling through the clouds, as if in a dream. 'Every song has a thread that takes you on that adventure,' she said. 'We decided to mix instruments from other genres and a production style in my vocals that makes it feel a little more modern. And that, for me, was a lot of fun.' The album, produced by Adrián Pieragostino, features ranchera, mariachi and contemporary corridos fused with other genres such as bolero, cumbia and Colombian vallenato. 'When I was creating music in the other genres, if it was pop music, if it was reggaeton, we were always playing and mixing genres. So, I decided, ‘Why not do it with regional music?’' she said. Still, there are traditional moments on the album, like the accordion-fueled ranchera 'Desierto' ('Desert'), where she sings about wanting an ex to run out of water in the desert. Her siblings approved the song, she said, and told her she should include it in her concerts. 'It reminds me a lot of the music I listened to when I was a child. That’s the music that my grandmother listened to, that my mom listened to,' she said, describing the song as 'cortavena' ('cutting veins') music — spiteful songs that are a part of regional Mexican music's cathartic appeal. 'Todo' ('All') features Delilah, a rising artist. 'We wanted it to sound like when you’re singing near someone,' Becky G said. 'It’s a very big song, but very quiet. It’s a very difficult style to achieve, but I think we did it really well, because it feels so big, it feels like a Disney song. I’m obsessed with her voice, Delilah’s voice. I think our voices together is magic.' The concept of the album started with 'Mercedes,' featuring Oscar Maydon, where Becky G shines atop regional Mexican instrumentation. For her, it is a perfect song to listen to in the car, hence the Mercedes Benz-referencing title. Visually, Becky G said she wanted to make her music videos and album artwork appear narrative, reflecting her city, community and culture in Los Angeles. 'Anyone who sees this, if they live in London, anywhere in the world, they’re going to see it, and they’re going to understand who Becky G is,' she said. That also translates to the album cover, in which she appears posing under the sun, with LA in the background. She's already thinking about the concept and title of the next album — and won't rule out whether it will be called another word that begins with the letter 'E.' 'I don’t want to stop, this is what I love, it’s everything to me,' she said. 'And having these opportunities to continue learning from my art and representing our stories, expressing myself and finding myself as a woman is a very beautiful process.' Becky G is currently on tour in the U.S., performing 'Encuentros' songs live, as well as those from 'Esquinas' and her pop and reggaeton eras. 'I always say that my shows are how I like my tacos,' she said, 'with a little bit of everything.'	https://apnews.com/article/becky-g-encuentros-interview-cf7ac8ca422573eb53e6aae4b11adeec	2024-10-15T09:03:19-07:00	
$55 million plan to give Notre Dame area a green facelift is part of Paris-wide eco plan	PARIS (AP) — As Notre Dame gears up to reopen its doors in December, Paris is on the verge of a remarkable eco-revival, bringing nature back to the forefront of the City of Light. Beyond restoring the cathedral's iconic spire and medieval charm, the city announced plans Tuesday to revamp Notre Dame's surroundings — to a tune of 50 million euros ($55 million) — into a serene, green oasis. The project echoes a broader, post-Olympics eco-facelift that’s reshaping Paris from its historic monuments to its bustling avenues. Among the key elements of this broader transformation are the revitalization of historic spaces like the Champs-Elysees and Place de la Concorde, a redesign aimed at reducing traffic around the Arc de Triomphe, and green promenades connecting the French capital's landmarks. Here's a look at some of the eco plans for Paris in the coming years: Notre Dame Cathedral: a rebirth in green The reopening on Dec. 8 promises to be a historic moment for Paris, fulfilling President Emmanuel Macron’s vow made after the devastating 2019 fire for a five-year timeline. While the cathedral’s spire and oak-framed roof have been restored to their prefire glory, Paris City Hall's plans for the area around Notre Dame are bringing something new. The ambitious, future-facing project will create 1,800 square meters (around 20,000 square feet) of green space and plant 160 trees, according to a news conference at City Hall that featured speeches from Paris officials, including mayor Anne Hidalgo on Tuesday. Hidalgo stated that the redesign will integrate nature and the Seine more fully into the area. Hidalgo emphasized that this transformation aims 'to better highlight our beautiful cathedral and do it justice, while respecting its history.' The redesign includes transforming the underground parking area into a visitor space complete with services and amenities. Additionally, the Seine’s adjacent quays will be revitalized, offering a new promenade along the river. A belvedere will provide panoramic views of the Ile Saint-Louis and the Seine, further enhancing the visitor experience. The project will unfold in two phases, with the first, focusing on the parvis and surrounding streets, expected to be completed by the end of 2027. The second phase, which will include the renovation of Square Jean-XXIII and other nearby areas, is set to finish by 2030. Place de la Concorde: A transformation At the heart of Paris, the Place de la Concorde — home to the 3,300-year-old Luxor Obelisk — will undergo a significant overhaul between 2026 and 2027. Paris officials have enlisted the input of a dozen architectural experts to envision how to preserve its rich history, while aligning the plaza with the city’s modern green ambitions. Expect more greenery and less traffic as the revamp balances historical significance with a fresh eco-friendly design. Eiffel Tower dispute Not everything has been a picnic in Paris’s post-Olympics makeover. Two of France’s most high-profile female politicians — Hidalgo and Culture Minister Rachida Dati — are engaged in a fierce battle over the future of the Eiffel Tower, casting a shadow over the city’s plans for its famed monument. Hidalgo has proposed to keep the Olympic rings affixed to the Eiffel Tower beyond the Games, which ended in August. She argues that the rings symbolize the 'festive spirit' of the successful Paris Olympics and wants them to remain at least until the next Summer Games in Los Angeles in 2028. Critics, however, say Hidalgo is using the Eiffel Tower as a political billboard to boost her image before the 2026 mayoral election, in which she is expected to face off against Dati. Dati has been vocal in opposing the plan, arguing that the tower is a protected heritage site and can't be altered without proper consultation. She has accused Hidalgo of using the monument as a 'personal campaign poster,' while Hidalgo counters that the rings are a harmless tribute to Paris’ Olympic success. Dati has gone further, launching an ultimatum to push for the Eiffel Tower to be classified as a full historical monument — something Hidalgo has resisted. This would add extra layers of bureaucratic protection and control, potentially thwarting Hidalgo’s plans. Champs-Elysees: A greener avenue Paris’ Champs-Elysees, sometimes called 'the most beautiful avenue in the world,' is receiving a 30-million-euro facelift, beginning with the renovation of its sidewalks, tree bases, and gardens that began in preparation for the Olympics. With 150 proposals to 're-enchant the Champs-Elysees' over the coming years, this project aims to add even more green spaces and revive its historic charm, reinforcing its reputation as the world’s most beautiful avenue. Arc de Triomphe: reducing traffic Changes to the Arc de Triomphe’s bustling roundabout are designed to reduce traffic flow and calm the surrounding environment. Traffic lanes encircling the famous monument will be trimmed, while the central ring will be widened, allowing for a quieter, more accessible space. Leading from the Arc de Triomphe to the Bois de Boulogne, the Avenue de la Grande Armee is also getting the green treatment. Authorities plan to recreate a historic green promenade, transforming this major traffic artery into a lush, tree-lined boulevard that reconnects the avenue with the nearby forest, historically converted into a public park in the 19th century under Napoleon III. Louvre Museum to go eco-friendly Paris’ Louvre Museum, the world’s most visited, will undergo its own transformation under the 'Louvre 2030' project. Though specific details remain sparse, the project aims to address the growing influx of visitors, with a significant redesign of Place du Louvre planned to help manage the crowds and provide a more tranquil, green environment for visitors.	https://apnews.com/article/france-paris-notre-dame-green-ecology-2b1930e4630e48994a6bd758a747ebbc	2024-10-15T08:56:50-07:00	
Belarus adds 1 year to imprisoned opposition activist's sentence	TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — A court in Belarus on Tuesday sentenced an imprisoned opponent of hardline President Alexander Lukashenko to an additional year behind bars for disobeying prison officials. Palina Sharenda-Panasyuk was arrested in 2021 during the crackdown on opposition that began after nationwide demonstrations broke out to protest the results of the disputed 2020 election that gave Lukashenko a sixth term in office. Sharenda-Panasyuk initially was convicted of insulting the president and assaulting a police officer. Prior to Tuesday's verdict, her sentence had been extended by two years for disobeying prison guards. It was not immediately clear when she's now expected to be released. She has pancreatitis and chronic back pain and has reported harsh conditions in prison, with inmates sleeping on metal slabs without mattresses or bedding. 'The new sentence sounds like a death sentence, because Palina physically may not be able to withstand another circle of hell,' her husband, Andrei Sharenda, told The Associated Press. Representatives of European Union nations traveled to her trial in the town of Rechitsa. The German Embassy in a statement said 'the mother of two minor children, despite having already served a prison sentence, is forced to appear before the court again, which demonstrates the ruthlessness of the Belarusian regime toward dissidents.' Lukashenko has consistently suppressed opposition and independent news media since coming to power in 1994. The human rights organization Viasna counts nearly 1,300 political prisoners in Belarus, including its Nobel Peace Prize-winning founder Ales Bialiatski.	https://apnews.com/article/belarus-lukashenko-prisoner-crackdown-9e167cb384341d1a02c114e66fead0ab	2024-10-15T08:33:06-07:00	
US warns Israel to boost humanitarian aid into Gaza or risk losing weapons funding	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration has warned Israel that it must increase the amount of humanitarian aid it is allowing into Gaza within the next 30 days or it could risk losing access to U.S. weapons funding. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin warned their Israeli counterparts in a letter dated Sunday that the changes must occur. The letter, which restates U.S. policy toward humanitarian aid and arms transfers, was sent amid deteriorating conditions in northern Gaza and an Israeli airstrike on a hospital tent site in central Gaza that killed at least four people and burned others. A similar letter that Blinken sent to Israeli officials in April led to more humanitarian assistance getting to the Palestinian territory, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Tuesday. But that has not lasted. 'In fact, it’s fallen by over 50% from where it was at its peak,' Miller said. 'So the secretary, along with Secretary Austin, thought it was appropriate to make clear to the government of Israel that there are changes that they need to make again, to see that the level of assistance making it into Gaza comes back up from the very, very low levels that it is at today.' For Israel to continue qualifying for foreign military financing, the level of aid getting into Gaza must increase to at least 350 trucks a day, Israel must institute additional humanitarian pauses and provide increased security for humanitarian sites, Austin and Blinken said in their letter. They said Israel had 30 days to respond to the requirements. 'We are making clear to the government of Israel that there are these changes that need to be implemented, that we give them an appropriate period of time to implement it,' Miller said. An Israeli official confirmed a letter had been delivered but did not discuss the contents. That official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a diplomatic matter, confirmed the U.S. had raised 'humanitarian concerns' and was putting pressure on Israel to speed up the flow of aid into Gaza. The letter, which an Axios reporter posted a copy of online, was sent during a period of growing frustration in the administration that despite repeated and increasingly vocal requests to scale back offensive operations against Hamas, Israel’s bombardment has led to unnecessary civilian deaths and risks plunging the region into a much wider war. 'We are particularly concerned that recent actions by the Israeli government, including halting commercial imports, denying or impeding 90 percent of humanitarian movements' and other restrictions have kept aid from flowing, Blinken and Austin said. The Biden administration is increasing its calls for its ally and biggest recipient of U.S. military aid to ease the humanitarian crisis in Gaza while assuring that America's support for Israel is unwavering just before the U.S. presidential election in three weeks. Funding for Israel has long carried weight in U.S. politics, and Biden said this month that 'no administration has helped Israel more than I have.' Humanitarian aid groups fear that Israeli leaders may approve a plan to seal off humanitarian aid to northern Gaza in an attempt to starve out Hamas, which could trap hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who are unwilling or unable to leave their homes without food, water, medicine and fuel. U.N. humanitarian officials said last week that aid entering Gaza is at its lowest level in months. About 80 trucks carrying aid have entered through crossings in Gaza’s north since Oct. 1, down from roughly 60 trucks a day previously, according to the U.N. website tracking deliveries. COGAT, the Israeli body facilitating aid crossings into Gaza, denied that crossings to the north have been closed. U.S. officials said the letter was sent to remind Israel of both its obligations under international humanitarian law and of the Biden administration’s legal obligation to ensure that the delivery of American humanitarian assistance should not be hindered, diverted or held up by a recipient of U.S. military aid. Israel’s retaliatory offensive since the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks by Hamas has killed over 42,000 people in Gaza, according to the territory’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count. The Hamas attacks that launched the war killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and militants abducted another 250. The United States has spent a record of at least $17.9 billion on military aid to Israel since the war in Gaza began and led to escalating conflict around the Middle East, according to a report for Brown University’s Costs of War project. That aid has enabled Israel to purchase billions of dollars worth of munitions it has used in its operations against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. However, many of those strikes also have killed civilians in both areas. ___ AP reporter Josef Federman in Jerusalem contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-gaza-humanitarian-aid-blinken-austin-887ae388a022215f71309ab6def12103	2024-10-15T08:09:37-07:00	
UN says deadly Israeli strike in northern Lebanon should be investigated	AITO, Lebanon (AP) — An Israeli airstrike on an apartment building in northern Lebanon that killed at least 22 people needs to be independently investigated, the United Nations’ human rights office said Tuesday. 'We have real concerns with respect to … the laws of war,' Jeremy Laurence, a spokesperson for the U.N.'s human rights office in Geneva said a day after the strike, as rescue workers searching through the rubble found more bodies and remains. Laurence said the U.N. had received credible reports that a dozen women and children were among the dead. The Israeli military said it 'struck a target belonging to the Hezbollah terrorist organization' and that it would look into reports of civilian deaths. The apartment building hit in the airstrike was in the small village of Aito, in the country’s Christian heartland and far from Hezbollah’s main areas of influence in Lebanon's south and east. The strike was a shock to residents, and it exacerbated fears that Israel would expand its offensive deeper into Lebanon. 'I heard a loud noise, like a boom,' said Dany Alwan, who lives next door. 'We ran outside, I saw the dust and the smoke and the rubble. There was a body here, another one there. It was a really ugly and painful scene.' The three-story building had been rented out to the Hijazi family, which fled their home in the southern village of Aitaroun, according to Elie Alwan, Dany Alwan's brother and the building's owner. Some 1.2 million people have fled southern and eastern Lebanon, where the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah has been concentrated. As rescue workers rummaged through the debris on Tuesday, they found the body of a child, and later a small leg and other remains that they put together in a white bag. The Lebanese military watched as a bulldozer cleared heaps of twisted steel, destroyed olive trees, and crushed rocks. Over the past year, 2,350 people in Lebanon have been killed in Israeli airstrikes, according to the country's Health Ministry, which says roughly 25 percent have been women and children. Hezbollah's acting leader vows to step up strikes against Israel Earlier on Tuesday, the acting leader of Hezbollah said the militant group would fire rockets into more areas of Israel until it ceases its airstrikes and ends its ground invasion of Lebanon. Naim Kassem said Hezbollah is focused on 'hurting the enemy,' comments made in a pre-recorded televised speech delivered on the same day the United States said it sent a small team of troops to Israel to support an American-made missile-defense system. Hezbollah has fired thousands of rockets into Israel over the past year in support of Hamas' war with Israel in Gaza. Tens of thousands of northern Israelis have been displaced from their homes by those attacks — and Israel has said its war with Hezbollah is aimed at stopping those rockets so families can return home. On Tuesday, Kassem signaled that Hezbollah would ramp up attacks further south in Israel, which it has already done by targeting Tel Aviv and Haifa. Kassem has headed the militant group since Sept. 27, when its longtime leader, Hassan Nasrallah, was assassinated in an Israeli airstrike. Hezbollah began targeting Israel with rockets on Oct. 8, 2023, a day after the Hamas attack on Israel that left 1,200 dead and 250 as hostages in Gaza. Israel's ensuing war against Hamas has left more than 42,000 people dead in Gaza, according to local health officials. They do not differentiate between fighters and civilians, but have said a little more than half the dead are women and children. Hezbollah has insisted it will continue to target Israel until a cease-fire in Gaza is reached. 'We cannot separate Lebanon from Palestine, or Palestine from the world,' Kassem said. Also on Tuesday, Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder announced the arrival of U.S. troops in Israel on Monday. The team will operate a Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense battery there to defend against ballistic missile attacks from Iran, which backs both Hezbollah and Hamas, and has launched two missile attacks on Israel. 'Over the coming days, additional U.S. military personnel and THAAD battery components will continue to arrive in Israel,' Ryder said. Iran has warned U.S. troops would be in harm’s way if they launch another attack. In Lebanon, Israel's bombardment and ground invasion have displaced more than 400,000 children in the past three weeks, according to Ted Chaiban, deputy executive director at UNICEF, the U.N. children's agency.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-aito-war-hezbollah-7d497b9c3c5a7429b3ac1fd3560f89be	2024-10-15T07:46:20-07:00	
Countries that have cashed in on their top-level domain names	LONDON (AP) — Anguilla is raking in extra revenue from registration fees for its .ai web domain thanks to the artificial intelligence boom, but it's not the only place cashing in on demand for websites with distinctive address endings. Here's a look at some other places cashing in on their unique top-level domains: TUVALU Tuvalu is a string of coral atolls, scattered over hundreds of miles in the Pacific Ocean, located midway between Australia and Hawaii. It has one of the world's smallest economies and its low-lying islands are vulnerable to climate change, but it does have a very valuable resource: the .tv web domain. Royalties from .tv, which web users might assume is short for television, have been climbing, especially after videogame streaming platform Twitch licensed the web address twitch.tv. LIBYA The North African country, which has been plagued by turmoil since longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi's death in 2011, isn't readily associated with internet culture. But Libya controls web addresses that end in .ly, which have become widely used as a so-called domain hack for websites with English names that end in -ly. Well-known examples include bit.ly, used by the weblink shortening service Bitly, and parse.ly, the website for online analytics platform Parse.ly. MONTENEGRO This Balkan country became an independent nation after the breakup of Yugoslavia. It's one of Europe's smaller countries — about 620,000 people — bordered by the Adriatic Sea, Bosnia, Kosovo, Serbia and Albania. Montenegro was assigned the .me web domain, which has become popular with people who want to claim their pronoun for personal branding. Websites ending in .me are 'often used for personal websites, portfolios, blogs and online resumes or portfolios because ‘me’ can be seen as a way to personalize an online presence,' website builder Wix says. COLOMBIA Websites that end in .co aren't from a generic web domain for companies, like .com sites. The .co domain is assigned to Colombia, but the South American country allows anyone to sign up for its web addresses. Internet registrar GoDaddy says more than 2 million .co web domains have been claimed, including addresses claimed by Big Tech names like Amazon which uses it to redirect online shoppers to its .com home page. Google, meanwhile, informs visitors to g.co that the link is it's official shortcut.	https://apnews.com/article/countries-popular-top-level-domain-names-2a6044ed4082e866ccf675e79a57e6f4	2024-10-15T07:31:41-07:00	
Egypt's long-delayed mega-museum will open some of its main galleries, a trial run for full opening	CAIRO (AP) — The Grand Egyptian Museum will partially open its main galleries on Wednesday, including 12 halls that exhibit aspects of ancient Egypt, as part of a trial run, officials said Tuesday. The museum, a mega-project near the famed Giza Pyramids which has cost well over $1 billion so far, will open the halls for 4,000 visitors as a trial run until the official opening date, which is yet to be announced, according to Al-Tayeb Abbas, assistant to the minister of antiquities. The opening of the museum, which has been under construction for more than a decade, has been repeatedly delayed for various reasons, including the COVID-19 pandemic. More than 100,000 artifacts of Egypt’s ancient treasures will be displayed in the world’s largest archaeological museum, according to the Egyptian state information website. Abbas told the AP that the trial run starting Wednesday would help prepare for the full opening by providing a deeper understanding of issues related to operations such as identifying overcrowded areas across the museum. The displays across the 12 halls tap into issues related to society, religion, and doctrine in ancient Egypt, he added. All open-style halls have been classified by dynasty and historical order, and each will showcase at least 15,000 artifacts. Eras that will be exhibited in the main galleries include the Third Intermediate Period (about 1070-664 B.C.), Late Period (664-332 B.C.), Graeco-Roman Period (332 B.C.-395 A.D.), New Kingdom (1550-1070 B.C.), Middle Kingdom (2030-1650 B.C.), and Old Kingdom (2649-2130 B.C.). One of the halls displays statues of 'Elite of the King,' members of the royal family and high-ranking officials who worked in the army, priesthood, and the government. Parts of the site have already been open for limited tours since late 2022 to test visitors’ experience and the museum’s operational preparedness. Aude Porcedde, a Canadian tourist who visited several sections, told the AP she was amazed by the museum, adding that Egyptian civilization is important for her and for the world to know more about. 'There is a lot of history and a lot of things we are not aware of, especially coming from the other side of the world, and seeing everything here and learning from the locals has been great,' said Costa Rican tourist Jorge Licano. The grand staircase, six stories high and with a view of the pyramids, and the commercial area are open to the public, showcasing monuments and artifacts that include sarcophagi and statues. Other parts of the museum, including the King Tutankhamun treasure collection, are set to open at later dates. All halls are equipped with advanced technology and feature multimedia presentations to explain the lives of the ancient Egyptians, including its kings, according to Eissa Zidan, Director-General of the Preliminary Restoration and Antiquities Transfer at the museum. One of the halls will use virtual reality to explain the history of burial and its development throughout ancient Egypt. 'The museum is not only a place to display antiquities, but it also aims to attract children to learn about ancient Egyptian history ... The museum is a gift to all the world,' Zidan told the AP. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Associated Press journalist Fatma Khaled contributed to this report from Cairo.	https://apnews.com/article/egypt-grand-egyptian-museum-antiquities-giza-pyramids-be3938b7d6ce96b1aa03693c0440a0f1	2024-10-15T07:24:11-07:00	
Israel assures US it won't strike Iranian nuclear or oil sites, US officials say	WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration believes it has won assurances from Israel that it will not hit Iranian nuclear or oil sites as it looks to strike back following Iran's missile barrage earlier this month, two U.S. officials said Tuesday. The administration also believes that sending a U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery to Israel and roughly 100 soldiers to operate it has eased some of Israel’s concerns about possible Iranian retaliation and general security issues. The Pentagon on Sunday announced the THAAD deployment to help bolster Israel’s air defenses following Iran’s ballistic missile attacks on Israel in April and October, saying it was authorized at the direction of President Joe Biden. However, the U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private diplomatic discussions, cautioned that the assurance is not ironclad and that circumstances could change. The officials also noted that Israel’s track record on fulfilling assurances in the past is mixed and has often reflected domestic Israeli politics that have upended Washington’s expectations. The most recent example of that was last month when U.S. officials were told by their Israeli counterparts that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would welcome a U.S.- and French-led temporary cease-fire initiative for Lebanon only to see Israel launch a massive airstrike that killed Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah two days later. Netanyahu’s office said in a statement that '‏we listen to the opinions of the United States, but we will make our final decisions based on our national interests.' The Middle East has been bracing for an expected response from Israel after Iran launched roughly 180 ballistic missiles on Oct. 1, which the United States helped to fend off. The tit-for-tat strikes and uncertainty about whether Israel might strike strategically important energy and nuclear sites in Iran have raised fears about escalation into an all-out regional war. Israel’s offensive against Iranian-backed Hamas militants in Gaza has expanded into a ground invasion of Lebanon targeting Hezbollah, another Iranian proxy that has been firing into Israel since the conflict in Gaza started a year ago in solidarity with Hamas. Biden has said he would not support a retaliatory Israeli strike on sites related to Tehran’s nuclear program and urged Israel to consider alternatives to hitting Iran’s oil sector. Such a strike could affect the global oil market and boost pump prices just ahead of the U.S. presidential election. Biden and Netanyahu spoke by phone last week for the first time in seven weeks, while Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has been speaking regularly with his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant. The Pentagon said in a readout of a call from Sunday that the U.S. has reaffirmed its support for Israel’s security but urged it to ensure protections for U.N. peacekeepers in southern Lebanon, shift from military operations to a diplomatic solution and 'raised concern for the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza and stressed that steps must be taken soon to address it.' The White House National Security Council declined to confirm that Netanyahu offered Biden any assurances about targets. 'Our commitment to Israel’s defense is ironclad,' the White House National Security Council said in a statement. 'We will not discuss private diplomatic discussions and would refer you to the Israeli government to speak to their own potential military operations.' ___ AP reporter Julia Frankel contributed from Jerusalem.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-iran-oil-nuclear-sites-biden-f5dd702de7d990dd1d00f665e1484dee	2024-10-15T07:04:08-07:00	
Hereditary nobles have sat in Britain's Parliament for centuries. Their time may be up	LONDON (AP) — Like his ancestors for centuries, the Earl of Devon serves in Parliament, helping to make the laws of the land. But not for much longer. British lawmakers voted Tuesday to approve in principle a bill to strip hereditary aristocrats of the right to sit and vote in the House of Lords after more than 700 years. The Labour Party government says the decision will complete a long-stalled reform of Parliament’s upper chamber and remove an 'outdated and indefensible' relic of the past. 'In the 21st century, there should not be places in our Parliament, making our laws, reserved for those who are born into certain families,' Constitution Minister Nick Thomas-Symonds said Tuesday as he opened debate on the bill in the House of Commons. He noted that Britain is one of only two countries — the other is Lesotho — with a hereditary element to its parliament. But Lord Devon thinks it’s risky to tinker with the U.K.'s unwritten constitution, which 'has survived an awful lot of slings and arrows of misfortune over a thousand years.' 'The fact that I am doing a job that was granted by the Empress Matilda to my forebear in 1142, and is still ongoing and is still functioning, is a remarkable example of consistency and continuity,' said the earl, a 49-year-old lawyer whose given name is Charles Peregrine Courtenay. Britain’s Parliament has two chambers: the House of Commons, whose members are directly elected by voters in 650 constituencies across the U.K.; and the unelected Lords. For centuries it was made up of noblemen — women were not allowed until 1963 — whose voting rights were passed down to their children along with their titles. In the 1950s these were joined by 'life peers' — retired politicians, civic leaders and other notables appointed by the government. In 1999 the Labour government of then-Prime Minister Tony Blair evicted most of the more than 750 hereditary peers from the Lords, though to avoid an aristocrats’ rebellion, 92 were allowed to remain temporarily. A quarter-century on, 88 hereditaries are still there, an all-male group with an average age of almost 70. When one dies or retires, their fellow bluebloods hold elections to replace them. Courtenay joined the House of Lords in 2018 after winning an election in which there were 19 candidates and 31 eligible voters. Peers who sit in the ornate, gilded Lords chamber do not get a salary but can claim 361 pounds ($472) a day in expenses and can enjoy Parliament’s subsidized bars, tea rooms and restaurants. It’s a job for life, unless members choose to retire or — in a recent change — are expelled for non-attendance. The appointment of peers by successive governments means the Lords is overstuffed, with about 800 members — the second-largest legislative chamber in the world after China’s National People’s Congress. The opposition Scottish National Party has filed a motion to abolish the House of Lords altogether, though that stands little chance of passing. Labour remains committed eventually to replacing the Lords with 'an alternative second chamber that is more representative of the U.K.' While more Lords support the Conservatives than any other party — others, like Courtenay, are nonaligned — some on the left of British politics have come to value the upper house for its role in helping to moderate controversial plans by the previous Conservative government over Brexit and immigration. Labour's large House of Commons majority meant lawmakers overwhelmingly approved sending the bill on for further scrutiny after rejecting a Conservative attempt to block it. 'The checks and balances of the Lords — its tried and tested conventions — work,' said Conservative lawmaker Oliver Dowden, a former deputy prime minister. 'We should only fix what is broken and be cautious about rushing into change.' To become law, the bill also has to get through the House of Lords, which has the power to delay and amend legislation approved by the Commons, but ultimately can’t block it. It is likely to become law in the coming year. Courtenay, who owns Powderham Castle and its 3,500 acre (1,400 hectare) estate in the southwest England county of Devon, is sanguine about becoming the last in his storied family to sit in Parliament. 'We were responsible for crowning Henry VII. We fought alongside the Black Prince at the Battle of Crécy, and we financed the Agincourt campaign in 1415. And we were first cousins of Henry VIII until he chopped our head off,' he said. 'So we’ve been somewhat involved in the workings of government over a long, long time. 'And outside of those moments in the spotlight, there’s been an awful lot of plodding along, trying to support Devon and help the community … a long and satisfying service, which will continue.'	https://apnews.com/article/uk-lords-hereditary-aristocrats-eebad806ed864e2da361c94e9526822e	2024-10-15T04:41:49-07:00	
4 people die in a migrant boat accident off a Greek island	ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Four people, including two children, died Tuesday off the Greek island of Kos in an accident involving a migrant smuggling boat crossing from nearby Turkey, Greek authorities said. A coast guard statement said 27 people were rescued and nobody was listed as missing. It said that according to survivors, the accident occurred when the person steering the small boat made a clumsy maneuver just off Kos. Ten passengers fell into the water and two women and two children died, the coast guard said. The survivors were picked up by coast guard vessels. Greek authorities are bracing for a possible surge in migrant arrivals due to the ongoing fighting in Lebanon and Gaza. Earlier Tuesday, an official warned that wars in the Middle East and Africa, combined with the effects of climate change, will put Europe under continuous long-term pressure from immigration. Sofia Voultepsi, a deputy minister for migration, also said a landmark European Union migration pact earlier this year remained lacking in practical terms. 'We got the (agreement), but the basic piece is still missing: Returns,' Voultepsi said. 'We must have a common system for asylum, a common system for returns and a common system for integration.' The EU migration pact is due to take effect in mid-2026 following a new round of negotiations with the bloc's 27 member states expected to last about a year. Voultepsi also expressed alarm at the growing number of refugees in Lebanon because of ongoing Israeli airstrikes targeting the militant group Hezbollah. Greece is a major entry point for migrants into the EU, with most crossing from Turkey and Libya in unsafe boats. Earlier Tuesday, the coast guard said 81 migrants were rescued from a stranded vessel traveling from Turkey to Italy. The rescue was carried out Sunday with the assistance of two merchant vessels. The rescued migrants told Greek authorities they had paid $8,500 each for the trip. Elsewhere in Europe, an Italian navy ship was expected to dock at an Albanian port with a first group of 16 migrants intercepted in international waters. Their asylum applications will be processed in Albania instead of Italy under a five-year agreement between the two countries. In Poland, Prime Minister Donald Tusk plans to temporarily suspend the right to asylum. The new migration policy was presented at Cabinet meeting on Tuesday. ___ Follow AP’s coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/migration	https://apnews.com/article/greece-migration-european-union-policy-6e4dff2bb4e88a4c24d6dd056f7f6b22	2024-10-15T04:07:09-07:00	
How the tiny Caribbean island of Anguilla has turned the AI boom into a digital gold mine	The artificial intelligence boom has benefited chatbot makers, computer scientists and Nvidia investors. It's also providing an unusual windfall for Anguilla, a tiny island in the Caribbean. ChatGPT's debut nearly two years ago heralded the dawn of the AI age and kicked off a digital gold rush as companies scrambled to stake their own claims by acquiring websites that end in .ai. That's where Anguilla comes in. The British territory was allotted control of the .ai internet address in the 1990s. It was one of hundreds of obscure top-level domains assigned to individual countries and territories based on their names. While the domains are supposed to indicate a website has a link to a particular region or language, it's not always a requirement. Google uses google.ai to showcase its artificial intelligence services while Elon Musk uses x.ai as the homepage for his Grok AI chatbot. Startups like AI search engine Perplexity have also snapped up .ai web addresses, redirecting users from the .com version. Anguilla's earnings from web domain registration fees quadrupled last year to $32 million, fueled by the surging interest in AI. The income now accounts for about 20% of Anguilla's total government revenue. Before the AI boom, it hovered at around 5%. Anguilla’s government, which uses the gov.ai home page, collects a fee every time a .ai web address is renewed, Identity Digital Chief Strategy Officer Ram Mohan said the fee — $140 for two years — won’t change. It also gets paid when new addresses are registered and expired ones are sold off. Some sites have fetched tens of thousands of dollars. The money directly boosts the economy of Anguilla, which is just 35 square miles (91 square kilometers) and has a population of about 16,000. Blessed with coral reefs, clear waters and palm-fringed white sand beaches, the island is a haven for uber-wealthy tourists. Still, many residents are underprivileged and tourism has been battered by the pandemic and, before that, a powerful hurricane. Anguilla doesn't have its own AI industry though Premier Ellis Webster hopes that one day it will become an hub for the technology. He said it was just luck that it was Anguilla, and not nearby Antigua, that was assigned the .ai domain in 1995 because both places had those letters in their names. Webster said the money takes the pressure off government finances and helps fund key projects, but cautioned that 'we can’t rely on it solely.' 'You can’t predict how long this is going to last,' Webster said in an interview with the AP. 'And so I don’t want to have our economy and our country and all our programs just based on this. And then all of a sudden there’s a new fad comes up in the next year or two, and then we are left now having to make significant expenditure cuts, removing programs.' To help keep up with the explosive growth in domain registrations, Anguilla said Tuesday it's signing a deal with a U.S.-based domain management company, Identity Digital, to help manage the effort. They said the agreement will mean more revenue for the government while improving the resilience and security of the web addresses. Identity Digital, which also manages Australia's .au domain, expects to migrate all .ai domain services to its systems by the start of next year, Mohan said in an interview. A local software entrepreneur had previously helped Anguilla set up its registry system decades earlier. There are now more than 533,000 .ai web domains, an increase of more than 10-fold since 2018. The International Monetary Fund said in a May report that the earnings will help diversify the economy, 'thus making it more resilient to external shocks. Webster expects domain-related revenues to rise further, and could even double this year from last year's $32 million. He said the money will finance the airport's expansion, free medical care for senior citizens and completion of a vocational technology training center at Anguilla's high school. The income also provides 'budget support' for other projects the government is eyeing, such as a national development fund it could quickly tap for hurricane recovery efforts. The island normally relies on assistance from its administrative power, Britain, which comes with conditions, Webster said. Mohan said working with Identity Digital will also defend against cyber crooks trying to take advantage of the hype around artificial intelligence. He cited the example of Tokelau, an island in the Pacific Ocean, whose .tk addresses became notoriously associated with spam and phishing after outsourcing its registry services. 'We worry about bad actors taking something, sticking a .ai to it, and then making it sound like they are much bigger or much better than what they really are,' Mohan said, adding that the company's technology will quickly take down shady sites. Another benefit is .AI websites will no longer need to connect to the government’s digital infrastructure through a single internet cable to the island, which leaves them vulnerable to digital bottlenecks or physical disruptions. Now they’ll use the company’s servers distributed globally, which means it will be faster to access them because they’ll be closer to users. 'It goes from milliseconds to microseconds,' Mohan said.	https://apnews.com/article/anguilla-artificial-intelligence-ai-internet-29d4ca2bb740d0425ffb8355811a6976	2024-10-15T03:59:04-07:00	
Canada-India ties could take a long time to recover	NEW DELHI (AP) — A diplomatic row that has strained bilateral relations between India and Canada for over a year has boiled over as the countries expelled each other’s top diplomats over the killing of a Sikh activist in Canada and allegations of other crimes. Experts say the diplomatic standoff will make it difficult for both countries to move forward with a once-promising partnership, and could impact India’s ambitions as it tries to project itself as a rising world power. 'India-Canada bilateral relations, which have been on a downslide since last year, will take a further hit which will take a long time to repair,' said Praveen Donthi, senior analyst with the International Crisis Group. Monday’s tit-for-tat expulsions came after Canada told India on Sunday that its top diplomat in the country is a person of interest in the 2023 assassination of Sikh activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, and that police have uncovered evidence of an intensifying campaign against Canadian citizens by agents of the Indian government. Canadian Foreign Minister, Mélanie Joly also tied five other expelled Indian officials to Nijjar’s assassination and said Canada had gathered 'ample, clear and concrete evidence which identified six individuals as persons of interest in the Nijjar case.' India foreign ministry rejected the accusations as absurd, and said it was expelling Canada’s acting high commissioner and five other diplomats in response. New Delhi’s anxieties about Sikh separatist groups have long been a strain on its relationship with Canada, where some 2% of the population is Sikh. India has increasingly accused Justin Trudeau’s government of giving free rein to Sikh separatists from a once-strong movement to create an independent Sikh homeland known as Khalistan. Nijjar was a local leader of the Khalistan movement, which is banned in India. India designated him a terrorist in 2020, and at the time of his death was seeking his arrest for alleged involvement in an attack on a Hindu priest in India. Canadian police said Nijjar was shot as he was leaving the parking lot of the Sikh temple where he served as president in British Columbia on June 18, 2023. He suffered multiple gunshot wounds and died at the scene. India’s foreign ministry in its statement Monday ascribed Canada’s allegations to the 'political agenda of the Trudeau government.' The Canadian leader faces national elections next year. Michael Kugelman of the Wilson Center, an American think tank, said India's strong reaction is partly explained by how publicly Canada has made its accusations. 'New Delhi is extremely sensitive to any external criticism of its policies. And yet Canada isn’t only criticizing Indian policy. Its government, on the highest levels, is publicly voicing some of the most serious allegations that another government can make,' he said. Last year, in response to similar allegations made by Trudeau, India told Canada to remove 41 of its 62 diplomats in the country. Kugelman said the relationship is on 'life support right now' and India’s concerns about the Khalistan movement in Canada 'is essentially holding the relationship hostage.' Canada is not the only country that has accused Indian officials of plotting an association on foreign soil. Last year, U,S, prosecutors said an Indian government official directed a failed plot to assassinate another Sikh separatist leader in New York. The official was neither charged nor identified by name, but was described as a 'senior field officer' with responsibilities in security management and intelligence. New Delhi at the time expressed concern after the U.S. raised the issue and said India takes it seriously. On Monday, the U.S. State Department said in a statement that an Indian inquiry committee set up to investigate the plot would travel to Washington on Tuesday as part of its ongoing investigations. Canada’s foreign minister on Monday noted that India is cooperating with U.S. officials but said it had refused to cooperate in the Canadian investigation. Donthi said India’s diplomatic posturing against Canada was more aggressive because of the relatively low stakes. 'The U.S.-India relations also have a larger geopolitical framework and context, unlike India’s relations with Canada,' Donthi said, adding that India's strong reaction was also meant to deliver a message to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's supporters at home. 'Any public criticism is anathema to the Indian government, which is personified Modi. Such aggressive reaction is aimed at the international community and, more importantly, at Modi’s domestic constituency,' he said. Yet, experts say the standoff could have ramifications for Modi's global ambitions as he seeks to cast India as a rising global power and grows closer to the U.S., which like India is watching China’s growing assertiveness with concern. Donthi said the growing rift between India and Canada will also 'impact the growing strategic understanding between the U.S. and Western democracies' that are wooing New Delhi as a counterweight to Beijing. 'The Canadian allegations against India come against the grain, as New Delhi has been enjoying a favorable external environment,' Donthi said. 'This will throw a spanner in the works for India’s great power ambitions.'	https://apnews.com/article/india-canada-diplomats-expelled-sikh-assassination-42080eab5c86b861f44ed7bb3f33b4e7	2024-10-15T03:02:11-07:00	
Southern Africa is enduring its worst hunger crisis in decades due to El Niño, the UN says	CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — Months of drought in southern Africa triggered by the El Niño weather phenomenon have had a devastating impact on more than 27 million people and caused the region's worst hunger crisis in decades, the United Nations' food agency said Tuesday. The World Food Program warned it could become a 'full-scale human catastrophe.' Five countries — Lesotho, Malawi, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe — have declared national disasters over the drought and resultant hunger. The WFP estimates that about 21 million children in southern Africa are now malnourished as crops have failed. Tens of millions in the region rely on small-scale agriculture that is irrigated by rain for their food and to make money to buy provisions. Aid agencies warned of a potential disaster late last year as the naturally occurring El Niño led to below-average rainfall across the region, while its impact has been exacerbated by warming temperatures linked to climate change. 'This is the worst food crisis in decades,' WFP spokesperson Tomson Phiri said. 'October in southern Africa marks the start of the lean season, and each month is expected to be worse than the previous one until harvests next year in March and April. Crops have failed, livestock have perished and children are lucky to receive one meal per day.' The five countries that declared drought-related disasters have pleaded for international aid, while Angola on the west coast of Africa and Mozambique on the east coast are also 'severely affected,' Phiri said, showing the extent to which the drought has swept across the region. 'The situation is dire,' Phiri said. He said the WFP needs around $369 million to provide immediate help but has only received a fifth of that amid a shortfall in donations. The WFP has begun helping with food assistance and other critical support at the request of various governments in the region, he said. Phiri said southern Africa's crisis came at a time of 'soaring global needs,' with humanitarian aid also desperately required in Gaza, Sudan and elsewhere. Other aid agencies have said the drought in southern Africa is especially harsh, with the United States aid agency, USAID, saying in June it was the most severe drought in 100 years during the January to March agricultural season, wiping out swathes of crops and food for millions. El Niño, a weather phenomenon which warms parts of the central Pacific, has different impacts on weather in different parts of the world. The latest El Niño formed in the middle of last year and ended in June. It was blamed, along with human-caused climate change and overall ocean warmth, for a wild 12 months of heat waves and extreme weather. In southern Africa, food prices have risen sharply in many areas affected by the drought, increasing the hardship. The drought has also had other damaging effects. Zambia has lost much of its electricity and has been plunged into hours and sometimes days of blackouts because it relies heavily on hydroelectric power from the huge Kariba Dam. The water level of the dam is so low that it can hardly generate any power. Zimbabwe shares the dam and is also experiencing power outages. Authorities in Namibia and Zimbabwe have resorted to killing wildlife, including elephants, to provide meat for hungry people. Scientists say sub-Saharan Africa is one of the most vulnerable parts of the world to climate change because of a high dependency on rain-fed agriculture and natural resources. Millions of African livelihoods depend on the climate, while poor countries are unable to finance climate-resilience measures. ___ AP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa	https://apnews.com/article/drought-southern-africa-food-el-nino-hunger-6a2c8eb3db2e909f098db3a5ce71f6e4	2024-10-15T03:00:05-07:00	
Mexico is struggling to stamp out a homophobic soccer chant ahead of the World Cup	GUADALAJARA, México (AP) — Guadalajara is the capital of a Mexican state that is home to tequila and Mariachi music. It is also considered the birthplace of a less flattering tradition – a homophobic soccer chant that has cost Mexico hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines over the past two decades. It’s no wild guess that the chant, a one-word slur which literally means male prostitute in Spanish, will be heard from the crowd in Guadalajara’s Akron stadium when Mexico hosts the United States in a friendly on Tuesday. Multiple sanctions from FIFA and campaigns by Mexican soccer officials to educate fans have not been able to stamp it out. The chant persists in both club and national team soccer in Mexico, not least in games between the two North American rivals who will co-host the 2026 World Cup together with Canada. The last time the U.S. men’s team played Mexico, in the CONCACAF Nations League final in Texas in March, the referee stopped the game twice due to homophobic chanting by Mexico fans. Last year, a game in Las Vegas between the two sides was cut short for the same reason. In Guadalajara, a city with a strong soccer tradition which has two teams in Mexico’s top soccer league and another two in the second division, many local fans told The Associated Press that they considered the chant to be harmless and only meant to poke fun at opposing teams. 'Soccer is still a party, and the chant is just for fun. People who yell it mean no offense to the rival,' said Luis Gallardo, a 38-year-old who was wearing the Mexico national team’s black away shirt. 'It’s been going on for years and I don’t think it’s going to change.' The slur, typically used when the opposing goalkeeper takes a goal kick, is hardly the only offensive chant heard in soccer stadiums worldwide, but its persistent use at international tournaments has become a costly embarrassment for the Mexican soccer federation. The federation has been fined countless times by FIFA for 'discriminatory behavior' by supporters, including 100,000 Swiss francs ($114,000) for two incidents during the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Mexico has appealed those penalties. The Mexican soccer federation long argued that the chant wasn’t aimed at gays and that the word had different connotations in contemporary Mexican culture. However, in recent years the federation launched campaigns to make it go away, with stadium announcers urging the crowd to refrain from discriminatory chants and eliciting the help of soccer stars and other celebrities to get the message across. The federation in 2022 threatened fans shouting the slur at games with five-year stadium bans. At the time, then-federation president Yon de Luisa said regardless of the intention of those using the slur, what matters is how it’s received by others. 'If it is discriminatory, we should avoid it,' said De Luisa, who later resigned after Mexico’s poor performance in Qatar where the team was eliminated in the group stage. The origin of the chant is somewhat unclear, but it’s been traced back to a 2004 Olympic qualifier between Mexico and the U.S. in Guadalajara, the capital of the state of Jalisco. It then spread to stadiums across Mexico with fans of Guadalajara soccer club Atlas. Francisco Acuña, a 55-year-old Atlas fan, said the chant was a way for fans to express emotion during the game and shouldn’t be taken too seriously. 'The people who know soccer they know that the game is intense and even players get hot-headed on the field and then they hug each other at the end of the match,' he said. Alejandro Oliva, a 40-year-old soccer fan in downtown Guadalajara, said he didn't understand why some people find the chant offensive. 'It amazes me that outside of Mexico people believe that it’s a homophobic chant. In Mexico it’s normal and it does not offend anyone,' he said. 'I think that even people from the gay community use the word, and they don’t get aggravated.' Not everyone sees it that way. 'It’s clearly homophobic because you are degrading a person with an insult of sexual and negative connotation,' said Andoni Bello, an LGBTQ+ activist and outspoken critic of the chant who played for Mexico in amateur soccer tournaments organized by the International Gay and Lesbian Football Association. He said Mexico must get rid of the chant by the 2026 World Cup when the world’s eyes will be on the country. Mexico is set to host 13 World Cup games, including four in Guadalajara. Bello urged tournament organizers to reach out to the LGBTQ+ community for help in dealing with the issue. 'It’s not just taking their pictures and saying that they are against the homophobia in the stadiums,' he said. 'There is a real opportunity to educate the Mexican fan. In the World Cup in ’86 we were world famous because of the ‘Mexican wave.’ We exported a good celebration, let’s hope to eradicate the chant because being known for homophobia is very sad.' ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-usa-homophobic-chant-soccer-guadalajara-fifa-a811c077084b03beda10515fcd59f8ca	2024-10-15T01:44:53-07:00	
After 67 days adrift, a Russian man was rescued but his brother and nephew are dead	MOSCOW (AP) — A Russian man was rescued in the stormy Sea of Okhotsk after surviving for more than two months in a tiny inflatable boat that lost its engine, but his brother and nephew have died, officials said Tuesday. The prosecutor's office in the far east of Russia said that the man was rescued Monday by a fishing vessel off the Kamchatka Peninsula. It didn't name the survivor, but Russian news reports identified him as 46-year-old Mikhail Pichugin, who in early August set on a journey to watch whales in the Sea of Okhotsk together with his 49-year-old brother and 15-year-old nephew. Their bodies were reportedly found in the boat when the Angel fishing vessel rescued Pichugin. Media reports said the three men traveled to the Shantar Islands off the northwestern shore of the Sea of Okhotsk in early August. They went missing after setting off on their way back to Sakhalin Island on Aug. 9. A rescue effort was launched but failed to locate them. Russian media reported that the trio had a small food ration and about 20 liters (5.2 gallons) of water when their engine failed and they found themselves adrift. Pichugin weighed just about 50 kilograms (110 pounds) when he was found, having lost half of his body weight, news reports said. He didn't immediately say how he managed to survive in the Sea of Okhotsk, the coldest sea in East Asia and known for its gales, and how his brother and nephew died. When the crew of the fishing vessel spotted the tiny inflatable boat on their radar, they initially thought it was a buoy or a piece of junk, the Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper said, but they turned on the spotlight to make sure and were shocked to see Pichugin. A video released by the prosecutor's office showed an emaciated man in a life jacket desperately shouting 'come here!' and the crew working to pull him back to safety. 'I have no strength left,' Pichugin said as he was taken to safety. Prosecutors said that they launched an investigation into the incident on charges of violation of safety rules that resulted in deaths.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-boat-adrift-rescue-sea-okhotsk-kamchatka-71722cac69b3f5bddb2e9d17cb9ff965	2024-10-15T01:30:18-07:00	
Taliban-run media stops showing images of living beings in some Afghan provinces	ISLAMABAD (AP) — Taliban run-media have stopped showing images of living beings in some Afghan provinces to comply with morality laws, an official confirmed Tuesday. In August, the country’s Vice and Virtue Ministry published laws regulating aspects of everyday life like public transportation, shaving, the media and celebrations reflecting authorities' interpretation of Islamic law, or Sharia. Article 17 bans the publication of images of living beings, sparking concerns about the consequences for Afghan media and press freedom. A spokesman for the Vice and Virtue Ministry, Saif ul Islam Khyber, said government media in the provinces of Takhar, Maidan Wardak and Kandahar have been advised not to air or show images of anything with a soul — meaning people and animals. Khyber told The Associated Press a day earlier that the ministry was responsible for implementing the morality laws. He did not clarify if the rules affected all media, including foreign outlets, or only Afghan channels and websites. Nor did he say how the laws would be enforced or if there was a deadline for compliance. Hujjatullah Mujadidi, the director of the Afghan Independent Journalists Union, said that Vice and Virtue Ministry officials initially told state media to stop running pictures and videos of living beings. This request was later extended to all media in those provinces. 'Last night, independent local media (in some provinces) also stopped running these videos and images and are instead broadcasting nature videos,' Mujadidi said. No other Muslim-majority country imposes similar restrictions, including Iran and Saudi Arabia. During their previous rule in the late 1990s, the Taliban banned most television, radio and newspapers altogether.	https://apnews.com/article/afghanistan-taliban-media-morality-laws-images-baf2dd860fd9c16af765faa6ea9bf8d9	2024-10-15T00:28:43-07:00	
Violence-hit Pakistan locks down the capital for an Asian security meeting	ISLAMABAD (AP) — Shaken by multiple militant attacks, Pakistani authorities have locked down the capital in a major security move as senior officials from several nations arrive for an Asian security group meeting. A three-day holiday started Monday in normally bustling Islamabad and the nearby garrison city of Rawalpindi, and Pakistan has deployed troops and blocked key roads, making it difficult even for ambulances to pass through. Some doctors asked police to remove barricades so that they could go to hospitals, but were instead asked to take longer routes. The main event of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization will be held Wednesday, when leaders and officials discuss how to boost their security cooperation and economic ties. The group was founded in 2001 by China and Russia to counter Western alliances. Other members include Iran, India, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Militants in recent weeks have killed dozens of people in multiple attacks in restive northwestern and southwestern Pakistan bordering Afghanistan. Security experts say militants have limited capacity to strike in Islamabad. Pakistan often blames the outlawed Pakistani Taliban, who have sanctuaries in neighboring Afghanistan, for the violence. Afghanistan’s Taliban government says it does not allow anyone to use its soil for attacks against any country. Two Chinese engineers were killed on Oct. 6 in a suicide bombing outside the airport in Karachi, the capital of southern Sindh province. The attack was claimed by a separatist group. In the past, ordinary Pakistanis used to line up on both sides of the main roads to welcome any dignitaries visiting the country, but authorities said they had to take harsh security measures because of fears of militant attacks. Only state media will be allowed to cover the meetings. Among those attending were China’s Premier Li Qiang, Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, India’s External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, Iran’s First Vice President Mohammad Reza Aref and the prime ministers of Kyrgyzstan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Mongolia.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-shanghai-cooperation-organization-security-meeting-ded90b37a647a03271192d2aa33daf42	2024-10-14T22:16:07-07:00	
Middle East latest: Top leaders attend an Iranian Revolutionary Guard general's funeral	The funeral of an Iranian Revolutionary Guard general killed alongside Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah drew the largest crowd of top leaders in the paramilitary organization together Tuesday for the first time since Tehran launched a ballistic missile attack on Israel. Rumors circulated for weeks over the status of the head of the Guard's expeditionary arm, Gen. Esmail Qaani, but the Quds Force leader was seen in a black bomber jacket wiping away tears early Tuesday morning at the body repatriation at Tehran’s Mehrabad International Airport. Meanwhile, Israeli strikes in the southern Gaza Strip killed at least 15 people overnight, including six children and two women, Palestinian medical officials said Tuesday. In northern Gaza, where Israel has been waging an air and ground campaign in Jabaliya for more than a week, residents said families were still trapped in their homes and shelters. It’s been more than a year since Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel’s security fence and stormed in, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not say how many were fighters but say women and children make up more than half of the fatalities. The war has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced about 90% of its population of 2.3 million people. In solidarity with Hamas, Lebanese militant group Hezbollah has exchanged cross-border fire with Israel almost daily for the past year. Israel escalated its campaign against the group in recent weeks. ___ Here's the latest: Thousands vaccinated against polio in Gaza as the campaign enters a second phase GENEVA — The U.N. health agency says more than 92,000 children aged under 10 in central Gaza received doses of novel oral polio vaccine as a second phase of a vaccination campaign got underway. World Health Organization spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told reporters Tuesday that the kick-off a day earlier to the second round of polio vaccinations was part of efforts to reach over 179,000 kids in central Gaza – and over 590,000 across the entire strip. 'What we have received from colleagues is that the vaccination went without major issues yesterday,' he told reporters at a regular U.N. briefing in Geneva. He expressed hopes that a 'humanitarian pause' will be respected in north and south Gaza over the next six-to-eight days. Jasarevic said 92,821 children aged under 10 received the jabs on Monday, the first day of the new phase of the vaccination campaign. 'No one wants to see any child paralyzed (because of polio),' Jasarevic said. 'But there are so many other problems that people in Gaza are facing, and we need sustained access.' A police officer killed and 4 civilians wounded in a shooting in central Israel JERUSALEM — Israeli police say one officer was killed and four civilians were wounded in a shooting Tuesday on a highway in central Israel. Police did not immediately provide the identity of the shooter, but police spokeswoman, Mirit Ben Mayor, said that it was a militant attack. Police said the attacker approached the highway and shot the officer before firing on civilians, wounding four. The attacker was then shot by a paramedic arriving on the scene, Israel’s rescue services said, without saying whether the attacker was killed. The shooting occurred on a two-lane highway near the city of Yavne, just south of Tel Aviv. Ohad Yehezkeli, a spokesperson for nearby Assuta Hospital, said the officer died on the way there and another civilian was being treated for moderate injuries. He said two more wounded people were being transported to the hospital. Palestinians have carried out dozens of stabbing, shooting and car-ramming attacks against Israelis since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack triggered the war in Gaza. Israel has ramped up military operations in the occupied West Bank, killing more than 750 Palestinians. Most have been killed during gunbattles with the army or violent protests, but the dead also include civilian bystanders. Iran's general threatens Israelis at a funeral in Tehran DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — A general in Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard directly threatened the lives of Israelis during a funeral service in Tehran for a general slain alongside Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. The comment from Gen. Ali Fadavi, a deputy commander in chief of the Guard, comes as Iran awaits a threatened retaliation by Israel over its Oct. 1 ballistic missile attack. 'That land is a small land. It’s not even as big as one of Iran’s small provinces,' Fadavi said. 'If we will, we can obliterate all the Zionists.' Iranian officials routinely refer to Israelis as 'Zionists.' The Guard’s leadership attended a funeral service for Gen. Abbas Nilforushan, who was killed alongside Nasrallah in an airstrike in Beirut. Guard leaders and others in Iran’s theocracy have threatened to destroy Israel in the past during the more than four decades since the country’s 1979 Islamic Revolution. Israeli police accuse Hamas operatives in Turkey for August attack in Tel Aviv JERUSALEM — Israeli police accused Hamas operatives in Turkey of directing a militant attack in August in Tel Aviv in which an explosive went off on a busy street, killing the attacker and wounding a bystander. There was no immediate comment from Turkey. Relations between the two countries have plunged since the start of the war in Gaza. Turkey has long provided political support for Hamas, including welcoming its top leaders on visits, but denies involvement in its military activities. The bomb appeared to have gone off before it was planned to, and it was unclear if the attacker had planned to carry out a suicide bombing or plant the explosives. Both Hamas and the smaller Islamic Jihad militant group claimed the attack. Police said Tuesday that they filed indictments against eight suspects. They said the attacker was a militant from Nablus, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, who had been directed by an operative in Turkey. They said one of the attack planners had traveled to Turkey several times for explosives training, and that a raid in Nablus uncovered more bombs and funds transferred from Turkey. The police did not provide evidence. 'The findings of this investigation clearly indicate the establishment of Hamas headquarters in Turkey and their extensive efforts abroad to incite violence and carry out bombings in Israel,' the police statement said. First responders recover 11 bodies from a destroyed home in northern Gaza DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Palestinian first responders say they recovered 11 bodies, nearly all women and children, from a home destroyed in an airstrike in northern Gaza, where Israel has been waging an air and ground operation for over a week. The Gaza Health Ministry’s ambulance service said the dead recovered Tuesday were all from the same family and included seven women and three children. Fares Abu Hamza, head of the emergency service, said ambulances were only able to reach the area in the Jabaliya refugee camp around 12 hours after the airstrike late Monday. He said funeral prayers for the dead, which included a medic killed in Jabaliya, were held Tuesday in the courtyard of the Kamal Adwan Hospital. First responders from the Civil Defense said its teams evacuated three families Tuesday who were stuck inside their homes in Jabaliya for several days because of heavy fighting. Since the start of the war, the Israeli military has carried out several large operations in Jabaliya — a densely populated urban refugee camp dating back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation — only to return months later after saying militants had regrouped there. Israel launched a large operation there on Oct. 6. Top leaders are among those mourning an Iranian Revolutionary Guard general DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — The funeral of an Iranian Revolutionary Guard general killed alongside Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah drew the largest crowd of top leaders in the paramilitary organization together Tuesday for the first time since Tehran launched a ballistic missile attack on Israel. The Guard’s leadership hasn’t been as visible in the two weeks since Iran’s Oct. 1 attack on Israel. The Guard is the main power behind Iran’s theocracy and oversees its arsenal of ballistic missiles — which would be crucial in any future attack on Israel. At the funeral in Tehran for Gen. Abbas Nilforushan, the Guard’s chief commander, Gen. Hossein Salami, attended alongside President Masoud Pezeshkian and the head of the country’s judiciary. Other Guard generals also attended, including Gen. Esmail Qaani of the Guard’s expeditionary Quds Force, about whom rumors had circulated for days regarding his status after the strike that killed Nasrallah. At least two prominent Guard generals were not on hand: Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, the commander of Guard’s aerospace division that oversees its missile program, and Gen. Ali Reza Tangsiri, commander of the Guard’s navy, did not attend. Iran offered no explanation for their absence, though Israel has threatened to carry out a serious retaliatory strike against Iran. Israeli strikes on south Gaza kill at least 15 overnight DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Israeli strikes in the southern Gaza Strip killed at least 15 people overnight, including six children and two women, Palestinian medical officials said Tuesday. A strike early Tuesday hit a house in the southern town of Beni Suhaila, killing at least 10 people from one extended family, according to Nasser Hospital in nearby Khan Younis. The dead include three children and one woman, according to hospital records. An Associated Press camera operator at the hospital counted the bodies. In the nearby town of Fakhari, a strike hit a house early Tuesday, killing five people, including three children and a woman, according to the European Hospital, where the casualties were taken. The Israeli military rarely comments on individual strikes. It says it tries to avoid harming civilians and blames their deaths on Hamas, accusing the militants of sheltering in civilian areas. Israeli bombardment around Jabaliya leaves family trapped DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — In northern Gaza, where Israel has been waging an air and ground campaign in Jabaliya for more than a week, residents said families were still trapped in their homes and shelters Tuesday. Adel al-Deqes said his relatives tried to move to another place in Jabaliya in the morning, but the military shelled them. 'We don’t know who died and who is still alive,' he said. Ahmed Awda, another Jabaliya resident, said they heard 'constant bombing and gunfire' overnight and Tuesday morning. He said the military destroyed many buildings in the eastern and northern parts of the camp, which dates back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation. 'They bombed many buildings; some of them empty buildings,' he said. Iranian paramilitary leader whose status was in question is shown on state TV DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — The head of the expeditionary arm of Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard has appeared in television footage aired Tuesday by Iranian state television. Rumors circulated for weeks over Gen. Esmail Qaani’s status in the time since an Israeli airstrike that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut in late September. But Qaani, the head of the Quds Force, was seen in a black bomber jacket, wiping away tears at an event early Tuesday morning at Tehran’s Mehrabad International Airport. While Iranian state television did not acknowledge the rumors, it made a point to film Qaani for over a minute and later share the footage from the airport ceremony online. Qaani was on hand for the repatriation to Iran of the body of Revolutionary Guard Gen. Abbas Nilforushan, 58, who was killed in the airstrike. Australia puts sanctions and travel bans on 5 Iranians WELLINGTON, New Zealand — Australia’s government has imposed targeted financial sanctions and travel bans on five Iranians contributing to the country’s missile defense program, Foreign Minister Penny Wong said Tuesday. Iran’s launch of at least 180 ballistic missiles against Israel on Oct. 1 was 'a dangerous escalation that increased the risk of a wider regional war,' Wong said in a statement. The fresh sanctions target two directors and a senior official in Iran’s Aerospace Industries Organization, the director of the Shahid Bagheri Industrial Group, and the commercial director of the Shahid Hemmat Industrial Group. The decision brings to 200 the number of Iran-linked individuals and entities now sanctioned by Australia. 'Australia will continue to hold Iran to account for its reckless and destabilizing actions,' Wong said.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-hezbollah-mideast-latest-15-october-2024-05d950e5e8f20e154aef36cab210c054	2024-10-14T21:25:02-07:00	
How did a killing at a Sikh temple lead to Canada and India expelling each other's diplomats?	NEW DELHI (AP) — Relations between India and Canada are at a low point as the countries expelled each other's top diplomats over an ongoing dispute about the killing of a Sikh activist in Canada. Canada said it had identified India’s top diplomat in the country as a person of interest in an assassination plot and expelled him and five other diplomats Monday. India has rejected the accusations as absurd, and its foreign ministry said it was expelling Canada’s acting high commissioner and five other diplomats in response. It’s the latest in an escalating dispute over the June 2023 killing of Sikh activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. What is the dispute about? Nijjar was fatally shot in his pickup truck in June 2023 after he left the Sikh temple he led in the city of Surrey, British Columbia. An Indian-born citizen of Canada, he owned a plumbing business and was a leader in a movement to create an independent Sikh homeland, which is banned in India. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in September 2023 there were credible allegations that India’s government had links to the killing. India denied the allegations at the time but said Nijjar was involved in 'terrorism.' How did relations get to this point? Canada expelled an Indian diplomat over the dispute last year, and in response India expelled a Canadian diplomat and froze consular services for Canadians for nearly two months. Tensions boiled over again in May, when Canadian police said they had arrested three Indian nationals accused of involvement in Nijjar’s killing and were 'investigating if there are any ties to the government of India.' India rejected the allegations, saying Canada had a 'political compulsion' to blame India. What changed on Monday? Now, Canada says that India's top diplomat in the country is a person of interest in the killing, and that police have uncovered evidence of an intensifying campaign against Canadian citizens by agents of the Indian government. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said it had found evidence of the involvement of Indian agents 'in serious criminal activity in Canada,' including links 'to homicides and violent acts' and interference in Canada's democratic processes, among other things. Meanwhile, Canada’s foreign minister, Mélanie Joly, tied the Indian officials to Nijjar's assassination and said Canada had gathered 'ample, clear and concrete evidence which identified six individuals as persons of interest in the Nijjar case.' She said India had been asked to waive diplomatic immunity and cooperate in the investigation but refused. In a statement Monday, India’s foreign ministry said that the Canadian government 'has not shared a shred of evidence' with the Indian government, 'despite many requests from our side.' The ministry also called the accusations part of 'a deliberate strategy of smearing India for political gains.' Who was Nijjar? Nijjar was a local leader in what remains of a once-strong movement to create an independent Sikh homeland known as Khalistan. The Khalistan movement is banned in India, but has support among the Sikh diaspora, particularly in Canada. India designated Nijjar a terrorist in 2020, and at the time of his death was seeking his arrest for alleged involvement in an attack on a Hindu priest in India. New Delhi’s anxieties about Sikh separatist groups in Canada have long been a strain on the relationship, but the two countries have maintained strong defense and trade ties, and share strategic concerns over China’s global ambitions. However, India has increasingly accused Canada of giving free rein to Sikh separatists. Sikhs make up nearly 2% of Canada's population, and more than a dozen are members of the country's parliament.	https://apnews.com/article/india-canada-diplomats-expelled-sikh-assassination-67c6ee375f883a81b501cdf2c5bc2b8c	2024-10-14T20:30:34-07:00	
Stock market today: Asian shares are mostly higher after Wall St powers to more records	BANGKOK (AP) — Asian shares advanced on Tuesday after Wall Street rolled to more records, though markets in China were mostly lower. U.S. futures edged higher while oil prices shed more than $2 a barrel. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index gained 1.3% to 40,125.60, while the Kospi in Seoul gained 0.2% to 2,627.92. In Australia, the S&amp;P/ASX 200 was up 0.8% to 8,321.40. Chinese shares extended losses after the government reported late Monday that growth in exports fell sharply in September, adding to signs of weakness in the economy. The Shanghai Composite index lost 0.5% to 3,267.13 while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong gave up 1.3% to 20,810.11. 'Market participants continue to seek for clarity around fiscal stimulus support from Chinese authorities, but the lack of commitment remains a source of reservation for risk-taking in Chinese equities,' Yeap Jun Rong of IG said in a commentary. Also early Tuesday, the dollar fell to 149.70 Japanese yen from 149.83 yen. The euro slipped to $1.0895 from $1.0911. U.S. benchmark crude dropped $2.25 to $71.58 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, skidded $2.33 to $75.13 per barrel. On Monday, Wall Street rolled to more all-time highs. The S&amp;P 500 climbed 0.8% to build on its record set on Friday, closing at 5,859.85. It’s coming off its fifth straight winning week and is on track for its longest weekly winning streak of the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5% to 43,065.22, adding 201 points to its own record. The Nasdaq composite gained 0.9% to 18,502.69. The gains followed relatively quiet trading in Europe, while the U.S. bond market remained closed for the day because of a holiday. Besides oil, prices also fell for copper and other commodities that a healthy Chinese economy would devour. That helped drive down prices for miners, such as Freeport-McMoRan, which fell 2.3% for one of the larger losses in the S&amp;P 500. Boeing lost 1.3% in its first trading since the aerospace giant warned that it expects to report that it burned through $1.3 billion in cash during the latest quarter and lost $9.97 per share. Boeing also said it was laying off 10% of its workforce as it tries to deal with a labor strike that is crippling production of the company’s best-selling airline planes. This week will have few top-tier economic reports outside of an update Thursday on sales at U.S. retailers. That leaves the emphasis on corporate earnings reports, which will pick up the pace this week after big banks began the reporting season last week. Bank of America, Johnson &amp; Johnson and UnitedHealth Group will all report their latest results on Tuesday. Later in the week will come United Airlines, Netflix, American Express and Procter &amp; Gamble. Analysts are looking for S&amp;P 500 companies to deliver overall growth of 4.1% in earnings per share for the latest quarter from a year earlier, according to FactSet. If they’re correct, it would be a fifth straight quarter of growth. Stocks have broadly rallied to records on relief that interest rates are finally heading back down, now that the Federal Reserve has widened its focus to include keeping the economy humming instead of just fighting high inflation. Recent reports showing the U.S. economy remains stronger than expected have also raised optimism that the Fed can pull off a perfect landing where it gets inflation down to 2% without causing a recession that many had thought would be necessary. ___ AP Business Writer Stan Choe in New York contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-rates-china-earnings-9603ee04b6690dc4e80c22f02f298159	2024-10-14T20:08:54-07:00	
A Hong Kong zoo seeks answers after 9 monkeys die in 2 days	HONG KONG (AP) — Hong Kong's oldest zoo is seeking answers in a monkey medical mystery after nine animals died in two days, including three members of a critically endangered species. Part of the Hong Kong Zoological and Botanical Gardens has been sealed off and disinfected, and experts have been called in to conduct necropsies and toxicological tests, Hong Kong leader John Lee said in his weekly press briefing Tuesday. Eight monkeys were found dead on Sunday, and another died Monday after unusual behavior. The deceased animals included a De Brazza’s monkey, a common squirrel monkey, four white-faced sakis and three cotton-top tamarins — a species listed as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. 'Whenever we have any news, if there’s a new development, an announcement should be made as soon as possible, so that everyone can know about the facts,' Lee said. On Monday, the government held an urgent interdepartmental meeting about the deaths. It said in a statement that another De Brazza’s monkey’s behavior and appetite were found to be unusual, requiring further observation. But all 80 other animals in the gardens were in normal condition, it added. The Hong Kong Zoological and Botanical Gardens — the oldest park in the former British colony — fully opened to the public in 1871. It is a rare urban oasis in the downtown Central district of the financial hub which returned to Chinese rule in 1997.	https://apnews.com/article/hong-kong-nine-monkeys-died-zoo-endangered-57cb32f0ab09bb5537385f9c6bb145ab	2024-10-14T19:44:06-07:00	
Campaigning begins for Japan's parliamentary election	TOKYO (AP) — Official campaigning for Japan's Oct. 27 parliamentary election began Tuesday with new Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba seeking a mandate for his policies and for reforms after the governing party’s political funds scandal. More than 1,300 candidates were expected to enter the races for the 465-seat Lower House before registration closes later Tuesday. Ishiba called the snap election after he took office as prime minister on Oct. 1. As customary for Liberal Democratic Party leaders over the past decade, he was to start his campaign in Fukushima to renew his pledge to support the area’s recovery from the 2011 nuclear disaster. With the early election, Ishiba is seeking to secure a majority in the lower house, the more powerful of Japan's two parliamentary chambers, before the congratulatory mood fades. The move has been criticized as prioritizing an election rather than policies and for allowing little debate. A majority for the ruling coalition would be 233 seats between his LDP and its junior coalition partner Komeito. Prior to the dissolution, the coalition held 288 seats, including 256 by LDP. The main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, which briefly ruled Japan from 2009-2012, sees the public anger over the LDP funds scandal as a rare chance to gain ground by appealing to conservative swing voters. The liberal-leaning CDPJ is making a conservative shift and now has a centrist leader Yoshihiko Noda, also a former prime minister. 'A leadership change is the biggest political reform,' Noda said. Political watchers say Japan’s opposition has remained too fractured to push the governing party out of power, which it has held almost without interruption in postwar times. While support ratings in Kyodo News survey for Ishiba’s new government already dipped from above 50% to 42% just over a week from taking office, LDP was still by far a voter favorite among all political parties. ___ Follow AP's Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific	https://apnews.com/article/japan-election-campaign-ishiba-1d98dfc9af7e455ee4c15a0d3ac6f72d	2024-10-14T18:55:40-07:00	
North Korea blows up parts of inter-Korean roads as tensions with South Korea soar	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea said North Korea blew up the northern parts of inter-Korean roads no longer in use on Tuesday, as the rivals are locked in rising animosities over North Korea’s claim that South Korea flew drones over its capital, Pyongyang. South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a brief statement that North Korea blew up parts of the roads on Tuesday. It said South Korea’s military is bolstering its readiness and surveillance posture but gave no further details. The explosions came a day after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called a meeting with his top military and security officials. During the meeting, Kim described the alleged South Korean drone flights as the 'enemy’s serious provocation' and laid out unspecified tasks related to 'immediate military action' and the operation of his 'war deterrent' for defending the country’s sovereignty, the North's state media reported earlier Tuesday. North Korea earlier put frontline artillery and other army units on standby to launch strikes on South Korea, if drones from South Korea are found over North Korea again. South Korea has refused to confirm whether it sent drones but warned it would sternly punish North Korea if the safety of its citizens is threatened. Destroying the roads would be in line with leader Kim Jong Un’s push to cut off ties with South Korea, formally cement it as his country’s principal enemy and abandon the North’s decades-long objective to seek a peaceful Korean unification. During the previous era of inter-Korean detente in the 2000s, the two Koreas reconnected two road routes and two rail tracks across their heavily fortified border. But their operations later were suspended one by one as the Koreas wrangled over North Korea’s nuclear program and other issues. Last week, North Korea said it would permanently block its border with South Korea and build front-line defense structures to cope with 'confrontational hysteria' by South Korean and U.S. forces. South Korean officials said North Korea had already been adding anti-tank barriers and laying mines along the border since earlier this year. They said North Korea has also planted mines and removed lamps along its sections of the inter-Korean roads and taken out ties on the northern side of the railways. ___ Follow AP's Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-roads-destroys-drones-south-0672f5baf033cf0c4ecb2f1e1b958a41	2024-10-14T18:28:22-07:00	
Who am I? A South Korean adoptee finds answers about the past — just not the ones she wants	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Rebecca Kimmel sat in a small room, stunned and speechless, staring at the baby photo she had just unearthed from her adoption file. It was a black-and-white shot of an infant, possibly taken at an orphanage in Gwangju, the South Korean city where Kimmel had heard all her life that she’d been abandoned. But something about the photo — the eyes, the ears, an uneasy feeling deep in her gut — confirmed what she’d long suspected: This baby was not her. Overcome, she started howling like a strange, wounded animal. This photo meant that the stories she had been told about herself were a lie. So who was she? Who IS she? Thousands of South Korean adoptees are looking to satisfy a raw, compelling urge that much of the world takes for granted: the search for identity. Like many of them, Kimmel has stumbled into a web of switched photos, made-up stories and false documents, all designed to erase the very identity she desperately wants to find. These adoptees live with the consequences of a tacit partnership by the South Korean government, Western nations and adoption agencies that has supplied some 200,000 children to parents overseas, despite warnings of widespread fraud. For decades, South Korea tried to get rid of children from biracial parents, poor families, orphanages and unwed mothers, ignoring illicit practices. Western families in turn were eager to adopt from abroad, after access to birth control and abortion crushed the supply of domestic babies. While many adoptions ended happily, the desires of both sides also resulted in the unnecessary removal of generations of children from their families based on fake paperwork. As Kimmel sat weeping in that room in the Seoul adoption agency, she knew little of this background. All she knew was that she needed answers. She would find them — just not the ones she wanted. ___ Kimmel, an artist, thinks she is about 49; her exact age is one of the many things about herself she does not know. She throws herself with intensity into almost everything she does, particularly her all-consuming quest for her roots. It wasn’t always that way. Kimmel spent much of her childhood in what many adoptees call 'the fog' — a time of happy ignorance when they are oblivious to questions about their adoption. Her parents told her the origin story they’d gotten from the adoption agency: She had been abandoned as an infant on a street in Gwangju and sent to an orphanage by police. A slip of paper on her clothing listed her birth date as the day before: Aug. 4, 1975. There was no information about her biological mother or father. Her birth name was either Chung Jo Hee or Chung So Hee — the writing on the original paperwork was unclear. She was adopted six months later by a family on the U.S. East Coast. Each Jan. 21, her parents would celebrate 'Arrival Day,' a sort of second birthday that she saw as slightly embarrassing but sweet. They would display her documents and baby pictures. But a small detail nagged at her: One photo that her parents showed from South Korea didn’t look much like those of her in the United States. When she asked why, her parents just told her that babies change. 'I think my parents were just happy to have got a child,' she says, describing them as an idealistic couple who couldn’t have comprehended the deeper problems surrounding adoptions from South Korea. In 1986, the family traveled to South Korea, where adoption workers told them to visit a different orphanage than the one they’d thought Kimmel was from. It was called Namkwang, in Busan. They found no record of Kimmel. Kimmel didn’t think much of it. Back in Maryland, she was living a suburban American childhood of Michael Jackson and Madonna and malls. She went to college, moved to Los Angeles, taught and ran an art school. But a sense of loneliness crept in and became increasingly harder to ignore. Every now and then, the thought occurred to her: Was she just a girl from Maryland? Was that all? 'It didn’t seem very exciting,' she says. 'It just seemed kind of like a blank slate.' Kimmel marks 2017 as the year when the fog began to clear. One day, while searching the web for Korean makeup tutorials, she Googled 'Korean adoptions,' and fell into a whole new world. In 2017, she went to a three-day event in San Francisco with hundreds of Korean adoptees. The new ideas and friendships prompted a deep sense of urgency. She realized she was running out of time. If she was 42, how old would a birth parent be? How late was too late to find your roots? ___ The Korean adoptee diaspora is thought to be the largest in the world, with thousands returning to South Korea in recent years to look for their birth families. Fewer than a fifth of those who asked the South Korean government for help with their search were successful, records show. A big problem is that documents were often left vague or outright falsified to make children look 'abandoned' even when they had known parents. In 2018, Kimmel shut down her art classes and made a trip to South Korea that so many had done before her. She was brimming with excitement. The clinic where Kimmel was supposedly dropped off was closed, but a former doctor who had worked there recalled an orphan who had been found in front of it. 'Oh God, this is me,' Kimmel thought, tears welling in her eyes. But it was the first of many false starts. Unlike Kimmel, that orphan had been looked after by a grandmother for a while. Kimmel next visited Korea Social Service in Seoul, her adoption agency. There, she argued heatedly with a social worker who had started working at KSS in 1976, the year of her adoption. Could she get a copy of her file? No. Could she photograph her file? No. Could the social worker photograph or photocopy her file for Kimmel? No. Kimmel realized the agency did not see her identity as hers. 'Never in my life have I been more angry,' she says. 'There’s always this typical argument between adoptee and a social worker in Korea where the adoptee says, ‘That’s my information.’ And the social worker says, ‘That’s our information. It doesn’t belong to you.’' Kimmel fought until she was allowed to see her file. In the very back, she discovered a small square paper envelope with a photograph. It was similar to the one she had questioned with her parents, but shot from a different angle. And this photo made it clear: The girl was not her. 'I’d opened this Pandora’s box,' she says. 'And I didn’t feel like I could close it.' She joined multiple online forums where adoptees shared stories about their lives, their birth searches, their grievances. She posted photos of the girl in her adoption file and of herself when she first arrived in the United States, asking if they looked like the same person. Some said no. Others, including parents of adoptees, reacted as Kimmel’s parents had, saying 'babies change.' A new hunch began to emerge: Had KSS switched her identity with another girl? It had happened before. During a stay in Europe, Kimmel had been startled to meet several adoptees in Denmark who at the last minute were given the paperwork of other children. Kimmel had her adoption photos cross-checked by a dysmorphologist, a medical expert trained to identify birth defects in children, mainly from facial features. He saw distinctive differences in the ears and the area between the nose and upper lip. His conclusion: These were likely different girls. 'At that point I realized, oh my God, I went through all of this trial and trepidation to photograph a file that’s not really mine,' Kimmel says. 'It has my adoptive parents’ names; it’s a file that’s related to me. But the actual physical child is not me; the identity is not mine.' So who was Kimmel? And who was the other girl? ___ In 2019, she returned to KSS in South Korea. This time, the same social worker allowed Kimmel to search the agency’s file room herself. In the paperwork for 1976, Kimmel found what she believed was her 'real file,' with five identical black-and-white photos of a girl and a slide negative. She was struck by the similarities to early photos of herself in the United States. 'I felt like I was looking into my own soul,' she says. At last, a breakthrough. Yet the details were perplexing. The documents said the girl had serious leg deformities that made her unable to sit. But the medical notes written just days earlier described a healthy girl with nothing more than a cough and diarrhea. Had the agency somehow blended information from two different girls? She again consulted the dysmorphologist, this time to compare the photos she had just found to those of herself in the United States. She expected a match. But once again, he concluded that they were different girls. Kimmel was shaken. She felt such a connection with this girl. Could she be a sibling? Maybe even a twin? ___ Kimmel threw herself into examining the complex numerical system KSS used to log adoption cases, based on hundreds of case numbers she collected from other KSS adoptees. In 2021, she revisited the agency with a long wish list of files. The meeting, which the AP attended, resulted in a tense back-and-forth for hours with the same long-time social worker. Kimmel struggled to contain her fury, waving her hands in disgust. 'You lied,' she fumed. Visibly irritated, the social worker shuttled back and forth from the room to a document storage area. But each of the files she brought out had no information on Kimmel. The social worker looked drained. She denied that the agency was withholding information. But she had no explanation for why it couldn’t present a single document with Kimmel’s information. Or why the photo in her file was of a different girl. Or why KSS had told her adoptive parents she was from the Namkwang orphanage in Busan. The pressure grew until the social worker acknowledged a startling practice: Switching children’s identities was common among South Korean agencies during the adoption rush of the 1970s and 1980s. When children died, became too sick or were retaken by birth families, the agencies simply swapped in other children. Western agencies or adopters were willing to take any child of the same sex or similar age, because 'it would take too much time to start over again,' the KSS social worker said. Could Kimmel have been one of those children? 'I can’t say with confidence that there’s absolutely no possibility that a different child was sent from here,' the worker confessed. The worker has retired, and AP has been unable to reach her since. KSS did not respond to requests for comment. Switched documents may be one reason agencies are so reluctant to fully open their files to adoptees, says Lee Kyung-eun, a former director of childcare policy at South Korea’s Health and Welfare Ministry. Even the agencies can’t tell which records are real. Some adoptees the AP talked with spent years getting to know people they were told were biological parents, only to have DNA tests show they weren’t related. 'It could be less about hiding records,' Lee says, 'and more about not having much to give.' ___ Kimmel was exhausted. But she refused to accept that this was all she was going to get. Still thinking she was a twin, she had been scouring message boards for twin sisters looking for their birth parents, or birth parents looking for twin girls. Now she had one clue left: A message written by an old man named Park Jong-kyun, looking for twin girls relinquished for adoption sometime between 1973 and 1976. Park had left detailed information about his full name, his wife’s names, their sons’ names, their birth dates. He described a small village, which Kimmel tracked down on the southern South Korean resort island of Jeju. Kimmel went. Within hours, with the help of local police, she met Park. Park is a slight man with kind eyes, who lives in a small, weathered house surrounded by tangerine bushes and flowers that remind him of his daughters. His twins were born at a time when he and his late wife were struggling financially to raise three sons. His wife needed an emergency C-section, which the couple couldn’t afford. The hospital persuaded them to give away the twin girls to relieve the financial burden and toll on his wife’s health, Park says. He named his girls after the Korean words for rose and chrysanthemum. He wrote the twins’ birthdate – May 11, 1973 – on two pieces of paper and put them in their clothing, hoping to find them someday. Park searched for the girls for decades, putting in requests with the government and Holt Children’s Services, South Korea’s biggest adoption agency. Government officials told him his twins were likely adopted to the United States through Holt, based on their birthdate and hospital. In 2018, he visited Holt and the government agency that helped with adoption searches. He sent them boxes of Jeju tangerines, hoping they would remember him and look for his daughters. When Kimmel came to Jeju in 2021, Park was excited and very surprised. They spent days together, eating in restaurants, talking and laughing as they communicated with translation apps. Park taped Kimmel’s U.S. baby photos on a wall of his small home. Yet he felt instinctively that she was not his daughter. His doubts were confirmed when a DNA test showed no relation. Kimmel was devastated. But in the wake of her grief, she realized that his twins could still be somewhere out in the world. Kimmel arranged to have kits from an American DNA testing firm sent to South Korea. She traveled back to Jeju to test Park and a nearby island to test his son. It took just three weeks for the company to locate Park’s daughters — Becca Webster and Dee Iraca. ___ The twins are very different. Webster, a nanny with a son in college, is whimsical, chatty and easygoing. Iraca, who works as a chef and dietitian, is meticulous, serious and always on the go. Her nickname is Speedy Dee-Dee. Those differences are what prompted them to take a DNA test in the first place; they wanted to confirm for themselves that they are biological sisters. Adopted by the same American family, their files described them as abandoned in front of a hospital. Anytime they thought about searching for their birth parents, they felt overwhelmed. 'Abandoned is such a hard word….It feels so hollow,' Webster says. 'When you’re told a narrative that you’ve been abandoned, left as a baby, where are you going to go with that?' They traveled to South Korea for the 2018 Winter Olympics and visited Holt’s office in Seoul, just months after Park went there. A social worker for Holt told the twins that the agency had no further documents for them. Which led them to wonder: If they’d just been left on a doorstep, how could anyone have really known they were twins? The results were reassuring; they were indeed sisters. But the test led to a baffling turn: A stranger sent them a note pointing out that the DNA site also registered a man called 'Mr. P' as their father. They were stunned. They asked the DNA company if this was a scam. It wasn’t. The stranger turned out to be Kimmel. She told them that their father had been looking for them for decades. 'Even now sometimes, it feels like a dream,' Iraca says. They felt guilty that so many adoptees, including Kimmel, had been desperately searching for their families, and their father had been searching for them. But they hadn’t been searching. 'It wasn’t about not wanting to know,' Webster says. 'It was about cutting that emotion off because we didn’t think we had a choice.' In October 2022, the twins went to South Korea. Park waited for them anxiously at the airport, holding up a handwritten English sign that read 'Dee, Becca, welcome to Korea.' He brought two bouquets of flowers: one roses and the other chrysanthemums. He made sure to give the right bouquet to the right daughter. He hugged them. 'Thank you for waiting for me,' he said. He spoke only Korean. They spoke only English and came across as unmistakably American. At one point, as they tried to walk inside his home, he said, 'No, no, no, no'; they hadn’t followed the Korean practice of taking off their shoes. But for all the differences, the twins felt an instant connection. Park showed them photos on his wall of his own father and mother. They met their Korean brother and their uncles and aunts, who hosted a welcome party. These strangers who were somehow still family touched the sisters’ faces and speculated on who looked like whom. Park gave each of them a hanbok, a traditional Korean garment. They wore them to a Buddhist temple where there’s a memorial photo of their mother. Back in North Carolina, the sisters are now taking care of their adoptive mother, who has health challenges, and it’s difficult to find the time and money to visit South Korea. But they want to make the effort to get to know their father.. They call him K-Dad, to differentiate from their adoptive father, who died more than a decade ago. He sends them packages of seaweed and green tea. They are left with mixed feelings. After all, they ended up happy in America. Yet their happiness was built on an injustice that hurt thousands, including their birth father. They resent that they learned of their identity from a stranger, and that they were too late to meet their mother. 'We have both built such incredible lives that it’s hard to look at that and anything negative about it,' Webster says. '(Yet) there’s a part of it that we feel sad.' Park, too, has mixed feelings. He wears a huge smile when he talks about meeting his daughters again. Their pictures cover his walls, along with taped memos of English words and expressions. Eager to talk with them, he has bought several English books, but says he isn’t getting anywhere. It was painful for him to see his daughters leave. He’s frustrated that Holt, which didn’t respond to AP’s request for comment, missed an opportunity to reunite them as early as 2018. In his mid-80s and still struggling financially, Park can’t afford a long and expensive trip to America. 'It’s sad,' Park says. 'There’s so little time left for me.' ___ That still leaves Kimmel. She feels a bittersweet thrill that she managed to reunite the twins with their father. They joke that they are triplets — two Beccas and a Dee. Kimmel also spends hours helping and advising other adoptees. She is a key contributor to an adoption-focused website called Paperslip, named after the word that frequently — and sometimes falsely — appears in the files of KSS adoptees described as abandoned. Her adoptive parents, who could not have birth children, have struggled with their unintended role in a deeply flawed system. Her mother is afraid that Kimmel’s obsession with her past has taken a toll on her well-being. Her father says he would not have considered international adoption 'had I known of the deception and what it has done to so many adoptees in their search for their identity.' Kimmel still does not know — and may never know — who she is. All she knows is who she’s not. And that leaves her in limbo, torn between a mind that sees no point in searching further and a heart that can’t seem to give up. 'I’m almost 50 years old, and I still don’t know when I was born, or what city I was born in,' she says. 'I don’t know my birth parents. There’s nothing that I know about myself as real.' She often looks at the photo of the girl she still believes is her twin. Like Kimmel herself — like thousands of others — her story remains a mystery. ___ PBS Frontline’s Lora Moftah contributed to this report.

UN Security Council voices 'strong concern' for UN peacekeepers after Israeli attacks	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The U.N. Security Council expressed 'strong concern' Monday as Israel has fired on and wounded U.N. peacekeepers in southern Lebanon during intensified fighting, reiterating its support for their role in supporting security in the region. It's the first statement by the U.N.’s most powerful body since Israel's attacks on the positions of the peacekeeping force known as UNIFIL began last week, drawing international condemnation. U.N. peacekeeping chief Jean-Pierre Lacroix told reporters that Secretary-General António Guterres confirmed Monday that peacekeepers will remain in all their positions even as Israel has urged the peacekeepers to move 5 kilometers (3 miles) north during its ground invasion in Lebanon. Israel has been escalating its campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon across a U.N.-drawn boundary between the two countries. The sides have been clashing since the Iranian-backed militant group started firing rockets a year ago in solidarity with its ally Hamas in Gaza. Hamas' deadly attacks in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, launched the war. The Security Council statement, issued after emergency closed consultations on Lebanon, did not name either Israel, Lebanon or Hezbollah. Read by Swiss U.N. Ambassador Pascale Baeriswyl, the council's current president, it urges all parties 'to respect the safety and security of UNIFIL personnel and U.N. premises.' The 15-member Security Council has been deeply divided over the war in Gaza, with the United States defending its ally Israel as support for the Palestinians has grown among members and casualties have escalated. The Biden administration has become more critical of civilian deaths as well as the recent attacks on UNIFIL. US. deputy ambassador Robert Wood told reporters that 'it’s good that the council can speak with one voice on what’s on the minds of all people around the world right now — and it’s the situation in Lebanon.' The council's statement sends a message to the Lebanese people 'that the council cares, that the council is watching this issue and that the council today spoke with one voice,' Wood said. Council members also expressed 'deep concern' at civilian casualties and suffering, the destruction of civilian infrastructure and the rising number of internally displaced people. More than 1,400 people in Lebanon, including civilians, medics and Hezbollah fighters, have been killed and 1.2 million displaced in the past month. Around 60 Israelis have been killed in Hezbollah strikes in the past year. Israel says it wants to drive the militant group away from the border so some 60,000 displaced Israelis can return to their homes. The Security Council statement called on all parties to abide by international humanitarian law, which requires the protection of civilians. Council members also called for the full implementation of Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war 'and recognized the need for further practical measures to achieve that outcome.' That resolution calls for the Lebanese army to deploy throughout the south and for all armed groups, including Hezbollah, to be disarmed — neither of which has happened in the past 18 years. Lacroix, the undersecretary-general for peace operations, told reporters after his closed briefing to the Security Council that five UNIFIL peacekeepers have been injured in recent days and that the U.N. has protested to Israel. Israel has indicated 'investigations will be carried out regarding some of these incidents ... and we will see what comes out of this,' he said. Israeli Army spokesman Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani asserted Sunday that Israel has tried to maintain constant contact with UNIFIL and that any instance of U.N. forces being harmed will be investigated at 'the highest level.' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called for UNIFIL to heed Israel’s warnings to evacuate, accusing them of 'providing a human shield' to Hezbollah. 'We regret the injury to the UNIFIL soldiers, and we are doing everything in our power to prevent this injury. But the simple and obvious way to ensure this is simply to get them out of the danger zone,' he said Sunday in a video addressed to the U.N. secretary-general, who has been banned from entering Israel. Lacroix on Monday stressed that all parties have a responsibility to ensure the safety and security of the peacekeepers. He also said it’s important that the peacekeepers stay in their positions 'because we all hope there will be a return to the negotiation table, and that there will be finally a real effort to full implementation of resolution 1701.' —— This story Corrects the first name of the U.N. peacekeeping chief in the third paragraph to Jean-Pierre Lacroix	https://apnews.com/article/un-lebanon-israel-security-council-statement-hezbollah-e391d8ffe57eebcf8bc294310bb922bd	2024-10-14T14:59:13-07:00	
Sending a THAAD air defense system to Israel adds to strain on US Army forces	WASHINGTON (AP) — The deployment of a U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery to Israel and roughly 100 soldiers to operate it will add to already difficult strains on the Army's air defense forces and potential delays in modernizing its missile defense systems, Army leaders said Monday. The service's top two leaders declined to provide details on the deployment ordered by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin over the weekend. But they spoke broadly about their concerns as the demand for THAAD and Patriot missile batteries grows because of the war in Ukraine and the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah and Hamas militants. 'The air defense, artillery community is the most stressed. They have the highest ‘optempo’ really of any part of the Army,' Army Secretary Christine Wormuth said, using a phrase meaning the pace of operations. 'We’re just constantly trying to be as disciplined as we can, and give Secretary Austin the information he needs to accurately assess the strain on the force when he’s considering future operational deployments.' Wormuth said the Army has to be careful about 'what we take on. But of course, in a world this volatile, you know, sometimes we have to do what we have to do.' The Pentagon announced the THAAD deployment Sunday, saying it was authorized at the direction of President Joe Biden. U.S. officials said the system will be moved from a location in the continental United States to Israel and that it will take a number of days for it and the soldiers to arrive. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details of troop movements. The move adds to what have been growing tensions within the Defense Department about what weapons the U.S. can afford to send to Ukraine, Israel or elsewhere and the resulting risks to America's military readiness and its ability to protect the nation. 'Everybody wants U.S. Army air defense forces,' Gen. Randy George, Army chief of staff, said Monday as he and Wormuth took questions from journalists at the Association of the U.S. Army’s annual conference. 'This is our most deployed formation.' The decision to send the THAAD came as Israel is widely believed to be preparing a military response to Iran’s Oct. 1 attack, when it fired roughly 180 missiles into Israel. Israel already has a multilayered air defense system, but a Hezbollah drone attack on an army base Sunday killed four soldiers and severely wounded seven others, underscoring the potential need for greater protection. Israeli forces and Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon have been clashing since Oct. 8, 2023, when the Lebanese militant group began firing rockets over the border in support of its ally Hamas in Gaza. The Sunday drone attack was Hezbollah's deadliest strike since Israel launched its ground invasion of Lebanon nearly two weeks ago. Since the THAAD deployment only involves about 100 soldiers, it won't add a tremendous amount of additional strain on air defense forces, Wormuth said at the conference. But it adds to the pace of their deployments. Since the frenetic pace of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars has subsided, the military has tried to ensure that service members have sufficient time at home to train and reset between deployments. Shrinking that so-called dwell time can have an impact on the Army's ability to keep good soldiers in the force. 'They're very good, but obviously deploying for a year and coming back for a year and deploying for a year — it's tough to do for anybody,' George said. He said the Army is looking at a range of ways to limit the impact on recruiting and retention, including growing the force and modernizing the systems so that it takes fewer soldiers to operate them. But the repeated deployments makes it difficult to get the systems into the depots where they can be upgraded. As a result, Wormuth said, Army leaders are trying to make their arguments as clear as possible when combatant commanders go to Austin and ask for another Patriot system in the Middle East or another one for Ukraine. 'We need to be able to bring these units home to be able to go through that modernization process,' she said. 'So we’re trying to lay that out for Secretary Austin so that he can weigh those risks — essentially current versus future risks — as he makes recommendations to the president about whether to send the Patriot here or there.'	https://apnews.com/article/army-israel-thaad-air-defense-strains-e49a65aaaf3a4ff051b54eebb869f241	2024-10-14T12:35:08-07:00	
The pandas are coming! The pandas are coming!	WASHINGTON (AP) — The National Zoo's long dark panda drought seems to be coming to an end. Eleven months after the zoo sent its three wildly popular pandas — Mei Xiang, Tian Tian and their cub Xiao Qi Ji — back to China, a new pair of bears is set to arrive. A pair of three-year old giant pandas, named Bao Li and Qing Bao, have left a research facility in the southwestern Chinese city of Dujiangyan and will soon be flown to Washington, according to a statement by the China Wildlife Conservation Association. 'Food prepared for the trip includes corn bread, bamboo and carrots, as well as water and medicine,' the statement said, adding that the partnership will 'make new contributions in protecting global biodiversity and enhance the friendship of the people from the two countries.' It's unclear exactly when the bears will arrive in Washington, but there will likely be an extended quarantine and acclimation period before they are introduced to the public. On Monday evening, the zoo's website posted an alert that the entire facility would be closed Tuesday, without giving a reason. The lead article on the site still said the pandas would be coming sometime before the end of the year. Bao Li (precious vigor) and Qing Bao (green treasure) arrive in Washington as part of a new 10-year agreement with Chinese authorities. The previous deal expired last year, leading to some concern among American panda-lovers that Beijing was gradually pulling its furry friendship ambassadors from American zoos amid rising diplomatic tensions. Breeding pairs in zoos in Memphis and San Diego had already returned to China earlier and the four pandas in the Atlanta zoo left for China last week. That anxiety turned to optimism last November when Chinese President Xi Jinping publicly stated a desire to continue the panda exchange programs. This year, a new pair of bears has been delivered to the San Diego Zoo, while another pair has been promised to San Francisco. In Washington, National Zoo officials remained conspicuously silent about negotiations for a new panda agreement, but they expressed optimism about striking a new deal and launched a multimillion-dollar renovation of its panda enclosure in anticipation. Then in late May, zoo director Brandie Smith teamed up with first lady Jill Biden to announce that Bao Li and Qing Bao would be arriving by the end of this year. The Chinese announcement said the National Zoo had sent 'three experienced keepers and veterinary experts' to China to assist the transport and accompany the bears. Zoo officials on Monday declined to confirm the Chinese announcement. Zoo spokesperson Jennifer Zoon said in an email, 'For the safety of animals and staff, we are not able to confirm any details at this time.' But signs at the zoo and on its social media site have heralded the planned return of the pandas and panda-themed merchandise still dominates the gift shops. 'The giant pandas are an iconic part of the Washington, D.C., story, both for locals and incoming travelers alike,' said Elliott L. Ferguson, II, president and CEO of Destination DC. 'The interest and excitement associated with their return directly benefits the entire city, bringing further interest and visitors to our hotels, restaurants and other attractions.' The exact terms of the deal are still unclear; under previous 10-year agreements the Chinese government receives $1 million per year, per bear. Any cubs born in overseas zoos are typically returned to China before they reach age four. Pandas have become one of the unofficial symbols of the nation's capital, dating back to 1972 when the first pair — Ling Ling and Hsing Hsing — were sent as a gift from Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai following President Richard Nixon's historic diplomatic visit to China. Later, a rolling series of 10-year cooperation agreements was struck. Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington, credited the decades of cooperation with advancing research into panda preservation and breeding. During the lifespan of these agreements, giant pandas have been reclassified from an endangered species to merely vulnerable. 'The current round of cooperation will focus on prevention and treatment of major diseases, and protection of habitats and wild giant panda populations,' Liu said in an email. 'We hope the arrival of the pandas will inject fresh impetus into exchanges between China and the U.S., and help to stabilize the broader bilateral relationship as well.'	https://apnews.com/article/pandas-national-zoo-china-8537ae9f9be4134c795fc5f007c02064	2024-10-14T10:50:57-07:00	
A bus carrying university students crashes, killing 12 and injuring 33 in Egypt's northeast	CAIRO (AP) — A bus carrying university students crashed and overturned on a highway in northeastern Egypt Monday, killing 12 people and injuring 33 others, the health ministry said in a statement. Students from the Suez-based Galala University were on board. Local media reported they were returning from their classes to their dormitory in Ain Sokhna resort, using the new Galala highway, when the accident happened, and that the driver was arrested as part of an investigation into the crash. The ministry didn’t reveal what caused the accident. The statement Monday night said 28 ambulances rushed to the site and transported the injured to the Suez Medical Complex, but didn't disclose their condition. Minister of Health, Khaled Abdel-Ghaffar, and Minister of High Education, Ayman Ashour, expressed their condolences to the families of the students. Deadly traffic accidents claim thousands of lives every year in Egypt, which has a poor transportation safety record. Speeding, bad roads, and poor enforcement of traffic laws mostly cause the collisions.	https://apnews.com/article/egypt-bus-crash-suez-university-students-7b69d1972f90cd514d558c6d6c8a0ddf	2024-10-14T09:54:26-07:00	
Italy sends the first ship with migrants to Albania as rights groups warn of a dangerous precedent	ROME (AP) — Italy is transferring the first group of migrants to Albania, the Interior Ministry said Monday, as part of a contentious plan to process thousands of asylum-seekers outside its borders. A naval ship departed from the island of Lampedusa with 16 men — 10 from Bangladesh and six from Egypt — who were rescued at sea after departing from Libya. The ship is expected to arrive Wednesday morning, a ministry spokesman said. Premier Giorgia Meloni's far-right government on Friday formally opened the two centers in Albania where Italy plans to process thousands of male migrants requesting asylum after being intercepted in international waters while trying to cross to Europe. The centers can accommodate up to 400 migrants at first, with that expected to increase to 880 in a few weeks, according to Italian officials. Women, children, older people and those who are ill or victims of torture will be accommodated in Italy. Families will not be separated. The five-year deal was endorsed last year by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen as an example of 'out-of-box thinking' in tackling the migration issue, but human rights groups say it sets a dangerous precedent. A spokesman for the U.N. refugee agency, which has expressed serious concerns, said Monday that one of its teams was conducting an 'independent mission' on board the ship to monitor the screening process. The agency also known as UNHCR has agreed to supervise the first three months to help 'safeguard the rights and dignity of those subject to it.' The agreement, signed last year, calls for Albania to house up to 3,000 male migrants while Italy fast-tracks their asylum claims. The migrants will retain their right under international and EU law to apply for asylum in Italy and have their claims processed there. The two centers will cost Italy 670 million euros ($730 million) over five years. The facilities will be run by Italy and are under Italian jurisdiction, while Albanian guards will provide external security. Meloni and her right-wing allies have long demanded that European countries share more of the migration burden. ___ Follow AP coverage of migration: https://apnews.com/hub/migration	https://apnews.com/article/italy-albania-migration-centers-asylum-seekers-fb89f5aece2504bf0267180bc3fd1a7d	2024-10-14T09:45:03-07:00	
Paris Motor Show opens during a brewing EV trade war between the EU and China	PARIS (AP) — Auto manufacturers competing to persuade drivers to go electric are rolling out cheaper, more tech-rich models at the Paris Motor Show, targeting everyone from luxury clients to students yet to receive their driving licenses. The biennial show has long been a major industry showcase, tracing its history to 1898. Chinese manufacturers are attending in force, despite European Union threats to punitively tax imports of their electric vehicles in a brewing trade war with Beijing. Long-established European manufacturers are fighting back with new efforts to win consumers who have balked at high-priced EVs. Here's a look at the show's opening day on Monday. MORE NEW MODELS FROM CHINA Chinese EV startups Leapmotor and XPeng showcased models they said incorporate artificial intelligence technology. Leapmotor, founded in 2015, unveiled a compact electric-powered SUV, the B10. It will be manufactured in Poland for European buyers, said Leapmotor's head of product planning, Zhong Tianyue. Leapmotor didn't announce a price for the B10 that will launch next year. Leapmotor also said a smaller electric commuter car it showcased in Paris, the T03, will retail from a competitive 18,900 euros ($20,620). Those sold in France will be imported from China but assembled in Poland, Zhong said. Leapmotor also announced a starting price of 36,400 euros ($39,700) in Europe for its larger family car, the C10. Sales outside of China are through a joint venture with Stellantis, the world’s fourth largest carmaker. Leapmotor said European sales started in September. XPENG BRACES FOR TARIFF HIT Attending the Paris show for the first time, the decade-old Chinese EV manufacturer XPeng unveiled a sleek sedan, the P7+. CEO He Xiaopeng said XPeng aims to deliver in Europe from next year. Intended European prices for the P7+ weren't given, but the CEO said they will start in China at 209,800 yuan, the equivalent of 27,100 euros, or $29,600. XPeng's president, Brian Gu, said the EU's threatened import duties could complicate the company's expansion plans if Brussels and Beijing don't find an amicable solution to their trade dispute before an end-of-October deadline. Brussels says subsidies help Chinese companies to unfairly undercut EU industry prices, with Chinese-built electric cars jumping from 3.9% of the EV market in 2020 to 25% by September 2023. 'The tariff will put a lot of pressure on our business model. It's a direct hit on our margin, which is already not very high,' Gu said. VEHICLES FOR YOUNG TEENS Manufacturers of small electric vehicles that can be driven in Europe without a license are finding a growing market among teens as young as 14 and their parents who, for safety reasons, prefer that they zip around on four wheels than on motorbikes. Several manufacturers of the two-seaters are showcasing in Paris, including France's Citroen. The starting price for its Ami, or 'Friend,' is just under 8,000 euros ($8,720). Launched in France in 2020, the plastic-shelled vehicle is now also sold in other European markets and in Turkey, Morocco and South America. 'It's not a car. It's a mobility object,' said Citroen's product chief for the Ami, Alain Le Gouguec. European legislation allows teenagers without a full license to drive the Ami and similar buggies from age 14 after an eight-hour training course. They're limited to a top speed of 45 kilometers per hour (28 mph). The vehicles are also finding markets among adults who lost their license for driving infractions or who never got a full license, and outside cities in areas with poor transport.

Hezbollah's drones are a fierce and evasive threat to Israel	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — One of the worst mass casualty strikes on Israel in a year of war came not from dozens of Iranian ballistic missiles nor the repeated barrages of rocket fire launched by Hamas and Hezbollah. Instead, it was a single drone. The unmanned aerial vehicle, laden with explosives, evaded Israel's multilayered air-defense system and slammed into a mess hall at a military training camp deep inside Israel, killing four soldiers and wounding dozens. It’s the latest achievement for Hezbollah’s drone fleet and has shined a light on Israel’s struggle over the past year of war to knock down unmanned aircraft incoming from as far away as Yemen, Iraq and Iran. Over the years, Israel has built up its aerial defense array to provide broad protection against short-range rocket fire and medium- and long-range missiles, although experts caution it is not airtight. While the system has taken down drones repeatedly, many have penetrated Israel's airspace and sidestepped its defenses, in some cases with deadly results. The drone traversed Israeli airspace unimpeded On Sunday evening, reports emerged of a mass casualty event about 65 kilometers (40 miles) from the Lebanese border. A drone had slammed into a mess hall filled with troops eating dinner, according to Israeli media, killing four soldiers and wounding 67 people. Minutes earlier, air raid sirens had blared in northern Israel as the aircraft flew overhead. But no sirens sounded at the base, giving the soldiers no advance warning and indicating that the drone may have fallen off Israel’s radar. An Israeli security official said Israel was still investigating how the drone made it through Israel’s air defenses. A pair of drones initially entered Israeli airspace, but while one was shot down, the other one continued to its target. Hezbollah, which said the attack was in response to Israeli strikes in Lebanon, said the drone was 'able to penetrate the Israeli air defense radars without being detected' and reach its target. It claimed it had outsmarted Israel's air defenses by simultaneously launching dozens of missiles and 'squadrons' of drones simultaneously. It was the second deadly drone strike in just two weeks. Earlier this month, a drone launched from Iraq killed two Israeli soldiers and wounded roughly two dozen, according to Israeli media. On Friday, during a major Jewish holiday, a Hezbollah drone slammed into a nursing home in central Israel, causing damage. 'We already have six dead in the past 10 days from drones. That’s too much,' said Ran Kochav, a former head of the Israeli military’s aerial defense command. Drones, he said, 'have become a real threat.' Drones are harder to detect and track than rockets or missiles Drones, or UAVs, are unmanned aircraft that can be operated from afar. Drones can enter, surveil and attack enemy territory more discreetly than missiles and rockets. Israel has a formidable arsenal of drones, capable of carrying out spy missions and attacks. It has developed a drone capable of reaching archenemy Iran, some 1500 kilometers (1,000 miles) away. But Israel's enemies have caught Israel off-guard on a number of occasions over the past year, often with deadly consequences. In July, a drone launched from Yemen travelled some 270 kilometers (160 miles) from Israel’s southern tip, all the way to Tel Aviv, slamming into a downtown building and killing one person without it having been intercepted. The Israeli security official said drones are harder to detect for a number of reasons: They fly slowly and often include plastic components, having a weaker thermal footprint with radar systems than powerful rockets and missiles. The trajectory is also harder to track. Drones can have roundabout flight paths, can come from any direction, fly lower to the ground and — because they are much smaller than rockets — can be mistaken for birds. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation into the mess hall strike was still underway. Kochav said that Israel spent years focusing on strengthening its air defense systems to improve protection against rockets and missiles. But drones were not seen as a top priority. During the current fighting, that has meant Israel’s ability to detect and intercept drones is not as successful as its capabilities in the face of rockets and missiles, Kochav said. Hezbollah's drone program receives support from Iran Hezbollah began using Iranian-made drones after Israel withdrew from southern Lebanon in 2000 and sent the first reconnaissance Mirsad drone over Israel’s airspace in 2004. Hezbollah’s drone program still receives substantial assistance from Iran, and the UAVs are believed to be assembled by experts of the militant group in Lebanon. Drones have become an 'Iranian-inspired, strategic system' for Hezbollah, according to Tal Beeri, the director of research for The Alma Research and Education Center, a think tank that studies Hezbollah and Israel's north. The militant group has launched roughly 1,500 surveillance and attack drones since it began striking Israel in October 2023, according to the group's count. The attack drones, which Beeri said often hit civilian targets, have a payload of 10 kilograms (22 lbs) of explosives and can fly hundreds of kilometers (miles). He said Hezbollah in May used for the first and only time a drone that was able to fire an anti-tank missile and that it may possess more. Hezbollah has also used drones to erode Israel’s air-defense capabilities by slamming them into the very batteries and infrastructure meant to take them down. Earlier this year, Hezbollah said it used an Ababil explosive drone to down Israel’s Sky Dew observation balloon, a component of its aerial defense. On Monday evening, Hezbollah released a video showing some of its militants in a warehouse full of drones. The video shows drones on launchers and at the end displays a caption that reads: 'Our capabilities are intact.' Israel says it is working to tackle the threat On Monday, on a visit to the training camp hit by the drone, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant pledged to learn from the strike and said Israel was 'concentrating significant efforts in developing solutions' to tackle the drone threat, without elaborating. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also visited the base and soldiers injured in the attack, noting that Israel had paid 'a painful price.' Kochav said there were ways to combat the drones that could be considered. Detection capabilities could be expanded to include acoustic radars to pick up on the sound of the drone's engine or electro-optics, which could allow Israeli surveillance to better identify them. He said rockets, fighter jets and helicopters could be deployed for interception, and that electronic warfare could be used to overtake the drones and divert them. 'We were busy in recent years ... and unmanned (aerial vehicles) was not a top priority,' he said. 'The results unfortunately are not good.' ___ Associated Press writers Josef Federman in Jerusalem, and Abby Sewell and Bassem Mroue in Beirut, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/hezbollah-drones-iran-israel-war-hamas-iran-houthi-386ae3c8deeb4c8997e64c954c3670e5	2024-10-14T07:01:59-07:00	
Kenya moves 50 elephants to a larger park, says it's a sign poaching is low	MWEA, Kenya (AP) — As a helicopter hovers close to an elephant, trying to be as steady as possible, an experienced veterinarian cautiously takes aim. A tranquilizer dart whooshes in the air, and within minutes the giant mammal surrenders to a deep slumber as teams of wildlife experts rush to measure its vitals and ensure it's doing OK. Kenya is suffering from a problem, albeit a good one: The elephant population in the 42-square-kilometer (16-square-mile) Mwea National Reserve, east of the capital Nairobi, has flourished from its capacity of 50 to a whopping 156, overwhelming the ecosystem and requiring the relocation of about 100 of the largest land animals. It hosted 49 elephants in 1979. According to the Kenya Wildlife Service Director General Erustus Kanga, the overpopulation in Mwea highlighted the success of conservation effort s over the last three decades. 'This shows that poaching has been low and the elephants have been able to thrive,' Kanga said. Experts started relocating 50 elephants last week to the expansive 780-square-kilometer (301-square-mile) Aberdare National Park in central Kenya. As of Monday, 44 elephants had been moved from Mwea to Aberdare, with six others scheduled for Tuesday. Tourism Minister Rebecca Miano oversaw the move of five of the elephants on Monday, saying: 'This will go down in history as a record, as it is the biggest exercise of its kind. It is the first time we are witnessing the translocation of 50 elephants at a go.' The process started at dawn and involved a team of more than 100 wildlife specialists, with equipment ranging from specially fitted trucks to aircraft and cruisers. A fixed-wing aircraft conducted aerial surveillance to track down herds of elephants, which naturally move in small families of about five. The craft was in constant communication with two helicopters used to herd and separate the elephants to ensure they were relocated with their family units. Aboard one of the helicopters is a spotter, on the lookout for elephants, and a veterinarian with a tranquilizer gun. Once an elephant is sedated, a ground team of veterinary specialists and rangers rushes to find it and clear thickets to make way for transport crews. Its vitals are monitored as another group of rangers works on lifting the massive animal, weighing hundreds of kilograms, onto specialized trucks, to be driven 120 kilometers (74 miles) to their new home. Kanga, the wildlife service director, said the relocation also aimed at curbing human-wildlife conflict. Boniface Mbau, a resident of the area, said: 'We are very happy that the government has decided to reduce the number of elephants from the area. Due to their high numbers, they did not have enough food in the reserve, and they ended up invading our farms.' A second phase to relocate 50 other elephants is planned, but the date has not been disclosed. The project has cost at least 12 million Kenyan shillings ($93,000), the wildlife agency said. Kenya’s national parks and reserves are home to a variety of wildlife species and attract millions of visitors annually, making the country a tourism hotspot. ___ The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

India recalls ambassador from Canada in growing dispute over assassination of Sikh activist	NEW DELHI (AP) — India said Monday it is recalling its ambassador and other diplomats from Canada, hours after it rejected a Canadian notification that the ambassador was a 'person of interest' in the assassination of a Sikh activist last year. India's foreign ministry said in a statement that it had also summoned the top Canadian diplomat in New Delhi and told him that 'the baseless targeting' of the Indian high commissioner, or ambassador, and other diplomats and officials in Canada 'was completely unacceptable.' 'We have no faith in the current Canadian Government’s commitment to ensure their security,' it said. 'Therefore, the Government of India has decided to withdraw the High Commissioner and other targeted diplomats and officials.' In September last year, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said there were credible allegations that the Indian government had links to the assassination in that country of Sikh activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. India rejected the accusation as absurd. In Ottawa, messages left for Canada’s foreign ministry, foreign minister and the prime minister’s office seeking comment were not immediately returned.	https://apnews.com/article/india-canada-ambassador-recalled-sikh-assassination-f099e210d2f9df93fea18a9de04e06f8	2024-10-14T05:54:35-07:00	
Body of Scottish independence champion Alex Salmond soon to be flown home from North Macedonia	SKOPJE, North Macedonia (AP) — The body of Alex Salmond, Scotland's former First Minister who died during a conference in North Macedonia, will soon be returned to Scotland by special flight, an official said Monday. Salmond, who as leader of the Scottish National Party took Scotland up to the brink of independence in a 2014 referendum, died suddenly Saturday at the lake resort of Ohrid aged 69. He had been a panelist at a forum and collapsed during a lunch event after apparently suffering a massive heart attack. Boris Josifovski, an aide to North Macedonia’s former president Gjorge Ivanov, who organized the forum, said Monday that procedures for the body's repatriation 'are almost done.' 'All legal procedures and paperwork are nearly finished,' Josifovski told The Associated Press. 'There will be a special flight in the next few days, probably from Ohrid,' to take Salmond's body to Scotland. The official coroner's report on the precise causes of Salmond's death will be delivered to his family, North Macedonia's judiciary said. Salmond, who took the SNP to power from the fringes of Scottish politics, served as first minister from 2007 to 2014. In the referendum Scots ultimately rejected independence, with 55% voting against and 45% in favor. Salmond subsequently resigned and was replaced by his long-time ally, Nicola Sturgeon. Their subsequent split dominated Scottish politics for years.	https://apnews.com/article/alex-salmond-scotland-independence-death-north-macedonia-b8cbfc267e9809269400d21b67d8998b	2024-10-14T04:57:40-07:00	
Polish leader Tusk defends decision to suspend asylum law	WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk on Monday defended a plan to temporarily suspend the right to asylum as human rights and and civil society organizations express concerns about the move. Poland has struggled since 2021 with migration pressures on its border with Belarus — which is also part of the European Union's external border. 'It is our right and our duty to protect the Polish and European border,' Tusk said Monday on X. 'Its security will not be negotiated.' Successive Polish governments have accused Belarus and Russia of organizing the mass transfer of migrants from the Middle East and Africa to the EU's eastern borders to destabilize the West. They view it as part of a hybrid war that they accuse Moscow of waging against the West as it continues its nearly three-year full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Some migrants have applied for asylum in Poland, but before the requests are processed, they travel across the EU’s border-free travel zone to reach Germany or other countries in Western Europe. Germany, where security fears are rising after a spate of extremist attacks, has recently responded by expanding border controls at all of its borders to fight irregular migration. Tusk called Germany’s move 'unacceptable.' Tusk announced his plan to temporarily suspend the right for migrants to seek asylum at a convention of his Civic Coalition on Saturday. It will be part of a strategy that will be presented to a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday. Dozens of nongovernmental organizations urged Tusk in an open letter to respect the right to asylum guaranteed by international conventions, which Poland signed, including the Geneva Convention on the Status of Refugees and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, and Poland's own constitution. They argued that fundamental rights and freedoms must be respected. 'It is thanks to them that thousands of Polish women and men found shelter abroad in the difficult times of communist totalitarianism, and we have become one of the greatest beneficiaries of these rights,' the letter said. It was signed by Amnesty International and 45 other organizations that represent a range of humanitarian, legal and civic causes. Tusk argued that Finland also suspended accepting asylum applications after facing migration pressure on its border with Russia. 'The right to asylum is used instrumentally in this war and has nothing to do with human rights,' Tusk said on X on Sunday. A spokesperson for the European Commission, the EU's executive branch, acknowledged the challenge posed by Belarus, but also Russia, and didn't explicitly criticize Tusk’s approach. 'It is important and imperative that the union is protecting the external borders, and in particular from Russia and Belarus, both countries that have put in the past three years, a lot of pressure on the external borders,' Anitta Hipper said during a briefing Monday. 'This is something that is undermining the security of the EU member states and of the union as a whole.' But she also underlined that EU member countries are legally obliged to allow people to apply for international protection. Hipper noted that the commission intends to 'work on ensuring that the member states have the necessary tools to respond to these types of hybrid attacks.' ___ Associated Press writer Lorne Cook in Brussels contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of migration issues at https://apnews.com/hub/migration	https://apnews.com/article/poland-migration-asylum-law-eu-belarus-russia-b247e18632bbae01c7bcca4d2ef6bf8e	2024-10-14T04:00:53-07:00	
Former officer with East Germany’s secret police sentenced to prison for a border killing in 1974	BERLIN (AP) — An 80-year-old former officer with communist East Germany’s secret police, the Stasi, was sentenced Monday to 10 years in prison for the murder of a Polish man at a border crossing in divided Berlin 50 years ago. The Berlin state court said in its ruling that there was no doubt that the then-first lieutenant shot the 38-year-old Polish citizen Czesław Kukuczka in an ambush on March 29, 1974 on behalf of the East German secret police, German news agency dpa reported. 'It was not the act of an individual for personal reasons, but planned and mercilessly executed by the Stasi,' presiding judge Bernd Miczajka said in his sentencing remarks. He said the defendant, whose name was not given in line with German privacy rules, fired the shot 'at the end of a chain of command,' dpa reported. The court fell short of the Berlin public prosecutor’s request for 12 years in prison. The accused’s defense lawyer had demanded an acquittal. According to lawyer Andrea Liebscher, it had not been proven that her client fired the fatal shot, dpa reported. The defendant remained silent in court but his lawyer said at the beginning of the trial that he denied the allegations. The verdict can still be appealed. The case goes back to March 29, 1974, when Kukuczka allegedly took a fake bomb to the Polish Embassy to threaten officials to allow him to leave for West Berlin, and the Stasi decided to pretend it was authorizing his departure. He was provided with exit documents and accompanied to a border crossing at the Friedrichstrasse railway station in East Berlin, according to prosecutors. The defendant — who was 31 at the time — was tasked with rendering the Polish man 'harmless,' prosecutors said. After the Pole had passed the final checkpoint, the suspect allegedly shot him in the back from a hiding place. Authorities made little headway with the case until a decisive tip-off about the identity of the shooter emerged in 2016 from the Stasi’s voluminous archives, dpa reported. Prosecutors initially suspected the case would amount to manslaughter, which unlike murder falls under the statute of limitations in Germany. East Germany built the Berlin Wall in 1961, preventing most of its citizens from traveling to the West. Many tried to escape by tunneling under it, swimming past it, climbing or flying over it. At least 140 people died in the attempt. The heavily fortified border was opened on Nov. 9, 1989, a key moment in the collapse of communism in Europe. Germany was reunited less than a year later.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-poland-stasi-verdict-berlin-border-communist-8cde4b1a8a6537e841977fc4fc442bcf	2024-10-14T03:46:16-07:00	
In Denmark, 50 well-preserved Viking Age skeletons have been unearthed, a rare discovery	AASUM, Denmark (AP) — In a village in central Denmark, archeologists made a landmark discovery that could hold important clues to the Viking era: a burial ground, containing some 50 'exceptionally well-preserved' skeletons. 'This is such an exciting find because we found these skeletons that are so very, very well preserved,' said archeologist Michael Borre Lundø, who led the six-month dig. 'Normally, we would be lucky to find a few teeth in the graves, but here we have entire skeletons.' The skeletons were preserved thanks to favorable soil chemistry, particularly chalk and high water levels, experts from Museum Odense said. The site was discovered last year during a routine survey, ahead of power line renovation work on the outskirts of the village of Aasum, 5 kilometers (3 miles), northeast of Odense, Denmark’s third-largest city. Experts hope to conduct DNA analyses and possibly reconstruct detailed life histories, as well as looking into social patterns in Viking Age, such as kinship, migration patterns and more. 'This opens a whole new toolbox for scientific discovery,' said Borre Lundø as he stood on the muddy, wind-swept excavation site. 'Hopefully we can make a DNA analysis on all the skeletons and see if they are related to each other and even where they come from.' During the Viking Age, considered to run from 793 to 1066 A.D., Norsemen known as Vikings undertook large-scale raids, colonizing, conquering and trading throughout Europe, even reaching North America. The Vikings unearthed at Aasum likely weren’t warriors. Borre Lundø believes the site was probably a 'standard settlement,' perhaps a farming community, located 5 kilometers from a ring fortress in what’s now central Odense. The 2,000-square meter (21,500-square foot) burial ground holds the remains of men, women and children. Besides the skeletons, there are a few cremated bodies. In one grave, a woman is buried in a wagon -- the higher part of a Viking cart was used as a coffin — suggesting she was from the 'upper part of society,' Borre Lundø told The Associated Press. Archeologists also unearthed brooches, necklace beads, knives, and even a small shard of glass that may have served as an amulet. Borre Lundø said the brooch designs suggest the dead were buried between 850 and 900 A.D. 'There’s different levels of burials,' he explained. 'Some have nothing with them, others have brooches and pearl necklaces.' Archeologists say many of the artefacts came from far beyond Denmark’s borders, shedding light on extensive Viking trade routes during the 10th century. 'There’s a lot of trade and commerce going on,' said Borre Lundø. 'We also found a brooch that comes from the island of Gotland, on the eastern side of Sweden, but also whetstones for honing your knife … all sorts of things point to Norway and Sweden.' The burial site was discovered last year, and the dig, which started in April, ended Friday. Boxes of artefacts have shipped to Museum Odense’s preservation labs for cleaning and analysis. Conservator Jannie Amsgaard Ebsen hopes the soil may also hold other preserved organic material on the backs of brooches or knife handles. 'We’re really hoping to gain the larger picture. Who were the people that were living out there? Who did they interact with?' she said. 'It’s a little bit like a jigsaw puzzle: all the various puzzle parts will be placed together.'	https://apnews.com/article/denmark-viking-burial-archeology-skeleton-aasum-dna-b8c29620bb78fd618c1d0f345d4dddfb	2024-10-14T03:30:58-07:00	
French citizen convicted in Russia of collecting military information and gets 3 years in prison	MOSCOW (AP) — A Russian court on Monday convicted a French citizen of collecting military information and sentenced him to three years in prison. Laurent Vinatier, who was arrested in Moscow in June, earlier admitted guilt, setting the stage for a fast-tracked trial. His lawyers’ asked the court to sentence him to a fine. In his remarks before the verdict, Vinatier, speaking Russian, reaffirmed that he fully recognized his guilt and asked the judge for clemency. 'I'm asking the Russian Federation to forgive me for failing to observe Russian laws,' he said. The 48-year-old political scholar said he fell in love with Russia 20 years ago when he began studying the country and concluded his comments with a verse by Russian poet Alexander Pushkin about having patience that better days lie ahead. Detentions on charges of spying and collecting sensitive data have become increasingly frequent in Russia and its heavily politicized legal system since Moscow sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022. Vinatier’s arrest came as tensions flared between Moscow and Paris following French President Emmanuel Macron’s comments about the possibility of deploying French troops in Ukraine. Russian authorities accused Vinatier of failing to register as a 'foreign agent' while collecting information about Russia’s 'military and military-technical activities' that could be used to the detriment of the country’s security. Vinatier is an adviser for the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue, a Switzerland-based nongovernmental organization. It said in June that it was doing 'everything possible to assist' him. The prosecutors charged that Vinatier had collected military information during his meetings with three Russian citizens in Moscow in 2021-22. The Russian citizens weren’t named in the indictment. The charges carried a prison sentence of up to five years, but the prosecutors asked for 3 1/4 years in prison, given that he had fully admitted his guilt and cooperated with investigators. Still, Vinatier’s lawyers argued the sentence sought by prosecutors was too harsh and asked the judge to sentence him to a fine. They pointed at his career as a political scholar who focused on studying Russia and emphasized that his books and articles have been friendly to the country. While asking the judge for clemency, Vinatier pointed at his two children and his elderly parents he has to take care of. The charges against Vinatier relate to a law that requires anyone collecting information on military issues to register with authorities as a foreign agent. Human rights activists have criticized the law and other recent legislation as part of a Kremlin crackdown on independent media and political activists intended to stifle criticism of its actions in Ukraine.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-france-citizen-prison-term-prosecutors-e22cc1df4f0d0dc8d2f87bd6277a26cd	2024-10-14T02:45:20-07:00	
Russia says it captured a southern Ukraine village in a push before winter comes	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia said Monday that it has captured the village of Levadne in southern Ukraine as it probes for weaknesses along the war ’s roughly 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, including in eastern areas that are the main focus of Moscow’s military effort before winter arrives. Ukrainian authorities, meanwhile, reported no nighttime Shahed drone attacks on the country for the first time in about six weeks, after saying five days ago they struck a Shahed storage facility in Russia’s Krasnodar region where around 400 drones reportedly were being kept. Levadne, in the Zaporizhzhia region, was seized by the Russians early on during the full-scale invasion, which began on Feb. 24, 2022, but was recaptured by Ukrainian forces during a counteroffensive in the summer of 2023. Ukrainian officials made no comment about Levadne’s possible capture, though they had previously noted that the Russian army was assembling troops there and was conducting local assaults at the end of last week. Ukraine’s troops are straining to hold back Russia’s military might, especially in the eastern Donetsk region, and don’t have the manpower or weaponry to launch their own offensive. Though Russia’s gains have been incremental, its steady forward movement is slowly adding up as the Ukrainians are pushed backward. Ukraine says it needs more Western help to have a chance of holding back Russia’s invasion. Russia illegally annexed four regions of Ukraine, including Zaporizhzhia, in September 2022. Russian President Vladimir Putin has demanded the withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from all four regions as the main condition for a prospective peace deal — a demand Ukraine and the West have rejected. Last week, the Ukrainian General Staff reported a direct hit on the Shahed drone warehouse inside Russia. 'The destruction of the Shahed drone storage base will significantly reduce the ability of Russian occupiers to terrorize peaceful residents of Ukrainian cities and villages,' it said at the time. Ukrainian officials are keen to show the West that they aren't giving up the fight against their much bigger neighbor. An incursion into Russia’s Kursk border region has put Ukrainian troops on Russian soil for more than two months. The Russians are managing to retake some territory in Kursk but the Ukrainians are capturing even more, according to Oleksandr Kovalenko, a military analyst from Information Resistance, a Kyiv-based think tank. He told The Associated Press that the onset of winter fog and rain will affect the use of drones — an important element in Ukraine’s military strategy. Ukraine has deployed sophisticated long-range drones to strike targets inside Russia, including airfields, oil refineries and ammunition depots. The Ukrainian Main Directorate of Intelligence said Monday that it destroyed a Russian military transport aircraft, a Tu-134, at a military airfield in Russia’s Orenburg region. Russia, meanwhile, struck port infrastructure in the southern Ukrainian city of Odesa with a ballistic missile Monday, killing one person and wounding eight others, as well as damaging two merchant ships, officials said. The attack damaged grain storage facilities, cargo cranes, administrative buildings, port equipment and vehicles, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister for Restoration Oleksii Kuleba said on his Telegram channel. Recent attacks on Odesa port facilities appear intended to disrupt the country’s exports of grains and other food staples. ___ Samya Kullab in Kyiv, Ukraine, contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-zaporizhzhia-shahed-drones-f21d12a3751b76282365ddcc2c9a9fd0	2024-10-14T02:27:20-07:00	
Britain hosts an international investment summit and denies snubbing Elon Musk	LONDON (AP) — Britain’s new Labour Party government announced billions of pounds in investment in U.K. artificial intelligence, life sciences and infrastructure on Monday at a business summit attended by executives from major international companies — though it was the absence of Elon Musk that made headlines. Prime Minister Keir Starmer ’s center-left administration is eager to attract investment into Britain’s sluggish economy and to convince corporations that its push to improve workers’ rights won’t come at the expense of businesses. It also needs to reassure trade unions, key Labour backers, that wooing business won’t come at workers’ expense. Starmer told about 300 executives from banks, investment firms, pharmaceutical companies, tech and media firms and others that after several years of economic and political turmoil and 'policy churn' under the Conservatives, Britain is once again a stable place for investors. 'This is the moment to back Britain,' he said, pledging to oversee a 'hard-headed' industrial strategy and 'galvanize growth' by slashing unnecessary regulation. 'We will rip up the bureaucracy that blocks investment,' Starmer said. Unions worry that may mean lowering standards on health, safety and the environment, a claim the government denies. Technology Secretary Peter Kyle said reducing red tape did not mean 'cutting corners or lowering standards, but making sure that the government takes on some of the burden of compliance so that our nation can benefit.' A sign of the tensions facing the government as it tries to please both employers and employees came after Transport Secretary Louise Haigh last week urged people to boycott P&amp;O Ferries, which in 2022 fired 800 seafarers to replace them with cheaper contract staff. Its parent company, Dubai-based DP World, reportedly threatened to pull out of the investment conference because of the remarks. After Starmer rebuked Haigh and reassured the company that hers was 'not the view of the government,' DP World confirmed Monday it would invest in a 1 billion pound ($1.3 billion) expansion of the London Gateway container port. Other deals announced Monday included a life sciences incubator supported by pharma firm Eli Lilly, several new data centers backed by U.S. firms and an expansion of Stansted Airport near London. Business executives attending the summit were rubbing shoulders with government ministers at London’s magnificent medieval Guildhall before a reception at St. Paul's Cathedral attended by King Charles III, with a performance by Elton John. Not among them was Musk, whose social media platform X was used to spread false information during the anti-immigrant violence that erupted in Britain this summer. Musk himself posted messages insulting Starmer and saying the U.K. was headed for civil war. After the BBC reported in September that Musk would not attend the investment summit, the Space X and Tesla boss posted on X: 'I don’t think anyone should go to the UK when they’re releasing convicted pedophiles in order to imprison people for social media posts.' He was apparently referring to the government’s decision to release hundreds of inmates — though not sex offenders — early because of overcrowded prisons.

Udine on high alert for Italy hosting Israel in Nations League	UDINE, Italy (AP) — There were snipers on the roof of the stadium and a heavy police presence throughout the city of Udine for Italy's match against Israel on Monday. In the end, both the game — and an earlier pro-Palestine demonstration — passed without incident as Italy beat Israel 4-1 in the Nations League. Udine was on high alert, with the game being played against the backdrop of the ongoing conflict in the Middle East which has spread to Lebanon after more than a year-long war in Gaza. It was the first match Israel has played outside neutral Hungary this year. After the Israel-Hamas war started on Oct. 7 last year, the national soccer team played in Kosovo and Andorra last November. All Israel matches since then have been in Hungary, including last month’s game against Belgium in the Nations League after the Belgian Football Association refused to host the game for security reasons. 'We are going to play this match with the hope of convincing ever more people of the wrongness of war,' Italy coach Luciano Spalletti said. 'There are many Israelis who don’t want it and we must convince ever more people that this is something that has to stop.' When Spalletti's team played its 'away' match against Israel last month in Hungary, a group of about 50 Italy fans clad in all black turned their backs in apparent protest during Israel’s national anthem. There were boos from some fans in Udine when the Israeli anthem was played on Monday but the rest of the stadium tried to drown that out with loud applause — just as they had done when the Israel team was read out. At least one Palestinian flag was held up. There was a highly visible group of around a dozen Israel fans and they loudly chanted their support. Fewer than 12,000 tickets were sold for Monday's match — less than half the capacity of the 25,000-seater Stadio Friuli — amid stringent security measures, that also included armed military personnel on the roof of the stadium. Areas around the stadium were blocked off 48 hours before kickoff and declared a 'red zone,' and only fans with tickets could pass through the tall metal barriers. Supporters were strongly advised to arrive early because of rigorous checks. Hundreds of extra police officers were called up from surrounding areas. Around 1,000 people took part in a pro-Palestine demonstration earlier in the city center. Among the placards, there were several posters calling on soccer's governing bodies to ban Israel. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer	https://apnews.com/article/italy-israel-nations-league-db35ac78fcb8ee7d7f4811ced6183bfb	2024-10-14T00:29:37-07:00	
Vial that contained nerve agent that killed UK woman contained enough poison to kill thousands	LONDON (AP) — The lead counsel for a public inquiry into the 2018 death of a British woman poisoned by a Soviet-developed nerve agent said Monday that there was enough poison in the vial she unwittingly opened to kill thousands of people. Dawn Sturgess and her partner collapsed after they came into contact with a discarded perfume bottle containing the nerve agent Novichok in the southwest England town of Amesbury. She had sprayed the contents of the bottle on her wrist and died days later. Her partner survived. 'The evidence will suggest that this bottle — which we shall hear contained enough poison to kill thousands of people — must earlier have been left somewhere in a public place creating the obvious risk that someone would find it and take it home,' lead counsel Andrew O’Connor said. Their exposure came four months after a former Russian intelligence officer, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter were sickened by Novichok in an attack in the nearby city of Salisbury. Britain has blamed Russian intelligence, but Moscow has denied any role. Russian President Vladimir Putin called Skripal, a double agent for the United Kingdom during his espionage days, a 'scumbag' of no interest to the Kremlin because he was exchanged in a spy swap in 2010. The Skripals won't testify during the inquiry out of fear for their safety. But in a witness statement to the inquiry, Skripal said that the attack was a shock because it was 'not honorable'' to kill people who had been exchanged. 'I had received a presidential pardon and was a free man with no convictions under Russian law. I never thought the Russian regime would try to murder me in Great Britain,' Skripal said in a statement read by O'Connor. 'They could have killed me easily if they wanted to when I was in prison.' He said he believed that Putin 'must have at least given permission for the attack.' 'I believe Putin makes all important decisions himself,' his statement said. Heather Hallett, the coroner who held the 2018 inquest into Sturgess’ death, said that a public inquiry was needed to conduct a complete look at how the woman died. Unlike inquests, which are routinely held in cases when the cause of death is unknown or if someone dies violently, public inquiries are allowed to consider sensitive intelligence material. ___ This story has been corrected to show that Sturgess died four months after the attack on the Skripals, not three months.	https://apnews.com/article/britain-russia-poisoned-spy-nerve-agent-d7ae02a79d6be8ed3a1989cbfbf06a86	2024-10-13T23:41:40-07:00	
Nobel economics prize goes to 3 economists who found that freer societies are more likely to prosper	STOCKHOLM (AP) — The Nobel memorial prize in economics was awarded Monday to three economists who have studied why some countries are rich and others poor and have documented that freer, open societies are more likely to prosper. The work by Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson and James A. Robinson 'demonstrated the importance of societal institutions for a country’s prosperity,' the Nobel committee of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said at the announcement in Stockholm. Acemoglu and Johnson work at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, while Robinson does his research at the University of Chicago. Jakob Svensson, chair of the Committee for the Prize in Economic Sciences, said their analysis has provided 'a much deeper understanding of the root causes of why countries fail or succeed.' Reached by the academy in Athens, Greece, where he was to speak at a conference, the Turkish-born Acemoglu, 57, said he was astonished by the award. 'You never expect something like this,' he said. Acemoglu said the research honored by the prize underscores the value of democratic institutions. 'I think broadly speaking the work that we have done favors democracy,' he said in a telephone call with the Nobel committee and reporters in Stockholm. But, he added: 'Democracy is not a panacea. Introducing democracy is very hard. When you introduce elections, that sometimes creates conflict.' In an interview with The Associated Press, Robinson, 64, said he doubts that China can sustain its economic prosperity as long as it keeps a repressive political system. 'There’s many examples in world history of societies like that that do well for 40, 50 years,' Robinson said by phone. 'What you see is that’s never sustainable. ... The Soviet Union did well for 50 or 60 years.'' Robinson said many societies have successfully made the transition to what he, Acemoglu and Johnson call an 'inclusive society.’’ 'Look at the United States,' Robinson said. 'This was a country of slavery, of privilege, where women were not allowed to take part in the economy or vote.' 'Every country that is currently relatively inclusive and open made that transition,' he added. 'In the modern world, you’ve seen that in South Korea, in Taiwan, in Mauritius.’’ Acemoglu and Robinson wrote the 2012 bestseller, 'Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty,' which argued that manmade problems were responsible for keeping countries poor. In their work, the winners looked, for instance, at the city of Nogales, which straddles the U.S.-Mexico border. Despite sharing the same geography, climate and a common culture, life is very different on either side of the border. In Nogales, Arizona, to the north, residents are relatively well-off and live long lives; most children graduate from high school. To the south, in Mexico’s Nogales, Sonora, residents are much poorer, and organized crime and corruption abound. The difference, the economists found, is a U.S. system that protects property rights and gives citizens a say in their government. Acemoglu expressed worry Monday that democratic institutions in the United States and Europe were losing support from the population. 'Support for democracy is at an all-time low, especially in the U.S., but also in Greece and in the UK and France,' Acemoglu said on the sidelines of the conference in an Athens suburb. 'And I think that is a symbol of how people are disappointed with democracy,' he said. 'They think democracy hasn’t delivered what it promised.'' Robinson agreed. 'Clearly, you had an attack on inclusive institutions in this country,' he said. 'You had a presidential candidate who denied that he lost the last election. So President (Donald) Trump rejected the democratic rule of the citizens. ... Of course, I’m worried. I’m a concerned citizen.' Johnson told the AP that economic pressures were alienating many Americans. 'A lot of people who were previously in the middle class were hit very hard by the combination of globalization, automation, the decline of trade unions, and a sort of shift more broadly in corporate philosophy,'' Johnson said. 'So instead of workers being a resource to be developed, which they were in the 19th and early 20th century, they became a cost to be minimized ... Now, that squeezed the middle class.’’ 'We have, as a country, failed to deliver in recent decades on what we were previously very good at, which was sharing prosperity,'' Johnson said. One key for the future, Johnson said, is how societies manage new technologies such as artificial intelligence. 'AI could go either way,' he said. 'AI could either empower people with a lot of education, make them more highly skilled, enable them to do more tasks and get more pay. Or it could be another massive wave of automation that pushes the remnants of the middle down to the bottom. And then, yes, you’re not going to like the political outcomes.’’ In their work, the economists studied institutions that European powers such as Britain and Spain put in place when they colonized much of the world starting in the 1600s. They brought different policies to different places, giving later researchers a 'natural experiment' to analyze. Colonies that were sparsely populated offered less resistance to foreign rule and therefore attracted more settlers. In those places, colonial governments tended to establish more inclusive economic institutions that 'incentivized settlers to work hard and invest in their new homeland. In turn, this led to demands for political rights that gave them a share of profits,' the Nobel committee said. In more densely populated places that attracted fewer settlers, the colonial regimes limited political rights and set up institutions that focused on 'benefiting a local elite at the expense of the wider population,' it said. 'Paradoxically, this means that the parts of the colonized world that were relatively the most prosperous around 500 years ago are now those that are relatively poor,' it added, noting that India’s industrial production exceeded the American colonies’ in the 18th century. The economics prize is formally known as the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. The central bank established it in 1968 as a memorial to Nobel, the 19th-century Swedish businessman and chemist who invented dynamite and established the five Nobel Prizes. Though Nobel purists stress that the economics prize is technically not a Nobel Prize, it is always presented together with the others on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death in 1896. Nobel honors were announced last week in medicine, physics, chemistry, literature and peace. ___ Corder reported from The Hague, Netherlands, and Wiseman from Washington.

Israeli strike on hospital tent camp kills 4 and ignites a fire that burns dozens	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — An Israeli airstrike on a hospital courtyard in the Gaza Strip early Monday killed at least four people and triggered a fire that swept through a tent camp for people displaced by the war, leaving more than two dozen with severe burns, according to Palestinian medics. The Israeli military said it targeted militants hiding out among civilians, without providing evidence. In recent months it has repeatedly struck crowded shelters and tent camps, alleging that Hamas fighters were using them as staging grounds for attacks. The Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the central city of Deir al-Balah was already struggling to treat a large number of wounded from an earlier strike on a school-turned-shelter that killed at least 20 people when the early morning airstrike hit and fire engulfed many of the tents. Several secondary explosions could be heard after the initial strike, but it was not immediately clear if they were caused by weapons or fuel tanks. Associated Press footage showed children among the wounded. A man sobbed as he carried a toddler with a bandaged head in his arms. Another small child with a bandaged leg was given a blood transfusion on the floor of the packed hospital. Hospital records showed that four people were killed and 40 wounded. Twenty-five people were transferred to the Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza after suffering severe burns, according to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. Israel is still carrying out near-daily strikes across the Gaza Strip more than a year into the war, and has been waging a major ground assault in the north, where it says militants have regrouped. The war began when Hamas attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, while Palestinian militants abducted around 250 hostages. Around 100 are still being held inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many were fighters but says women and children make up more than half the fatalities. Around 90% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million people have been displaced by the war, often multiple times, and large areas of the coastal territory have been completely destroyed. Israel has ordered the entire remaining population of the northern third of Gaza, estimated at around 400,000 people, to evacuate to the south and has not allowed any food to enter the north since the start of the month. Hundreds of thousands of people from the north heeded Israeli evacuation orders at the start of the war and have not been allowed to return. That has raised fears among Palestinians that Israel intends to implement a plan devised by former generals in which it would order all civilians out of northern Gaza and label anyone remaining there a combatant — a surrender-or-starve strategy that rights groups say would violate international law. The plan has been presented to the Israeli government, but it's unclear whether it has been adopted. With no end in sight to the war in Gaza, Israel is also waging an air and ground war in southern Lebanon against the Hezbollah militant group, an ally of Hamas that has been firing rockets into northern Israel for more than a year. Israel has also threatened to strike Iran in retaliation for a ballistic missile attack, raising the prospect of an all-out regionwide war. A Hezbollah aerial attack on an army base in northern Israel killed four soldiers — all of them 19 years old — and severely wounded seven others Sunday, the military said, in the deadliest strike by the militant group since Israel launched its ground invasion of Lebanon nearly two weeks ago. Hezbollah called the attack near Binyamina city retaliation for Israeli strikes on Beirut on Thursday that killed 22 people. It said it targeted Israel’s elite Golani brigade, launching dozens of missiles to occupy Israeli air defense systems during the assault by drones. Israel’s national rescue service said the attack wounded 61. It’s rare for so many people to be wounded by drones or missiles, most of which are intercepted by Israel's multitiered air defenses or fall in open areas. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo. ___ Find more of AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-lebanon-hezbollah-news-10-14-2024-70c8cf5a93eec9ea643a5fda5670da93	2024-10-13T21:30:26-07:00

Stock market today: Asian shares gain after China says more help is needed for its slowing economy	BANGKOK (AP) — Asian shares gained ground on Monday, with stocks in China rising more than 2% after the finance minister said over the weekend that more stimulus is needed for the slowing economy. U.S. futures were little changed and oil prices retreated. China’s finance minister, Lan Foan, said Saturday that the government was considering additional ways to boost the economy, but he didn’t give details of a major new stimulus plan. Stock investors and analysts have been hoping for a plan of up to 2 trillion yuan, or about $280 billion. But any expressions of support by officials tend to push share prices higher, and the 'national team' of big state-run companies and financial institutions tend to weigh in with stock purchases to help stabilize markets, analysts say. 'The devil, as they say, is always in the details — or in this case, the glaring lack of them. When it comes to Chinese policy briefings, it’s usually all sizzle and no steak,' Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary. 'By mid-week, we’ll see if the market bid has legs, and by month’s end, we’ll know for sure if Beijing is delivering the goods or if it’s just more smoke and mirrors.' The Shanghai Composite index rose 2.1% to 3,284.32 and the smaller market in Shenzhen gained 3%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index lost 0.9% to 21,061.23. China reported that consumer inflation weakened in September and that wholesale prices fell further, reflecting continued weakness in domestic demand that has spurred the government into a flurry of measures meant to revive falling housing sales and other spending. Large-scale Chinese military exercises surrounding Taiwan and its outlying islands on Monday appeared to have scant impact on markets. Taiwan's Taiex was up 0.3%. Tokyo's markets were closed for a public holiday. In South Korea, the Kospi added 1% to 2,623.29, while Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 picked up 0.5% to 8,252.80. The advance in Asia followed a strong close on Friday on Wall Street as U.S. stocks rose to records, lifted by strong profits at big banks. The S&amp;P 500 climbed 0.6% to 5,815.03, topping its all-time high set earlier in the week and closing out its fifth straight winning week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 1% to set its own record, at 42,863.86. The Nasdaq composite lagged the market with a gain of 0.3% after a slide for Tesla kept it in check. It closed at 18,342.94. Wells Fargo rose 5.6% after reporting stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. JPMorgan Chase climbed 4.4% after reporting a milder drop in profit than analysts feared. It was the strongest single force pushing upward on the S&amp;P 500. BlackRock, meanwhile, rose 3.6% after likewise delivering better profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The investment giant ended September managing a record $11.5 trillion in total assets for its customers. The gains for banks helped make up for Tesla's 8.8% tumble after the electric-vehicle maker unveiled its long-awaited robotaxi on Thursday night. Critics highlighted a lack of details about its planned rollout. Following the unveiling of the 'Cybercab,' potential rival Uber Technologies jumped 10.8% and was one of the strongest forces lifting the S&amp;P 500. Lyft rose 9.6%. In the bond market, Treasury yields were mixed following the latest updates on inflation at the wholesale level and on sentiment among U.S. consumers. Prices paid by producers were 1.8% higher in September than a year earlier, improved but not by as much as economists expected. In other dealings early Monday, U.S. benchmark crude oil lost $1.23 to $74.33 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard, fell $1.26 to $77.78 per barrel. The dollar rose to 149.30 Japanese yen from 149.08 late Friday. The euro fell to $1.0928 from $1.0935.	https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-rates-china-3eea0bd848ea1fe6dd788930c17027eb	2024-10-13T20:08:10-07:00	
Pakistan hosts a major security meeting this week as it struggles against rising insurgent violence	ISLAMABAD (AP) — Pakistan is hosting a major security meeting this week, with senior leaders from longtime ally China and archrival India among those attending. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization was established in 2001 by China and Russia to discuss security concerns in Central Asia and the wider region. But it’s Pakistan’s own security that is under the microscope. An attack on a foreign ambassadors’ convoy, violent protests by supporters of an imprisoned former prime minister, and a bombing outside Pakistan’s biggest airport are signs the country is struggling to contain multiplying threats from insurgents. The meeting, which begins Tuesday in Islamabad, comes at a crucial time for the government. Here’s why: Armed groups are outpacing the army Pakistan says it has foiled attacks through intelligence-based operations and preventative measures. It frequently vows 'to root out terrorism.' But the frequency and scale of the recent violence give the impression that the government isn’t in control and raises questions about its ability to protect key sites and foreigners, let alone Pakistanis. In the last few weeks, separatists from Pakistan's southwest Balochistan province have killed Chinese nationals in Karachi, Pakistan’s biggest city, as well as more than 20 miners in an attack on housing at a coal mine, and seven workers in another attack. The outlawed Baloch Liberation Army, or BLA, is better at mobilizing fighters in different areas and its operational capabilities have increased. The group wants independence for the province. It’s not interested in overthrowing the state to establish a caliphate, which is what the Pakistani Taliban want. But the two groups have a common enemy -- the government. Analysts have said the BLA is getting support from the Pakistani Taliban. But, even without an alliance, attacks in the southwest are becoming more audacious and brutal, indicating that the BLA’s tactics are evolving and taking the security apparatus by surprise. The Pakistani Taliban continue their shootings and bombings in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, which borders Afghanistan. It could be difficult for militants to hit the meeting, given the security around it and the areas where delegates will stay. But they could still wreak havoc. Vehicles are often just waved through street checkpoints in Islamabad. Aside from government buildings and top hotels, body searches and under-vehicle scanners are rare. 'At stake for the entire state is the only mission -- how to hold such an event peacefully,' said Imtiaz Gul, the executive director of the Center for Research and Security Studies. 'How to get it done without any unpleasant incidents taking place. It’s going to be a formidable challenge for the government to disprove the notion of failures within the security apparatus.' Pakistan is paying the price for shutdowns Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said last week that the national economy suffered cumulative daily losses of more than $684 million on account of recent agitation. He was referring to supporters of former Prime Minister Imran Khan reaching the heart of the capital, despite a suspension of cellphone service and placement of shipping containers at access points to the city. The shutdown hit most business sectors, the gig economy, point-of-sale transactions, commuters, students, workers and more. Pakistan can’t afford to incur such losses or deepen people’s grievances. It relies on International Monetary Fund bailouts and multibillion-dollar deals and loans from friendly countries to meet its economic needs. There are regular protests over energy bills and the cost of living. Despite people's hardships, authorities have declared a three-day holiday surrounding the meeting. There have been reports of the government ordering the closure of wedding halls, restaurants, hotels, cafes and markets in Islamabad and the neighboring garrison city Rawalpindi for security reasons. Officials denied the reports, but not very strenuously. 'Generally, high-profile conferences are meant to promote connectivity, trade and improve a country’s image,' said Gul. But not in this case because Islamabad won't look like a normal city, he said. 'It seems they lack innovative thinking,' Gul said. 'They are unable to use smart approaches and that’s why the easier way is to shut everything down.' A seat at the table and saving face The last time Pakistan hosted a major conference was in March 2022, a month before Khan was kicked out of office and a new cycle of upheaval started. The country's security situation and political instability are two factors that have prevented it from holding big international events. Even its best-loved sport, cricket, has suffered. There was a 10-year absence of test matches after terrorists ambushed a Sri Lanka team bus in 2009, killing eight people and injuring players and officials. The meeting is Pakistan’s chance to shine, especially in front of its neighbor China, to whom it is in hock by several billion dollars and whose nationals are prime targets for armed groups, as well as India, which is sending its foreign minister to the country for the first time since 2015. India and Pakistan have fought three wars and built up their armies but also developed nuclear weapons. China and India fought a war over their border in 1962. Pakistan, unused to hosting such a high-level meeting, will have to put its best face forward. Senior defense analyst Abdullah Khan said the government wants to show its international legitimacy amid the domestic crises. 'The presence of heads of state and other senior officials will itself be a success as Pakistan will come out of its so-called isolation,' said Khan. 'A peacefully held SCO will further improve the country’s image.' ___ Associated Press writer Munir Ahmed contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-security-shanghai-cooperation-organization-summit-b155bbf6ca89227803545b96e3525dd9	2024-10-13T20:05:33-07:00	
Ailing and silenced in prison, Belarus activist symbolizes the nation's repression	TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — The last time any of Maria Kolesnikova's family had contact with the imprisoned Belarusian opposition activist was more than 18 months ago. Fellow inmates at the penal colony reported hearing her plead for medical help from inside her tiny and smelly cell. Her father, Alexander Kolesnikov, told The Associated Press by phone from Minsk that he knows she's seriously ill and tried to visit her several months ago at the facility near Gomel, where she is serving an 11-year sentence, but has failed whenever he goes there. On his last attempt, he said the warden told him, 'If she doesn't call or doesn't write, that means she doesn't want to.' The 42-year-old musician-turned-activist is known to have been hospitalized in Gomel in May or June, but the outcome was unclear, said a former prisoner who identified herself only as Natalya because she feared retaliation from authorities. 'I can only pray to God that she is still alive,' Kolesnikov said in an interview. 'The authorities are ignoring my requests for a meeting and for letters — it is a terrible feeling of impotence for a father.' Kolesnikova gained prominence when mass protests erupted in Belarus after the widely disputed August 2020 election gave authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko a sixth term in office. With her close-cropped hair, broad smile and a gesture of forming her outstretched hands into the shape of a heart, she often was seen at the front of the demonstrations. She became an even greater symbol of defiance in September of that year when Belarusian authorities tried to deport her. Driven to the Ukrainian border, she briefly broke away from security forces in the neutral zone at the frontier and tore up her passport, then walked back into Belarus. She was convicted a year later of charges including conspiracy to seize power. Natalya, whose cell was next to Kolesnikova’s before being released in August, said she had not heard her talking to guards for six months. Other inmates heard Kolesnikova's pleas for medical assistance, she said, but reported that doctors did not come for 'a very long time.' In November 2022, Kolesnikova was moved to an intensive care ward to undergo surgery for a perforated ulcer. Other prisoners become aware of her movements because 'it feels like martial law has been declared' in the cellblock, Natalya said. 'Other prisoners are strictly forbidden not only to talk, but even to exchange glances with Maria.' Her sister, Tatiana Khomich, said she was told by former inmates that the 5-foot-9-inch Kolesnikova weighed only about 45 kilograms (100 pounds). 'They are slowly killing Maria, and I consider that this is a critical period because no one can survive in such conditions,' said Khomich, who lives outside Belarus. The last time Kolesnikova wrote from prison was in February 2023. Letters to her 'are ripped up before her eyes by prison personnel,' her sister said, relaying accounts from other former inmates. Kolesnikova, who before the 2020 protests was a classical flautist who was especially knowledgable about baroque music, is one of several major Lukashenko opponents to disappear behind bars. The prisons department of the Belarusian Interior Ministry refused to comment on Kolesnikova’s case. The U.N. Human Rights Committee has repeatedly demanded Belarusian authorities take 'urgent protective measures' in relation to Kolesnikova and other political prisoners held incommunicado. In September, the European Parliament demanded that Belarus release all political prisoners. Former inmates say Kolesnikova wore a yellow tag that indicates a political prisoner. That marks them for additional abuse by guards and officials, rights advocates say. The human rights group Viasna counts about 1,300 political prisoners in Belarus, including the group's Nobel Peace Prize-winning founder, Ales Bialiatsky. At least six have died behind bards. 'It was too late to save Alexei Navalny (from prison in Russia), and it was too late for six people in Belarus. We and the Western world don't have much time to save Maria's life,' Khomich said. Amnesty International has begun a campaign to raise awareness about Kolesnikova's fate, urging people to take up her plight with Western officials and politicians. Other prominent opposition figures who are imprisoned and have not been heard from in a year or more include Siarhei Tsikhanouski, who planned to challenge Lukashenko in the 2020 election but was imprisoned; his wife, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, took his place on the ballot and was forced to leave the country the day after the vote. Aspiring opposition candidate Viktar Babaryka also was imprisoned before the election as his popularity among prospective voters soared. Kolesnikova was his campaign manager but then joined forces with Tsikhanouskaya. Prominent opposition figure Mikola Statkevich and Kolesnikova's lawyer, Maxim Znak, are imprisoned and have not contacted the outside world since the winter of 2023. Lukashenko denies Belarus has any political prisoners. At the same time, in recent months he has unexpectedly released 115 prisoners whose cases had political elements; those released had health problems, wrote petitions for pardons and repented. Belarus is deeply integrated with Russia and some observers believe Lukashenko is concerned about the extent of his dependence on Moscow, hoping to restore some ties with the EU by releasing political prisoners ahead of a presidential election next year. 'Minsk is returning to the practice of bargaining with the West to try to soften sanctions and achieve at least partial recognition of the results of the upcoming presidential election,' said Belarusian analyst Alexander Friedman. 'Lukashenko’s regime is interested in not becoming part of Russia and therefore wants at least some communication with the West, offering to talk about political prisoners' Lukashenko’s critics and human rights activists say they see no real change in government policy, since all leading pro-democracy figures are still behind bars and authorities have seized three times as many opposition activists to refill the prisons. 'It is difficult to consider these pardons as a real thaw, since the repressions continue, but the West should encourage Lukashenko to continue releasing political prisoners,' Khomich said. 'The regime is sending clear signals to Western countries about its readiness to release people, and it's very important that (the signal) is heard, and the opportunity is seized.'	https://apnews.com/article/lukashenko-belarus-crackdown-viasna-4c81e46b1ebba8924306c541fb7170db	2024-10-13T19:09:46-07:00	
North Korea is preparing to destroy northern parts of inter-Korean roads, Seoul says	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea said Monday it has detected signs that North Korea is preparing to destroy the northern parts of inter-Korean roads no longer in use, as the rivals are embroiled in soaring tensions over North Korea’s claim that South Korea flew drones over its territory. Destroying the roads would be in line with leader Kim Jong Un’s push to cut off ties with South Korea, formally cement it as his country's principal enemy and abandon the North's decades-long objective to seek a peaceful Korean unification. South Korea's military said Monday that it was observing various activities in North Korea that appeared to be preparations for demolishing the roads, such as installing screens. 'They have installed screens on the road and are working behind those screens, preparing to blow up the roads,' Lee Sung Joon, spokesperson of South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a briefing. He said the demolitions could be carried out as early as Monday. Lee said that the South Korean military believes that the North could also attempt to launch a space rocket, which is viewed by the U.N. as a banned test of long-range missile technology. Lee said North Korea may conduct unspecified 'small provocations' to ramp up pressure on Seoul. It’s not clear how much parts of the roads North Korea would destroy. The development comes as North Korea has recently accused South Korea of launching drones to drop propaganda leaflets over Pyongyang three times this month and threatened to respond with force if it happened again. South Korea has refused to confirm whether it sent drones but warned it would sternly punish North Korea if the safety of its citizens is threatened. In a statement Sunday, the North’s Defense Ministry said that the military had ordered artillery and other army units near the border with South Korea to 'get fully ready to open fire.' The spokesperson said that the entire South Korean territory 'might turn into piles of ashes' following the North’s powerful attack. North Korea often releases warlike rhetoric when animosities with its rivals increase. Experts say it's highly unlikely for North Korea to launch full-scale, preemptive attacks as it military is outmatched by the combined U.S. and South Korean forces. Koo Byoungsam, a spokesperson of South Korea’s Unification Ministry, said Monday that North Korea’s accusation on South Korean drone flights was likely aimed at creating tensions to reinforce its internal unity while stoking instability in South Korea. Koo said North Korea cannot win what it wants from South Korea with threats and provocations. Some observers say anti-Pyongyang activists might have sent drones this month, but North Korea argues the South Korean government cannot still escape responsibility because it must have been aware of such moves. In 2022, South Korea sent surveillance drones across the border into North Korea after it accused North Korea of flying drones into South Korea for the first time in five years. Last week, North Korea said it will permanently block its border with South Korea and build front-line defense structures to cope with 'confrontational hysteria' by South Korean and U.S. forces. It cited various military exercises in South Korea and the temporary deployments of powerful U.S. military assets in South Korea. South Korean officials said North Korea had already been adding anti-tank barriers, planting mines and reinforcing roads on its side of the border since earlier this year in a likely attempt to boost its front-line security posture and prevent its soldiers and citizens from defecting to South Korea. Tensions on the Korean Peninsula are at their highest point in years, with North Korea continuing a run of provocative missile tests and South Korea and the U.S. expanding their military drills. Observers say North Korea could perform major weapons tests ahead of next month’s U.S. presidential election to increase its leverage in future diplomacy with the Americans. In January, Kim Jong Un ordered the revision of North Korea's constitution to remove the goal of a peaceful Korean unification, formally designate South Korea as the country’s 'invariable principal enemy' and define the North’s sovereign, territorial sphere. Kim’s order stunned many North Korea watchers because it was seen as breaking away with his predecessors’ long-cherished dreams of peacefully achieving a unified Korea on the North’s terms. Experts say Kim likely aims to diminish South Korea’s voice in the regional nuclear standoff and seek direct dealings with the U.S. They say Kim also likely hopes to diminish South Korean cultural influence and bolster his rule at home.	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-roads-destroy-tensions-drones-072433677101dc38e30bb65f908ec631	2024-10-13T17:19:01-07:00

China holds large naval and air force exercises around Taiwan as a warning against independence	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — China held large-scale military exercises surrounding Taiwan and its outlying islands Monday in what it called a warning against Taiwan independence. China’s Defense Ministry said the drills were a response to Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te’s refusal to concede to Beijing’s demands that Taiwan acknowledge itself as a part of the People’s Republic of China under the rule of the Communist Party. Taiwan’s Defense Ministry called the drills a provocation and said its forces were prepared to respond. The PLA’s Eastern Theater Command spokesperson Navy Senior Captain Li Xi said the navy, army air force, missile corps were all mobilized for the drills. 'This is a major warning to those who back Taiwan independence and a signifier of our determination to safeguard our national sovereignty,' Li said in a statement on the service’s public media channel. Taiwan was a Japanese colony before being unified with China at the end of World War II. It split away in 1949 when Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists fled to the island as Mao Zedong's Communists swept to power on the mainland. Lai took office in May, continuing the eight-year rule of the Democratic Progressive Party that rejects China’s demand that it recognize Taiwan is a part of China. China routinely states that Taiwan independence is a 'dead end' and that annexation by Beijing is a historical inevitability.	https://apnews.com/article/taiwan-china-military-drills-053fbadaf1125be4adfee7a7e6d1ce79	2024-10-13T16:15:45-07:00

Pakistani police fire tear gas and charge protesters in Karachi	KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) — Pakistani police fired tear gas and swung batons at thousands of protesters on Sunday in Karachi after the demonstrators tried to break through a security barricade. Around 2,000 supporters of a far-right Islamist party tried to reach the city’s press club to oppose a another demonstration staged by civil society groups about the killing of a blasphemy suspect while he was in custody. Supporters of the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan party hurled rocks at officers and torched a patrol car when police stopped them from reaching the press club. The party said one of its members died in the violence. Police arrested around 20 people from both demonstrations. Provincial Interior Minister Zia Ul Hassan said authorities feared clashes because both the political party and the civil society groups had issued calls for protests on the same day. Ul Hassan condemned the violence, especially given an upcoming security summit in Islamabad and last week’s deadly attack on a convoy of Chinese nationals outside the city's airport. The TLP supports Pakistan's controversial blasphemy laws, which call for the death penalty for anyone who insults Islam.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-protest-police-clash-karachi-8adf76efe4396cf70c21494c5d963c51	2024-10-13T08:09:30-07:00	
US will send a missile defense system and troops to run it to Israel to aid defense against Iran	WASHINGTON (AP) — The United States will send a T erminal High Altitude Area Defense battery to Israel, along with the troops needed to operate it, the Pentagon said Sunday, even as Iran warned Washington to keep American military forces out of Israel. Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin authorized the deployment of the THAAD battery at the direction of President Joe Biden. He said the system will help bolster Israel's air defenses following Iran’s ballistic missile attacks on Israel in April and October. The delivery of the sophisticated missile defense system risks further inflaming the conflict in the Middle East despite widespread diplomatic efforts to avoid an all-out war. The Iranian warning came in a post on the social platform X long associated with Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who noted the earlier reports that the U.S. was considering the deployment. Israeli forces and Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon have been clashing since Oct. 8, 2023, when the Lebanese militant group began firing rockets over the border in support of its ally Hamas in Gaza. Late last month, Israel launched a ground invasion into Lebanon. Israel is widely believed to be preparing a military response to Iran’s Oct. 1 attack when it fired roughly 180 missiles into Israel. In a brief exchange with reporters before leaving Florida on Sunday, Biden said he agreed to deploy the THAAD battery 'to defend Israel.' Biden spoke at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa after making a quick visit to to see the damage caused by Hurricane Milton and meet with first responders, residents and local leaders. Ryder, in his statement, said the deployment 'underscores the United States’ ironclad commitment to the defense of Israel, and to defend Americans in Israel, from any further ballistic missile attacks by Iran.' It was not immediately clear where the THAAD battery was coming from or when it will arrive. Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, an Israeli army spokesman, declined to provide any timeline for its arrival, but thanked the U.S. for its support. The U.S. deployed one of the batteries to the Middle East along with additional Patriot battalions to bolster protections for U.S. forces in the region late last year after the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel by Hamas militants. Ryder also said that the U.S. sent a THAAD battery to Israel in 2019 for training. It also is not unusual for the U.S. to have a limited number of troops in Israel, which the U.S. considers a key regional ally. There generally has been a small number of forces there consistently as well as routine rotational deployments for training and exercises. The THAAD will add another layer to Israel's already significant air defenses, which include separate systems designed to intercept long-range, medium-range and short-range threats. Israel recently retired its U.S.-made Patriot systems after decades of use. According to an April report by the Congressional Research Service, the Army has seven THAAD batteries. Generally each consists of six truck-mounted launchers, 48 interceptors, radio and radar equipment and requires 95 soldiers to operate. The THAAD is considered a complementary system to the Patriot, but it can defend a wider area. It can hit targets at ranges of 150 to 200 kilometers (93 to 124 miles), and is used to destroy short-range, medium-range and limited intermediate-range ballistic missile threats that are either inside or outside the atmosphere. The U.S. Missile Defense Agency is responsible for developing the system, but it is operated by the Army. An eighth system has been funded and ordered and is expected to be in the field sometime next year. ____ Associated Press writers Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, Aamer Madhani in Tampa, Florida, and Josef Federman in Jerusalem contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/thaad-israel-missile-defense-iran-pentagon-34a0b06d82352df6cb0b80d94d4913c8	2024-10-13T07:14:19-07:00	
North Korea says front-line units ready to strike South Korea if more drones appear	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea said Sunday its front-line army units are ready to launch strikes on South Korea, ramping up pressure on its rival that it said flew drones and dropped leaflets over its capital Pyongyang. South Korea has refused to confirm whether it sent drones but warned it would sternly punish North Korea if the safety of its citizens is threatened. North Korea on Friday accused South Korea of launching drones to drop propaganda leaflets over Pyongyang three times this month and threatened to respond with force if it happened again. In a statement carried by state media Sunday, the North’s Defense Ministry said that the military had issued a preliminary operation order to artillery and other army units near the border with South Korea to 'get fully ready to open fire.' An unidentified ministry spokesperson said the North Korea’s military ordered relevant units to fully prepare for situations like launching immediate strikes on unspecified enemy targets when South Korea infiltrates drones across the border again, possibly triggering fighting on the Korean Peninsula, according to the statement. The spokesperson said that 'grave touch-and-go military tensions are prevailing on the Korean Peninsula' because of the South Korean drone launches. In a separate statement later Sunday, the spokesperson said that the entire South Korean territory 'might turn into piles of ashes' following the North's powerful attack. Also Sunday, the powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un described as 'suicidal' the South Korean Defense Ministry’s reported warning that North Korea would face the end of its regime if it harms South Korean nationals. She warned Saturday that the discovery of a new South Korean drone will 'certainly lead to a horrible disaster.' North Korea often issues such fiery, blistering rhetoric in times of elevated animosities with South Korea and the United States. Ties between the two Koreas remain tense since a U.S.-led diplomacy on ending North Korea's nuclear program fell apart in 2019. North Korea has since pushed hard to expand its nuclear arsenal and repeatedly threatened to attack South Korea and the U.S. with its nuclear weapons. But experts say it's unlikely for North Korea to launch a full-blown attack because its military is outpaced by the combined U.S. and South Korean forces. Observers predicted North Korea would escalate tensions ahead of next month's U.S. presidential election to boost its leverage in future diplomacy with the Americans. Since May, North Korea has floated thousands of balloons carrying rubbish toward South Korea in retaliation for South Korean activists flying their own balloons carrying anti-Pyongyang leaflets. South Korea’s military responded to the North’s balloon campaign by restarting border loudspeakers to blare broadcast propaganda and K-pop songs to North Korea. North Korea is extremely sensitive to any outside criticism of the authoritarian government of Kim Jong Un and his family’s dynastic rule.	https://apnews.com/article/north-south-korea-drones-c923535e6f414674593d74ff935adf41	2024-10-13T07:00:57-07:00	
Netanyahu mulls plan to empty northern Gaza of civilians and cut off aid to those left inside	JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is examining a plan to seal off humanitarian aid to northern Gaza in an attempt to starve out Hamas militants, a plan that, if implemented, could trap without food or water hundreds of thousands of Palestinians unwilling or unable to leave their homes. Israel has issued many evacuation orders for the north throughout the yearlong war, the most recent of which was Sunday. The plan proposed to Netanyahu and the Israeli parliament by a group of retired generals would escalate the pressure, giving Palestinians a week to leave the northern third of the Gaza Strip, including Gaza City, before declaring it a closed military zone. Those who remain would be considered combatants — meaning military regulations would allow troops to kill them — and denied food, water, medicine and fuel, according to a copy of the plan given to The Associated Press by its chief architect, who says the plan is the only way to break Hamas in the north and pressure it to release the remaining hostages. The plan calls for Israel to maintain control over the north for an indefinite period to attempt to create a new administration without Hamas, splitting the Gaza Strip in two. There has been no decision by the government to fully carry out the so-called 'Generals’ Plan,' and it is unclear how strongly it's being considered. When asked if the evacuation orders in northern Gaza marked the first stages of the 'Generals' Plan,' Israeli military spokesperson Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani said no. 'We have not received a plan like that,' he added. But one official with knowledge of the matter said parts of the plan are already being implemented, without specifying which parts. A second official, who is Israeli, said Netanyahu 'had read and studied' the plan, 'like many plans that have reached him throughout the war,' but didn't say whether any of it had been adopted. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity, because the plan isn't supposed to be discussed publicly. On Sunday, Israel launched an offensive against Hamas fighters in the Jabaliya refugee camp north of the city. No trucks of food, water or medicine have entered the north since Sept. 30, according to the U.N. and the website of the Israeli military agency overseeing humanitarian aid crossings. The U.S. State Department spokesperson has said Washington is against any plan that would bring direct Israeli occupation in Gaza. Human rights groups fear the plan's potential toll on civilians Human rights groups say the plan would likely starve civilians and that it flies in the face of international law, which prohibits using food as a weapon and forcible transfers. Accusations that Israel is intentionally limiting food to Gaza are central to the genocide case brought against it at the International Court of Justice, charges Israel denies. So far, very few Palestinians have heeded the latest evacuation order. Some are older, sick or afraid to leave their homes, but many fear there’s nowhere safe to go and that they will never be allowed back. Israel has prevented those who fled earlier in the war from returning. 'All Gazans are afraid of the plan,' said Jomana Elkhalili, a 26-year-old Palestinian aid worker for Oxfam living in Gaza City with her family. 'Still, they will not flee. They will not make the mistake again ... We know the place there is not safe,' she said, referring to southern Gaza, where most of the population is huddled in dismal tent camps and airstrikes often hit shelters. 'That’s why people in the north say it’s better to die than to leave.' The plan has emerged as Hamas has shown enduring strength, firing rockets into Tel Aviv and regrouping in areas after Israeli troops withdraw, bringing repeated offensives. After a year of devastating war with Hamas, Israel has far fewer ground troops in Gaza than it did a few months ago and in recent weeks has turned its attention to Hezbollah, launching an invasion of southern Lebanon. There is no sign of progress on a cease-fire in either front. Israel’s offensive on the strip has killed more than 42,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants, but says more than half of the dead are women and children. People in northern Gaza could be forced to ‘surrender or starve’ The Generals’ Plan was presented to the parliament last month by a group of retired generals and high-ranking officers, according to publicly available minutes. Since then, officials from the prime minister’s office called seeking more details, according to its chief architect, Giora Eiland, a former head of the National Security Council. Israeli media reported that Netanyahu told a closed parliamentary defense committee session that he was considering the plan. Eiland said the only way to stop Hamas and bring an end to the yearlong war is to prevent its access to aid. 'They will either have to surrender or to starve,' Eiland said. 'It doesn’t necessarily mean that we’re going to kill every person,' he said. 'It will not be necessary. People will not be able to live there (the north). The water will dry up.' He believes the siege could force Hamas to release some 100 Israeli hostages still being held by the group since its Oct. 7 attack that triggered Israel’s campaign. At least 30 of the hostages are presumed dead. Human rights groups are appalled. 'I’m most concerned by how the plan seems to say that if the population is given a chance to evacuate and they don’t, then somehow they all turn into legitimate military targets, which is absolutely not the case,' said Tania Hary, executive director of Gisha, an Israeli organization dedicated to protecting Palestinians’ right to move freely within Gaza. The copy of the plan shared with the AP says that if the strategy is successful in northern Gaza, it could then be replicated in other areas, including tent camps further to the south sheltering hundreds of thousands of Palestinians. When asked about the plan Wednesday, U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said the U.S. was going to 'make absolutely clear that it’s not just the United States that opposes any occupation of Gaza, any reduction in the size of Gaza, but it is the virtual unanimous opinion of the international community.' In northern Gaza, aid has dried up and people are trapped The north, including Gaza City, was the initial target of Israel’s ground offensive early in the war, when it first ordered everyone there to leave. Entire neighborhoods have been reduced to rubble since then. A senior U.N. official said that no aid, except for one small shipment of fuel for hospitals, has entered the north since Sept. 30, whether through crossings from Israel or from southern Gaza. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential information. COGAT, the Israeli body facilitating aid crossings into Gaza, denied that crossings to the north have been closed, but didn't respond when asked how many trucks have entered in recent days. The U.N. official said that only about 100 Palestinians have fled the north since Sunday. 'At least 400,000 people are trapped in the area,' Philippe Lazzarini, head of the U.N.’s agency for Palestinian refugees, wrote on X Thursday. 'With almost no basic supplies available, hunger is spreading.' Troops have already cut off roads between Gaza City and areas further north, making it difficult for people to flee, said two doctors in the far north — Mohammed Salha, director of al-Awda Hospital, and Dr. Rana Soloh, at Kamal Adwan Hospital. 'North Gaza is now divided into two parts,' Soloh said. 'There are checkpoints and inspections, and not everyone can cross easily.' ___ Melanie Lidman contributed to this report from Jerusalem.	https://apnews.com/article/hamas-israel-generals-plan-eiland-gaza-219d7eb9a3050e281ccc032d5a56263c	2024-10-13T04:46:33-07:00	
Middle East latest: US says it will send THAAD defense battery to Israel, along with US troops	The U.S. is sending a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery to Israel, along with US troops to operate it. The Pentagon made the announcement just hours after Iran warned the U.S. to keep its military forces out of Israel. Israel is widely believed to be preparing a military response to Iran's Oct. 1 attack when it fired roughly 180 missiles into Israel. Israel has been escalating its campaign against Hezbollah with waves of heavy airstrikes across Lebanon and a ground invasion at the border after a year of exchanges of fire. Israel is now at war with Hamas in Gaza and Hamas’ ally Hezbollah in Lebanon. Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not say how many were fighters but say women and children make up more than half of the fatalities. The war has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced about 90% of its population of 2.3 million people. It’s been a year since Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel’s security fence and stormed into army bases and farming communities, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. They are still holding about 100 captives inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Here's the latest: Rescue service: Nearly 40 people wounded in drone strike in central Israel Israel Rescue Services said that almost 40 people were wounded in a drone strike in the central Israeli city of Binyamina, three of them critically. Israeli media said that two drones were launched from Lebanon. The Israeli military said one drone was intercepted. Israel’s advanced air defense systems mean such a high number of injuries from drones or missiles are exceptionally rare. This is the second time in two days that a drone has struck Israel. On Saturday, during the Israeli holiday of Yom Kippur, a drone struck a retirement home in a suburb of Tel Aviv, causing damage but no injuries Officials: At least 20 people are injured in drone strike in central Israel TEL AVIV, Israel — Israel Rescue Services said that at least 20 people were injured in a drone strike in the central Israeli city of Binyamina, three of them critically. Israeli media said that two drones were launched from Lebanon, and one was intercepted near the coast. This is the second drone strike in two days in Israel. On Saturday, during the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur, a drone struck a retirement home in a suburb of Tel Aviv, causing damage but no injuries. Israel says it is destroying Hezbollah infrastructure in southern Lebanon Israel’s defense minister says Israel is making sure that Hezbollah militants won’t return to communities in southern Lebanon. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant made the comments Sunday during a visit to forces in northern Israel near the border. Gallant described the 'entire first line of villages' in southern Lebanon as having Hezbollah infrastructure and asserted that Israeli defense forces are currently destroying it above and below ground during their ground invasion. 'I have instructed the IDF at all levels to ensure the destruction of (attack infrastructure) and to ensure that terrorists may not return to these places. This is essential in order to ensure the safety of Israel’s northern communities,' Gallant said. U.S. will send complex defense system to Israel despite Iranian threat The United States will send a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery and troops to Israel. The Pentagon made the announcement Sunday, shortly after Iran warned Washington to keep American military forces out of Israel. Pentagon spokesman Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said in a statement that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin authorized the deployment of the THAAD battery at the direction of President Joe Biden. Ryder said the air defense system will help bolster Israel’s air defenses following Iran’s missile attacks on Israel in April and October. The THAAD is a defensive system that shoots down incoming ballistic missiles. U.N. mission says Israeli tanks forcibly entered gates of one of its bases before leaving The U.N. peacekeeping mission in Lebanon says Israeli tanks forcibly entered the gates of one of its bases in southern Lebanon and destroyed the main gate early Sunday. A UNIFIL statement calls it a 'further flagrant violation of international law.' The tanks later left. Israel has warned the U.N. force to evacuate its positions during its offensive in southern Lebanon against the Hezbollah militant group. International criticism is growing after Israeli strikes wounded five peacekeepers in recent days. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday expressed regret for wounding peacekeepers but accused the U.N. mission of providing a 'human shield' for Hezbollah. Israel has long accused the U.N. of being biased against it, and relations have worsened during the yearlong war in Gaza. UNIFIL was created in 1978 to oversee the withdrawal of Israeli troops after Israel invaded and occupied south Lebanon. Netanyahu says UN peacekeepers are serving as ‘human shields’ for Hezbollah TEL AVIV, Israel — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has accused U.N. peacekeepers in southern Lebanon of serving as 'human shields' for Hezbollah after Israeli strikes wounded five of them in recent days. The Israeli military has warned UNIFIL to evacuate southern Lebanon as it carries out air and ground operations against Hezbollah militants, but the peacekeepers have so far refused. Netanyahu said Sunday that their refusal to clear out 'has the effect of providing Hezbollah terrorists with human shields,' saying they had become 'hostages of Hezbollah.' 'We regret the injury to the UNIFIL soldiers and we are doing everything in our power to prevent this injury. But the simple and obvious way to ensure this is simply to get them out of the danger zone,' he said in a video addressed to the U.N. secretary-general, who has been banned from entering Israel. The military has ordered the peacekeepers to move five kilometers (three miles) north, which would effectively keep them from doing their mission. They have already halted patrols because of air and ground attacks. Israel has long accused the U.N. of being biased against it and relations have plunged further since the start of the war in Gaza. It has accused the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees of having been infiltrated by Hamas, allegations the agency denies. Italian premier says UN peacekeeper security must be guaranteed ROME — Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni has told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the security of U.N. forces in southern Lebanon must be 'guaranteed at all times.' In a phone conversation Sunday with Netanyahu, Meloni also stressed that UNIFIL 'acts under a mandate from the Security Council to contribute to regional stability.' She reiterated 'the absolute necessity that the security of UNIFIL personnel be guaranteed at all times.' Netanyahu says Hezbollah uses U.N. peacekeepers as 'human shields' after Israeli strikes wounded five of them in recent days. The Italian premier also said she is convinced that, through the full implementation of U .N. Security Council Resolution 1701, 'we can contribute to the stabilization of the Israeli-Lebanese border and ensure the return home of all displaced persons.' Both Lebanese troops and U.N. peacekeepers are deployed in southern Lebanon to enforce the resolution that ended a bloody monthlong 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah. Foreign ministers of Iraq, Iran warn Israel against sparking broader war BAGHDAD — Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Sunday that the Middle East faces 'dangerous challenges' as Tehran anticipates an Israeli strike. 'Iran does not seek war, but we are prepared for war,' Araghchi said at a news conference in Baghdad after meeting with his Iraqi counterpart. Meanwhile, Iraqi Foreign Minister Fouad Hussein said Israel was forbidden from using Iraq’s airspace in any possible strike against Iran. Baghdad’s top diplomat said an outbreak of regional war will create not only a global crisis but also fertile ground for the reemergence of extremist groups like the Islamic State. 'We are trying to keep the conflict away from the region and Iraq,' he said. Iran's foreign minister warns the US against sending forces to operate in Israel DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Iran’s foreign minister indirectly threatened U.S. forces potentially operating in Israel in an online post Sunday. The comments came in a post on the social platform X long associated with Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who helped reached Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. In the message, Araghchi referred to the United States potentially sending one of its Terminal High Altitude Area Defense systems to Israel. Any move of one of the systems, known by the acronym THAAD, to Israel would involve the deployment of soldiers to operate the complex system. 'The US has been delivering record amount of arms to Israel,' the X message read. 'It is now also putting lives of its troops at risk by deploying them to operate US missile systems in Israel.' It added: 'While we have made tremendous efforts in recent days to contain an all-out war in our region, I say it clearly that we have no red lines in defending our people and interests.' Iran’s Foreign Ministry did not respond to a request for comment over the remarks, which were carried by Iranian state media. Israel is widely believed to be planning to attack Iran over its missile barrage on Israel earlier this month, its second direct attack on Israel during the ongoing Israel-Hamas war that’s widened to Lebanon and involved other Iranian-backed militant groups in the region. The THAAD is a defensive system that shoots down incoming ballistic missiles, like those fired by Iran in its last attack. ___ Associated Press writer Jon Gambrell contributed. ___ VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis reiterated his call on Sunday for an 'immediate ceasefire' in the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and asked for the U.N. peacekeepers to be 'respected.'

'Let’s pursue the paths of diplomacy and dialogue to achieve peace,' he added, stressing he feels close to all the peoples involved: Palestine, Israel, Lebanon.

Ukraine’s human rights envoy urges response to alleged killings of Ukrainian POWs in Kursk	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine’s human rights ombudsman urged international organizations Sunday to respond to a claim that several Ukrainian prisoners of war were executed in Russia’s Kursk region, where Kyiv had launched an incursion in August. DeepState, a Ukrainian battlefield analysis site close to Ukraine’s Defense Ministry, said that Russian troops shot and killed nine Ukrainian 'drone operators and contractors' on Oct. 10 after they had surrendered. Dmytro Lubinets said on Telegram that he sent letters to the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross regarding the case, calling it 'another crime committed by the Russians.' Later on Sunday, Ukrainian Prosecutor-General Andriy Kostin said that his office had opened a criminal investigation into the matter. Earlier this month, Ukraine’s Prosecutor-General’s Office of Ukraine said that Russian troops had killed 16 captured Ukrainian soldiers in the partially occupied Donetsk region. There was no immediate response from Russian officials. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian air force said Sunday that its air defenses had shot down 31 of 68 drones launched at Ukraine by Russia overnight into Sunday in the regions of Kyiv, Poltava, Chernihiv, Sumy and Cherkasy. A further 36 drones were 'lost' over various areas, it said, likely having been electronically jammed. The air force added that ballistic missiles struck Odesa and Poltava while Chernihiv and Sumy came under attack by a guided air missile. Local authorities didn't report any casualties or damage. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Sunday that Russia had launched around 900 guided aerial bombs, more than 40 missiles and 400 drones against Ukraine over the past week. Zelenskyy appealed on X to Ukraine’s allies to 'provide the necessary quantity and quality of air defense systems' and 'make decisions for our sufficient range.' Kyiv is still awaiting word from its Western partners on its repeated requests to use the long-range weapons they provide to hit targets on Russian soil. In Russia, the Defense Ministry said that 13 Ukrainian drones were shot down over three regions of Russia: six each in the Belgorod and Kursk regions, and one in the Bryansk region, all of which border Ukraine. ___ Follow the AP’s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-pows-kursk-drones-missiles-d8eabbac5bd82b34bd715c4d7473a346	2024-10-13T02:38:52-07:00	
Indian politician known for his close ties with Bollywood is killed in Mumbai	NEW DELHI (AP) — A senior politician in India’s financial capital, Mumbai, who was also known for his close ties with Bollywood has been shot dead weeks before a key state election. Baba Siddique, 66, was shot multiple times outside his son’s office in Mumbai on Saturday night, police said in a statement. He later succumbed to his wounds at the city’s Lilavati Hospital. Siddique was associated with the Indian National Congress party for decades but had recently joined a regional party that rules Maharashtra state. He was also close to several Bollywood superstars and was known for throwing lavish parties. Maharashtra’s deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, who is from the same political party as Siddique, said he was shocked by the killing. 'The incident will be thoroughly investigated and strict action will be taken against the attackers. The mastermind behind the attack will also be traced,' Pawar said in a statement. News agency Press Trust of India reported that two suspected attackers had been arrested, and police were searching for another. Broadcaster NDTV said the two suspects claimed they were part of a crime gang that has carried out multiple killings in the past. Elections in Maharashtra state are expected to be held in November.	https://apnews.com/article/india-baba-siddique-shot-bollywood-455faf6f0fca1ebb06c87b2fa02066da	2024-10-12T22:39:15-07:00	
Israeli strike on Gaza kills a family of 8	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — An Israeli strike on the central Gaza Strip has killed a family of eight, Palestinian medical officials said Sunday, as Israeli forces battled Palestinian militants and pushed for the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of people from the territory's north. Israel is also waging an air and ground campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon, and is expected to strike Iran in retaliation for a missile attack earlier this month, though it has not said how or when. The strike in Gaza late Saturday hit a home in the Nuseirat refugee camp, killing parents and their six children, who ranged in age from 8 to 23, according to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in nearby Deir al-Balah, where the bodies were taken. It said another seven people were wounded, including two women and a child in critical condition. An Associated Press reporter counted the bodies and filmed funeral prayers held at the hospital. More than a year into the war with Hamas, Israel continues to strike what it says are militant targets in Gaza nearly every day. The military says it tries to avoid harming civilians and blames their deaths on Hamas and other armed groups because they operate in densely populated areas. The military rarely comments on individual strikes, which often kill women and children. In recent months, it has repeatedly struck schools being used as shelters by displaced people, accusing militants of hiding among them. Israel presses for full evacuation of northern Gaza In northern Gaza, Israeli air and ground forces have been attacking Jabaliya, where the military says militants have regrouped. Over the past year, Israeli forces have repeatedly returned to the built-up refugee camp, which dates back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation, and other hard-hit areas. Israel has ordered the full evacuation of northern Gaza, including Gaza City. An estimated 400,000 people remain in the north after a mass evacuation ordered in the opening weeks of the war. The Palestinians fear Israel intends to permanently depopulate the north to establish military bases or Jewish settlements there. The military confirmed Saturday that hospitals were included in the evacuation orders but said it had not set a specific timetable. It said a medical convoy scheduled to transfer patients from the Kamal Adwan Hospital in recent days was canceled for security reasons — without elaborating — but that the convoy had delivered fuel to the hospital on Saturday. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Around 100 hostages are still being held in Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel's bombardment and ground invasions of Gaza have killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, and left much of the territory in ruins. Palestinian medical officials do not say whether those killed by Israeli forces are militants or civilians, but say women and children make up over half the fatalities. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence. Israel expected to strike Iran as fighting rages in Lebanon Lebanon's Hezbollah, which is allied with Hamas, began firing rockets into Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, drawing retaliatory airstrikes. The conflict dramatically escalated in September with a wave of Israeli strikes that killed Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and most of his senior commanders. Israel launched a ground operation into southern Lebanon earlier this month. At least 2,255 people have been killed in Lebanon since the start of the conflict, including more than 1,400 people since September, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry, which also does not say how many were Hezbollah fighters. At least 54 people have been killed in the rocket attacks on Israel, nearly half of them soldiers. Iran, which supports Hezbollah and Hamas, launched around 180 ballistic missiles at Israel to avenge the killing of Nasrallah, an Iranian general who was with him, and Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas, who died in an explosion in Iran's capital in July that was widely blamed on Israel. ___ Find more of AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-lebanon-hezbollah-news-10-13-2024-a8cd5df3e2bb4ab08405a78251244bb2	2024-10-12T21:54:05-07:00	
They fled their homes to escape Boko Haram. Now Nigeria is resettling them back despite their fears	DAMASAK, Nigeria (AP) — When Boko Haram launched an insurgency in northeastern Nigeria in 2010, Abdulhameed Salisu packed his bag and fled from his hometown of Damasak in the country's battered Borno state. The 45-year-old father of seven came back with his family early last year. They are among thousands of Nigerians taken back from displacement camps to their villages, hometowns or newly built settlements known as 'host communities' under a resettlement program that analysts say is being rushed to suggest the conflict with the Islamic militants is nearly over. Across Borno, dozens of displacement camps have been shut down, with authorities claiming they are no longer needed and that most places from where the displaced fled are now safe. But many of the displaced say it’s not safe to go back. Boko Haram — Nigeria’s homegrown jihadis — took up arms in 2009 to fight against Western education and impose their radical version of Islamic law, or Sharia. The conflict, now Africa's longest struggle with militancy, has spilled into Nigeria's northern neighbors. Some 35,000 civilians have been killed and more than 2 million have been displaced in the northeastern region, according to U.N. numbers. The 2014 kidnapping of 276 schoolgirls by Boko Haram in the village of Chibok in Borno state — the epicenter of the conflict — shocked the world. Borno state alone has nearly 900,000 internally displaced people in displacement camps, with many others absorbed in local communities. So far this year, at least 1,600 civilians have been killed in militant attacks in Borno state, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project, a U.S.-based nonprofit. And in a state where at least 70% of the population depends on agriculture, dozens of farmers have also been killed by the extremists or abducted from their farmland in the last year. In May, hundreds of hostages, mostly women and children who were held captive for months or years by Boko Haram were rescued from a forest enclave and handed over to authorities, the army said. In September, at least 100 villagers were killed by suspected Boko Haram militants who opened fire on a market, on worshippers and in people’s homes in the Tarmuwa council area of the neighboring Yobe state, west of Borno. Analysts say that a forced resettlement could endanger the local population as there is still inadequate security across the hard-hit region. Salisu says he wastes away his days in a resettlement camp in Damasak, a garrison town in Borno state of about 200,000 residents, close to the border with Niger. Food is getting increasingly difficult to come by and Salisu depends on handouts from the World Food Program and other aid organizations. He longs to find work. 'We are begging the government to at least find us a means of livelihood instead of staying idle and waiting for whenever food comes,' he said. On a visit last week to Damasak, Cindy McCain, the WFP chief, pledged the world would not abandon the Nigerian people as she called for more funding to support her agency's aid operations. 'We are going to stay here and do the very best we can to end hunger,' McCain told The Associated Press as she acknowledged the funding shortages. 'How do I take food from the hungry and give it to the starving,' she said. Resettlement usually involves the displaced being taken in military trucks back to their villages or 'host communities.' The Borno state government has promised to provide returnees with essentials to help them integrate into these areas, supported by aid groups. The government says the displacement camps are no longer sustainable. 'What we need now is ... durable solutions,' Borno governor Babagana Zulum told McCain during her visit. As the resettlement got underway, one in five displaced persons stayed back in Maiduguri, the Borno state capital, and nearby towns but were left without any support for local integration, the Global Protection Cluster, a network of non-government organizations and U.N. agencies, said last December. Many others have crossed the border to the north, to settle as refugees in neighboring Niger, Chad or Cameroon. The three countries have registered at least 52,000 Nigerian refugees since January 2023, according to the U.N. refugee agency — nearly twice the number registered in the 22 months before that. A rushed closure of displacement camps and forced resettlement puts the displaced people at risk again from militants still active in their home areas — or forces them to 'cut deals' with jihadis to be able to farm or fish, the International Crisis Group warned in a report earlier this year. That could make the extremists consolidate their presence in those areas, the group warned. Boko Haram, which in 2016 split into two main factions, continues to ambush security convoys and raid villages. Abubakar Kawu Monguno, head of the Center for Disaster Risk Management at the University of Maiduguri, said the best option is for government forces to intensify their campaign to eliminate the militants or 'push them to surrender.' After not being able to access their farms because of rampant attacks by militants, some farmers in Damasak and other parts of Mobbar district returned to work their land last year, armed with seedlings provided by the government. Salisu was one of them. Then a major flood struck in September, collapsing a key dam and submerging about 40% of Maiduguri's territory. Thirty people were killed and more than a million others were affected, authorities said. Farms that feed the state were ruined, including Salisu's. His hopes for a good rice harvest were washed away. Now he lines up to get food at a Damasak food hub. 'Since Boko Haram started, everything else stopped here,' he said. 'There is nothing on the ground and there are no jobs.' Maryam Abdullahi also lined up at a WFP hub in Damasak with other women, waiting for bags of rice and other food items she desperately needs for her family of eight. Her youngest is 6 years old. The donations barely last halfway through the month, she said, but she still waited in the scorching heat. What little money she has she uses to buy yams to fry and sell to sustain her family but it’s nowhere enough. Her only wish is to be able to get a 'proper job' so she and her children would feel safe, she said. 'We either eat in the morning for strength for the rest of the day or ... we eat only at night,' Abdullahi said. ___ Associated Press reporter Haruna Umar in Maiduguri, Nigeria, contributed to this report. contributed. ___ The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

Lithuanians vote in parliamentary election with many looking for change despite a strong economy	VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) — Lithuanians voted Sunday in the first round of parliamentary elections that could lead to the center-right governing coalition being replaced by the opposition Social Democrats and smaller center-left parties. Despite economic successes, strict COVID-19 measures and an influx of migrants have cast shadows over conservative Prime Minister Ingrida Šimonytė’s government, which took office in 2020. Although European Union member Lithuania has seen annual double-digit personal income growth and has one of the lowest inflation rates in the 27-nation bloc, many voters don’t seem to be impressed. 'There’s a lot of disappointment and discontent among voters,' said Rima Urbonaitė, a political analyst at Vilnius’ Mykolas Romeris University. 'It is related to numerous crises and shocks and cannot be compensated by economic factors like positive change in purchasing power.' Šimonytė has faced criticism for strict measures during the pandemic, with many complaining that her government didn’t do enough to help companies during lockdown. Others say thousands of people didn’t have proper access to health care services. Šimonytė also has been lambasted for her handling of migrants arriving via Belarus. Lithuania has its eastern neighbor, as well as Russia, of orchestrating the influx of people, mostly from Africa and the Middle East. A recent survey by pollster Vilmorus says that the Social Democratic Party, led by Vilija Blinkevičiūtė, would top the poll, with twice as many votes as Šimonytė’s Homeland Union. Nemuno Aušra, a newly registered party of right-wing politician Remigijus Žemaitaitis, who was impeached earlier this year for making antisemitic statements, would come in between them. However no party would obtain more than 20% of the vote, forcing anyone hoping to govern to to look for alliances. The Social Democrats have ruled out an alliance with Žemaitaitis’ party, meaning that three or four parties, likely small groups representing the political center, will be necessary to form a governing coalition. 'I have voted for the conservatives my entire life, but this year I’m thinking of giving my ballot to another good party, not to them,' said Darius Mikalauskas, a 51-year-old teacher in Vilnius. 'Šimonytė and the entire Homeland Union looks battered, worn out and they would better spend some time on the spare bench.' Analysts say a shift to the left wouldn’t bring significant changes to the foreign policy of Lithuania, which also borders Russia’s Kaliningrad exclave to the west. But the vote comes at a time when Russia’s war in Ukraine is fueling greater fears about Moscow’s intentions, particularly in the strategically important Baltic region. 'In this country, the foreign policy course is determined mainly by the president,' Urbonaitė said. Earlier this year, President Gitanas Nauseda beat Šimonytė in the presidential election to take a second five-year term. In 2020, Šimonytė led her Homeland Union to victory in the parliamentary election. She later formed a coalition with two liberal parties, the Freedom Party and the Liberal Movement. About 2.4 million people are eligible to elect 141 members of the parliament, or Seimas, for a four-year term in two rounds. On Sunday, 70 lawmakers will be elected by party lists, joined by those in single-mandate constituencies who manage to win more than 50% of votes. The runoff is Oct. 27, when the majority of single-member constituencies will vote to choose between the two leading candidates.	https://apnews.com/article/lithuania-elections-parliament-3ec44ad544ae11cf05b1b112175ef93b	2024-10-12T19:02:21-07:00	
Cubans searching for a better future leave their pets behind	HAVANA (AP) — Balto, Pepa and Mami were among the lucky ones. After being abandoned by their owners who left Cuba — or simply couldn’t care for them anymore — the dogs were rescued by animal rights activists on the island, who fed them, sterilized them and found them a new home. Many others didn't have such luck, and were left wandering the streets. While there are no official figures or estimates of how many pets have been left behind by their owners who leave the island, the number of abandoned cats and dogs has spiked in the last two years as Cubans migrate in record numbers, animal activists say. 'We’d receive a phone call from someone asking us to care for their pets, because they’re suddenly migrating and don’t know what to do with them,' said Elizabeth Meade, founder of Adoptions for Love, an animal shelter in Havana. Although the shelter found a home for some 300 rescued pets in the past year, many of those were returned — or simply went missing — after their new owners also decided to migrate. For these animals, said Meade, 'it’s not always a happy ending.' Between October 2021 and September 2024, U.S. authorities reported more than 600,000 encounters with Cubans — a significant number for an island of roughly 10 million people. That is in addition to the thousands who choose to migrate to Spain or other Latin American countries. For many Cubans, taking their pets with them is not an option. Transporting an animal from Havana to Miami through a specialized agency can cost up to $1,200 — including medical examinations and the flight — and, since September, pet owners have to pay an additional $1,300 to comply with a legal obligation of a quarantine. For those who remain in Cuba, daily life is not easy: the country’s gross domestic product fell by 2% in 2023, resulting in rampant inflation and food and fuel shortages. Caring for a pet on the island can be prohibitive for most Cubans. While the average monthly salary in the state sector — the largest employer — is about $21, a 20-kilo bag of imported dog food can cost up to $70 and a visit to the vet costs the equivalent of $10. The increase in the number of abandoned pets in Cuba has been largely countered by animal activism, a phenomenon that began to take shape in 2018 after the Internet was massively adopted and social media helped coordinate actions. In 2021, animal rights activists scored a win when the government passed a long-awaited animal welfare law, which seeks to prevent cruelty and raise awareness about the need to protect animals. The law also penalizes animal cruelty, including dogfights, and the sacrifice of animals for religious purposes but activists say it is not enough. 'Abandonment is the worst form of animal abuse,' said Leandro Valdés, a dog trainer and proud owner of Koffee, a rescued dog that has gone viral as he rides around Havana in the back of Valdés’ motorcycle, wearing goggles and a seatbelt. 'The increase in migration has resulted in more pets being abandoned,' says Valdés, noting the 'loss of values' that resulted from Cuba's deepening economic crisis. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/cuba-migration-pets-animal-rights-ccecf0dd3c0d86cd99a22c0205b80498	2024-10-12T19:01:47-07:00

Beijing loyalists will vote to endorse Macao's former top judge as next leader of the casino hub	MACAO (AP) — About 400 Beijing loyalists were set to vote Sunday to endorse the sole candidate for the top job in the Chinese city of Macao in a largely ceremonial election that would make him the first leader of the casino hub to be born in mainland China. Former top judge Sam Hou Fai ’s expected victory within hours would be a departure from the long-standing custom of having chief executives who were born in the former Portuguese colony, typically from influential business families. The shift in the city’s leadership to someone from the legal profession will create expectations of a declining influence from business circles, which critics have often accused of colluding with officials, analysts say. They anticipate Beijing’s policy agenda for the city will take priority. Sam, 62, is widely seen to have Beijing’s blessings. He has already secured endorsements from 386 of the 400 election committee members who are to vote on Sunday. Most of the territory’s 687,000 residents lack voting rights, leading to mixed sentiments about the election. Some hope Sam will heed public opinion and avoid prioritizing business interests, while others feel disconnected from an election process they can’t participate in. Still, political observers said many residents are comfortable with Sam’s non-local origin in a city that has been home to migrants for decades. With Sam’s victory guaranteed, the real challenges await in the governance hurdles that lie ahead. Macao is the only place in China where casino gambling is legal. Beijing has called for the city to diversify its gambling-reliant economy. Sam has promised to accelerate the current government’s plan to boost tourism and other sectors such as traditional Chinese medicine, finance, exhibitions and commerce. However, the city will still need to rely on the gambling industry for government revenues to support the city's welfare and accomplish other goals laid out by Beijing, analysts say. China wants Macao to develop into a world-class tourism and leisure center and play a bigger role as a bridge for trade between China and Portuguese-speaking countries. Small local businesses have been hurt by residents who spend money in the neighboring mainland city of Zhuhai, which offers a wider selection of items with good value for money. Chinese tourists are also now spending less than before. It remains to be seen whether Sam, with a lack of government leadership experience, can form a capable cabinet to tackle these pressing issues. Sam was born in neighboring Guangdong province in 1962. He graduated from the prestigious law school of Peking University in Beijing. He also studied the Portuguese language, culture and law at the University of Coimbra in Portugal, and once practiced law in mainland China. When Macao returned to Chinese rule in 1999, Sam was appointed the city’s top judge, a role in which he served for nearly 25 years before resigning in August to participate in the election. He handled some politically sensitive cases, including rejecting an appeal of a police ban on a vigil commemorating China’s bloody 1989 military crackdown on the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests. His court also upheld a decision to bar pro-democracy figures from running in the 2021 legislative elections.	https://apnews.com/article/macao-elects-leader-sam-hou-fai-china-11578a4d193ab2a440b9b915b7909666	2024-10-12T15:04:40-07:00	
Pregnant Philippine women arrested in Cambodia for surrogacy could be prosecuted after giving birth	PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) — Thirteen pregnant Philippine women accused of illegally acting as surrogate mothers in Cambodia after being recruited online may face prison terms after they give birth, a senior Interior Ministry official said Saturday. Interior Ministry Secretary of State Chou Bun Eng, who leads the country’s fight against human trafficking and sexual exploitation, said police found 24 foreign women, 20 Philippine and four Vietnamese, when they raided a villa in Kandal province, near the capital of Phnom Penh, on Sept. 23. Thirteen of the Philippine women were found to be pregnant and were charged in court on Oct. 1 under a provision in the law on Suppression of Human Trafficking and Sexual Exploitation, she said. The law was updated in 2016 to ban commercial surrogacy after Cambodia became a popular destination for foreigners seeking women to give birth to their children. Developing countries have been popular for surrogacy because costs are much lower than in countries such as the United States and Australia, where surrogate services could cost around $150,000. The surrogacy business boomed in Cambodia after it was put under tight restrictions in neighboring Thailand, as well as in India and Nepal. In July 2017, a Cambodian court sentenced an Australian woman and two Cambodian associates to 1 1/2 years in prison for providing commercial surrogacy services. The new case is unusual because surrogates normally are employed in their own countries, not transported elsewhere. Cambodia already has a bad reputation for human trafficking, especially in connection with online scams in which foreigners recruited for work under false pretenses are kept in conditions of virtual slavery and help perpetrate criminal fraud online against targets in many countries. Details of the new surrogacy case remain murky, and officials have not made clear whether the women were arrested or whether anyone involved in organizing the scheme has been identified. Chou Bun Eng told The Associated Press that the business that recruited the surrogates was based in Thailand, and their food and accommodation in Cambodia were arranged from there. She said the authorities had not yet identified the business. She said the seven Philippine women and four Vietnamese women who were caught in the raid but who were not pregnant would be deported soon. The 13 pregnant women have been placed under care at a hospital in Phnom Penh, said Chou Bun Eng. She added that after they give birth, they could be prosecuted on charges that could land them in prison for two to five years. She said that Cambodia considered the women not to have been victimized but rather offenders who conspired with the organizers to act as surrogates and then sell the babies for money. Her assertion could not be verified, as the women could not be contacted and it is not known if they have lawyers. The Philippine Embassy in Cambodia, in response to a local press account of the affair, issued a statement on Wednesday confirming most of the details related to what it called the 'rescue of 20 Filipino women.' 'The Philippine Embassy ensured that all 20 Filipinos were interviewed in the presence of an Embassy representative and an interpreter in every step of the investigation process,' it said.	https://apnews.com/article/surrogacy-human-trafficking-law-0ac21e8d40a0015dba0d62fb3b347601	2024-10-12T08:49:16-07:00	
Former Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond, who sought Scotland's independence from UK, dies at 69	LONDON (AP) — Alex Salmond, the former first minister of Scotland who for decades championed Scotland’s independence from the U.K., has died. He was 69. Salmond, who was a divisive figure in British politics and who as the then leader of the Scottish National Party took Scotland to the brink of independence in a 2014 referendum, died in the North Macedonia lake-resort town of Ohrid, local media reported. 'Unfortunately, Alex Salmond, the former first minister of Scotland who was one of the panellists at yesterday’s cultural diplomacy forum that was held in Ohrid, died suddenly today,' according to a statement from the office of former North Macedonia President Gjorgje Ivanov. Tributes poured in from across the political spectrum, with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer of the Labour Party calling him a 'monumental figure' of both Scottish and British politics. 'He leaves behind a lasting legacy,' Starmer said. 'As first minister of Scotland, he cared deeply about Scotland’s heritage, history and culture, as well as the communities he represented.' Salmond served as first minister of Scotland from 2007 to 2014, and was leader of the Scottish National Party on two occasions, from 1990 to 2000, and from 2004 to 2014. Salmond, as then leader of the Scottish National Party, led the independence campaign in the referendum in 2014, but lost, gaining 45% of the vote. Salmond resigned from the SNP in 2018 in the wake of sexual harassment allegations. He subsequently formed a new party called Alba — the Scottish Gaelic word for Scotland — and was acquitted of the charges. The current SNP first minister, John Swinney, said that he was 'deeply shocked and saddened at the untimely death' of Salmond. 'Over many years, Alex made an enormous contribution to political life, not just within Scotland, but across the U.K. and beyond,' he said. 'He took the Scottish National Party from the fringes of Scottish politics into government and led Scotland so close to becoming an independent country.' Former U.K. Conservative Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said that Salmond was a 'huge figure in our politics.' Salmond said that he learned to dream of a better Scotland at his grandfather’s knee, and chose to join the SNP at university in 1973 when his English girlfriend poked too much fun at his separatist sentiments. Salmond’s academic and professional background prepared him to become Scotland’s most economically optimistic and visionary politician. At St. Andrew’s University. he double-majored in medieval history, reflecting his love of a Caledonia lost, and economics. In his 20s, he worked as an economist first for Britain’s regional government in Scotland and then at the Royal Bank of Scotland, where he analyzed the country’s most dynamic industry, North Sea oil. He won a seat in the U.K. Parliament in 1987, and within three years was party leader. He supported Tony Blair's Labour government in the late 1990s to create a devolved Scottish parliament in Edinburgh, a reform that stopped short of independence, but gave his homeland a taste of self-government for the first time since its 1707 union with England. Salmond then had a very public forum to push his dream of full independence forward — his government had an array of powers especially on social issues — and managed to convince the government of Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron to call a referendum. Up until the results were known, it had been considered a close call. Though the independence campaign lost, Salmond's SNP managed to capitalize its support and has dominated Scottish politics since. The SNP has been the Edinburgh-based government since, though it suffered a huge setback in this year's U.K.-wide general election, when it lost a vast majority of the seats it held in the House of Commons to Labour. The next Scottish election is due to take place in 2026. ___ Demetris Nellas contributed to this report from Athens, Greece.	https://apnews.com/article/uk-scotland-alex-salmond-dead-bb41c9c8dad38dc16a2760fd15eb8ad4	2024-10-12T07:50:41-07:00	
Powerful storm knocks out power to 1.6 million in Brazil's largest city	SAO PAULO (AP) — More than 1.6 million people in Sao Paulo were without power on Saturday more than 16 hours after a brief but powerful storm swept through South America's largest city. Officials in Sao Paulo state said that record wind gusts Friday night of up to 67 mph (108 kph) knocked down transmission lines and uprooted trees. causing severe damage in some parts. The storm also shut down several airports and interrupted water service in several areas, according to the Sao Paulo state government. Authorities originally expected to restore power within a few hours. But several neighborhoods in the metropolitan area, which is home to 21 million people, were still in the dark on Saturday and authorities were urging residents to limit their consumption of water. One person died when a tree fell on an outdoor stall, authorities said. At least four other people in surrounding Sao Paulo state also died.	https://apnews.com/article/brazil-storm-sao-paulo-44dd41d56497ed41175b09db543b5da2	2024-10-12T06:45:19-07:00	
Heavy Israeli bombardment in northern Gaza as UN peacekeepers in Lebanon are hit again	BEIRUT (AP) — Palestinians in northern Gaza described heavy Israeli bombardment Saturday in the hours after airstrikes killed at least 22 people, as Israel warned people there and in southern Lebanon to get out of the way of offensives against the Hamas and Hezbollah militant groups. In Lebanon, the U.N. peacekeeping force said that its headquarters in Naqoura was hit again, with a peacekeeper struck by gunfire late Friday and in stable condition. It wasn’t clear who fired. The shooting occurred a day after Israel’s military fired on the headquarters for a second straight day. Israel, which has warned peacekeepers to leave their positions, didn’t immediately respond to questions. Hunger warnings emerged again in northern Gaza as residents said they hadn't received aid since the beginning of the month. The U.N. World Food Program said that no food aid had entered the north since Oct. 1. An estimated 400,000 people remain there. Israel’s military renewed its offensive in northern Gaza almost a week ago while escalating its air and ground campaign against the Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon. Amid Israel's war with Hezbollah, a top U.N. official, Carl Skau, told The Associated Press that he's concerned that Lebanon’s ports and airport might be taken out of service. More than 1 million people have been displaced. Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency said that an Israeli airstrike hit an apartment building on the edge of Barja south of Beirut, and the Health Ministry said that four were killed. The ministry said an airstrike on Maisra village northeast of Beirut killed five people. The total toll in Lebanon over the past year of conflict between Israel and Hezbollah is now 2,255 killed, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. More than 1,400 people have been killed since mid-September. It wasn't clear how many were fighters. Israel’s military said that Hezbollah fired more than 300 projectiles over the Yom Kippur holiday. The military said that it killed 50 militants in Lebanon. Claims on either side couldn't be verified. 'We will keep standing with the Lebanese people during these difficult circumstances and also with the Palestinian people,' the speaker of Iran’s parliament, Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, said Saturday while touring the scene of an Israeli airstrike in Beirut. Some Gaza residents are trapped In northern Gaza, residents told the AP many were trapped in their homes and shelters with dwindling supplies while seeing bodies uncollected in the streets as the bombing hampered emergency responders. Those who rushed to the scene of the latest deadly airstrikes in the urban refugee camp of Jabaliya found a hole 20 meters (65 feet) deep where a home once stood. At least 20 bodies were recovered as of Saturday morning, while others likely were trapped under rubble, emergency service officials said. Elsewhere in Jabaliya, a strike on a home killed two brothers and wounded a woman and newborn baby, the officials said. Another strike in the afternoon hit a Jabaliya home and killed at least four people, including a woman, said Fares Abu Hamza, an official with the emergency service. Israel’s military said that it killed more than 20 militants in the Jabaliya area over the past day. Military spokesperson Avichay Adraee told people in parts of Jabaliya and Gaza City to evacuate south to an Israeli-designated humanitarian zone as Israel plans to use great force 'and will continue to do so for a long time.' Israel has repeatedly returned to parts of Gaza as Hamas and other militants regroup. The war has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced around 90% of its population of 2.3 million people, often multiple times. Once again, some families moved south on foot, in donkey carts or crowded in vehicles that navigated piles of rubble. Others refused to go. 'It’s like the first days of the war,' said a Jabaliya resident, Ahmed Abu Goneim. 'The occupation is doing everything to uproot us. But we will not leave.' The 24-year-old said Israeli warplanes and drones struck many neighboring houses in the past week. He counted 15 relatives and neighbors, including four women and five children as young as 3, killed in neighboring homes. He said that there were dead in the streets and 'no one is able to recover them because of the bombing.' Hamza Sharif, who stays with his family in a school-turned-shelter in Jabaliya, described 'constant bombings day and night.' He said that the shelter hasn't received aid since the beginning of the month. 'Families depend on what they have stored, but they will run out of supplies very soon,' he said. Food is running out The World Food Program said that it was unclear how long the limited food supplies it distributed in northern Gaza earlier will last. The U.N.’s independent investigator on the right to food last month accused Israel of carrying out a 'starvation campaign' against Palestinians, which Israel has denied. Israel's offensive in Gaza started after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack, when militants stormed into Israel, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 others. Israel’s offensive has killed more than 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who don't specify between combatants and civilians. Gaza’s Health Ministry said that hospitals had received the bodies of 49 people killed over the past 24 hours. ___ Samy Magdy reported from Cairo.

Poland's leader plans to suspend the right to asylum as country faces pressure on Belarus border	WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Poland's leader said Saturday that he plans to temporarily suspend the right to asylum as part of a new migration policy, pointing to its alleged abuse by eastern neighbor Belarus and Russia. Prime Minister Donald Tusk said that 'the state must regain 100% of the control over who enters and leaves Poland,' and that a territorial suspension of the right to asylum will be part of a strategy that will be presented to a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Polish news agency PAP reported. He didn't give details, but said at a convention of his Civic Coalition that 'we will reduce illegal migration in Poland to a minimum.' Poland has struggled with migration pressures on its border with Belarus since 2021. Successive Polish governments have accused Belarus and Russia of luring migrants from the Middle East and Africa there to destabilize the West. Tusk pointed to alleged misuse of the right to asylum 'by (Belarusian President Alexander) Lukashenko, by (Russian President Vladimir) Putin, by smugglers, human smugglers, human traffickers. How this right to asylum is used is in exact contradiction to the idea of the right to asylum.' He said that he would demand recognition of the decision on the right to asylum from the European Union, PAP reported. Tusk's comments came after Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski said on Thursday that Poland will tighten its visa regulations, stepping up the vetting of applicants. That decision follows an investigation into a cash-for-visas scandal under the country's previous government. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of migration issues at https://apnews.com/hub/migration	https://apnews.com/article/poland-migration-asylum-right-suspension-belarus-1716d8872d38caa25b01ac02a5348a69	2024-10-12T05:08:51-07:00	
An explosion and fire at a service station in Russia's Chechnya kills 4	MOSCOW (AP) — An explosion at a gas station in Russia’s southern region of Chechnya killed at least four people, officials said Saturday. The explosion of a gas tank triggered a fire at the service station in the regional capital, Grozny, said Russia’s Emergencies Ministry, adding that two children were among the dead. The fire was extinguished. Grozny is about 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) south of Moscow. Regional authorities said a criminal investigation was opened. Last month an explosion at a gas station in the neighboring region of Dagestan killed at least 13 people and injured 23 others.	https://apnews.com/article/chechnya-explosion-fire-gas-station-8c6d6841ba9897613724f286534176d0	2024-10-12T05:07:43-07:00	
Ukrainian recruiters descend on Kyiv's nightlife in search of men not registered for conscription	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian military recruitment officers raided restaurants, bars and a concert hall in Kyiv, checking military registration documents and detaining men who were not in compliance, media and witnesses reported Saturday. Officers descended on Kyiv’s Palace of Sports venue after a concert Friday night by Ukrainian rock band Okean Elzy. Video footage aired by local media outlets appears to show officers stationed outside the doors of the concert hall intercepting men as they exit. In the footage, officers appear to be forcibly detaining some men. Checks were also conducted at Goodwine, an upscale shopping center, and Avalon, a popular restaurant. It is unusual for such raids to take place in the capital, and reflects Ukraine’s dire need for fresh recruits. All Ukrainian men aged 25-60 are eligible for conscription, and men aged 18-60 are not allowed to leave the country. Men live in fear of being called up A 27-year-old man said he left the concert as the last song was playing after he was told about the recruitment officers. He said he saw soldiers and police talking to people but 'didn't see anything super aggressive.' He said men felt in danger of being drafted whenever they ventured outside. 'That inner state of always being in danger, it’s back again,' he told The Associated Press, only giving his first name for fear of retribution. He said his university draft waiver was taken away after Ukraine passed laws in April that both lowered draft-eligible age for men from 27 to 25 and did away with some draft exemptions. Local reports said raids were also conducted in clubs and restaurants across other Ukrainian cities, including Kharkiv and Dnipro in eastern and central Ukraine. Ukraine has intensified its mobilization drive this year. A new law came into effect this spring stipulating that those eligible for military service must input their information into an online system or face penalties. Ukraine reports strikes on a Russian-run oil terminal Meanwhile, Ukraine’s military said on Saturday that it struck a Russian-controlled oil terminal in the partially occupied Luhansk region that provides fuel for Russia’s war effort. 'Oil and oil products were stored at this base, which were supplied, in particular, for the needs of the Russian army,' Ukraine’s General Staff wrote on Telegram. Russian state media reported that the terminal close to the city of Rovenky had come under attack from a Ukrainian drone and said there were no casualties and that the fire had been extinguished, but did not comment on the extent of any damage. On Monday, Ukrainian forces said they struck a major oil terminal on the south coast of the Russia-occupied Crimea Peninsula. Both sides are facing the issue of how to sustain their costly war of attrition — a conflict that started with Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and that shows no signs of a resolution. Ukraine’s aim is to impair Russia’s ability to support its front-line units, especially in the eastern Donetsk region where the main Russian battlefield effort is stretching weary Ukrainian forces. Kyiv is still awaiting word from its Western partners on its repeated requests to use the long-range weapons they provide to hit targets on Russian soil. Meanwhile, Russia’s Defense Ministry said 47 Ukrainian drones had been intercepted and destroyed by its air defense systems overnight into Saturday: 17 over the Krasnodar region, 16 over the Sea of ​​Azov, 12 over the Kursk region and two over the Belgorod region, all of which border Ukraine. Belgorod Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said Saturday that one person had been killed and 14 wounded in Ukrainian shelling and drone attacks over the previous 24 hours. In Ukraine, the country’s Air Force said air defenses had shot down 24 of 28 drones launched overnight against Ukraine. Zaporizhzhia regional Gov. Ivan Fedorov said two women were wounded Saturday in Russian attacks on the capital of the southern Ukrainian region, also called Zaporizhzhia. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine ___ Morton reported from London.

The 22-year-old suspect was among three people who authorities revealed earlier this week were detained in the southern Toulouse region. The two other people were released from custody. Authorities said that an investigation that was opened on Sept. 27 subsequently revealed a suspected 'plan for violent action targeting people in a football stadium or a shopping center' allegedly linked to the Afghan suspect. They said they found 'several elements' allegedly linking the person to 'radicalization' and 'adherence to the ideology of the Islamic State' group.	https://apnews.com/article/france-attack-plot-432ceed4af3a415cd0e16babb0a05858	2024-10-12T04:13:43-07:00	
Middle East latest: Israeli military renews orders for Palestinians to leave northern Gaza	The Israeli military on Saturday renewed its orders for Palestinian in the northern Gaza Strip to leave their homes and shelters as troops press on a weeklong offensive against militants. Most of the fighting in the past week was centered in and around Jabaliya that was pounded by Israeli war jets and artillery. Residents said they have been trapped inside their homes and shelters. In Lebanon, authorities said Friday that 60 people were killed and 168 wounded in the past 24 hours, raising the total toll over the past year of conflict between Israel and the militant group Hezbollah to 2,229 dead and 10,380 wounded. Israel has been escalating its campaign against Hezbollah with waves of heavy airstrikes across Lebanon and a ground invasion at the border, after a year of exchanges of fire. Israel is now at war with Hamas in Gaza and Hamas' ally Hezbollah in Lebanon. Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not say how many were fighters but say women and children make up more than half of the fatalities. The war has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced about 90% of its population of 2.3 million people, often multiple times. It's been a full year since Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel’s security fence and stormed into army bases and farming communities, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. They are still holding about 100 captives inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. ___ Here is the latest: US military hits Islamic State camps in Syria with airstrikes The U.S. military said it conducted a series of airstrikes against multiple camps in Syria belonging to the Islamic State group. The U.S. Central Command said the strikes on Friday will 'disrupt the ability of ISIS to plan, organize and conduct attacks against the United States, its allies and partners, and civilians throughout the region and beyond.' It said battle damage assessments were underway and did not include civilian casualties. There are some 900 U.S. forces in Syria, along with an undisclosed number of contractors, mostly trying to prevent any comeback by the extremist IS group, which swept through Iraq and Syria in 2014, taking control of large swaths of territory. Speaker of Iran's parliament visits Beirut BEIRUT — The speaker of Iran’s parliament on Saturday toured the scene of an Israeli airstrike in Beirut that killed and wounded dozens, vowing that Tehran would keep supporting Lebanese and Palestinians in fighting against Israel. Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf visited the bombed area after holding talks with caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati, who said that Lebanon’s priority now was working toward a cease-fire. His office said that Lebanon’s government still abides by a 2006 U.N. Security Council Resolution approved at the end of a 34-day war between Israel and Hezbollah and was prepared to boost Lebanese army presence along the country’s border with Israel. 'We will keep standing with the Lebanese people during these difficult circumstances and also with the Palestinian people,' Qalibaf said during the tour, during which he was escorted by several Hezbollah officials. Qalibaf added that Iran will aid the Lebanese people and 'we hope that they will be victorious.' It was the second recent visit by an Iranian official to Beirut after the foreign minister visited rarlier this month. Iran is a main backer of Hezbollah that has suffered major setbacks in recent weeks, including the killing of it leader Hassan Nasrallah. Hezbollah started attacking Israeli army posts in October last year in solidarity with the militant Hamas group in Gaza. Since Sept. 23, Israel has intensified its airstrikes and forced the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Lebanese. Last week, Israel began a ground invasion of Lebanon, leading to clashes along the border with Hezbollah fighters. No food has entered northern Gaza since Oct. 1, UN says CAIRO — The United Nations food agency said on Saturday that no food aid had entered northern Gaza since Oct. 1. The World Food Program said that the primary border crossing into the war-ravaged area had been closed for about two weeks, warning that Israel’s ongoing ground operation has a disastrous impact on food security for thousands of Palestinians families there. 'The north is basically cut off and we’re not able to operate there,' said Antoine Renard, the WFP country director of Palestinian territories. Concerns of a hunger crisis have risen in Gaza roughly a month after the U.N.’s independent investigator on the right to food accused Israel of carrying out a 'starvation campaign' against Palestinians. Israel has denied such allegations and insisted that it has allowed food and other aid into Gaza in significant quantities. 'Israel has not halted the entry or coordination of humanitarian aid entering from its territory into the northern Gaza Strip. As evidence, humanitarian aid coordinated by COGAT and international organizations will continue to enter the northern Gaza Strip in the coming day as well,' COGAT, the Israeli military body overseeing aid distribution, said in a statement on Wednesday. The WFP said its food distribution points, as well as kitchens and bakeries in northern Gaza, have been forced to shut down due to airstrikes, military ground operations and evacuation orders. It said that the only functioning bakery in North Gaza, supported by WFP, caught fire after being hit by an explosive munition. The WFP said its last remaining food supplies in the north -- including canned food, wheat flour, high-energy biscuits, and nutrition supplements -- have been distributed to shelters, health facilities and kitchens in Gaza City and three shelters in the northern areas. It is unclear how long these limited food supplies will last, warning that the consequences for fleeing families will be dire if the escalation continues. EU concerns over Israeli legislation that would ban UNRWA JERUSALEM — The European Union said Saturday it was deeply concerned about draft Israeli legislation that would ban the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees from operating in Israel and likely scale back aid distribution across war-ravaged Gaza. Earlier this week, an Israeli parliamentary committee approved a pair of bills this week that would ban UNRWA from operating in Israeli territory and end all contact between the government and the U.N. agency. The bill needs final approval from the Knesset, Israel’s parliament. 'If adopted, (the bill) would have disastrous consequences, preventing the U.N. agency from continuing to provide its services and protection to Palestinian refugees in the occupied West Bank, including east Jerusalem, and Gaza,' the EU said in an online statement. Israel has alleged that some of UNRWA’s thousands of staff members participated in the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack that sparked the Israel-Hamas war. The U.N. has since fired more than a dozen staffers after internal investigations found they may have taken part in the attack that killed 1,200 people in southern Israel. The U.N. agency has been the main supplier of food, water and shelter to Palestinian civilians during the 12 month conflict in Gaza. Concern about the Israeli bill was echoed by UNRWA’s chief, Philippe Lazzarini, on Wednesday, who said all humanitarian operations in Gaza and the West Bank could 'disintegrate' if the bill was implemented. When UNRWA was created by the U.N. General Assembly in 1949, it was meant to provide health care, education and welfare services to about 700,000 Palestinian refugees from the 1948 conflict with Israel. Israeli military renews evacuation orders for northern Gaza CAIRO — The Israeli military on Saturday renewed orders for Palestinian in the northern Gaza Strip to leave their homes and shelters amid a week of intense fighting with militants there. Avichay Adraee, a spokesman for the Israeli military, told people that the area includes parts of Gaza City’s Sheikh Radwan neighborhood and other parts in and around Jabaliya, the urban refugee camp. In a post on X, Adraee asked people living there to head south to Muwasi, a packed area in southern Gaza designed by the military as a humanitarian zone. Most of past week fighting centered in and around Jabaliya with Israeli war jets and artillery pounding the area. People there said they have been trapped inside their homes and shelters. The military also ordered the three main hospitals in northern Gaza to evacuate patients and medical staff.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-hamas-latest-mideast-12-october-2024-a6cb533eb39d69bd2bea60c46b7dcb0b	2024-10-12T00:30:22-07:00	
Planned nuclear plant in a Kenyan top tourist hub and home to endangered species sparks protest	KILIFI, Kenya (AP) — Dozens rallied against a proposal to build Kenya's first nuclear power plant in one of the country's top coastal tourist hubs which also houses a forest on the tentative list of the UNESCO World Heritage site. Kilifi County is renowned for its pristine sandy beaches where hotels and beach bars line the 165-mile-long coast and visitors boat and snorkel around coral reefs or bird watch in Arabuko Sokoke forest, a significant natural habitat for the conservation of rare and endangered species, according to the U.N. organization. The project, proposed last year, is set to be built in the town of Kilifi — about 522 kilometers (324 miles) southeast of the capital, Nairobi. Many residents have openly opposed the proposal, worried about what they say are the negative effects of the project on people and the environment, leading to a string of protesters which at times turned violent. Muslim for Human Rights (MUHURI) led the march Friday in Kilifi to the county governor’s office where they handed him a petition opposing the construction of the plant. Some chanted anti-nuclear slogans while others carried placards with 'Sitaki nuclear', Swahili for 'I don’t want nuclear.' The construction of the 1,000MW nuclear plant is set to begin in 2027 and be operational by 2034, with a cost of 500 billion Kenyan shillings ($3.8 billion). Francis Auma, a MUHURI activist, told the Associated Press that the negative effects of the nuclear plant outweigh its benefits. 'We say that this project has a lot of negative effects; there will be malformed children born out of this place, fish will die, and our forest Arabuko Sokoke, known to harbor the birds from abroad, will be lost,' Auma said during Friday’s protests. Juma Sulubu, a resident who was beaten by the police during a previous demonstration, attended Friday's march and said: 'Even if you kill us, just kill us, but we do not want a nuclear power plant in our Uyombo community.' Timothy Nyawa, a fisherman, participated in the rally out of fear that a nuclear power plant would kill fish and in turn his source of income. 'If they set up a nuclear plant here, the fish breeding sites will all be destroyed.' Phyllis Omido, the executive director at the Centre for Justice Governance and Environmental Action, who also attended the march, said Kenya’s eastern coastal towns depended on eco-tourism as the main source of income and a nuclear plant would threaten their livelihoods. 'We host the only East African coastal forest, we host the Watamu marine park, we host the largest mangrove plantation in Kenya. We do not want nuclear (energy) to mess up our ecosystem,' she said. Her center filed a petition in Nov. 2023 in parliament calling for an inquiry and claiming that locals had limited information on the proposed plant and the criteria for selecting preferred sites. It also raised concerns over the risks to health, the environment and tourism in the event of a nuclear spill, saying the country was undertaking a 'high-risk venture' without proper legal and disaster response measures in place. The petition also expressed unease over security and the handling of radioactive waste in a country prone to floods and drought. The Senate suspended the inquiry until a lawsuit two layers filed in July seeking to stop the plant’s construction, claiming public participation meetings were rushed and urging the Nuclear Power and Energy Agency (Nupea) not to start the project, was heard. Nupea said construction would not begin for years and environmental laws were under consideration, adding that adequate public participation was carried out. The nuclear agency also published an impact assessment report last year that recommended policies be put in place to ensure environmental protections, including detailed plans for the handling of radioactive waste, measures to mitigate environmental harm, such as setting up a nuclear unit in the national environment management authority, and emergency response teams. ___ The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

A fire on board an oil tanker off Germany's Baltic Sea coast has been extinguished	BERLIN (AP) — A fire that broke out on board an oil tanker off Germany's Baltic Sea coast has been extinguished, authorities said Saturday. The blaze didn't spread to the ship's load. The maritime rescue service was alerted to the fire on board the German-flagged Annika on Friday morning, and shortly afterward took all seven crew members off the vessel. Black smoke from the tanker, which was carrying about 640 metric tons of oil, could be seen from the coast. The fire appears to have broken out in the engine room or in a storage room for paint and spread across the stern of the ship. On Friday afternoon, experts determined that the ship's condition was stable and authorities decided to have it towed to the port city of Rostock to continue fighting the blaze. Firefighters inspected the 73-meter (240-foot) -long ship after it arrived in the harbor around 1 a.m. and found that the fire was out, Germany's Central Command for Maritime Emergencies said.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-baltic-sea-oil-tanker-fire-extinguished-1ac4f6f0d711a134ed5193fdcfcf0a91	2024-10-11T23:21:18-07:00	
Bomb survivors use Nobel Peace Prize win to share their anti-nuke message with younger generations	TOKYO (AP) — The recipient of this year's Nobel Peace Prize is a fast-dwindling group of atomic bomb survivors who are facing down the shrinking time they have left to convey the firsthand horror they witnessed 79 years ago. Nihon Hidankyo, the Japanese organization of survivors of the U.S. atomic bombings on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, was awarded for its decadeslong activism against nuclear weapons. The survivors, known as hibakusha, see the prize and the international attention as their last chance to get their message out to younger generations. 'We must seriously think about the succession of our messages. We must thoroughly hand over from our generation to the future generations,' Toshiyuki Mimaki, senior member of the Hiroshima branch of Hidankyo, told reporters Friday night. 'With the honor of the Nobel Peace Prize, we now have a responsibility to get our messages handed down not only in Japan but also across the world.' The honor rewards members' grassroots efforts to keep telling their stories — even though that involved recollecting horrendous ordeals during and after the bombings, and facing discrimination and worries about their health from the lasting radiation impact — for the sole purpose of never again let that happen. Now, with their average age at 85.6, the hibakusha are increasingly frustrated that their fear of a growing nuclear threat and push to eliminate nuclear weapons are not fully understood by younger generations. The number of prefectural hibakusha groups decreased from 47 to 36. And the Japanese government, under the U.S. nuclear umbrella for protection, has refused to sign the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapon. But there is hope, and a youth movement seems to be starting, the Nobel committee noted. Three high school students accompanied Mimaki at the city hall, stood by him as the prize winner was announced, and promised to keep their activism alive. 'I had goose bumps when I heard the announcement,' said a beaming Wakana Tsukuda. 'I have felt discouraged by negative views about nuclear disarmament, but the Nobel Peace Prize made me renew my commitment to work toward abolishing nuclear weapons.' Another high school student, Natsuki Kai, said, 'I will keep up my effort so we can believe that nuclear disarmament is not a dream but a reality.' In Nagasaki, another group of students celebrated Hidankyo's win. Yuka Ohara, 17, thanked the survivors' yearslong effort despite the difficulty. Ohara said she heard her grandparents, who survived the Nagasaki bombing, repeatedly tell her the importance of peace in daily life. 'I want to learn more as I continue my activism.' In April, a group of people set up a network, Japan Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, connecting younger generations around the country to work with survivors and pursue their effort. Efforts to document the survivors' stories and voices have grown in recent years around Japan, including in Hiroshima, Nagasaki and Tokyo. In some places, young volunteers are working with hibakusha to succeed their personal story telling when they are gone. The first U.S. atomic bombing killed 140,000 people in the city of Hiroshima. A second atomic attack on Nagasaki on Aug. 9, 1945, killed another 70,000. Japan surrendered on Aug. 15, bringing an end to its nearly half-century aggression in Asia. Hidankyo was formed 11 years later in 1956. There was a growing anti-nuclear movement in Japan in response to U.S. hydrogen bomb tests in the Pacific that led to a series of radiation exposures by Japanese boats, adding to demands for government support for health problems. As of March, 106,823 survivors — 6,824 fewer than a year ago, and nearly one-quarter of the total in the 1980s — were certified as eligible for government medical support, according to the Health and Welfare Ministry. Many others, including those who say they were victims of the radioactive 'black rain' that fell outside the initially designated areas of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, are still without support.	https://apnews.com/article/nobel-peace-prize-hibakusha-nihon-hidankyo-survivors-9830508bbfccdd0c9c81dc61bfbe35c0	2024-10-11T21:08:43-07:00	
China's finance minister says there is room for more economic stimulus but offers no plan	BEIJING (AP) — The Chinese government is looking at additional ways to boost the economy, Finance Minister Lan Fo'an said Saturday, but he stopped short of unveiling a major new stimulus plan that analysts and stock investors were hoping for. Lan's remarks left the door open for such a plan in the future but he did not divulge what is under consideration. 'There are other policy tools that are being discussed that are still in the pipeline,' he said at a news conference, adding that there is 'ample room' in the government budget to raise debt and increase the deficit. China's economy has remained sluggish despite the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions at the end of 2022. Companies have cut back on hiring and wages and a prolonged downturn in the property market has deflated consumer confidence, curbing spending. The government has raised pensions and offered subsidies to people who trade in old cars or appliances for new ones, but such steps have failed to jolt economic growth. Chinese stock markets rallied after the central bank and other government agencies announced steps at the end of September to revive the property sector and prop up financial markets. But the rally has since cooled amid concern about whether the moves were enough to generate a sustainable economic recovery. Investors were hoping Lan would announce a stimulus package of up to 2 trillion yuan ($280 million). The finance minister instead said the government would roll out a package of incremental measures to speed up implementation of its existing policies. They include increasing scholarships for students, issuing bonds to help major banks replenish their capital, and providing more support to highly indebted local governments, some of which have had to curtail public services.	https://apnews.com/article/china-finance-minister-economy-stimulus-96aaf75fe6d75c8550f866783f70b10a	2024-10-11T20:15:20-07:00	
As Hezbollah and Israel battle on the border, Lebanon's army watches from the sidelines	BEIRUT (AP) — Since Israel launched its ground invasion of Lebanon, Israeli forces and Hezbollah militants have clashed along the border while the Lebanese army has largely stood on the sidelines. It's not the first time the national army has found itself watching war at home from the discomfiting position of bystander. Lebanon's widely beloved army is one of the few institutions that bridge the country's sectarian and political divides. Several army commanders have become president, and the current commander, Gen. Joseph Aoun, is widely regarded as one of the front-runners to step in when the deadlocked parliament fills a two-year vacuum and names a president. But with an aging arsenal and no air defenses, and battered by five years of economic crisis, the national army is ill-prepared to defend Lebanon against either aerial bombardment or a ground offensive by a well-equipped modern army like Israel’s. The army is militarily overshadowed by Hezbollah. The Lebanese army has about 80,000 troops, with around 5,000 of them deployed in the south. Hezbollah has more than 100,000 fighters, according to the militant group’s late leader, Hassan Nasrallah. Its arsenal — built with support from Iran — is also more advanced. A cautious initial response Israeli forces and Hezbollah fighters have been clashing since Oct. 8, 2023, when the Lebanese militant group began firing rockets over the border in support of its ally Hamas in Gaza. In recent weeks, Israel has conducted a major aerial bombardment of Lebanon and a ground invasion that it says aims to push Hezbollah back from the border and allow displaced residents of northern Israel to return. As Israeli troops made their first forays across the border and Hezbollah responded with rocket fire, Lebanese soldiers withdrew from observation posts along the frontier and repositioned about 5 kilometers (3 miles) back. So far, Israeli forces have not advanced that far. The only direct clashes between the two national armies were on Oct. 3, when Israeli tank fire hit a Lebanese army position in the area of Bint Jbeil, killing a soldier, and on Friday, when two soldiers were killed in an airstrike in the same area. The Lebanese army said it returned fire both times. Lebanon's army declined to comment on how it will react if Israeli ground forces advance farther. Analysts familiar with the army’s workings said that, should the Israeli incursion reach the current army positions, Lebanese troops would put up a fight — but a limited one. The army's 'natural and automatic mission is to defend Lebanon against any army that may enter Lebanese territory,' said former Lebanese Army Gen. Hassan Jouni. 'Of course, if the Israeli enemy enters, it will defend, but within the available capabilities … without going to the point of recklessness or suicide.' Israeli and Lebanese armies are ‘a total overmatch’ The current Israeli invasion of Lebanon is its fourth into the neighboring country in the past 50 years. In most of the previous invasions, the Lebanese army played a similarly peripheral role. The one exception, said Aram Nerguizian, a senior associate with the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, was in 1972, when Israel attempted to create a 20-kilometer (12-mile) buffer zone to push back Palestinian Liberation Organization fighters. At that time, Nerguizian said, the Lebanese army successfully slowed the pace of the Israeli advance and 'bought time for political leadership in Beirut to seek the intervention of the international community to pressure Israel for a cease-fire.' But the internal situation in Lebanon — and the army's capabilities — deteriorated with the outbreak of a 15-year civil war in 1975, during which both Israeli and Syrian forces occupied parts of the country. Hezbollah was the only faction that was allowed to keep its weapons after the civil war, for the stated goal of resisting Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon — which ended in 2000. By 2006, when Hezbollah and Israel fought a bruising monthlong war, the Lebanese army 'had not been able to invest in any real-world post-war modernization, had no ability to deter Israeli air power' and 'was left completely exposed,' Nerguizian said. 'The few times that the (Lebanese army) and Israeli forces did engage militarily, there was total overmatch.' International aid has been a mixed blessing After the 2011 outbreak of civil war in neighboring Syria and the rise of the Islamic State militant group there, the Lebanese army saw a new influx of military aid. It successfully battled against IS on Lebanon’s border in 2017, although not alone — Hezbollah was simultaneously attacking the group on the other side of the border. When Lebanon’s financial system and currency collapsed in 2019, the army took a hit. It had no budget to buy weapons and maintain its existing supplies, vehicles and aircraft. An average soldier’s salary is now worth around $220 per month, and many resorted to working second jobs. At one point, the United States and Qatar both gave a monthly subsidy for soldiers’ salaries. The U.S. had been a primary funder of the Lebanese army before the crisis. It has given some $3 billion in military aid since 2006, according to the State Department, which said in a statement that it aims 'to enable the Lebanese military to be a stabilizing force against regional threats' and 'strengthen Lebanon’s sovereignty, secure its borders, counter internal threats, and disrupt terrorist facilitation.' President Joe Biden's administration has also touted the Lebanese army as a key part of any diplomatic solution to the current war, with hopes that an increased deployment of its forces would supplant Hezbollah in the border area. But that support has limits. Aid to the Lebanese army has sometimes been politically controversial within the U.S., with some legislators arguing that it could fall into the hands of Hezbollah, although there is no evidence that has happened. In Lebanon, many believe that the U.S. has blocked the army from obtaining more advanced weaponry that might allow it to defend against Israel — America’s strongest ally in the region and the recipient of at least $17.9 billion in U.S. military aid in the year since the war in Gaza began. 'It is my personal opinion that the United States does not allow the (Lebanese) military to have advanced air defense equipment, and this matter is related to Israel,' said Walid Aoun, a retired Lebanese army general and military analyst. Nerguizian said the perception is 'not some conspiracy or half-truth,' noting that the U.S. has enacted a legal requirement to support Israel's qualitative military edge relative to all other militaries in the region. ___ Associated Press writer Matt Lee in Washington contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/lebanese-army-laf-israel-hezbollah-78f6ad2da82d64d1ae266aa5394e6d4e	2024-10-11T19:47:46-07:00	
UK leader Keir Starmer is marking 100 days in office. It has been a rocky ride	LONDON (AP) — British Prime Minister Keir Starmer marks 100 days in office Saturday with little cause for celebration. Starmer’s center-left Labour Party was elected by a landslide on July 4, sweeping back to power after 14 years. But after weeks of stories about feuding, freebies and fiscal gloom, polls suggest Starmer’s personal approval rating has plummeted, and Labour is only slightly more popular than a Conservative Party that was rejected by voters after years of infighting and scandal. 'You couldn’t really have imagined a worse start,' said Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London. 'First impressions count, and it’s going to be difficult to turn those around.' Starmer won the election on promises to banish years of turmoil and scandal under Conservative governments, get Britain’s sluggish economy growing and restore frayed public services such as the state-funded National Health Service. His government argues it has made a strong start: It has ended long-running strikes by doctors and railway workers, set up a publicly owned green energy firm, scrapped the Conservatives' contentious plan to deport asylum-seekers to Rwanda and introduced bills to strengthen rights for workers and renters. Starmer has traveled to Washington, the United Nations and European capitals as he seeks to show that ' Britain is back ' after years of inward-looking wrangling over Brexit. But the United Kingdom, like its allies, has struggled to have much impact on spiraling conflicts in the Middle East and the grinding war in Ukraine. The new government also has faced crises at home, including days of far-right fueled anti-immigrant violence that erupted in towns and cities across England and Northern Ireland in the summer. Starmer condemned the rioters as 'mindless thugs' and vowed to jail those responsible. So far, more than 800 people have appeared in court and almost 400 have gone to prison. Starmer’s most intractable problem is Britain’s sluggish economy, hobbled by rising public debt and low growth of just 0.2% in August, according to official figures. Starmer has warned that things will be 'tough in the short term' before they get better. He says public spending will be constrained by a 22-billion-pound ($29 billion) 'black hole' in the public finances left by the Conservatives. One of the government’s first acts was to strip millions of retirees of a payment intended to help heat their homes in winter. It was intended to signal determination to take tough economic decisions, but it spawned a sharp backlash from Labour members and sections of the public. It also sat awkwardly with news that Starmer had accepted thousands of pounds' worth of clothes and designer eyeglasses from a wealthy Labour donor. Starmer insisted the gifts were within the rules, but after days of negative headlines agreed to pay back 6,000 pounds' (almost $8,000) worth of gifts and hospitality, including tickets to see Taylor Swift. Government officials and advisers have traded blame for the faltering start, with the focus on Downing Street Chief of Staff Sue Gray, and her reported tensions with Labour campaign strategist Morgan McSweeney. Amid intense media scrutiny — which produced the revelation that Gray earned more than the prime minister — she resigned Sunday, saying stories about her 'risked becoming a distraction.' McSweeney is replacing her as Starmer’s chief of staff. Anand Menon, director of the political think tank U.K. in a Changing Europe, wrote on its website that the government made 'avoidable mistakes' that allowed a 'perception of incompetence and dysfunction' to take hold. The government’s focus is now on Oct. 30, when Treasury chief Rachel Reeves will set out her first budget. She has ruled out increasing income tax, sales tax or corporation tax, but also says there will be no 'return to austerity' — a hard circle to square. She is thought to be considering hiking levies on wealth such as capital gains or inheritance tax. The government is hoping it can take painful decisions early and then turn things around by showing a growing economy and improving living standards. And it has time — there does not have to be another election until 2029. Starmer will be working from 10 Downing St. on his 100th day in office, and aides insist he is not musing on whether his first weeks have been a success. 'It’s for the public to judge that,' spokesperson Camilla Marshall said. 'The government is focused on delivery.' Bale said the government can rebuild trust with voters, if it shows 'not only that it’s had a pretty dire inheritance, but that it has a plan to improve the country.' 'What’s been lacking in some ways is the vision thing,' he said. 'I don’t think people have that much of a sense of what Keir Starmer or indeed Labour is about. And that’s something they need to put right very quickly.'	https://apnews.com/article/uk-labour-starmer-100-days-c0b8a3439fc67d4392ba43d09e9f1fc2	2024-10-11T19:03:08-07:00	
Drought is parching the world's largest man-made lake, stripping Zambia of its electricity	LAKE KARIBA, Zambia (AP) — Tindor Sikunyongana is trying to run a welding business which these days means buying a diesel generator with costly fuel he can't always afford. Like everyone in Zambia, Sikunyongana is facing a daily struggle to find and afford electricity during a climate-induced energy crisis that’s robbed the southern African country of almost all its power. 'Only God knows when this crisis will end,' said Sikunyongana. His generator ran out of diesel and spluttered to a halt as he spoke. 'You see what I mean?' he said. Zambia's worst electricity blackouts in memory have been caused by a severe drought in the region that has left the critical Kariba dam, the source of Sikunyongana's woes, with insufficient water to run its hydroelectric turbines. Kariba is the largest man-made lake in the world by volume and lies 200 kilometers (125 miles) south of Lusaka on the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe. The massive dam wall was built in the 1950s and more than 80 workers died during construction. It was meant to revolutionize the countries' energy supplies by trapping the water of the Zambezi River, turning a valley into a huge lake and providing an endless supply of renewable hydroelectric power. That's not the case anymore as months of drought brought by the naturally occurring El Nino weather pattern and exacerbated by warming temperatures have put Zambia's hydroelectric station on the brink of completely shutting down for the first time. The water level is so low that only one of the six turbines on Zambia's side of the dam is able to operate, cutting generation to less than 10% of normal output. Zambia relies on Kariba for more than 80% of its national electricity supply, and the result is Zambians have barely a few hours of power a day at the best of times. Often, areas are going without electricity for days. Edla Musonda is so exasperated that she’s taken to lugging her entire desktop computer — hard drive, monitor, everything — to a local cafe so she can work. Musonda and others cram into the Mercato Cafe in the Zambian capital of Lusaka, not for the sandwiches or the ambiance but because it has a diesel generator. Tables are cluttered with power strips and cables as people plug in cell phones, laptops and in Musonda’s case, a home office. This is the only way her small travel business is going to survive. Less than half of Zambia's 20 million people had access to electricity before Kariba's problems. Millions more have now been forced to adjust as mothers find different ways to cook for their families and children do their homework by candlelight. The most damaging impact is during the daylight hours when small businesses, the backbone of the country, struggle to operate. 'This is also going to increase poverty levels in the country,' said economist Trevor Hambayi, who fears Zambia's economy will shrink dramatically if the power crisis is prolonged. It's a warning call to the Zambian government and the continent in general about the danger to development of relying heavily on one source of energy that is so climate dependent. The power crisis is a bigger blow to the economy and the battle against poverty than the lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic, said Zambia Association of Manufacturers president Ashu Sagar. Africa contributes the least to global warming but is the most vulnerable continent to extreme weather events and climate change as poor countries can't meet the high financials costs of adapting. This year's drought in southern Africa is the worst in decades and has parched crops and left millions hungry, causing Zambia and others to already declare national disasters and ask for aid. Hydroelectric power accounts for 17% of Africa’s energy generation, but that figure is expected to rise to 23% by 2040, according to the International Energy Agency. Zambia is not alone in that hydroelectric power makes up over 80% of the energy mix in Mozambique, Malawi, Uganda, Ethiopia and Congo, even as experts warn it will become more unreliable. 'Extreme weather patterns, including prolonged droughts, make it clear that overreliance on hydro is no longer sustainable,' said Carlos Lopes, a professor at the Mandela School of Public Governance at the University of Cape Town in South Africa. The Zambian government has urged people and businesses to embrace solar power. But many Zambians can't afford the technology, while the government itself has turned to more familiar but polluting diesel generators to temporarily power hospitals and other buildings. It has also said it will increase its electricity from coal-fired stations out of necessity. While neighboring Zimbabwe has also lost much of its electricity generation from Kariba and blackouts there are also frequent, it gets a greater share of its power from coal plants. At Kariba, the 128-meter-high (420-feet) dam wall is almost completely exposed. A dry, reddish-brown stain near the top marks where the water once reached in better times more than a decade ago. Leonard Siamubotu, who has taken tourists on boat cruises on the picturesque lake for more than 20 years, has seen the change. As the water level dropped, it exposed old, dead trees that were completely submerged for years after the wall was built. 'I’m seeing this tree for the first time,' he said of one that's appeared in the middle of the lake. The lake's water level naturally rises and recedes according to the season, but generally it should go up by around six meters after the rains. It moved by less than 30 centimeters after the last rainy season barely materialized, authorities said. They hope this year's rains, which should start in November, will be good. But they estimate that it'll still take three good years for Kariba to fully recover its hydroelectric capability. Experts say there's also no guarantee those rains will come and it's dangerous to rely on a changing climate given Zambia has had drought-induced power problems before, and the trend is they are getting worse. 'That's not a solution ... just to sit and wait for nature,' said Hambayi. ___ Associated Press journalist Taiwo Adebayo in Abuja, Nigeria contributed to this report. ___ For more news on Africa and development: https://apnews.com/hub/africa-pulse ___ The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

Morocco's King lauds new allies in Western Sahara dispute after European court ruling	RABAT, Morocco (AP) — King Mohammed VI on Friday reaffirmed that settling sovereignty disputes over the Western Sahara remains the driving force behind Morocco's foreign policy, lauding diplomatic triumphs and framing them as progress toward resolving the decades-long conflict in Morocco's favor. In an annual speech to members of parliament, the king noted that the United States, Spain and most recently France had backed Morocco's autonomy plan for the disputed territory. He thanked President Emmanuel Macron for his 'frank support for the ‘Moroccanness’ of the Sahara.' 'So it is that the French Republic supports Morocco’s sovereignty over the entire Sahara territory,' he said. Mohammed VI invited Macron to visit Morocco after France shifted its position in July, a gesture reflecting how relations between Paris and Rabat have warmed. The disputed territory, which Morocco considers to be its 'southern provinces,' is among the most sensitive topics in the North African Kingdom and a common theme in royal speeches. Morocco has pushed countries that partner with it economically and on security and managing migration to back its 2007 autonomy plan, which would grant it sovereignty over the region in question. Doing so, however, risks angering Algeria — a key player in the conflict as well as a security partner and gas supplier to many of the same countries. The Western Sahara is a former colony that has been a lightning rod in regional politics since the 1970s. The United Nations categorizes it as among Africa's last 'non-self-governing territories' and has since 1979 considered a pro-independence movement called the Polisario Front to be a legitimate representative of the Sahrawi people. Most of the territory is controlled by Morocco, while the Polisario operates out of refugee camps in Algeria, which supports it both financially and politically. Efforts to resolve the conflict span back to 1991, when the U.N. brokered a cease-fire and negotiations began over the territory's future. With discussions long stalled, Morocco has sought recognition among its political and economic allies while the Polisario has pursued legal routes, challenging Morocco's claims in international courts. The United States backed Morocco's plan as part of an agreement that saw Morocco normalizing its ties with Israel in 2020. Countries including Saudi Arabia and 18 European Union members have since followed suit, according to Morocco's tally. In July, France amended its longstanding position to begin backing Morocco's plan. Algeria subsequently withdrew its ambassador from France and its president indefinitely postponed a planned visit to Paris. Weeks ago, Europe's Court of Justice issued a ruling in favor of the Polisario, invalidating expired fishing and agricultural agreements between Morocco and the European Union pertaining to exports from the territory because they didn't take the people of the Western Sahara into account. Morocco has also recruited allies in the Middle East and Africa and struck ground on infrastructure projects including a territory-spanning highway and an Atlantic port that it plans to use to grow its influence as an Atlantic and African power. Mohammed VI on Friday said Morocco's African allies consider the territory 'the heart of strategic continental initiatives,' including a planned pipeline extending from Nigeria and an initiative announced last year to give countries in the Sahel additional access to Atlantic trade routes. 'The fundamentals of Morocco’s position need to be explained to the small number of countries that continue to turn the logic of law on its head and deny the facts of history,' he told members of parliament. The opening of parliament is one of the rare instances in which Mohammed VI gives public speeches. During his address, the king was flanked by his brother, Prince Moulay Rachid, and son, Prince Moulay Hassan, who is expected to succeed him. The king spent much of the summer at a palace in the northern city of Tetouan, where he received Morocco’s central bank governor, Olympic Gold-winning runner Soufiane El Bakkali and celebrated the 25th anniversary of his ascension to the throne, according to Morocco's state news agency.	https://apnews.com/article/morocco-king-mohammed-parliament-speech-western-sahara-b05bc2d69cc22a96bc25e5b1e8ede201	2024-10-11T14:41:31-07:00	
Trump's campaign requests military aircraft and armored vehicles in response to threats from Iran	NEW YORK (AP) — Donald Trump 's aides have requested a slew of stepped-up security measures, including military aircraft capable of shooting down surface-to-air missiles to transport the former president in the race’s final stretch, amid growing concerns over threats from Iran in a campaign already shaken by violence. The campaign's highly unusual request comes as the Republican candidate faces death threats from Iran, which has also targeted other former Trump administration officials and has also been blamed for a widespread hack of top campaign officials. Trump narrowly survived one assassination attempt and U.S. Secret Service agents foiled a second, though neither case has been publicly linked to Iranian actors. Beyond a military plane, the campaign has asked for special armored vehicles typically reserved for sitting presidents, expanded temporary flight restrictions over his rallies and his residences, reimbursements for decoy aircraft, and more money for the U.S. Secret Service and local law enforcement agencies that assist in Trump’s protection. Both Trump and his staff have complained that he is being restricted from campaigning the way he wants to because the agency lacks the resources to keep him safe. The Secret Service insisted Friday that Trump is already 'receiving the highest levels of protection.' And President Joe Biden told reporters that he would be happy to approve Trump’s request to use military aircraft in the final stages of the campaign, as long as 'he doesn't ask for F-15s.' 'Look, what I’ve told the department is to give him every single thing he needs for his — as if he were a sitting president,' he said. 'Give him all that he needs. If it fits within that category, that’s fine. But it doesn’t, he shouldn’t.' The new security requests were first reported by the New York Times. The campaign and Secret Service have gone back and forth The Trump campaign’s requests were outlined in a letter to acting Secret Service director Ronald Rowe Jr. from senior Trump campaign adviser Susie Wiles and obtained by The Associated Press. She asked the Secret Service to pre-position the ballistic glass that Trump now uses for protection at his outdoor rallies in the seven battleground states where he is expected to spend the majority of time in the race’s final stretch. Currently, it takes more than a week's notice to position the barriers in the right place, according to a person familiar with the requests who, like others, spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss security matters. Trump aides see that advance notice as unrealistic given the frenetic nature of the final days of a campaign, when schedules are adjusted based on incoming polls and campaign strategy, the person said. In a statement, Secret Service spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said that since the attempted assassination on July 13 at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, the agency 'has made comprehensive enhancements to its communications capabilities, resourcing and protective operations' and that Trump 'is receiving the highest levels of protection.' He said the Department of Defense regularly provides assistance for Trump's protection, including canine units, and that the Secret Service has been restricting air traffic over the former president’s residence and when he travels. 'Additionally, the former President is receiving the highest level of technical security assets, which include unmanned aerial vehicles, counter unmanned aerial surveillance systems, ballistics and other advanced technology systems,' he said. Former American presidents are able to use military airlift only if requested by the current president. In April, for instance, former President Bill Clinton used one as he led a U.S. delegation to Rwanda. On Sept. 11, 2021, Biden, Clinton, and former President Barack Obama flew to a remembrance in New York. Trump has accused Biden of denying him resources The Trump campaign for weeks now has accused the U.S. Secret Service of forcing it to cancel or scale back events due to a lack of resources. That includes a speech in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, held the same week as the U.N. General Assembly in New York, that was scaled back because the Secret Service couldn't secure a larger rally. Trump has accused Biden of intentionally denying security resources to help Vice President Kamala Harris, his Democratic opponent, by preventing him from addressing large crowds. 'They couldn’t give me any help. And I’m so angry about it because what they’re doing is interfering in the election,' he said in a recent Fox News interview. Trump, however, has repeatedly praised his own security detail, commending them for their bravery. While the Secret Service says Trump already has presidential-level protection, there are differences. Both Biden and Harris, for instance, have military assets, including planes. Beyond her Sept. 30 letter, Wiles has also spoken with White House Chief of Staff Jeff Zients and others about her concerns about Trump's security and how his ability to campaign has been curtailed by threats. Zients, according to a person who spoke on condition of anonymity to disclose details of their conversation, connected Wiles to Homeland Security Department and Secret Service leadership after she reached out and made clear that Biden had directed the Secret Service to provide the highest level of protection for Trump. In a separate letter, Rep. Mike Waltz of Florida, who is close to Trump, urged the Secret Service, Department of Homeland Security, White House and Department of Defense to deploy additional military assets to protect Trump in the face of Iranian threats. He requested that Trump be provided with a military passenger aircraft like those used by cabinet secretaries. Trump aides call for action against Iran Trump has been targeted by Iran, which is believed to want retaliation for his administration’s killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani. In August, a Pakistani man alleged to have links to Iran was charged in a plot to carry out political assassinations on U.S. soil. Law enforcement did not name the targets of the alleged plot, but legal filings suggest Trump was a potential target. Iranian hackers have also been charged with stealing information from Trump’s campaign and trying to pass it along to news organizations. In May, prosecutors say, the men charged began trying to penetrate the Trump campaign, successfully breaking into the email accounts of campaign officials and other Trump allies. They then sought to 'weaponize' the stolen campaign material by sending unsolicited emails to people associated with Biden’s campaign. None of the recipients who worked for Biden responded. Trump's campaign has complained that the Biden White House has downplayed the death threats. 'This administration spends more time focused on a hack of emails than they do the Iranians who are trying to kill Donald Trump,' Trump campaign senior adviser Chris LaCivita told reporters in Pennsylvania last weekend. He noted that former President Clinton deployed cruise missiles in retaliation for an Iraqi plot to assassinate former President George H.W. Bush. 'You know he did? He sent a bunch of cruise missiles to send a message,' LaCivita complained. 'All they do is put out a press release.' In a statement, National Security Council spokesman Sean Savett said the Biden administration has been 'closely tracking Iranian threats against former President Trump and former Trump administration officials for years, dating back to the last administration.' 'We consider this a national and homeland security matter of the highest priority, and we strongly condemn Iran for these brazen threats,' Savett added, warning that: 'Should Iran attack any of our citizens, including those who continue to serve the United States or those who formerly served, Iran will face severe consequences.' ___ Associated Press writers Aamer Madhani, Zeke Miller, Rebecca Santana, Lolita C.

Oregon's most populous county adds gas utility to $51B climate suit against fossil fuel companies	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — Oregon's Multnomah County, home to Portland, has added the state's largest natural gas utility to its $51.5 billion climate lawsuit against fossil fuel companies over their role in the region's deadly 2021 heat- dome event. The lawsuit, filed last year, accuses the companies’ carbon emissions of being a cause of the heat-dome event, which shattered temperature records across the Pacific Northwest. About 800 people died in Oregon, Washington state and British Columbia in the heat wave, which hit in late June and early July 2021. An amended complaint was filed this week, adding NW Natural to a lawsuit that already named oil giants such as ExxonMobil, Chevron and Shell as defendants. It accuses NW Natural, which provides gas to about 2 million people across the Pacific Northwest, of being responsible for 'a substantial portion' of greenhouse gas emissions in Oregon and deceiving the public about the harm of such emissions. NW Natural said it can't comment in detail until it has completed reviewing the claims. 'However, NW Natural believes that these new claims are an attempt to divert attention from legal and factual laws in the case. NW Natural will vigorously contest the County’s claims should they come to court,' it said in an emailed statement. According to the Center for Climate Integrity, it is the first time a gas utility has been named in a lawsuit accusing fossil fuel companies of climate deception. There are currently over two dozen such lawsuits that have been filed by state, local and tribal governments across the U.S., according to the group. The amended complaint also added the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine, which describes itself as a research group on its website, to the lawsuit. The group has opposed the concept of human-caused global warming. A request for comment sent Friday to the email address on its website was returned to sender. Multnomah County is seeking $51.5 billion in damages, largely for what it estimates to be the cost of responding to the effects of extreme heat, wildfire and drought. 'We’re already paying dearly in Multnomah County for our climate crisis — with our tax dollars, with our health and with our lives,' county chair Jessica Vega Pederson said in a statement. 'Going forward we have to strengthen our safety net just to keep people safe.' After the initial complaint was filed last year, ExxonMobil said the lawsuit didn't address climate change, while a Chevron lawyer said the claims were baseless. When contacted for comment Friday, Shell said it was working to reduce its emissions. 'Addressing climate change requires a collaborative, society-wide approach,' it said in an emailed statement. 'We do not believe the courtroom is the right venue to address climate change, but that smart policy from government and action from all sectors is the appropriate way to reach solutions and drive progress.' The case is pending in Multnomah County Circuit Court.	https://apnews.com/article/oregon-climate-change-lawsuit-gas-utility-fossil-fuels-a4fe9191d693969408471c9c03f0d721	2024-10-11T12:08:47-07:00	
U.S. expands sanctions on Iran in response to its ballistic attack on Israel	WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. on Friday announced new sanctions on Iran's energy sector in response to its Oct. 1 attack on Israel when it fired roughly 180 missiles into the country. Iran said the barrage was retaliation for a series of devastating blows Israel has landed in recent weeks against the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah in Lebanon, which has been firing rockets into Israel since the war in Gaza began. Included in Friday's sanctions are blocks on Iran's so-called 'ghost fleet' of ships and associated firms that span the United Arab Emirates, Liberia, Hong Kong and other jurisdictions that allegedly obfuscate and transport Iranian oil for sale to buyers in Asia. Additionally, the U.S. State Department designated a network of companies based in Suriname, India, Malaysia and Hong Kong for allegedly arranging for the sale and transport of petroleum and petroleum products from Iran. Current U.S. law authorizes sanctions targeting Iran’s energy sector as well as foreign firms that buy sell and transport Iranian oil. But energy sanctions are often a delicate issue as restricting supplies could push up prices for global commodities that the U.S. and its allies need. Jake Sullivan, the U.S. national security advise, said the new sanctions 'will help further deny Iran financial resources used to support its missile programs and provide support for terrorist groups that threaten the United States, its allies, and partners.' The penalties aim to block them from using the U.S. financial system and bar American citizens from dealing with them. Israel and Iran have fought a shadow war for years, but rarely have they come into direct conflict. Increasingly, however, escalating attacks between Israel and Iran and its Arab allies threaten to push the Middle East closer to a regional war. Iran launched another direct attack on Israel in April, but few of its projectiles reached their targets. Many were shot down by a U.S.-led coalition while others apparently failed at launch or crashed in flight. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Friday that the United States 'will not hesitate to take further action to hold Iran accountable.'	https://apnews.com/article/treasury-sanctions-iran-gaza-israel-hezbollah-lebanon-5c3d798a1916e4ee197b13d000a776c1	2024-10-11T12:02:24-07:00

Lawsuit in US targets former Salvadoran colonel in 1982 killings of Dutch journalists	CENTREVILLE, Va. (AP) — The brother of a Dutch journalist slain in 1982 covering El Salvador's civil war has filed a lawsuit against a former Salvadoran military officer who has lived for decades in the northern Virginia suburbs and is accused of orchestrating the killing. The lawsuit, filed Thursday in U.S. District Court in Alexandria, seeks unspecified monetary damages against Mario Adalberto Reyes Mena and a declaration that he is responsible for the killings of Jan Kuiper and three other Dutch journalists. Reyes Mena, now 85, was a colonel who commanded El Salvador’s Fourth Infantry Brigade. That unit, and Reyes Mena in particular, were declared responsible for the journalists' deaths by a United Nations Truth Commission that was established in 1992 as part of the peace agreement that ended El Salvador's civil war. An estimated 75,000 civilians were killed during El Salvador’s civil war, mostly by U.S.-backed government security forces. 'The killing of the Dutch Journalists, which the U.N. Truth Commission highlighted as among the most emblematic crimes committed during the civil war, demonstrated the brutality with which the Salvadoran Security Forces sought to stifle national and international independent media in El Salvador,' the lawyers wrote in their complaint. Kuiper and three other Dutch television journalists — Koos Koster, Hans ter Laag and Joop Willemsen — were ambushed as they tried to travel to territory controlled by the leftist guerilla group that was fighting the Salvadoran Security Forces. According to the truth commission, the killings occurred near the El Paraíso military base that was under the command of Reyes Mena, who ordered the ambush. Kuiper's family and others who have sought to bring the journalists' killers to justice have been thwarted for decades. Shortly after the truth commission released its report, the Salvadoran government passed an amnesty law that shielded Reyes Mena and other military officers from prosecution. But El Salvador's Supreme Court struck down the amnesty law as unconstitutional in 2016. In 2022, a judge ordered the arrest of Reyes Mena and others, including former defense minister Gen. José Guillermo García and Col. Francisco Antonio Morán, former director of the now-defunct treasury police, in connection with the journalists' killing. According to the lawsuit, Reyes Mena ended his travel to El Salvador when the arrest warrants were issued. The lawsuit said there's no indication that Reyes Mena will be extradited, even though a notice seeking his arrest has been posted with Interpol. The Salvadoran Embassy referred questions about efforts to extradite Reyes Mena to the country's court system, which said a formal public information request must be submitted. The U.S. State Department referred questions Friday to the Justice Department, which did not respond. At Reyes Mena’s Centreville townhouse, a woman who identified herself as his wife declined to comment Thursday and said she would relay a reporter’s request for comment to their lawyer, whom she did not identify. The Center for Justice and Accountability, a nonprofit legal group that filed the lawsuit on behalf of Kuiper's brother, Gert Kuiper, has brought multiple cases over the years against individuals accused of overseas war crimes under U.S. laws like the Torture Victim Protection Act. In 2019, a jury at the Alexandria courthouse found a northern Virginia man who once served as a colonel in the Somali Army during the regime of dictator Siad Barre responsible for torturing a Somali man in the 1980s. The jury awarded $500,000 in damages. It also won a $21 million default judgement against a former Somali defense minister and prime minister, Mohamed Ali Samantar. Other efforts to hold foreign officials accountable have failed. Earlier this year, a judge in Alexandria tossed out a series of civil lawsuits against a Libyan military commander, Khalifa Hifter, who used to live in Virginia and was accused of killing innocent civilians in that country’s civil war. The Hifter lawsuits were not brought by the Center for Justice and Accountability.	https://apnews.com/article/salvador-dutch-journalist-lawsuit-kuiper-reyes-717fac8d4abb9a6955fa773f9742a9c8	2024-10-11T08:56:00-07:00	
UN peacekeepers in southern Lebanon in crosshairs of Israel’s war on Hezbollah	BEIRUT (AP) — Israeli airstrikes hit the headquarters of the U.N. peacekeeping force and other positions in southern Lebanon in recent days, drawing widespread condemnation from around the world. The force, known as UNIFIL, said new explosions hit its headquarters on Friday morning, injuring two peacekeepers, a day after Israeli forces struck the same position, injuring two others. As Israel escalates its campaign against Hezbollah in the south, the 10,000-strong peacekeeping force is increasingly in the crosshairs, highlighting the fragility of its personnel amid an expanding ground invasion by Israel. The attacks are taking place in the backdrop of worsening relations between Israel and the United Nations over the way Israel has conducted its war in Gaza. In an unprecedented move, Israel earlier this month said the U.N. chief was persona non grata in Israel, signaling a new low in relations. Here’s a look at the U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon and the latest developments: What is UNIFIL? The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon was created in 1978 to oversee the withdrawal of Israeli troops after Israel invaded and occupied south Lebanon. Israel invaded again in 1982, and it was not until 2000 that it withdrew from the country. In the absence of an agreed-upon border, the U.N. drew up a boundary between Lebanon and Israel known as the Blue Line, which UNIFIL monitors and patrols. The United Nations expanded UNIFIL’s original mission following the monthlong 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, allowing peacekeepers to deploy along the Israeli border to monitor the cessation of hostilities between the two sides and patrol a buffer zone set up along the border. The force currently has some 10,000 peacekeepers stationed in southern Lebanon drawn from around 50 countries. The troops patrol, monitor and report violations of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701 which ended the 2006 fighting. The force also provides support to local communities. What happened in the last two days? On Thursday, UNIFIL said an Israeli tank 'directly' fired on its headquarters in the town of Naqoura, knocking down an observation tower and injuring two Indonesian peacekeepers, who were hospitalized. It said its headquarters and nearby positions 'have been repeatedly hit' and that Israel 'deliberately' fired on and disabled the headquarters’ monitoring cameras. It also said the Israeli army fired on a nearby bunker where peacekeepers were sheltering. On Friday, UNIFIL said new explosions hit its headquarters, injuring two more peacekeepers, although it did not directly blame Israel. It also said an Israeli army bulldozer hit the perimeter of another of its positions in southern Lebanon while Israeli tanks moved nearby. The attacks drew global condemnation. Italy, which has about 1,000 soldiers deployed in southern Lebanon, and France summoned the Israeli ambassadors in protest. Italy's defense minister said the attacks were possible 'war crimes.' Human Rights Watch, in a statement, used similar language. Tensions between the two sides had been mounting for days. Earlier this month, Israel asked UNIFIL to move its personnel further north, which the peacekeeping force refused to do. 'We won’t accept the justification that Israeli military forces had previously alerted UNIFIL that some of its bases had to be abandoned,' Defense Minister Guido Crosetto said Thursday at a press conference in Rome, calling the attacks 'not an accident nor a mistake.' What has Israel said? The Israeli army has expressed deep concern over Thursday's incident and says it is conducting a thorough review at the highest levels of command to determine the details. On Friday, it said its soldiers were responding with fire to an immediate threat against them, adding that the army had instructed UNIFIL personnel to enter into protected spaces and remain there, hours before the incident. It also accused Hezbollah of deliberately operating near U.N. posts, thereby endangering their personnel. There have been several incidents during the current war where UNIFIL said that Israel had shot at patrol vehicles or shelled their positions. The United Nations peacekeeping force has had a troubled history with Israel. In 1996, during a 17-day Israeli offensive against Hezbollah, Israel shelled a United Nations compound near the village of Qana where hundreds of displaced civilians were sheltering. The attack killed 106 civilians, including at least 37 children. Four Fijian soldiers assigned to UNIFIL were seriously injured. How does this affect the mission? The Israeli military is asking that the peacekeeping force move 5 kilometers (3 miles) north to avoid being caught in the fighting between its troops and Hezbollah militants. That effectively would impede the peacekeeping force from doing its mission. The U.N. peacekeeping chief, Jean-Pierre Lacroix, told an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council Thursday that UNIFIL would not evacuate its personnel, but because of air and ground attacks they cannot conduct patrols. He said UNIFIL operations have virtually come to a halt since late September, when Israel expanded its campaign against Hezbollah in the south. 'Peacekeepers have been confined to their bases with significant periods of time in shelter,' he said, adding that the security environment has also presented challenges for the resupply of fuel, food and water for U.N. positions. Later Thursday, Lacroix said 300 peacekeepers in frontline positions had been temporarily moved to larger bases, and that plans to move another 200 will depend on security conditions as the conflict escalates. He said UNIFIL had decided to reduce its footprint 'at the most affected U.N. positions by 25%.' On Oct. 3, he told reporters that in some places in southern Lebanon, the number of peacekeepers had been reduced by about 20%. Nick Birnback, U.N. peacekeeping’s chief of strategic communications, said: 'UNIFIL has remained in its positions along the Blue Line without interruption since its establishment.' The Italian minister also reiterated that a final decision on whether to stop the UNIFIL mission in southern Lebanon for security reasons is up to the U.N.	https://apnews.com/article/unifil-peacekeeping-lebanon-israel-peacekeeping-b03091462dbb2e025a6fcad1acdba08f	2024-10-11T08:48:55-07:00	
Activists risk their lives to rescue animals in areas of Lebanon hit by Israeli airstrikes	BEIRUT (AP) — Hours after an Israeli strike destroyed a three-story building in Beirut, killing at least 10 people, Maggie Sharawi received a telephone call from a person living nearby saying that the attack had killed a cat that had several kittens. While civil defense members were combing through the rubble for human victims or survivors, Sharawi and other members of Animals Lebanon, an animal protection organization, also rushed to the scene in Beirut’s central Burj Abi Haidar neighborhood Friday. They began climbing through rubble, twisted metal and collapsed walls to reach the kittens. The animals, just a few days old, were pulled out, put in a plastic carrier and taken away as the rescuers continued searching for other cats whose cries could be heard emerging from under the debris. Sharawi said that over the past three weeks they have managed to rescue 190 animals from strike sites in Beirut and its southern suburbs. In some cases, she added, they give the animals back to their owners while others remain at the group’s shelter in the Lebanese capital. 'We believe that caring for animals is caring for humans. In the end it is the people who are calling us for help,' Sharawi said. Since Lebanon’s Hezbollah started attacking Israeli military posts along the border in October last year and Israel responded with airstrikes and shelling in much of southern Lebanon, animal rights activists have been going to the south to help rescue pets. After Israel intensified its attacks on parts of Lebanon on Sept. 23, leading to the displacement of hundreds of thousands, many people left their pets behind in south Lebanon or in Beirut’s southern suburbs. Since then, animal rights activists have increased their missions, putting their own lives in danger in order to rescue the animals, mainly cats and dogs, or to bring them to where their owners have fled. 'Our teams are working 24 hours a day,' said Sharawi, adding that they go into homes in the southern suburbs to bring animals to safety. After the kittens were rescued, two adult cats remained but they were too scared for the activists to approach them. Animals Lebanon members later brought metal traps and baited them with food, hoping that the cats would walk in and be captured. Sharawi said if cats or dogs are injured, they usually rush them straight to a clinic for treatment and those who are in good condition are either sent back to their owners or left at their shelters. Many of the animals they rescue have suffered injuries, including broken bones as a result of walls falling on them. 'We are dealing with cases that we have never seen before,' Sharawi said.	https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-animals-war-israel-hezbollah-airstrikes-rescue-1549ca8f08e7d97b7a5cb27f43b12398	2024-10-11T08:47:31-07:00	
Stellantis CEO under fire from Italian lawmakers as the group grapples with financial troubles	ROME (AP) — Italian lawmakers on Friday questioned the head of Stellantis, the world's fourth largest automaker, over the group’s strategy, one day after it announced a management shakeup in an effort to revive sales. Stellantis, which makes Jeep and Chrysler vehicles, is struggling globally, with the Italian government demanding clarity about its production plans for the country. It also faces a national metal workers strike called by Italy’s main unions for Oct. 18, with a massive demonstration expected in Rome. The group has been under fire following a concerning profit warning in which the company said it expected to finish the year with a negative cash flow of up to 10 billion euros ($11.2 billion). Speaking in front of a parliamentary committee on Friday, Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares stressed that European Union carbon emission rules impose 40% higher costs on the struggling car-making industry. He added that European customers are reluctant to buy expensive electric vehicles, while Chinese competitors can leverage on additional cost advantages. Tavares, whose leadership has recently come under scrutiny, said the sector is under pressure due to a constant change in technologies. 'This can generate anxiety, especially when fast and profound … But we at Stellantis have a very clear roadmap for carrying forward this change,' he said. Tavares has also been under fire from U.S. dealers and the United Auto Workers union after a dismal financial performance this year, caught off guard by too many high-priced vehicles on dealer lots. He has been trying to cut costs by delaying factory openings, laying off union workers and offering buyouts to salaried employees. Italian lawmakers pointed to a significant cutback in car manufacturing in Italy, which threatens the country’s once prosperous automotive industry. Stellantis, which was created in 2021 from the merger of Fiat-Chrysler with PSA Peugeot, registered a sharp drop in output at most of its Italian plants in the first half of 2024. Over the past 17 years, the carmaker has slashed its Italian production by nearly 70%. Tavares was invited by lawmakers to explain how he intends to reverse the decline of Italy's car industry. 'The cost of energy here is very high,' he said. 'It is double that of Spain, and this is a significant disadvantage,' he noted, calling for political leaders to provide responses on how to manage the cost increase. Calling for additional state incentives for the struggling electric cars sector, Tavares said: 'We are not asking for money for ourselves, we are asking you to help your citizens, so that they can buy vehicles they can afford.' However, several parliamentarians — mainly from the center-left opposition — blasted Tavares’ hearing as 'disappointing.' Giuseppe Conte, leader of the 5-Star party, noted that Stellantis’ CEO 'didn’t say anything about the future of our factories, nothing specific regarding investments in research, technology and development.' Meanwhile, Democratic Party leader Elly Schlein said that her party will support the autoworkers’ strike. 'We ask that Stellantis discuss with the trade unions and the workers. It cannot be them who bear the costs of what is happening,' she said. In the latest management shakeup announced Thursday, Stellantis' chief financial officer Natalie Knight will be replaced by Doug Ostermann, the company’s chief operating officer in China. Stellantis also appointed new chief operating officers in North America and in Europe. The group in September announced that it was looking for a successor for Tavares, 66, as part of a planned leadership change. Tavares’ five-year contract was a little over a year from its expiration date in 2026, but the company hinted at the time it was possible he might remain in the job beyond that.	https://apnews.com/article/italy-stellantis-ceo-parliament-hearing-lawmakers-financial-troubles-75a2f2979bb349a9d7bd94a0686d5c3f	2024-10-11T08:06:19-07:00	
Treasury official says withdrawing the US from the IMF and World Bank would be a 'step backward'	WASHINGTON (AP) — Withdrawing the United States from the IMF and World Bank would be 'a step backward,' a top U.S. Treasury official said Friday, defending the organizations before a presidential election that could cast uncertainty about America's future in them. In advance of the institutions' annual meetings this month, Jay Shambaugh, the undersecretary for international affairs, alluded to a Project 2025 proposal for the U.S. to pull out of the IMF and World Bank if Donald Trump wins. The proposal is part of a plan created by the Heritage Foundation as a possible handbook for the next Republican administration, though Trump has said it is not related to his campaign and he is not bound to its ideas. 'There are those who have suggested the U.S. withdraw from these institutions; this would be a step backward for our economic security,' Shambaugh said in a speech at the Atlantic Council. Without U.S. leadership, 'we would have less influence and we would weaken these institutions. We cannot afford that.' Often lenders of last resort, the International Monetary Fund and World Bank use billions in loans and assistance to buoy struggling economies and encourage countries operating in deficit to implement reforms they say promote stability and growth. Asked more directly about the Project 2025 plan in a question and answer session, Shambaugh was measured in his response, noting that the Hatch Act restricts partisan political activity by federal employees. But he said that over many decades there have been proposals to withdraw from the institutions by people who say the U.S. would be better off without them. 'I would just say I think the evidence suggests that’s entirely inaccurate,' he said. Within the more than 1,000-page Project 2025, the authors propose that the Treasury Department 'withdraw from both the World Bank and the IMF and terminate its financial contribution to both institutions,' because they 'simply create expensive middle-men, while U.S. funds are intercepted before being distributed to those in need.' Vice President Kamala Harris and Democratic allies have turned Project 2025 into one of their most consistent tools against Trump. He has denied knowing about Heritage's conservative roadmap, even though dozens of his allies and former aides helped to draft the presidential transition plan. Danielle Alvarez, a Trump campaign senior adviser, said 'only President Trump and the campaign, and NOT any other organization or former staff, represent policies for the second term.' She said the 20 promises listed on his campaign website 'are the only policies endorsed by President Trump for a second term,.' The campaign did not answer when asked if he would encourage the U.S. to withdraw from the financial institutions. The IMF and World Bank annual meetings will be held in Washington this month.	https://apnews.com/article/treasury-imf-world-bank-international-finance-43c9a0f3818996fa4e8c8164c5f319d8	2024-10-11T08:00:46-07:00	
New arrests revive concern that nonviolent political protesters in Myanmar may be tortured	BANGKOK (AP) — Concern was rising on Friday that two nonviolent activists opposed to military rule in Myanmar are at high risk of torture after being arrested in raids this week in Yangon, the country’s biggest city. Paing Phyo Min, 27, a leading member of AJAY — the Anti-Junta Alliance Yangon — and Shein Wai Aung, a participant in peaceful protests, were arrested separately on Wednesday night, one of AJAY’s leaders, Nan Lin, told The Associated Press. He said that four other young activists were arrested just hours after participating in a brief Sept. 19 protest in Yangon against high commodity prices and military conscription. The arrests are a reminder that even as the military engages in armed combat against pro-democracy guerrillas and ethnic rebels in the countryside and remote areas, they also seek to bottle up political opposition in major urban areas. AJAY’s Nan Lin said he was worried that the arrested protesters are at high risk of torture by interrogators. He said Paing Phyo Min and Shein Wai Aung were sent to an interrogation center, and there has been no contact with any of the detainees. Rights groups and media, including The Associated Press, have reported extensively on the use of torture on detainees. On its Facebook page, AJAY on Thursday called on the international community and Myanmar's strike committees to exert pressure on the military government to safeguard the detained protesters, expressing particular concern for Paing Phyo Min. Paing Phyo Min is known for his involvement with a group of young people performing Thangyat, a traditional Burmese art form in which the participants present satirical poetry and songs. He was arrested in 2019 along with three others after taking part in Thangyat performances dressed as soldiers. He was sentenced to six years in prison for sedition, but released in April 2021 under a mass amnesty. Nonviolent demonstrations were the main form of protest immediately after the army seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021. After the security forces suppressed them with lethal force, many opponents of the military launched armed resistance, and much of the country is now embroiled in fighting. 'Protesting in Myanmar today is not the same as it was before the coup. Anyone involved in any kind of dissent against the military faces long jail terms, torture and other ill-treatment, and even death in custody,' said Joe Freeman, the Myanmar researcher for the human rights group Amnesty International. 'In Myanmar’s prison system, there is little hope of fair treatment, no transparency, and extremely substandard conditions. Interrogation centers, where these two activists have likely been sent, are also notorious locations of abuse where torture has been used to extract information before charges are formally brought.' According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, which tabulates arrests and deaths, at least 5,800 people have been killed and 27,529 people have been arrested by the security forces since the army takeover. After the crackdowns on street demonstrations in 2021, protests have become fewer in number and usually take the form of flash mobs. Protesters quickly gather, carrying flags, banners or torches, and chant for the overthrow of the military government and the release of civilian leaders currently in detention. They disperse after a few minutes, minimizing the possibility of confrontation with police or soldiers. According to Nan Lin and statements from activist groups in Yangon, the four activists arrested on Sept. 19 were Zaw Lin Htut, also known as Poe Thar, a University Students’ Union Alumni Force co-founder and freelance photojournalist; Aung Min Khaing and Mya Myintzu, members of the Youth Strike Committee; and Hnin Ei Khaing, a former political prisoner. Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, the head of Myanmar’s military-government, at a Tuesday meeting on security and development , told army officers and administrative officials that they must collaborate in maintaining security and peace in greater Yangon, and constantly watch to prevent armed-opponents from infiltrating into the wards and villages, state media reported.	https://apnews.com/article/myanmar-protests-yangon-politics-arrest-torture-09c96b7e94c001c5a86384136838e3ec	2024-10-11T06:45:56-07:00	
Nobel prize for A-bomb survivors' group boosts hope for Japanese seeking a nuke-free world	TOKYO (AP) — For many Japanese survivors of the U.S. atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and their relatives, Friday’s awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to a Japanese organization against nuclear weapons gives them hope for a new momentum to push for a nuclear-free world — starting from getting their own government to sign the nuclear weapons ban treaty. Nihon Hidankyo, an organization of survivors of the two U.S. atomic bombings, became the first Japanese recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize in 50 years since the late Prime Minister Eisaku Sato was honored in 1974 for his contribution to regional stability and Japan's signing of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Toshiyuki Mimaki, the organization’s Hiroshima branch executive, was standing by at the city hall for the announcement. He cheered and teared up when he received the news. 'Is it really true? Unbelievable!' Mimaki screamed, pinching his cheek with his fingers to make sure he was not dreaming. 'I believe the Nobel Peace Prize will give us more power to promote our cause toward achieving a world without nuclear weapons,' said Mimaki, who was exposed to atomic bombing at age 3 in Hiroshima, his father’s hometown, where he evacuated after surviving the U.S. air raid in Tokyo on March 10, 1945. The group’s honor comes seven years after the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons won the peace prize in 2017 for their contribution to the adoption of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. Hidankyo members have helped collect more than 3 million signatures in favor of the treaty, and demanded the reluctant Japanese government sign it and do more to lead the nuclear disarmament as the world’s only country to have suffered atomic attacks. Former Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has been criticized by survivors for refusing to sign the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapon. He has argued that the pact is unworkable because no nuclear-armed state has signed. Japanese leaders have repeatedly promised to serve as a middle ground between nuclear and non-nuclear states and stressed the need for dialogue toward nuclear disarmament, but refused to join the treaty even as an observer. Atomic bombing survivors, or hibakusha, say Japanese leaders are only making hollow promises because Japan relies on the U.S. nuclear umbrella for protection and has been rapidly expanding its military. 'As hibakusha, it is extremely sad to see the Japanese government has not signed or ratified the nuclear weapons ban treaty,' said Terumi Tanaka, 91, a Hidankyo executive who survived the Nagasaki bombing at age 13. 'I hope the Nobel Peace Prize opens up a chance to get the Japanese government to take the step.' Tanaka said the prize is timely in a world increasingly facing the threat of nuclear weapons. 'Sadly, I think many people around the world still don’t understand how inhumane nuclear weapons are,' he said, adding that it is 'a good chance for them to think about what we’ve kept saying all along.' Japan, the United States and other regional partners have been stepping up security cooperation in response to a more assertive China and the growing nuclear and missile threats from North Korea and Russia. Japan has sought stronger U.S. protection by its nuclear capability. Japan’s new Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, a security expert who took office this month, is an advocate of a NATO-style collective defense framework in Asia. 'It is extremely meaningful,' Ishiba said of the Hidankyo’s honor at a news conference from Vientiane where he attended the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. In Tokyo, many expressed surprise and joy as workers distributed a special newspaper edition on Hidankyo’s winning of the peace prize. 'I would be happy if this award can be an opportunity to make the people around the world think,' said Sayaka Nakanishi, a high school teacher. Hiroshima Gov. Hidehiko Yuzaki, an advocate of nuclear disarmament, said Hidankyo’s win meant 'the Nobel Foundation was warning against an international trend toward stronger nuclear armament.' 'We should really take the meaning of the award seriously and think about what they mean when hibakusha say they don’t want anyone else to suffer the same ordeal,' he said. Many survivors of the bombings have suffered lasting injuries and illnesses resulting from the explosions and radiation exposure and have faced discrimination in Japan. Aging survivors are also worried about how to keep their stories alive for younger generations. Nagasaki Mayor Shiro Suzuki, whose parents were hibakusha, expressed hope that the international recognition for Hidankyo will help inspire younger generations around the world. The atomic bomb dropped by the United States on Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945, killed 140,000 people, and a second bomb dropped on Nagasaki three days later killed another 70,000. Japan surrendered on Aug. 15, 1945, ending World War II and its nearly half-century of aggression across Asia. Hidankyo was formed 11 years later in 1956, amid a growing anti-nuclear movement in Japan in response to U.S. hydrogen bomb tests in the Pacific that led to a series of radiation exposures by Japanese boats and added to demands for government support for health problems. As of March, 106,823 survivors — 6,824 fewer than a year ago, and now with an average age of 85.6 — are certified as eligible for government medical support, according to the Health and Welfare Ministry. Many others, including those who say they were victims of the radioactive 'black rain' that fell outside the initially designated areas of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, are still without support. —- This version corrects the name of the Hiroshima branch executive to Toshiyuki Mimaki, not Tomoyuki Mimaki. ___ Associated Press video journalist Ayaka McGill contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-nobel-peace-hibakusha-atomic-bomb-808038ef664be2f200306d5e60b76711	2024-10-11T06:15:16-07:00	
Trump heads to Colorado to drive his anti-immigration message	AURORA, Colo. (AP) — Donald Trump is detouring from the battleground states Friday to visit a Colorado suburb that's been in the news over illegal immigration as he drives a message that migrants are causing chaos in smaller American cities and towns, often using false or misleading claims to do so. Trump’s rally in Aurora will mark the first time ahead of the November election that either presidential campaign has visited Colorado, which reliably votes Democratic statewide. The Republican nominee has long promised to stage the largest deportation operation in U.S. history and has made immigration core to his political persona since the day he launched his first campaign in 2015. Over the last few months, Trump has pinpointed specific smaller communities that have seen large arrivals of migrants, with tensions flaring locally over resources and some longtime residents expressing distrust about sudden demographic changes. Aurora entered the spotlight in August when a video circulated showing armed men walking through an apartment building housing Venezuelan migrants. Trump has claimed extensively that Venezuelan gangs are taking over buildings, even though authorities say that was a single block of the suburb near Denver, and the area is again safe. At the venue where he was appearing on Friday, chants of 'Trump!' and guttural cries of excitement began before the sun rose and continued throughout the morning. Attendees trickled into the vast conference hall, curated specially for Trump’s visit to Aurora: On stage, posters displayed mug shots of people in prison-orange with descriptions including 'Illegal immigrant gang members from Venezuela.' Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, also have spread falsehoods about a community in Springfield, Ohio, where Haitian immigrants were accused of stealing and eating pets. 'It’s like an invasion from within, and we’re going to have the largest deportation in the history of our country, and we’re going to start with Springfield and Aurora,' Trump said last month in a news conference in California. While Ohio and Colorado are not competitive in the presidential race, the Republican message on immigration is intended for states that are. Vance campaigned recently in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, a city of 70,000 that has resettled refugees from Africa and Asia, and touted Trump's plan to ramp up deportations. He argues smaller communities have been 'overrun' by immigrants taxing local resources. Some of Colorado's Democratic leaders accused Trump and other Republicans of overstating problems in Aurora. 'What is occurring is minimal and isolated. And to be clear, it’s never acceptable, right? We never say any level is acceptable,' said Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo. 'But it’s not a surge. It’s not a change. There is no takeover of any part of this city, of any apartment complex. It has not happened. It is a lie.' Trump has vowed to deport not only 'criminals,' a promise he shares with Vice President Kamala Harris, his Democratic rival, but also Haitians living legally in Springfield and even people he has denigrated as 'pro-Hamas radicals' protesting on college campuses. Trump has said he would revoke the temporary protected status that allows Haitians to stay in the U.S. because of widespread poverty and violence in their home nation. Trump repeatedly faults Harris and President Joe Biden for allowing record high numbers of arrivals, saying that is fueling violent crime, though numbers show a continued downward trend after a coronavirus pandemic-era crime spike. On the campaign trail, Trump uses specific cases of murders or attacks where suspects are immigrants who arrived in the country illegally. He has referred to them as 'animals,' and earlier this week suggested that those suspected in homicide cases 'have bad genes.' Chris Haynes, an associate professor of political science at University of New Haven, who wrote a book about public opinion on immigration policies and has studied the former president’s messaging on immigration, says that is part of what he calls 'episodic branding.' It may prompt some moderate voters to reassess who they want to support, he said. 'What’s worked for him from the very beginning is to vilify immigrants, but also to try to make people feel like they’re a threat,' said Haynes, saying some of the rhetoric also appeals to low propensity voters that are part of his base. Harris, for her part, was wrapping up a three-day western swing with a campaign event Friday in Scottsdale, Arizona. She also was participating virtually in a White House briefing with President Biden on the recovery effort from hurricanes Milton and Helene. Just as Biden did before he abandoned his reelection bid, Democrat Harris has tacked to the right on immigration, presenting herself as a candidate who can be tough on policing the border, which is perceived as one of her biggest vulnerabilities. 'What Kamala has done with illegal migrants is the biggest crime story of our time because hundreds of thousands of people are going to be victims very shortly,' Trump said in a recent speech in Erie, Pennsylvania, before saying he would send federal law enforcement 'to liberate every Pennsylvania town and every town in the United States of America that has been taken over by migrant gangs.' Jeffrey Balogh, a resident of Erie, said at that event that he feels strongly about Trump’s proposals on immigration. He shared that he felt uncomfortable recently when he went to rent chairs from a business and five men who spoke a foreign language were standing outside waiting for a bus. 'Not one spoke a lick of English,' he said. 'You see a whole different environment.' ___ Gomez reported from Fort Lauderdale, Florida.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-migrants-deportation-colorado-fe8805ec9024cb683a6386bce9f64c70	2024-10-11T05:48:51-07:00	
The Latest: Hurricanes have jumbled campaign schedules for Harris and Trump	Back-to-back hurricanes have jumbled the presidential campaign schedules of Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump. Trump and Harris have separately gone to Georgia to assess hurricane damage and pledge support. Harris also has visited North Carolina, requiring the candidates to cancel campaign events elsewhere and use up time which is a precious resource in the final weeks before any election. Both Georgia and North Carolina are political battlegrounds. Meanwhile, a recent poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that a solid majority of Hispanic women have a positive opinion of Harris and a negative view of Trump. Hispanic men are more divided on both candidates. Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: Harris-Walz campaign makes pitch to gun owners Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are taking another shot at making their case to gun owners. Their campaign announced Friday they are launching their newest coalition: Hunters and Anglers for Harris-Walz. Harris has advocated for stricter gun safety laws, while also underscoring that she and Walz are gun owners. She told Oprah Winfrey at a campaign event last month that she had a gun and that 'if somebody breaks into my house, they’re getting shot.' The vice president revealed earlier this week in a CBS '60 Minutes' interview that her weapon is a Glock pistol and confirmed that she has fired it at a shooting range. The hunters and anglers group is set to hold a call next week aimed at mobilizing like-minded peers to get behind Harris and Walz. The campaign announced the new group as Walz on Saturday will join fellow hunters in Minnesota to mark the start of pheasant season Trump brings anti-immigration message to Colorado Donald Trump is in a Colorado suburb, aiming to tie the arrivals of migrants to a perception of chaos in smaller communities. He is doubling down on his pledge to carry out the largest deportation operation in U.S. history. Trump’s rally on Friday in Aurora, Colorado, marks the first time either presidential campaign has visited this state that votes reliably Democratic in statewide races. Trump has been consistently loud in his statements on immigration. Over the last few months, he has pinpointed specific smaller communities that have seen large arrivals of migrants, where tensions are flaring over resources. Harris says she would create a bipartisan council of advisers Vice President Kamala Harris said she will create a bipartisan council of advisers to provide her feedback on her policy initiatives if she makes it to the White House. Harris announced the initiative while attending an event in Phoenix with Republicans supporting her campaign. She said it’s critical that there is structure in her administration so she could hear from a spectrum of voices. 'I love good ideas wherever they come from,' said Harris, who is making a push to get Republicans with doubts about Trump to support her. Harris says she would be a greater champion for Israel's security than Trump Vice President Kamala Harris laced into former President Donald Trump on Friday for letting Iran 'off the hook' while he was in office and argued that she would be a greater champion for Israel’s security than the Republican nominee. 'Make no mistake, as president, I will never hesitate to take whatever action is necessary to defend American forces and interests from Iran and Iran-backed terrorists,' Harris said in a call with Jewish supporters ahead of Yom Kippur. 'And I will never allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon. Diplomacy is my preferred path to that end. But all options are on the table.' Harris charged that Trump 'did nothing' after Iranian-backed militias attacked U.S. bases and American troops. But during his time in office, Trump had ordered strikes against Iranian-backed militias as well as a January 2020 operation that killed Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran’s elite Quds Force, and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the deputy commander of the Iran-backed group in Iraq known as the Popular Mobilization Forces, or PMF. Trump said he ordered the killing of Soleimani because Soleimani was developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members. Biden derides Trump for disinformation about hurricane response President Joe Biden said ahead of a Friday briefing about hurricane damage that estimates are the Hurricane Milton alone caused $50 billion of damage, while adding that his predecessor, Donald Trump, is 'just the biggest mouth' for disinformation about the government’s response. The president added that the disinformation is a 'permanent state of being for some extreme people,' but that he believes the country as a whole wants facts and bipartisan cooperation to address natural disasters. 'I think those who have been spreading these lies to try to undermine the opposition are going, gonna pay a price for it,' Biden added. Trump will try to expand his appeal with women in Fox News town hall Donald Trump has been running a decidedly 'bro-y' campaign. But he will try to expand his appeal with women as he participates in a Fox News town hall focusing on issues impacting women Fox News Channel announced that host Harris Faulkner will moderate the discussion in front of an audience of women. 'Women constitute the largest group of registered and active voters in the United States, so it is paramount that female voters understand where the presidential candidates stand on the issues that matter to them most,' Faulkner said said in a statement. Trump’s campaign has aggressively courted men — especially younger men of color — with appearances on podcasts and sporting events popular with the demographic. Polls have repeatedly shown he is seen more favorably by men than by women. The Trump sit-down will be taped Tuesday and air the next day, Oct. 16th. Fox says it has extended a standing invitation to Vice President Kamala Harris to participate in a town hall as well. 3 Wisconsin conservatives declare support for Harris A trio of Wisconsin conservatives declared Friday that they support Democrat Kamala Harris rather than Donald Trump in the Nov. 5 election. Charlie Sykes, a former conservative radio talk show host from Milwaukee; former Republican state Senate Majority Leader Dale Schultz; and former Republican state representative and appellate judge David Deininger told reporters that Trump lacks the character and moral fiber to serve as president. Sykes said the election is a referendum on constitutional values that the country had always taken for granted before Trump’s political ascendance. 'Republicans have decided winning or staying in power is more important than standing up for these values, which used to be fundamental,' Sykes said. 'I’m going to be voting for Kamala Harris for president and it’s not a difficult choice for me. It’s absolutely essential to keep Donald Trump out of the White House.' Schultz said the country needs real leadership. 'I continue to consider myself a good Republican but it’s time to put the good of the country ahead of the party,' Schultz said. Deininger said Trump has lied to Americans 'about just about everything.' 'A second Trump term would be far worse and far more dangerous,' Deininger said. 'If he regains power, he won’t have guardrails to restrain him.' Emhoff says Trump is afraid to debate Harris again Doug Emhoff, Kamala Harris’ husband, says Donald Trump won’t debate his wife again because he was badly beaten in their first encounter. 'He’s afraid that that’s going to happen again,' Emhoff says in an interview for the MSNBC show 'Morning Joe.' The husband of the Democratic nominee says Trump would rather spread 'this fog of misinformation and disinformation and gaslighting' than face Harris directly. Emhoff says he doesn’t have the time to be angry at Trump’s criticisms of him and his wife, because that would be a 'distraction' and the focus of the Democratic ticket is on campaigning to win the Nov. 5 election. Walz says Trump is wrong about Detroit Democratic vice presidential nominee Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is firing back at Donald Trump in Michigan for insulting Detroit while campaigning in the city. Trump said Thursday that if Vice President Kamala Harris wins the White House, 'The whole country will be like — you want to know the truth? It’ll be like Detroit.' Walz was to use a campaign event in nearby Warren, Michigan, to attack Trump’s record in the battleground state, according to prepared remarks shared by the campaign. 'Maybe if he ever spent any time in the Midwest, he’d know Detroit is experiencing a great American comeback. Crime is down. The city is growing. Factories are opening again,' he was to say. 'But all these guys know about manufacturing is how to manufacture bulls—-.' Walz plans to quote Trump campaigning in the state in 2016 promising that they 'won’t lose one' automotive plant if he’s elected. 'I guess, technically, that wasn’t a lie — because he lost 6 of them across the country,' Walz was to say. Walz also plans to reassure the auto-heavy state that Harris was not trying to ban gas-powered vehicles. Harris to participate in a town hall hosted by Charlamagne tha God Vice President Kamala Harris will participate in a town hall hosted by Charlamagne tha God on Tuesday, the influential radio host announced on his show Friday. The appearance comes as Harris’ campaign is looking to shore up support among Black men for her candidacy. The announcement comes a day after former President Barack Obama delivered a forceful call for Black men to support Harris during a campaign swing in Pennsylvania. Walz discusses Biden's term on 'Good Morning America' Democratic vice presidential nominee Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz says, 'I don’t know if any of us do everything right,' as he tried to draw some distance between the Democratic ticket and President Joe Biden. Speaking to ABC’s 'Good Morning America,' Walz was asked whether he and Vice President Kamala Harris would have done anything different over the last four years. 'Look, I don’t know if any of us do everything right,' he replied. 'But I can tell you he’s done everything in the best interests of the American public.' Harris drew fire from former President Donald Trump when she told 'The View' earlier this week that she couldn’t think of a difference with Biden — before saying she would put a Republican in her Cabinet if elected. Walz also used the interview to try to walk back his call at a fundraiser this week to eliminate the electoral college. Harris’ campaign quickly stated it doesn't support such a move and Walz told ABC, 'My position is the campaign’s position.'	https://apnews.com/article/harris-trump-election-2024-walz-vance-59658719a804c0dafd1afb08c324370a	2024-10-11T05:34:23-07:00	
North Korea accuses South Korea of flying drones to its capital and threatens to attack next time	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea has accused rival South Korea of flying drones to its capital to drop anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets and threatened to respond with force if such flights occur again. South Korea issued a vague denial of the allegation. North Korea’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement Friday that South Korean drones were detected in the night skies of Pyongyang on Oct. 3 and Wednesday and Thursday this week. The ministry accused the South of violating North Korea’s 'sacred' sovereignty and threatening its security, and described the alleged flights as a 'dangerous provocation' that could escalate to an armed conflict and even war. It said North Korean forces will prepare 'all means of attack' capable of destroying the southern side of the border and the South Korean military, and respond without warning if South Korean drones are detected in its territory again. 'The safety lock on our trigger has now been released,' the ministry said. 'We will be prepared for everything and will be watching. The criminals should no longer gamble with the lives of their citizens.' Asked about the North Korean claims during a parliamentary hearing, South Korean Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun told lawmakers, 'We have not done that.' He said he was still trying to assess the situation and didn’t elaborate further. It wasn’t immediately clear whether Kim was referring to South Korean military drones, or also drones possibly operated by South Korean civilians. The South’s Joint Chiefs of Staff later said in a statement that it couldn’t confirm whether the North’s claims were true, without elaborating why. The joint chiefs warned the North to 'exercise restraint and not act recklessly.' 'If the safety of our citizens is threatened in any way, our military will respond with stern and thorough retaliation,' it said. North Korea is extremely sensitive to any outside criticism of the authoritarian government of leader Kim Jong Un and his family’s dynastic rule over the country. Since May, North Korea has sent thousands of balloons carrying paper waste, plastic and other trash to drop on the South, in what it described as retaliation against South Korean civilian activists who flew balloons with anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets across the border. South Korea’s joint chiefs said in a separate statement that the North was again flying balloons toward the South Friday evening and warned civilians to beware of objects falling from the sky. South Korea’s military responded to the North’s balloon campaign by using border loudspeakers to broadcast propaganda and K-pop to North Korea. The psychological warfare campaigns have further escalated tensions created by Kim’s weapons tests and verbal threats of nuclear conflict against Washington and Seoul. The allies have responded by strengthening their combined military exercises and expanding three-way cooperation with Japan, while also upgrading nuclear deterrence plans built around U.S. strategic assets. On Wednesday, North Korea said it will permanently block its border with South Korea and build front-line defense structures to cope with 'confrontational hysteria' by South Korean and U.S. forces. North Korea’s military said in a statement on state media that it will 'completely cut off roads and railways' linked to South Korea and 'fortify the relevant areas of our side with strong defense structures.' North Korea called its steps a 'self-defensive measure for inhibiting war and defending the security' of the country and accused its rivals of 'getting ever more reckless in their confrontational hysteria.' North Korea cited what it called various military exercises in South Korea, the deployment of U.S. strategic assets and its rivals’ harsh rhetoric. Experts say Kim’s nuclear push is aimed at eventually forcing the United States to accept North Korea as a nuclear power and allowing the North to negotiate security and economic concessions from a position of strength. In written answers to questions by The Associated Press this month, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said North Korea will likely stage major provocations such as a nuclear test explosion or an intercontinental ballistic missile test around the U.S. presidential election in November to grab Washington’s attention. Yoon also condemned North Korea over its balloon campaign and warned that it 'will face consequences that it will find difficult to withstand' if its balloon activities jeopardize the safety of South Korean people. He didn’t elaborate on what steps his government was considering. ___ Associated Press writer Hyung-jin Kim contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-south-drones-attack-threat-border-d1b2e42665fba63dbf4cf2f36a96f5f5	2024-10-11T02:54:32-07:00	
Zelenskyy appeals to allies to keep up aid as Germany pledges new weapons package	BERLIN (AP) — President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Friday it's important that allies' aid to Ukraine doesn't decrease next year as he received a pledge of a new weapons package from German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on a European tour meant to win backing for his 'victory plan' aimed at ending the war with Russia. Zelenskyy arrived in Berlin after stops Thursday in London, Paris and Rome on a tour arranged after a planned summit Saturday with U.S. President Joe Biden and other allied leaders was derailed by Hurricane Milton. Scholz noted that Germany is Ukraine’s biggest military supporter in Europe and the second-biggest behind the United States, and said 'it will stay that way.' Scholz emphasized Berlin’s continued focus on helping Kyiv with air defense. And he said that, by the end of the year, it will deliver another package of military support worth about 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion), with support from Belgium, Denmark and Norway — including further air defense systems, self-propelled Gepard anti-aircraft guns, tanks, armored vehicles, combat drones, artillery ammunition and radars. 'For us, it is very important that aid does not decrease next year,' Zelenskyy said, thanking Scholz for the planned aid. 'It must be sufficient to protect people and lives.' This year’s German budget foresees nearly 7.5 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine, while next year’s plan is for 4 billion euros. Berlin hopes a $50 billlion international loan packag e funded by interest on profits from frozen Russian assets will play a growing role in financing aid starting next year, with Kyiv procuring weapons directly. The aim is for that system to be set up by the end of the year. Scholz told Zelenskyy that 'you can rely' on that package. He said Russian President Vladimir Putin should realize that 'playing for time won't work; we won't let up in our support for Ukraine.' The Ukrainian leader has yet to publicly detail his proposals for 'victory.' But the timing of his efforts to lock in European support appear to have the looming U.S. election in mind. Former President Donald Trump has long been critical of U.S. aid to Kyiv. Ukraine’s stretched and short-handed army is currently under heavy pressure in the country’s eastern Donetsk region. Russian forces recently pushed it out of the Donetsk town of Vuhledar and are now in control of about half of nearby Toretsk. To stop the losses, Zelenskyy needs to secure more help. In Berlin, he said that Ukraine 'would want to end the war no later than in 2025.' 'This plan is a bridge to hold a productive peace summit that will truly put an end to the war,' he said, adding that Ukraine can only strengthen its position against Russia through cooperation with Western partners. Earlier Friday, Zelenskyy had a 35-minute meeting with Pope Francis at the Vatican. He also met the Vatican's secretary of state, Pietro Parolin. 'The discussions were dedicated to the state of the war and the humanitarian situation in Ukraine, as well as the ways in which it could be brought to an end, leading to just and stable peace in the country,' the Vatican said, adding that 'some matters relating to the religious life of the country were also examined.' Since the first Russian attack on Kyiv, there have been multiple contacts between Francis and Zelenskyy, through visits, letters and phone calls. The pope sparked some criticism from Ukrainian leaders in March when he suggested they should have the courage of the 'white flag' negotiating an end to the war with Russia, in what was interpreted by many as a call to surrender. Francis has called repeatedly for an end to the war, focusing on prisoner exchanges and on reaching a diplomatic solution to the Ukrainian conflict. ___ Arhirova reported from Kyiv, Ukraine.

Israel's deadliest strike in central Beirut leaves Lebanese stunned as they dig through the rubble	BEIRUT (AP) — Rescue workers searched through the rubble of a collapsed building in central Beirut on Friday morning, hours after two Israeli strikes hit the Lebanese capital, killing at least 22 people and wounding dozens. The air raid was the deadliest attack on central Beirut in over a year of war, hitting two residential buildings in neighborhoods that have swelled with displaced people fleeing Israeli bombardment elsewhere in the country. Hezbollah’s Al-Manar television and Israeli media said the strikes aimed to kill Wafiq Safa, a top security official with the group. Al-Manar said Safa was not in either building at the time. The Israeli military had no comment on the reports. Thursday night's strikes came as Israel escalates its campaign against Hezbollah with waves of heavy airstrikes across Lebanon and a ground invasion at the border, after a year of exchanges of fire between the two rivals. The same day as the Beirut explosions, Israeli forces fired on United Nations peacekeepers in southern Lebanon and wounded two peacekeepers from Indonesia, drawing widespread condemnation. Hezbollah has expanded its rocket fire to more populated areas deeper inside Israel. While disrupting life for Israelis, most of Hezbollah’s barrages have not caused casualties. But early Friday, an anti-tank missile fired from Lebanon killed a man from Thailand working on a farm in northern Israel. In Beirut’s Burj Abi Haidar neighborhood, civil defense members and municipal workers dug through the pile of concrete and twisted metal from a three-story building knocked down by Thursday night’s strike. In an adjacent building that was badly damaged, Ahmad al-Khatib stood in the apartment of his in-laws where he, his wife, Marwa Hamdan, and their 2 ½-year-old daughter, Ayla, suffered injuries. He had just picked up his wife from work and she was performing the evening Muslim prayers at home when the blast hit. 'The world suddenly turned upside down and darkness prevailed,' said the 42-year-old, tears running down his cheeks. He pulled his daughter out from under the debris of a wall that collapsed in a bedroom. Al-Khatib, who works for the postal service. said he found the force of the explosion had thrown his wife against a wall and a piece of metal had hit her in the head. 'I looked in her face and shouted, ‘Say something!’' he said, but she only responded with sounds of pain. His wife remains in the ICU at a Beirut hospital. His daughter suffered only minor injuries. Mohammed Tarhani said he had moved in with his brother nearby in the neighborhood after fleeing around southern Lebanon to escape airstrikes the past weeks. His children were out on the veranda, and he was in the living room when the strike hit. 'We rushed out to look for the children,' he said. 'Where is one supposed to go now?' Civil defense official Walid Hashash said they don’t expect more bodies under the rubble as no people are missing. He added that once operations are over they will issue a final death toll. Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, in support of Hamas and the Palestinians, drawing Israeli airstrikes in retaliation. Israel says its stepped-up campaign since late September aims to push Hezbollah away from the border to allow tens of thousands of its citizens evacuated from the area to return home. More than 2,100 Lebanese –- including Hezbollah fighters, civilians and medical personnel — have been killed the past year by Israeli strikes, more than two thirds of them in the past few weeks. Hezbollah attacks have killed 29 civilians as well as 39 Israeli soldiers in northern Israel since October 2023 and in southern Lebanon since Israel launched its ground invasion on Sept. 30. So far, Israeli troops have been operating in a narrow strip of a few kilometers (miles) along the border. The war threatens to spiral even further, with Israel aiming to strike a crippling blow to its longtime adversary Hezbollah. Netanyahu this week warned Lebanese they would suffer the same destruction that Israel’s campaign against Hamas has inflicted in Gaza unless they take action against Hezbollah. Israel has also vowed to strike back against the Lebanese group’s supporter, Iran, after it launched some 180 ballistic missiles at Israel last week. Iran’s barrage was in retaliation for previous Israeli strikes that killed Hamas’ leader in Tehran and senior Iranian Revolutionary Guard figures in Lebanon. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday reiterated U.S. support for Israel’s escalated campaign against Hezbollah. He said Israel had a 'clear and very legitimate' interest to try to ensure the return of tens of thousands of its citizens who were evacuated from their homes near the border because of Hezbollah fire since last October. He told a news conference after attending an annual meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Laos that the U.S. is 'extremely focused' on reaching a diplomatic solution to the war. Meanwhile the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, was rearranging some of its personnel after its positions were repeated hit by Israeli forces Thursday. UNIFIL said an Israeli tank directly fired on an observation tower at the force’s headquarters in the town of Naqoura, Lebanon, and that soldiers attacked a bunker near where peacekeepers were sheltering, damaging vehicles and a communication system. It said an Israeli drone was seen flying to the bunker’s entrance. The Israeli military acknowledged opening fire at a U.N. base in southern Lebanon on Thursday and said it had ordered the peacekeepers to 'remain in protected spaces.' Afterward, the U.N. peacekeeping chief said 300 peacekeepers in frontline positions on southern Lebanon’s border have been temporarily moved to larger bases. Plans to move another 200 will depend on security conditions as the conflict escalates. Jean-Pierre Lacroix told an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council that peacekeepers with UNIFIL are staying in their positions, but because of air and ground attacks they cannot conduct patrols. UNIFIL, which has more than 10,000 peacekeepers from dozens of countries, was created to oversee the withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon after Israel’s 1978 invasion. The United Nations expanded its mission following the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, allowing peacekeepers to patrol a buffer zone set up along the border. Israel accuses Hezbollah of establishing militant infrastructure along the border in violation of the U.N. Security Council resolution that ended the 2006 war. ___ Find more of AP’s coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war.	https://apnews.com/article/srael-palestinians-hamas-war-lebanon-hezbollah-11-10-2024-9dd58a9fea9c2de963edbc31ba90bb1a	2024-10-11T01:39:43-07:00	
AI is having its Nobel moment. Do scientists need the tech industry to sustain it?	Hours after the artificial intelligence pioneer Geoffrey Hinton won a Nobel Prize in physics, he drove a rented car to Google's California headquarters to celebrate. Hinton doesn't work at Google anymore. Nor did the longtime professor at the University of Toronto do his pioneering research at the tech giant. But his impromptu party reflected AI's moment as a commercial blockbuster that has also reached the pinnacles of scientific recognition. That was Tuesday. Then, early Wednesday, two employees of Google's AI division won a Nobel Prize in chemistry for using AI to predict and design novel proteins. 'This is really a testament to the power of computer science and artificial intelligence,' said Jeanette Wing, a professor of computer science at Columbia University. Asked about the historic back-to-back science awards for AI work in an email Wednesday, Hinton said only: 'Neural networks are the future.' It didn't always seem that way for researchers who decades ago experimented with interconnected computer nodes inspired by neurons in the human brain. Hinton shares this year's physics Nobel with another scientist, John Hopfield, for helping develop those building blocks of machine learning. Neural network advances came from 'basic, curiosity-driven research,' Hinton said at a press conference after his win. 'Not out of throwing money at applied problems, but actually letting scientists follow their curiosity to try and understand things.' Such work started well before Google existed. But a bountiful tech industry has now made it easier for AI scientists to pursue their ideas even as it has challenged them with new ethical questions about the societal impacts of their work. One reason why the current wave of AI research is so closely tied to the tech industry is that only a handful of corporations have the resources to build the most powerful AI systems. 'These discoveries and this capability could not happen without humongous computational power and humongous amounts of digital data,' Wing said. 'There are very few companies — tech companies — that have that kind of computational power. Google is one. Microsoft is another.' The chemistry Nobel Prize awarded Wednesday went to Demis Hassabis and John Jumper of Google’s London-based DeepMind laboratory along with researcher David Baker at the University of Washington for work that could help discover new medicines. Hassabis, the CEO and co-founder of DeepMind, which Google acquired in 2014, told the AP in an interview Wednesday his dream was to model his research laboratory on the 'incredible storied history' of Bell Labs. Started in 1925, the New Jersey-based industrial lab was the workplace of multiple Nobel-winning scientists over several decades who helped develop modern computing and telecommunications. 'I wanted to recreate a modern day industrial research lab that really did cutting-edge research,' Hassabis said. 'But of course, that needs a lot of patience and a lot of support. We’ve had that from Google and it’s been amazing.' Hinton joined Google late in his career and quit last year so he could talk more freely about his concerns about AI’s dangers, particularly what happens if humans lose control of machines that become smarter than us. But he stops short of criticizing his former employer. Hinton, 76, said he was staying in a cheap hotel in Palo Alto, California when the Nobel committee woke him up with a phone call early Tuesday morning, leading him to cancel a medical appointment scheduled for later that day. By the time the sleep-deprived scientist reached the Google campus in nearby Mountain View, he 'seemed pretty lively and not very tired at all' as colleagues popped bottles of champagne, said computer scientist Richard Zemel, a former doctoral student of Hinton’s who joined him at the Google party Tuesday. 'Obviously there are these big companies now that are trying to cash in on all the commercial success and that is exciting,' said Zemel, now a Columbia professor. But Zemel said what’s more important to Hinton and his closest colleagues has been what the Nobel recognition means to the fundamental research they spent decades trying to advance. Guests included Google executives and another former Hinton student, Ilya Sutskever, a co-founder and former chief scientist and board member at ChatGPT maker OpenAI. Sutskever helped lead a group of board members who briefly ousted OpenAI CEO Sam Altman last year in turmoil that has symbolized the industry's conflicts. An hour before the party, Hinton used his Nobel bully pulpit to throw shade at OpenAI during opening remarks at a virtual press conference organized by the University of Toronto in which he thanked former mentors and students. 'I’m particularly proud of the fact that one of my students fired Sam Altman,' Hinton said. Asked to elaborate, Hinton said OpenAI started with a primary objective to develop better-than-human artificial general intelligence 'and ensure that it was safe.' 'And over time, it turned out that Sam Altman was much less concerned with safety than with profits. And I think that’s unfortunate,' Hinton said. In response, OpenAI said in a statement that it is 'proud of delivering the most capable and safest AI systems' and that they 'safely serve hundreds of millions of people each week.' Conflicts are likely to persist in a field where building even a relatively modest AI system requires resources 'well beyond those of your typical research university,' said Michael Kearns, a professor of computer science at the University of Pennsylvania. But Kearns, who sits on the committee that picks the winners of computer science's top prize — the Turing Award — said this week marks a 'great victory for interdisciplinary research' that was decades in the making. Hinton is only the second person to win both a Nobel and Turing. The first, Turing-winning political scientist Herbert Simon, started working on what he called 'computer simulation of human cognition' in the 1950s and won the Nobel economics prize in 1978 for his study of organizational decision-making. Wing, who met Simon in her early career, said scientists are still just at the tip of finding ways to apply computing's most powerful capabilities to other fields. 'We’re just at the beginning in terms of scientific discovery using AI,' she said. —— AP Business Writer Kelvin Chan contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/ai-nobel-prizes-physics-chemistry-google-deepmind-hinton-cb963de3b4235f28f8c95ca9080830f6	2024-10-11T01:00:21-07:00	
George Baldock's family confirm soccer player drowned while swimming	George Baldock, the Greece international soccer player who was found dead at his home in Athens on Wednesday, drowned while swimming in his pool, his family said. Greek police said this week there was no initial indication the death of the 31-year-old former Premier League player was suspicious. 'We are heartbroken with the sudden passing of our beloved George. We can confirm that a post-mortem examination has found that George tragically drowned whilst swimming in the pool at his home in Glyfada, Athens,' Baldock's family said in a statement issued to The Associated Press. The family said the Panathinaikos defender, who was born in Britain, had been due to return to the U.K. on Thursday to celebrate his baby son's first birthday. 'George, you were the most special father, fiance, son, brother, uncle, friend, teammate and person. Your enthusiasm and infectious personality brought so much love to those that were fortunate enough to know you and those that adored you from the stands,' the family said. 'We will forever cherish the special memories we have of you and you will continue to live on in your beautiful son.' Baldock was of Greek heritage and played 12 matches for the national team. He joined Sheffield United in 2017 and helped the club earn promotion to the Premier League twice, in 2019 and 2023. He joined Panathinaikos in May, on a three-year contract, after Sheffield United was relegated to England’s second division. 'As a family it has been incredibly touching, but equally so very difficult to read the huge number of tributes written by those that knew George and from those whose life he touched. It was impossible not to love him,' his family said. 'We ask that you please continue to respect our privacy at this devastating time as we begin to process our grief.' There was a period of silence in tribute to the right back ahead of Thursday's game in the Nations League between England and Greece at Wembley Stadium. Greece won 2-1. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer	https://apnews.com/article/greece-george-baldock-dead-swimming-family-cebabaeddb20e81f8a953ae150d90ad8	2024-10-11T00:51:54-07:00	
Russia launches 4th aerial attack in a week against Ukraine's grain-exporting Odesa region	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A nighttime Russian missile strike on Odesa killed at least four people including a 16-year-old girl, regional authorities said Friday, in the latest in a series of attacks this week on the southern Ukrainian region that are likely intended to disrupt the country’s grain exports. Four Russian missile and drone attacks on the Odesa region this week have killed 14 people and wounded around 20, according to local officials. The strikes have hit merchant ships and damaged port infrastructure in the region, which is a vital hub for Ukraine’s agricultural exports through the Black Sea. An attack on Odesa late Wednesday killed nine people and hit a container ship sailing under the Panamanian flag — the third attack on a merchant vessel in four days, according to regional Gov. Oleh Kiper. The apparent Russian effort to frustrate Ukraine’s exports, which bring vital revenue for a national economy battered by more than two years of war, coincided with a renewed push by Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to ensure continuing military and financial support from his country’s Western partners. Ukraine’s stretched and short-handed army is currently under heavy pressure in the country’s eastern Donetsk region. Russian forces recently pushed it out of the Donetsk town of Vuhledar and are now in control of about half of nearby Toretsk, local administration chief Vasyl Chynchyk said Friday. To stop the losses, Zelenskyy needs to secure more help. Russia last year tore up an agreement that allowed Ukraine — one of the world’s biggest suppliers of grain and other food staples, especially to developing nations — to export produce safely through the Black Sea. Months later, and amid successful Ukrainian attacks on Russia’s Black Sea fleet which forced its navy to back away from the coast, Ukraine established a shipping corridor that hugs the coast down to Turkey and opens a way to the Mediterranean Sea. A special insurance program has provided affordable coverage to shippers who have carried millions of tons of cargo out of Ukraine, but the latest attacks could jeopardize that arrangement. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-odesa-attacks-grain-e9e8ce95daf89a07c9d1c1ee68a7416e	2024-10-11T00:27:48-07:00	
Nobuyo Oyama, voice actor for beloved Japanese cartoon robotic cat Doraemon, dies at age 90	TOKYO (AP) — Nobuyo Oyama, best known as the raspy voice of Doraemon, the beloved cartoon robotic cat from the future, has died. She was 90. Oyama, who voiced Doraemon for more than a quarter century, died of natural causes on Sept. 29, her agency, Actors Seven, said Friday. Oyama performed the voice of the blue-and-white robotic cat from 1979 to 2005. Created by the cartoonist Fujiko F. Fujio in 1970, Doraemon and the story of his friendship with Nobita, a good-hearted but somewhat lazy boy, became hugely popular. The manga and anime series have been read and watched by millions of fans in Japan and across the world and have been translated into dozens of languages. In the series, Doraemon arrives from the 22nd century and helps Nobita in difficult situations, often with gadgets from the future such as an 'anywhere door' and 'take-copter.' Born in Tokyo in 1933, Oyama was an aspiring actor and debuted in a 1956 drama on Japan’s NHK public television. She had her first voice acting role in 1957 in the dubbed version of the TV drama series 'Lassie.' Oyama’s raspy voice quickly gained her popularity in anime and children’s programs. She was the voice of one of three piglets in a popular children’s puppet show in the early 1960s and of teenage boy Katsuo in the family anime series 'Sazaesan' prior to 'Doraemon.' Oyama retired as Doraemon in March 2005 as part of a renewal of the voice actors for the main characters. 'I hope Doraemon will still be a beloved character in the distant future,' Oyama said. In 2015, Oyama’s husband disclosed that she had developed dementia. Even so, as head of a sound arts school, Oyama was known to always succeed on the first try when she was asked to perform in her Doraemon voice. Oyama’s agency said her funeral was held privately by her relatives. Noriko Ohara, the voice of Nobita, died in July.	https://apnews.com/article/japan-doraemon-voice-actor-manga-obit-bc30a07500453c78a854339ba1d49667	2024-10-11T00:07:01-07:00	
Nobel Peace Prize awarded to Japanese organization of atomic bombing survivors Nihon Hidankyo	The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded Friday to Nihon Hidankyo, a Japanese organization of survivors of the U.S. atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, for its activism against nuclear weapons. Jørgen Watne Frydnes, chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, said the award was made as the 'taboo against the use of nuclear weapons is under pressure.' In September, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a shift in his country’s nuclear doctrine, in a move aimed at discouraging the West from allowing Ukraine to strike Russia with longer-range weapons. It appeared to significantly lower the threshold for the possible use of Russia’s nuclear arsenal. Watne Frydnes said the Nobel committee 'wishes to honor all survivors who, despite physical suffering and painful memories, have chosen to use their costly experience to cultivate hope and engagement for peace.' Hidankyo's Hiroshima branch chairperson, Tomoyuki Mimaki, who was standing by at the city hall for the announcement, cheered and teared up when he received the news. 'Is it really true? Unbelievable!' Mimaki screamed. Efforts to eradicate nuclear weapons have been honored in the past by the Nobel committee. The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons won the peace prize in 2017, and in 1995 Joseph Rotblat and the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs won for 'their efforts to diminish the part played by nuclear arms in international politics and, in the longer run, to eliminate such arms.' This year's prize was awarded against a backdrop of devastating conflicts raging in the world, notably in the Middle East, Ukraine and Sudan. 'It is very clear that threats of using nuclear weapons are putting pressure on the important international norm, the taboo of using nuclear weapons,' Watne Frydnes said in response to a question on whether the rhetoric from Russia surrounding nuclear weapons in its invasion of Ukraine had influenced this year's decision. 'And therefore it is alarming to see how threats of use is also damaging this norm. To uphold an international strong taboo against the use is crucial for all of humanity,' he added. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on X that 'the spectre of Hiroshima and Nagasaki still looms over humanity. This makes the advocacy of Nihon Hidankyo invaluable. This Nobel Peace Prize sends a powerful message. We have the duty to remember. And an even greater duty to protect the next generations from the horrors of nuclear war.' Alfred Nobel stated in his will that the peace prize should be awarded for 'the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses.' Last year’s prize went to jailed Iranian activist Narges Mohammadi for her advocacy of women’s rights and democracy, and against the death penalty. The Nobel committee said it also was a recognition of 'the hundreds of thousands of people' who demonstrated against 'Iran’s theocratic regime’s policies of discrimination and oppression targeting women.' In a year of conflict, there had been some speculation before the announcement that the Norwegian Nobel Committee that decides on the winner would opt not to award a prize at all this year. The prize has been withheld a total of 19 times since 1901, including during both world wars. The last time it was not awarded was in 1972. In the Middle East, persistently spiraling levels of violence over the past year have killed tens of thousands of people, including thousands of children and women. The war, sparked by a bloody raid into Israel by Hamas-led militants on Oct. 7, 2023 that left about 1,200 people dead, mostly civilians, has spilled out into the wider region. In the past week, Israel sent ground troops into Lebanon to pursue Hezbollah militants firing rockets into Israel, while Iran – which backs both Hamas and Hezbollah – fired a barrage of ballistic missiles into Israel. Israel has yet to respond, but its defense minister vowed this week that its retaliation would be both devastating and surprising. The war in Gaza has killed more than 42,000 people, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which doesn’t differentiate between civilians and combatants in its count but says more than half are women and children. In Lebanon, more than 1,400 people have been killed, with thousands more injured and around 1 million displaced since mid-September, when the Israeli military dramatically expanded its offensive against Hezbollah. The war in Ukraine, sparked by Russia’s invasion, is heading toward its third winter with a massive loss of human life on both sides. The U.N. has confirmed more than 11,000 Ukrainian civilian dead, but that doesn’t take into account as many as 25,000 Ukrainians believed to have died during the Russian capture of the city of Mariupol or unreported deaths in the occupied territories. The Nobel prizes carry a cash award of 11 million Swedish kronor ($1 million). Unlike the other Nobel prizes that are selected and announced in Stockholm, founder Alfred Nobel decreed the peace prize be decided and awarded in Oslo by the five-member Norwegian Nobel Committee. The Nobel season ends Monday with the announcement of the winner of the economics prize, formally known as the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. ___ Corder reported from The Hague, Netherlands, and Becatoros from Athens, Greece.

Middle East latest: UN mission in Lebanon is hit again by explosions	The United Nations peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon said new explosions hit its headquarters Friday, injuring two peacekeepers a day after Israeli forces targeted the same position and struck central Beirut. Earlier Friday, cross-border fire from Lebanon killed a man from Thailand who was working on a farm in north Israel. Lebanon’s crisis response unit announced Friday that 60 people were killed and 168 wounded in the past 24 hours, raising the total toll over the past year of conflict between Israel and Hezbollah to 2,229 killed and 10,380 wounded, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. Israel has been escalating its campaign against Hezbollah with waves of heavy airstrikes across Lebanon and a ground invasion at the border, after a year of exchanges of fire between the two rivals. Israel is now at war with Hamas in Gaza and Hamas' ally Hezbollah in Lebanon. Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not say how many were fighters but say women and children make up more than half of the fatalities. The war has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced about 90% of its population of 2.3 million people, often multiple times. It's been a full year since Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel’s security fence and stormed into army bases and farming communities, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. They are still holding about 100 captives inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. ___ Here is the latest: At least 8 killed in airstrikes on southern Lebanon, health ministry says BEIRUT — At least eight people were killed in intensified airstrikes across villages in southern and eastern Lebanon on Friday evening, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. An Israeli airstrike on Baysarieh, a village in Sidon province, killed three people, including a 2-year-old and a 16-year-old, and injured three others, the health ministry said. In Baalbeck-Hermel province, located in the Bekaa Valley, five more people were killed and five others wounded in additional airstrikes. On Thursday, 22 people were killed and 117 wounded in two Israeli strikes on two locations in central Beirut. The strike caused the collapse of two residential buildings housing families and displaced individuals. Critical aid routes into northern Gaza have been cut off, United Nations officials say UNITED NATIONS — U.N. humanitarian officials say aid entering Gaza is at its lowest level in months and warn that critical aid lifelines into northern Gaza, where Israel has renewed its offensive, have been cut off. U.N. deputy spokesperson Farhan Haq delivered the grim news Friday, saying the main crossings into the north have been closed and no food or other essential supplies have entered since Oct. 1. More than 400,000 people who remain in the north are under increasing pressure to move south, Haq said. On Wednesday, the Israeli military body that oversees aid distribution in Gaza, COGAT, said in a statement that 'Israel has not halted the entry or coordination of humanitarian aid' in the north. Meanwhile, the humanitarian organization MedGlobal, which has worked in Gaza since 2018, said Friday that the Israeli army’s renewed military action has driven the remaining health care facilities in the north 'to the brink of collapse.' Three hospitals with hundreds of patients including children in intensive care — Kamal Adwan, Al-Awda and the Indonesian Hospital — have been ordered to evacuate by Israeli authorities and are on the verge of running out of fuel. Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, director of Kamal Adwan and MedGlobal’s lead physician in Gaza, said Friday that the hospital just received 'numerous injuries and fatalities due to the targeting of Al Naji area.' The hospital’s intensive care unit is overcrowded and the 'catastrophic situation … will worsen in the coming hours if there is no fuel for emergency services,' he said in a statement. On the overall dire situation throughout Gaza, Haq said the U.N. World Food Program reports that it has been unable to deliver food parcels to the more than 1 million Palestinians who receive them so far this month 'due to constrained access of aid supplies.' In the north, WFP said kitchens, distribution points and bakeries have either been forced to shut down or are at risk of shutting down if the conflict continues, Haq said, adding that the bakeries are also running out of wheat flour. Despite the challenges, Haq said, the U.N. agency helping Palestinian refugees known as UNRWA and its partners are distributing bread, meals and flour to designated shelters and beyond. Government watching situation of Italian peacekeeping contingent, premier says Italy’s Premier Giorgia Meloni said Friday that the Italian government is following the situation of the Italian peacekeeping contingent in southern Lebanon 'with great attention,' reiterating her strong condemnation of the Israeli attacks on the U.N. bases in the area. The Italian soldiers engaged in the UNIFIL mission 'are doing a fundamental, valuable work for the stabilisation of the area, ' Meloni said, speaking at the final press conference of the Med9 Summit in Cyprus. She recalled that the UNIFIL mission’s headquarters and two Italian bases have been hit by gunfire attacks launched by Israeli forces. 'I can’t avoid to go back and condemn what happened. It is not acceptable,' Meloni said, confirming that the Italian government has 'strongly protested' to the Israeli authorities over the attacks. Meloni added that she was also working with her international colleagues on a common initiative to be discussed during the G7 Defense summit, which will take place in the coming days, 'to implement our joint efforts to strengthen the Lebanese armed forces.' US and Israel defense leaders spoke to discuss operations in Lebanon, Pentagon says WAHINGTON — U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant on Thursday to discuss Israel’s operations in Lebanon. Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, said Austin reaffirmed ironclad support for Israel’s right to defend itself and reiterated the U.S. commitment to a diplomatic arrangement that safely returns both Lebanese and Israeli civilians to their homes on both sides of the border. He said Austin emphasized the importance of ensuring the safety of UNIFIL forces in the area and urged Israel to 'pivot from military operations to a diplomatic pathway as soon as feasible.' 60 killed, 168 wounded over past 24 hours in Lebanon, health ministry says BEIRUT — Lebanon’s crisis response unit announced Friday that 60 people were killed and 168 wounded in the past 24 hours, raising the total toll over the past year of conflict between Israel and Hezbollah to 2,229 killed and 10,380 wounded, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. The casualty toll was notably higher than previous days, with 22 people killed and 117 wounded in two Israeli strikes on two locations in central Beirut. The strike caused the collapse of two residential buildings housing families and displaced individuals. The crisis response unit report also recorded 57 airstrikes and incidents of shelling in the past day, mostly concentrated in southern Lebanon, the southern suburbs of Beirut and the Bekaa Valley. Some 1,032 centers — including educational complexes, vocational institutes, universities and other institutions — are sheltering 187,000 people, including 39,000 families, displaced by the Israeli offensive in Lebanon, the report said. Among these shelters, 837 have now reached full capacity. Despite a major border crossing between Lebanon and Syria being out of commission after an Israeli strike hit the road last week, crowds have continued to flow across the border seeking relative safety in Syria. Between Sept. 23 and Oct. 9, Lebanese General Security recorded 317,457 Syrian citizens and 115,044 Lebanese citizens crossing into Syria, the report said. Fourth Brazilian repatriation flight leaves Beirut SAO PAULO — Brazil’s fourth repatriation plane left Beirut for Brazil on Friday, carrying 211 passengers including 12 infants, according to a statement from Brazil’s foreign ministry. The flight is set to land in Sao Paulo on Saturday morning local time after a stop to refuel in Lisbon. The Brazilian government has evacuated 885 people and 11 pets from Lebanon in one week, the foreign ministry said. About 21,000 Brazilians live in Lebanon, which is home to the largest community of Brazilians in the Middle East. Two Brazilian adolescents have been killed by Israeli bombardments in Lebanon. The Brazilian Embassy in Beirut remains in contact with Brazilians and their close family members to organize a new repatriation flight depending on the security conditions, according to the foreign ministry. 2 Sri Lankans serving in UN peacekeeping mission in Lebanon wounded COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — The Sri Lankan foreign ministry said two Sri Lankan soldiers who were serving in the United Nations peacekeeping mission in south Lebanon were wounded following the attacks on the U.N. base. 'Sri Lanka strongly condemns the attack at UNIFIL’s headquarters in Naqoura, South Lebanon injuring two Sri Lankan UN peacekeepers. Sri Lanka upholds the obligations to ensure the safety and security of UN personnel and inviolability of UN premises at all times,' the foreign ministry said Friday. The U.N. force, known as UNIFIL, said new explosions hit its headquarters on Friday morning and injured two peacekeepers a day after Israeli forces struck the same position. The force has more than 10,000 peacekeepers from dozens of countries. 2 Lebanese soldiers killed as airstrike hits near Lebanese Army checkpoint Two Lebanese soldiers were killed and three others wounded in an Israeli airstrike that hit a building near a Lebanese Army checkpoint in Kafra, Bint Jbeil province, the Lebanese Army said Friday. Since Israel launched its ground invasion of Lebanon, Israeli forces and Hezbollah militants have clashed along the border while the Lebanese army has largely stood on the sidelines. As Israeli troops made their first forays across the border and Hezbollah responded with rocket fire, Lebanese soldiers withdrew from observation posts along the frontier and repositioned about 5 km back. On Oct. 3, a Lebanese soldier was killed and another injured in an Israeli strike in Taybeh during rescue operations. On Sept. 30, another Lebanese soldier was killed by an Israeli drone targeting a Lebanese Army checkpoint in Wazzani. 2 injured after new explosions hit its base in southern Lebanon, UN says The United Nations peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon says new explosions hit its headquarters on Friday morning, injuring two peacekeepers, a day after Israeli forces struck the same position. The force, known as UNIFIL, said the explosions went off close to an observation tower at its headquarters in the southern Lebanese town of Naqoura. One of the injured peacekeepers was taken to a hospital in the nearby city of Tyre, while the other was treated at the site. It did not specify the cause of the blasts. It also said an Israeli army bulldozer hit the perimeter of another of its positions in southern Lebanon while Israeli tanks moved nearby. Additional peacekeepers were sent to reinforce the position, it said. Human Rights Watch says Israeli attacks on United Nations peacekeepers amount to war crimes Human Rights Watch says the Israeli military's deliberate and repeated attacks on the United Nations peacekeeping mission in south Lebanon are unlawful and amount to war crimes. The New York-based rights group issued a statement amid widespread condemnation of the attack by Israeli forces on the headquarters of the U.N. peacekeeping force known as UNIFIL, which wounded two peacekeepers a day earlier. 'Any targeting of UN peacekeepers by Israeli forces violates the laws of war and dangerously interferes with UNIFIL’s civilian protection and aid work,' said Lama Fakih, Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch. 'With over 2,000 people killed and over a million people displaced in Lebanon since mid-September, it is crucial for UNIFIL to be allowed to fulfil its civilian protection and humanitarian functions,' Fakih said. United Nations appeals for pause in fighting to enable polio vaccinations in Gaza GENEVA — The U.N. is getting ready for the start a second round of polio vaccinations for children in Gaza next week, and appealed for the implementation of a 'humanitarian pause' to enable the campaign. A first round of vaccinations was concluded last month after the detection of Gaza’s first polio case in 25 years. The new round is due to start on Monday and aims to give a second dose to some 591,700 children. Dr. Rik Peeperkorn, the World Health Organization’s representative in the Palestinian territories, said Friday that a pause in fighting will once again be a 'prerequisite' for a successful second round. He said that 'we renew our request for all parties of the conflict to implement this necessary humanitarian pause' in Gaza. He added that this is 'particularly critical as new evacuation orders in the north of Gaza are threatening access to hospitals and protection of health facilities and health and community workers.' Blinken says Israel has ‘clear and legitimate’ interests in fighting Hezbollah VIENTIANE, Laos — Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday gave support to Israel’s escalated campaign against Hezbollah, saying it had 'clear and legitimate' reasons, but said the United States is trying to find a diplomatic solution to the war. 'When the horror of Oct. 7 happened, the next day Hezbollah joined in, trying to create another front in the process,' he told a news conference after attending an annual meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Laos. He said Israel has a 'clear and very legitimate interest' in trying to allow the return of its citizens who were evacuated from their homes in northern Israel because of Hezbollah fire. 'The people of Lebanon want the same thing,' he said, referring to Lebanese who fled homes near the border to escape Israeli bombardment. 'We believe that the best way to get there is through a diplomatic understanding, one that we’ve been working on for some time and one that we’re extremely focused on right now,' he said. Blinken said it was also important that civilians are protected amid fighting in Lebanon and Gaza, adding that not enough humanitarian aid is reaching north Gaza and other areas. Thai worker in Israel killed by munition from Lebanon JERUSALEM — Cross-border fire from Lebanon killed a young worker from Thailand in the north of Israel early Friday, Israel’s military said. Israel's military said that the 27-year-old was killed by a rocket that hit farmland. The Thai Embassy in Israel and Israel's paramedic service said he was killed by an anti-tank missile fired from Lebanon. The two accounts could not immediately be reconciled. The man was a farmworker on Kibbutz Yir'on, a communal farm in the north, the embassy said in a Facebook post Friday. The attack also 'severely traumatized' another worker. The embassy was working on getting in touch with the man’s family, a spokesperson for Thailand’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said at a news conference in Bangkok. The Israeli military said two other civilians were injured in the same incident Friday. Hezbollah claimed one missile attack on a military position in the north Friday morning. Hezbollah and other militants in Lebanon have been exchanging fire with Israel for the past year. Israel recently escalated bombardment in Lebanon and invaded a strip inside the Lebanese border, vowing to push out Hezbollah fighters. Friday’s strike was one of the first civilian deaths in Israel since the escalation began in late September. Two Israelis were killed by rocket debris Wednesday. On the Lebanese side, Israeli strikes have killed more than 1,400 people in the past three weeks, including fighters, civilians and medical personnel. Turkey condemns Israeli attack that wounded United Nations peacekeepers ANKARA, Turkey — Turkey condemned Israel’s attack on United Nations peacekeepers in southern Lebanon, characterizing it as 'a manifestation of its perception that its crimes go unpunished.' The U.N. peacekeeping mission in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, said in a statement Thursday that its headquarters and positions 'have been repeatedly hit' by Israeli forces. Two UNIFIL troops were wounded in the attacks. The Israeli military acknowledged opening fire at a U.N. base in southern Lebanon on Thursday and said it had ordered the peacekeepers to 'remain in protected spaces.' 'The international community is obliged to ensure that Israel abides by international law,' Turkey’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement released late Thursday. 'We will continue to support all initiatives within the framework of international law to promote peace in the region. Turkey contributes to UNIFIL Maritime Task Force with a corvette and five personnel, the ministry said.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-hamas-latest-mideast-11-october-2024-114541998d0f165b05884e19fa161d34	2024-10-10T23:13:43-07:00	
AP PHOTOS: Performers bring Hindu gods to life in the Ramleela	NEW DELHI (AP) — 23-year old Ashutosh Agnihotri has been playing god this week. Ahead of the Dussehra festival, which celebrates the defeat of mythological demon Ravana, at the hands of Lord Rama, artists dressed in ornate crowns and costumes perform the Ramleela, a dramatic re-enactment of Lord Rama’s life as told in the religious epic Ramayana. Performing as one of Hindu-majority India’s most beloved gods means living up to the values enshrined in his inspiring life story, says Agnihotri, the actor playing Lord Rama. The former technology professional-turned-actor is trying to keep his anger in check during the 10-day run of the Ramleela in a New Delhi park. 'Well, I get angry. God does not get angry easily,' he says. 'When you have played the character of god, you realize how you should live your life as a human being. God has shown you everything.' Usually performed on a brightly lit open stage, the Ramleela brings alive one of the most enduring tales in Hindu religion, symbolizing the victory of good over evil and blending collective devotion with popular culture. It tells the story of Lord Rama’s exile with his wife Sita and his brother Lakshmana, Sita’s abduction by the demon king of Lanka, Ravana, and the grand battle for her ultimate rescue. The scenes include song and dance, narration and melodramatic dialogue, with a live orchestra using local instruments like drums and the harmonium to keep the audience engaged. What the production lacks in technological sophistication, it makes up with sheer ingenuity. The man in charge of special effects holds a flame behind the actor playing the ten-headed Ravana, whose raucous laughter fills the air as smoke machines throw up plumes of color. Rakesh Ratnakar, 65, a retired drama teacher who has been directing Ramleela performances in New Delhi for years, brought together a motley crew of actors, technicians and make-up artists, many travelling from other cities. Days of rehearsals, hours of makeup, and pounds of heavy costume go into the production. Funds for the show are collected from donors. While the tale may be traditional, digital technology and social media have helped in reaching contemporary audiences. The demon king Ravana is the most sought after for selfies with fans. For Ratnakar, putting the show together is a labour of love, and devotion. The show ends every night with ritual prayers. Lord Rama represents 'the essence' of India, he says, and his life story will help safeguard both the Hindu religion and India’s culture. 21-year old Hitanshi Jha, who plays the role of Sita, believes that a divine hand guides her performance. 'Meaning everything happens automatically. I don’t say anything on stage, God himself makes it happen,' she says. The day of the Dussehra festival also marks the end of the five-day Durga Puja festival, the biggest holiday for India’s Bengali community. Thousands gather at temporary shrines to the Hindu goddess Durga, who is seen as the mother of the universe and worshipped for her fearsome power. As the actors in Delhi finish their show, they seek the director’s blessings, bowing down in front of their guru. Then the makeup comes off and costumes are packed away, and the crew gathers for a meal, relaxing in their dressing room in a tent provided by a charitable group. Time to catch up on real lives and sleep, before another day of playing gods.	https://apnews.com/article/india-festival-ramleela-dussehra-hindu-gods-1571d00214a0bb7c6027f674ec646c92	2024-10-10T20:36:14-07:00	
Israel's airstrike warnings terrify and confuse Lebanese civilians	BEIRUT (AP) — As the war between Israel and Hezbollah intensifies, Lebanese civilians are increasingly paying the price – and this dangerous reality often becomes clear in the middle of the night: That’s when the Israeli military typically warns people to evacuate buildings or neighborhoods to avoid airstrikes. Moein Shreif was recently awakened at 3 a.m. by a neighbor calling to alert him that Israel planned to strike a nearby building in his middle-class suburb south of Beirut where Hezbollah has a strong presence. Shreif, his wife and their three children quickly fled their multi-story apartment building and drove away. Within minutes, explosions rang out, he said later that day upon returning to see the smoldering ruins of his building and the one next door. 'I didn’t even have time to dress properly, as you can see,' said Shreif, a well-known Lebanese folk and pop singer who was still wearing his pajamas from the night before. 'I didn’t take anything out of the house.' Israel and Hezbollah have been exchanging strikes nearly every day since the start of the war in Gaza. Hezbollah says it will fire rockets into Israel until there's a cease-fire in Gaza; Israel says its fighting to stop those attacks, which have forced tens of thousands of Israelis from their homes. But it wasn’t until late last month, when Israel dramatically expanded its aerial campaign against Hezbollah, that Lebanese people began receiving regular warnings about upcoming airstrikes. Human rights groups say Israel's warnings — which aren't issued before many airstrikes — are inadequate and sometimes misleading. On Sept. 23, Israel made 80,000 calls into Lebanon, according to Imad Kreidieh, head of the country’s telecommunications company – presumably recorded warnings about upcoming airstrikes. The calls caused panic. Schools shut down. People rushed home early from work. It ended up being the deadliest day of airstrikes in Lebanon in decades, with over 500 people killed — roughly one quarter of all those killed in Lebanon the past year, according to the country’s Health Ministry. Women and children make up one quarter of all the deaths, the ministry says. Israel has issued warnings on social media nearly every day since then. On Oct. 1, 27 villages in southern Lebanon were told to evacuate to the north of the Awali River, dozens of kilometers (miles) away. 'Save your lives,' the instructions said. That is when Salam, a 42-year-old mother of two, fled the village of Ain Ebel. She and her family are now staying with relatives in Beirut. Salam refused to give her full name for fear of reprisals. So far, Ain Ebel – a mostly Christian village – hasn’t been bombarded, although surrounding villages whose residents are predominantly Shiite Muslims have been. Salam's teenage children are terrified of going home, especially since Israel launched a ground invasion. Salam is still baffled and angry that her village was evacuated. So far, evacuation notices in Lebanon have been far more limited than in Gaza, but the messages in both places have a common theme. In Gaza, Israel says it is targeting Hamas militants embedded among Gaza's civilians. In Lebanon, it warns of similar behavior by Hezbollah, a Hamas ally. Most of the Israeli military's warnings first appear on the social media accounts of its Arabic spokesperson. They are then amplified by the Lebanese media. The warnings instruct people to vacate homes 'immediately,' and they are usually followed by a series of overnight strikes that often cause damage in areas beyond those that were warned. Israel says it is targeting Hezbollah fighters, weapons or other assets belonging to the group. Warnings are rarely issued before daytime strikes. The Lebanese government says at least 1.2 million people have been displaced by the war, the vast majority since Israel ramped up airstrikes across the country last month. Over 800 of some 1,000 shelters are over capacity. One quarter of Lebanese territory is now under Israeli military displacement orders, according to the U.N.'s human rights division. 'Calling on residents of nearly 30 villages to leave ‘immediately’ is not effective and unlawfully suggests that civilians who do not leave an area will be deemed to be combatants,' said Ramzi Kaiss, a researcher for Human Rights Watch in Beirut. Kaiss said Israel — which usually issues warnings 30 to 90 minutes ahead of airstrikes — is obligated to protect civilians who refuse to evacuate, or who are physically unable to. Amnesty International is also critical of Israel's practice of warning entire towns and villages to evacuate. It 'raises questions around whether this is intended to create the conditions for mass displacement,' Agnes Callamard, the group's secretary general said in a statement on Thursday. The Israeli military didn’t respond to a request for comment. It has previously said it makes a significant effort to save civilian lives with its warnings. For almost a year, Israel’s strikes were mostly concentrated in communities along the border, far from the capital and its populous suburbs. But now people who once felt relatively safe in the outskirts of Beirut are increasingly at risk, and their neighborhoods are receiving a small but growing share of airstrike warnings. In Shreif’s case, he said his neighbor called about five minutes after the Israeli military issued a warning on the social media platform X. Shreif considers himself lucky: If it wasn’t for that wake-up call, his family might not be alive. The AP could not determine whether any people were killed or injured in the strike that destroyed Shreif's building or the one next door. To the northeast of Beirut, in the Bekaa Valley, Israel recently issued a warning to people to stay at least 1,000 meters (yards) away from their town or village if they are in or a near a home that has weapons belonging to Hezbollah. Some of the warnings have come in the form of animated videos. One shows an elderly woman in a kitchen, suggesting she is unaware of hidden rooms and compartments in her own house that contain weapons for Hezbollah. 'Didn’t you know?' the narrator says in Arabic, as the elderly woman discovers rockets under the couch, behind the shower curtains and elsewhere. The video warns viewers to leave their homes immediately if they – or their neighbors – discover weapons. But in many cases there are no warnings at all. Last month, in Ain el-Delb near the southern city of Sidon, an Israeli airstrike hit a residential building, burying about 70 people under the rubble. Achraf Ramadan, 34, and his father were among the lucky one who rescue workers were able to pull out alive. His mother was taken to the hospital alive, but she later died from her wounds. His younger sister Julia, a public relations professional in her late 20s, was found dead. Achraf and Julia together had been leading initiatives to support displaced Lebanese families in and around Sidon. 'This is a nice and peaceful neighborhood,' Ramadan said, sounding dejected. 'The international community is asleep and not taking initiative. On the contrary, I think it's giving Israel an excuse for its barbarity on the pretext of self-defense.' ___ Associated Press writers Fadi Tawil in Beirut, Julia Frankel in Jerusalem, and Zeina Karam in London, contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-evacuation-warnings-war-d131e6f7043623bc109eab768decc2a1	2024-10-10T20:04:38-07:00	
AP PHOTOS: A look at life inside Paraguay's overcrowded prisons	ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) — Paraguay a few months ago launched an operation to address some of the many problems plaguing its prison system, including internal gang control, but one problem in particular has proven difficult to deal with: overcrowding. The South American nation has 18 prisons with a capacity for almost 10,000 inmates, but the current population exceeds 17,600, according to the latest figures provided by authorities which go until the end of 2023. A country of more than 6 million inhabitants, Paraguay is considered a regional drug trafficking hub. An Associated Press photographer recently had access to five different prisons — four male facilities and one for women — to see how their inmates live. With the exception of the female detention center, overcrowding was common. One of the penitentiaries the AP visited was Tacumbú, the largest prison in Paraguay, which authorities raided nine months ago in an effort to regain control from the Rotela clan — a gang that has extended its presence onto Paraguay's streets and into some of its prisons. The police operation ended with a dozen people dead, several injured and the relocation of 700 inmates to other lockups. Inside the prison, cells designed to hold five inmates hold more than 15. Prisoners often sleep on thin mattresses on the floor and hang towels in an attempt at privacy. They look for ways to spend their time. The facilities the AP visited were minimum-security prisons, so inmates interact more freely. But for those who break the rules, there are cells in an isolated area where they are held without visitors. Inside 'El Buen Pastor,' or Good Shepherd, female prison, things look cleaner and less crowded than in the men's facilities. Any given day, in prisons like Tacumbú, there are stretching sessions in open areas or religious ceremonies. Some inmates play soccer while others prefer bingo. Some try to earn money and shine the guards shoes for 30 cents. There are no dining areas, so inmates eat in their cells or in hallways. On cold days, prisoners are allowed to make a fire in the patios to keep warm. Atiliano Cuyer, 64, was detained for domestic violence and says he's been waiting for 10 months for a trial inside the Coronel Oviedo regional penitentiary. 'Justice in Paraguay doesn't work if you don't have money,' he adds.	https://apnews.com/article/paraguay-prisons-photo-gallery-2c58be3819606a99950302574773a06f	2024-10-10T19:26:52-07:00	
Stock market today: Wall Street rises toward records as banks rally and Tesla tumbles	NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are rising toward records Friday as big banks rally on a rush of reassuring profit reports. The S&amp;P 500 was 0.4% higher in afternoon trading and on track to top its all-time high set earlier this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 268 points, or 0.6%, and also heading toward a record, as of 12:56 p.m. Eastern time. The Nasdaq composite was lagging the market with a gain of 0.2% after a slide for Tesla kept it in check. Wells Fargo jumped 6% after reporting stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It benefited from better results from its venture-capital investments and higher fees for investment-banking services, among other things. Banks and other financial giants traditionally kick off each earnings reporting season, and BlackRock and Bank of New York Mellon also climbed after delivering results that topped analysts’ forecasts. BlackRock, the investment giant, said it ended the summer managing a record $11.5 trillion in total assets for its customers. JPMorgan Chase, the nation's biggest bank, rose 4.9% and was the strongest single force pushing upward on the S&amp;P 500 after it reported a milder drop in profit than analysts feared. CEO Jamie Dimon said the bank is still buying back shares of its stock to send cash to investors, but the pace is modest 'given that market levels are at least slightly inflated.' The gains for banks helped make up for the drag of Tesla, which tumbled 7.7% and was the heaviest weight on the market. The electric-vehicle maker unveiled its long-awaited robotaxi on Thursday night, but critics highlighted a lack of details about its planned rollout. Following the unveiling of the 'Cybercab,' potential rival Uber Technologies jumped 9.6% and was one of the strongest forces lifting the S&amp;P 500. Lyft rose even more, 10.1%. Another automaker, Stellantis, saw its European-traded shares sink 2.8% after it announced some significant leadership changes, including the timing of CEO Carlos Tavares’ retirement. Its chief financial officer is also departing as the company formed by the merger of PSA Peugeot and Fiat Chrysler struggles to revive sales in North America. In the bond market, Treasury yields were holding relatively steady after the latest updates on inflation at the wholesale level and on sentiment among U.S. consumers. Prices paid by producers were 1.8% higher in September than a year earlier. That was an improvement from August’s year-over-year inflation level, but not as much as economists expected. Analysts said it likely helped calm worries stirred a day earlier, when a separate report showed inflation at the consumer level wasn’t cooling as quickly as economists expected. A separate report suggested sentiment among U.S. consumers is weakening by more than economists feared. But the preliminary reading's decline was still within the margin of error, according to Joanne Hsu, director of the University of Michigan's Surveys of Consumers. After Friday’s reports, traders were holding onto their bets that the Federal Reserve would cut its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point at its next meeting, according to data from CME Group. They've pared back their expectations from earlier this month, when some were betting on the possibility for another larger-than-usual cut of half a percentage point in November. A run of stronger-than-expected data on the economy wiped out such calls. Regardless of how much the Fed cuts rates by at its next meeting, the longer-term trend for interest rates is still downward, according to Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas, at UBS Global Wealth Management. That should benefit stock prices generally. The Fed last month cut its main interest rate from a two-decade high as it widens its focus to include keeping the economy humming instead of just fighting high inflation. The yield on the 10-year Treasury was holding at 4.07%, where it was late Thursday. The two-year yield, which more closely tracks expectations for the Fed’s upcoming moves, edged down to 3.93% from 3.96%. In markets abroad, stocks fell 2.5% in Shanghai for their latest sharp swing ahead of a briefing scheduled for Saturday by China’s Finance Ministry. Investors hope it will unveil a big stimulus plan for the world's second-largest economy. South Korea's Kospi slipped 0.1% after its central bank cut interest rates for the first time in more than four years in hopes of boosting its economy. ___ AP Business Writers Matt Ott and Zimo Zhong contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/stock-market-china-stimulus-fed-korea-rates-7dfc363b1ff32e71a335571cdf8325fb	2024-10-10T19:16:31-07:00	
Migration through Darien Gap increased in September, led by Venezuelans after the election	PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) — The number of migrants crossing the Darien Gap — a rugged jungle passage between Colombia and Panama — increased sharply in September, according to Panamanian government data, and a human rights organization says there’s less capacity to assist migrants. Venezuelans have led mass migration through the Darien since 2022, and make up much of the increase since that country's recent controversial presidential election. 'The crackdown in the wake of the July 28, 2024 elections in Venezuela has led to an increase in immigration,' Refugees International said in a report published Friday. The report was based on dozens of interviews with migrants at reception stations in Panama and Costa Rica. More than half a million migrants, a record number, crossed the Darien in 2023. More than 65% of them were Venezuelan. Panamanian President José Raúl Mulino, who took office on July 1, promised to curb migration by closing several access points. He also said he would implement a repatriation program with the help of the United States, which has so far added flights to Colombia, Ecuador, and India. The U.S. government agreed to pay for deportation flights for those migrants deemed inadmissible. The plan has not been applied to Venezuelan migrants because Panama, like neighboring Costa Rica, suspended its relations with Caracas after refusing to recognize the electoral victory claimed by Nicolás Maduro. Flights between the two nations are paralyzed. As of Oct. 7, the number of migrants who had crossed through the Darien this year was 277,939 or 36% less than the same period in 2023, according to the Panamanian Ministry of Security. However, the same data showed a sharp increase in September compared to August. Records show that 25,111 migrants crossed last month, 51% more than in August with more than 80% of them Venezuelans. The numbers also included Colombians, Ecuadorians, Chinese and dozens of other nationalities. 'The (migratory) measures and the rhetoric from the Panamanian government could have temporarily discouraged migration, but not in the long-term,' said the organization. 'When they exit Darien, migrants encounter less humanitarian aid in Panama,' the report said. 'For those who aren’t Venezuelan they encounter the threat of deportation.' Refugees International said this is due in part to the suspension of Doctors Without Borders (MSF) in early March by the previous Panamanian administration. The organization provided humanitarian aid to migrants, but was suspended because of an expired agreement with the country's Ministry of Health. MSF had suggested that the suspension was in retaliation for multiple accusations made against Panamanian authorities for not addressing unprecedented rates of sexual violence in the Darien during the first months of 2024, according to the report. MSF informed the AP on Thursday that it has resumed its activities since last week at the Lajas Blancas reception station after Panamanian authorities approved a three-month medical intervention. MSF said that from January 2023 to February 2024 it provided more than 72,700 migrants with medical care. ___ Follow AP's Latin America coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/darien-gap-panama-venezuelan-migrants-4a385db728c922525d9addbc2577bc42	2024-10-10T19:14:38-07:00

Blinken tells ASEAN the US is worried about China's 'dangerous' actions in disputed sea	VIENTIANE, Laos (AP) — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Southeast Asian leaders Friday that the U.S. is concerned about China's 'increasingly dangerous and unlawful' activities in the disputed South China Sea during an annual summit meeting, and pledged the U.S. will continue to uphold freedom of navigation in the vital sea trade route. The 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations’ meeting with Blinken followed a series of violent confrontations at sea between China and ASEAN members Philippines and Vietnam, which have fueled concerns that China’s increasingly assertive actions in the waterways could spiral into a full-scale conflict. China, which claims almost the entire sea, has overlapping claims with ASEAN members Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei, as well as Taiwan. About a third of global trade transits through the sea, which is also rich in fishing stocks, gas and oil. Beijing has refused to recognize a 2016 international arbitration ruling by a U.N.-affiliated court in the Hague that invalidated its expansive claims, and has built up and militarized islands it controls. 'We are very concerned about China’s increasingly dangerous and unlawful activities in the South China Sea which have injured people, harm vessels from ASEAN nations and contradict commitments to peaceful resolutions of disputes,' said Blinken, who is filling in for President Joe Biden, in his opening speech at the U.S.-ASEAN summit. 'The United States will continue to support freedom of navigation, and freedom of overflight in the Indo Pacific.' The U.S. has no claims in the South China Sea, but has deployed navy ships and fighter jets to patrol the waters in a challenge to China’s claims. Chinese and Philippine vessels have clashed repeatedly this year, and Vietnam said last week that Chinese forces assaulted its fishermen in the disputed sea. China has also sent patrol vessels to areas that Indonesia and Malaysia claim as exclusive economic zones. The U.S. has warned repeatedly that it’s obligated to defend the Philippines — its oldest treaty ally in Asia — if Filipino forces, ships or aircraft come under armed attack, including in the South China Sea. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. complained to summit leaders on Thursday that his country 'continues to be subject to harassment and intimidation' by China. He said it was 'regrettable that the overall situation in the South China Sea remains tense and unchanged' due to China’s actions, which he said violated international law. He has called for more urgency in ASEAN-China negotiations on a code of conduct to govern the South China Sea. Singaporean leader Lawrence Wong earlier this week warned of 'real risks of an accident spiraling into conflict' if the sea dispute isn't addressed. Malaysia, who takes over the rotating ASEAN chair next year, is expected to push to accelerate talks on the code of conduct. Officials have agreed to try and complete the code by 2026, but talks have been hampered by sticky issues including disagreements over whether the pact should be binding. Chinese Premier Li Qiang was defiant during talks on Thursday. He called South China Sea a 'shared home' but repeated China’s assertion that it was merely protecting its sovereign rights, officials said. Li also blamed meddling by 'external forces' who sought to 'introduce bloc confrontation and geopolitical conflicts into Asia.' Li didn’t name the foreign forces, but China has previously warned the U.S. not to meddle in the region’s territorial disputes. In another firm message to China, Blinken said the U.S. believed 'it is also important to maintain our shared commitment to protect stability across the Taiwan Strait.' China claims the self-ruled island of Taiwan as its own territory and bristles at other countries’ patrolling the body of water separating it from the island. Blinken also attended an 18-nation East Asia Summit, along with the Chinese premier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, and leaders from Japan, South Korea, India, Australia and New Zealand. ASEAN has treaded carefully on the sea dispute with China, which is the bloc's largest trading partner and its third largest investor. It hasn't marred trade relations, with the two sides focusing on expanding a free trade area covering a market of 2 billion people. Blinken said the annual ASEAN summit talks were a platform to address other shared challenges including the civil war in Myanmar, North Korea’s 'destabilizing behavior' and Russia’s war aggression in Ukraine. He said the U.S. remained the top foreign investor in the region, and aims to strengthen its partnership with ASEAN.	https://apnews.com/article/asean-us-china-south-china-sea-blinken-12e98754ad3ece4932254b8a869c02ec	2024-10-10T18:29:17-07:00	
Gunmen kill 20 miners in an attack in southwest Pakistan ahead of an Asian security summit	QUETTA, Pakistan (AP) — Gunmen killed 20 miners and wounded another seven in Pakistan’s southwest, a police official said Friday, drawing condemnation from authorities who have ordered police to trace and arrest those who are behind the killings. It’s the latest attack in restive Balochistan province and comes days ahead of a major security summit being hosted in the capital. Police official Hamayun Khan Nasir said the gunmen stormed the accommodations at the coal mine in Duki district late Thursday night, rounded up the men and opened fire. Most of the men were from Pashtun-speaking areas of Balochistan. Three of the dead and four of the wounded were Afghan. No group claimed immediate responsibility for the attack, but the suspicion is likely to fall on the outlawed Baloch Liberation Army, which often targets civilians and security forces. The group committed multiple attacks in August that killed more than 50 people, while authorities responded by killing 21 insurgents in the province. Those killed included 23 passengers, mostly from eastern Punjab province, who were fatally shot after being taken from buses, vehicles and trucks in Musakhail district in Baluchistan. The latest attack drew a strong condemnation from the country's Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and Sarfraz Bugti, the chief minister in Balochistan, who said the 'terrorists have once again targeted poor laborers.' He said the attackers were cruel and had an agenda to destabilize Pakistan. 'The killing of these innocent laborers would be avenged,' he said in a statement. Naqvi also said those who killed the laborers would not be able to escape from the grip of the law. The province is home to several separatist groups who want independence. They accuse the federal government in Islamabad of unfairly exploiting oil- and mineral-rich Balochistan at the expense of locals. On Monday, a group called the Baloch Liberation Army said it carried out an attack on Chinese nationals outside Pakistan's biggest airport. There are thousands of Chinese working in the country, most of them involved in Beijing’s multibillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative. The explosion, which the BLA said was the work of a suicide bomber, also raised questions about the ability of Pakistani forces to protect high-profile events or foreigners in the country. Islamabad is hosting a summit next week of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, a grouping founded by China and Russia to counter Western alliances. Authorities have beefed up security in the capital by deploying troops to prevent any acts of terrorism. The Ministry of Interior this week had alerted the country's four provinces to take additional measures to enhance security as the separatist groups and Pakistani Taliban could launch attacks at public places and government installation. The killings of miners came hours Saudi and Pakistani businessmen signed 27 memorandums of understanding valued at $2 billion for investment across various sectors, including mining in oil and gas rich Balochistan. Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif attended the signing of the memorandums in the capital, Islamabad. Saudi Arabia also wants to invest in Reko Diq, district in Balochistan which famed for its mineral wealth, including gold and copper. Baluchistan’s Gwardar port is an anchor in the China Pakistan Economic Corridor, part of Beijing’s vast Belt and Road infrastructure initiative, and BLA has asked the Chinese to leave the province to avoid attacks. ____ Associated Press writer Munir Ahmed contributed to this story from Islamabad.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-miners-killed-b4302a6af4888c009212bea622f76679	2024-10-10T17:48:09-07:00	
South Korea's central bank cuts rates in a bid to boost the economy	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s central bank on Friday cut its policy rate for the first time in more than four years as pressure to revive a sluggish economy outweighed concerns about the country’s level of household debt. The Bank of Korea lowered its key interest rate by a quarter percentage point to 3.25% following a meeting of its monetary policy committee, in its first move to lower borrowing costs since May 2020, when the economy was weathering the COVID-19 pandemic. The bank raised the rate by a quarter percentage point in August 2021 over concerns about inflation and soaring household debt, driven in part by skyrocketing house prices, and then froze rates for over three years. The bank said in a statement that domestic demand is making a slow recovery, bogging down the pace of economic growth. It said there was room for a rate cut because inflation is showing signs of stabilizing and household debt is also increasing more slowly as the housing market in the greater Seoul area cools down. At a news conference, central bank Governor Rhee Chang-yong said there’s still capacity in the economy for additional cuts, pointing out that house prices in the capital area grew by two thirds less in September than in August. The country’s consumer price inflation also eased to 1.6% in September, below the policy target of 2%. However, Rhee said it’s still too soon to conclude that the country’s financial situation is stabilizing and indicated that the bank would be conservative about further rate cuts. 'We will decide after monitoring the stability in financial markets,' said Lee. He said the bank’s latest step could be interpreted as a 'hawkish cut,' meaning that it still favors tighter monetary conditions. Alarmed by slowing growth, government officials have called for the bank to lower borrowing costs. During a parliamentary hearing, South Korean finance minister Choi Sang-mok told lawmakers that he 'respects and welcomes' the rate cut. South Korea’s trade-dependent economy is facing increasing uncertainties, including the growing crisis in the Middle East that could potentially influence fuel prices, exchange rates and public utility prices, the bank said. 'The future path of economic growth is likely to be influenced by the pace of recovery in domestic demand, economic conditions in major countries and trends in information-technology exports,' the bank said. 'The growth in house prices in the metropolitan area and household debt is expected to gradually slow down due to the strengthening of macroprudential policies,' aimed at maintaining the stability of the financial system, the bank said. 'However, there’s still a need to monitor related risks, such as the impact the lowered base interest rate may have on household debt.' The bank projects South Korea’s economy to grow at 2.4% this year, down from 2.6% in 2023. Household loans issued by banks were measured at around 1,135.7 trillion won ($841 billion) at the end of September after growing by about 5.7% during the month, compared to a 9.2% increase in August. While the country’s exports have been gradually improving, job growth remains sluggish, due to weakness in construction industries and other sectors, the bank said. ___ The headline of this story has been edited to reflect that the central bank cut, not raised, its policy interest rate.	https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-rate-cut-central-bank-economy-66f3bdd72aae9910f072b08f901b711f	2024-10-10T17:28:17-07:00	
New Zealand ship didn’t sink because its captain was a woman, the ‘appalled’ defense minister says	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — New Zealand's defense minister issued stinging rebukes of what she said were 'vile' and 'misogynistic' online remarks by 'armchair admirals' about the woman captain of a navy ship that ran aground, caught fire and sank off the coast of Samoa. 'Seriously, it’s 2024,' Judith Collins told reporters Thursday. 'What the hell’s going on here?' After days of comments on social media directed at the gender of Commander Yvonne Gray, Collins urged the public to 'be better.' Women members of the military had also faced verbal abuse in the street in New Zealand since the ship — one of nine in the country's navy — was lost on Sunday, Collins said. All 75 people on board evacuated to safety with only minor injuries after the vessel ran aground on the reef it was surveying about a mile off the coast of Upolu, Samoa's most populous island. The cause of the disaster is not known. 'The one thing that we already know did not cause it is the gender of the ship's captain, a woman with 30 years' naval experience who on the night made the call to get her people to safety,' Collins said. One of the posters was a truck driver from Melbourne, Australia, she added. 'I think that he should keep his comments to people who drive trucks rather than people who drive ships,' Collins said. 'These are the sorts of people I'm calling out and I'm happy to keep calling them out for as long as it takes to stop this behavior.' About 20% of New Zealand’s uniformed military members are women. Collins is New Zealand's first woman defence minister and said she stood alongside Gray and Maj. Gen. Rose King, the country's first woman army chief, who assumed her role in June. 'We are all appointed on merit, not gender,' said Collins. The sinking prompted fears of a major fuel spill. On Thursday, officials in Samoa said while the vessel was leaking oil from three places, the amount was reducing each day and was dissipating quickly due to strong winds in the area. Most of the ship's fuel appeared to have burned out in the fire, according to a statement by the Marine Pollution Advisory Committee. Officials were due to meet with locals Thursday to discuss how to remove the vessel's anchor and three shipping containers from the reef without further damaging the fragile marine ecosystem. New Zealand’s government has ordered a military court of inquiry into the episode, which will be led by senior military officers. It will assemble for the first time on Friday. Passengers, including civilian scientists and foreign military personnel, left the vessel on life boats in 'challenging conditions' and darkness, New Zealand’s Chief of Navy Rear Admiral Garin Golding told reporters after the sinking. Those on board have since returned to New Zealand by plane. The specialist dive and hydrographic vessel had been in service for New Zealand since 2019, but was 20 years old and had previously belonged to Norway. The military said the ship, purchased for $100 million NZ dollars ($61 million), was not covered by replacement insurance. The state of New Zealand’s aging military hardware has prompted warnings from the defense agency, which in a March report described the navy as 'extremely fragile,' with ships idle due to problems retaining the staff needed to service and maintain them. Of the navy’s eight remaining ships, five are currently operational. Golding said the HMNZS Manawanui underwent a maintenance period before the deployment.	https://apnews.com/article/zealand-navy-ship-sexism-woman-commander-samoa-778b42dcefe5adc252673fd16cf41372	2024-10-10T14:01:08-07:00	
A new mayor takes office in southern Mexico after his predecessor was beheaded	CHILPANCINGO, Mexico (AP) — A new mayor was sworn in Thursday in a city in southern Mexico where his predecessor was killed and beheaded less than a week after taking office. The new mayor, Gustavo Alarcón, a doctor, had been elected as an alternate on the same ticket as deceased Mayor Alejandro Arcos in the June election. Arcos took office on Oct. 1 in the violence-wracked city of Chilpancingo, the capital of the southern state of Guerrero. But his beheaded body was found in a pickup truck Sunday; his head had been placed on the vehicle's roof. Two rival drug gangs are fighting to control the city. Alarcón took the oath of office with a minimal security detail of a handful of police officers Thursday. He pledged to 'work for the good of all' and fight the violence that has gripped Chilpancingo for years. Before he was killed, Arcos had told local media he needed more protection, but officials said no formal request had been received. State and federal governments can offer mayors bulletproof vehicles, additional bodyguards and emergency alert systems. It was not clear if Alarcón had been granted that kind of protection. Chilpancingo, a city of about 300,000, is dominated by two warring drug gangs, the Ardillos and the Tlacos. One staged a demonstration of hundreds of people, hijacked a government armored car, blocked a major highway and took police hostage in 2023 to win the release of arrested suspects. Earlier this week, federal Public Safety Secretary Omar García Harfuch said four mayors from other towns in Mexico had requested protection on Monday, a day after Arcos’ remains were found. The requests came from Guerrero and another violence-plagued state, Guanajuato. The situation in Guanajuato is so bad that ahead of the country’s June elections, at least four mayoral candidates were killed. But violence in Guerrero reached such unprecedented levels that earlier this year, Roman Catholic bishops announced they had helped arrange a truce in another part of the state between two warring drug cartels. At the time, former president Andrés Manuel López Obrador— who refused to confront the gangs — said he approved of such talks. 'Priests and pastors and members of all the churches have participated, helped in pacifying the country. I think it is very good,' said López Obrador, who left office Sept. 30. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-mayor-beheading-cartel-violence-guerrero-3c6de2e059d6c1a706508a2ac814d7c7	2024-10-10T13:33:11-07:00

AP PHOTOS: Powerful Hurricane Milton destroys homes, shreds stadium roofs apart	Many Florida residents were returning to their homes Thursday after Hurricane Milton pummelled the state, the second major hurricane in two weeks. Millions of people in several counties had been ordered to evacuate earlier this week as Milton approached. In Palmetto, southwest of Tampa, resident Natasha Ducre and her family of seven returned from a government shelter to find their home demolished and unlivable — furniture and other belongings destroyed by heavy rainwater. The roof in her kitchen had collapsed, with debris now carpeting the floor. Their home destroyed, siblings Saboria, 4, and Messiah Tyler, 3, had nowhere to sleep but the backseat of a car. Farther north in St. Petersburg, powerful winds and rain shredded the roof of the Tropicana Field Stadium, home to the Tampa Bay Rays of Major League Baseball, where several stadium workers were taking shelter. The team said it may take weeks to fully assess how much damage was done. Milton slammed into Florida as a Category 3 storm on Wednesday, killing at least 5 people, spawning tornadoes and leaving more than 3 million homes and businesses without power. The state’s central Gulf Coast was hardest hit by the outages, including Hardee, Sarasota, Hillsborough and Manatee counties. The storm came after Hurricane Helene ravaged several southeastern states as a Category 4 storm, killing more than 220 people. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

TD Bank to pay $3 billion in historic money-laundering settlement with the Justice Department	WASHINGTON (AP) — TD Bank will pay approximately $3 billion in a historic settlement with U.S. authorities who said Thursday that the financial institution's lax practices allowed significant money laundering over multiple years. Canada-based TD Bank pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering, the largest bank in U.S. history to do so, Attorney General Merrick Garland said. 'TD Bank created an environment that allowed financial crime to flourish,' Garland said. 'By making its services convenient for criminals, it became one.' High-level executives were alerted to serious problems with the bank’s anti-money laundering program, but failed to correct them as employees openly joked about how easy it seemed to be for criminals to launder money there, Garland said. The bank is the 10th largest in the United States, and its CEO said the company takes full responsibility and has been cooperating with the investigation. It's been taking steps to fix its U.S. anti-money laundering program, including appointing new leadership and adding hundreds of new specialists, said TD Bank Group CEO Bharat Masrani. 'We know what the issues are, we are fixing them. As we move forward, we’re ensuring that this never happens again,' Masrani said. 'And I’m 100% confident that we get to the other side and emerge even stronger.' The Justice Department said the bank allowed at least three different money laundering networks to move a total of $670 million through TD Bank accounts over a period of several years. The institution became the bank of choice for multiple criminals and money laundering organizations, authorities said. 'From fentanyl and narcotics trafficking, to terrorist financing and human trafficking, TD Bank’s chronic failures provided fertile ground for a host of illicit activity to penetrate our financial system,' said Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo. In one case, a man moved more than $470 million in drug proceeds and other illicit funds through TD Bank branches, bribing employees with more than $57,000 in gift cards. He chose TD Bank because it had the 'most permissive policies,' more than once depositing more than $1 million in cash in a single day and then moving the funds out of the bank with checks or wire transfers, Garland said. It continued despite employees expressing concern about what he was doing. There were also piles of cash dumped on a bank’s counters and ATM withdrawals that totaled 40 times to 50 times higher than the daily limits, said Philip Sellinger, U.S. attorney in New Jersey. In a separate scheme, five employees worked with criminal organizations to open and maintain accounts that were used to launder $39 million to Colombia, including drug proceeds, Garland said. There were also multiple red flags in that case, including that the same Venezuelan passports were used to open multiple accounts, but the bank did not identify the problem until one of the employees was arrested. In a third scheme, a money laundering network had accounts for at least five shell companies that moved more than $100 million in illicit funds, but the bank did not file a required suspicious activity report until law enforcement alerted it. The bank's 'long-term, pervasive, and systemic deficiencies' in its policies over a period of nine years allowed such abuses to flourish, prosecutors said. Two dozen people have been prosecuted for involvement in money-laundering schemes, including two TD Bank employees, Garland said. The investigation is ongoing. The bank has also agreed to major restructuring of the corporate compliance program in its U.S. operations, as well as three years of monitoring and five years of probation. ____ Associated Press writer Alanna Durkin Richer contributed to this story.	https://apnews.com/article/td-bank-money-laundering-justice-department-75426a569d40174fd61fa7bc83026176	2024-10-10T08:59:01-07:00	
Donald Trump rolls out tax breaks, but no specifics, for overseas citizens and auto buyers	DETROIT (AP) — Donald Trump on Thursday rolled out more plans for tax breaks without offering details on how they would work or how they'd affect the federal budget. Trump vowed in a speech at the Detroit Economic Club to allow interest on car loans to be deducted from taxes, saying the proposal would 'stimulate massive domestic auto production' and make car ownership more affordable. In a video, also released Thursday, he proposes to grant a key tax break to U.S. citizens living overseas to end so-called double taxation. Trump has offered a series of tax breaks over the last several months to appeal to specific groups he's courting in the election: tipped and hourly workers, Social Security recipients, and now car buyers who have experienced sticker shock as well as Americans who live and vote abroad. In a tight race with Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump is betting that his targeted no-tax pledges will appeal to enough voters in key battlegrounds. But so far, the Republican nominee has been vague about how those tax breaks would work or how he would pay for them — other than promising that his plans to impose sweeping tariffs would bring in new government revenue. Economic analyses of his earlier tax cut ideas estimated they would cost between nearly $6 trillion and $10 trillion over 10 years, depending on which proposals become policy and how they’re implemented. And mainstream economists warn that Trump's tariff plans — and the expected retaliation from targeted countries — would raise prices for Americans, slash more than a percentage point off the U.S. economy by 2026 and make inflation 2 percentage points higher next year than it otherwise would have been. The proposal to make interest on car loans tax deductible is intended to help buyers struggling with the increase in car prices. Since inflation took off in early 2021, the average price of a new car has jumped nearly 18%, though that has fallen compared with a year ago. Used car prices are up 13%. At the same time, the Federal Reserve’s interest rate increases, intended to combat inflation, have pushed auto-loan rates much higher. The average rate on a five-year car loan reached 8.4% in this year’s third quarter, up from 4.5% two years ago, when the Fed’s rate hikes began. Marc Goldwein, senior vice president at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said a rough estimate of the impact of Trump’s proposals for overseas citizens and auto buyers would be to reduce tax revenues by more than $100 billion over 10 years. If the car-loans proposal does operate like the deduction for mortgage interest, as Trump suggested, then only the one-fifth of taxpayers who itemize their deductions would be able to take advantage of it, Goldwein said. Trump's promise to help U.S. citizens living abroad concerns policies that can require Americans to pay taxes in the country where they reside and to the U.S. government. The U.S. has bilateral agreements with some nations that ease the burden in some cases. The proposal was first released by a group called Republicans Overseas. 'You have to make sure that you are registered and you are going to vote, because I'm going to take very good care of you,' Trump says in the video statement the overseas group's CEO, Solomon Yue, posted to his account on X. 'Once and for all, I'm going to end double taxation on our overseas citizens,' Trump said. 'You've been wanting this for years, and nobody has listened to you. And you deserve it. And I'm going to do it.' The overseas tax breaks could also end up favoring some wealthy citizens, because it could open more opportunities for them to live abroad in low-tax countries and avoid U.S. taxes. Yue praised Trump for his commitment. 'Republicans Overseas has been fighting for the rights of Americans abroad since its inception ten years ago,' Yue said in a statement. 'We have spoken to many politicians over the years, and while they sympathized with the burden of double taxation, very few have been willing to act.' The former president's embrace of U.S citizens living abroad comes after statements lumping those voters in with his unfounded accusations that Democrats plan to commit widespread fraud in the 2024 election. 'The Democrats are talking about how they’re working so hard to get millions of votes from Americans living overseas,' Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform Sept. 23. 'Actually, they are getting ready to CHEAT!' He argued that efforts to make it easier for overseas citizens to vote would 'dilute' the votes of military service members who Trump believes will favor him over Democratic nominee Kamala Harris. 'WATCH! Remember, IF YOU VOTE ILLEGALLY,' he threatened, 'YOU’RE GOING TO JAIL.' Paulina Salzeider, 47, who attended the speech on Thursday, works as a barber and supports Trump’s tax cuts and plan to exclude tips from federal taxes. 'In our business, I mean we depend on tips,' she said. 'In the service industry, the nicer you are, the kinder you are, the friendlier you are, you get rewarded by tips. So I feel that we deserve it.' But Curtis Lyons, a financial adviser from Detroit who is a Democrat and was also at the Thursday event, said he believes Trump’s tax cuts in his first administration did more harm than good and only benefited the wealthier. 'I’m not going to be voting for our guest,' he said. 'I’m just here to see and be entertained.' ___ Barrow reported from Atlanta and Gomez Licon reported from Fort Lauderdale, Fla.

South Koreans are joyful after Han Kang wins Nobel Prize for literature	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Koreans reacted with joy and astonishment on Thursday after learning that homegrown writer Han Kang won the Nobel Prize in literature, an unexpected moment that stoked national pride about the country’s growing cultural influence. Han, known for her experimental and often disturbing stories that explore human traumas and violence and incorporate the brutal moments of South Korea’s modern history, is the country’s first writer to win the preeminent award in world literature. Han's triumph adds to the growing global influence of South Korean culture, which in recent years included the successes of director Bong Joon-ho’s Oscar-winning 'Parasite,' the brutal Netflix survival drama 'Squid Game' and K-pop groups like BTS and BLACKPINK. 'I’m so surprised and honored,' Han, 53, said in a telephone interview posted on the X account of the Nobel Prize. As the news spread in South Korea, some online bookstores temporarily froze following a sudden jump in traffic. South Korean social media were flooded with jubilant messages expressing admiration and pride. Some internet users found it meaningful that Han was the first Asian woman to win the award and portrayed it as a statement toward the country’s traditionally male-dominated literature scene. 'It’s always the women who do the big things,' one Facebook user wrote. In South Korea’s parliament, multiple government hearings were paused as lawmakers cheered and applauded Han’s award. While visiting Laos for a meeting of Asian leaders, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol issued a statement, congratulating Han on her award, calling it a 'great achievement in the history of Korean literature' and a 'special moment for the nation.' 'You converted the painful wounds of our modern history into great literature,' Yoon wrote. 'I send my respects to you for elevating the value of Korean literature.' Han, the daughter of renowned South Korean novelist Han Seung-won, made her publishing debut as a poet in 1993. She won the International Booker Prize in 2016 for the novel 'The Vegetarian,' a story in which a woman’s decision to stop eating meat brings devastating consequences and raises concern among family members that she’s mentally ill. The book sold more than 100,000 in the U.S. Another one of Han's well-known novels is 'Human Acts,' which is set in 1980 in her birth city of Gwangju and follows a boy searching for the body of a friend who was killed in a violent suppression of a student protest. South Korea’s former military government that year sent troops to Gwangju for a bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protesters that left around 200 people dead and hundreds of others injured. 'The decision came all too sudden. I could also describe it as a feeling of bewilderment,' Han Seung-won, Han’s father, told reporters Friday about the moment he heard the news that his daughter had won the Nobel Prize. He praised his daughter's writing, which he described as poetic and exhibiting unique 'fantastical realism,' and also commended British translator Deborah Smith, who translated 'The Vegetarian' and 'The White Book.' 'The translator has somehow managed to convey Han Kang’s sentences, bringing to life the delicate and beautiful prose and melancholic sensibility,' he said. Han Kang’s award generated excitement among South Korean writers and critics, who in comments to local media expressed hope that it would bring more global attention to South Korean literature. But it remains to be seen whether Han’s stories would become widely popular among casual readers around the world, said Brother Anthony of Taize, a British-born scholar and prolific translator of Korean literature. 'It’s not always an easy read,' he said, describing how her novels are often complicated stories about communication failures, misunderstandings, 'unhappy people and troubled relationships and pain.' If Han's works have anything in common with South Korea's other cultural products that garnered international acclaim in recent years, it is that they often reflect the dark side of the country’s society. Both Parasite and Squid Game provided biting commentaries on the country’s deepening inequality and other problems that have many young and poor people describing their lives as a hellish nightmare. South Korea has one of the largest gaps between rich and poor among developed economies and is grappling with decaying job markets, soaring household debt and a record-low birth rate as struggling couples put off having babies. The country also struggles to deal with the pains of its brutal transition from dictatorship to democracy. 'Korean society is rather dark and it’s probably the aspect that resonates,' Brother Anthony said. Jung Yoon-young, a 49-year-old resident in Seoul, said Han’s triumph was a refreshing moment for the country during depressing times. 'It’s a miraculous event and really a breath of fresh air,' she said. 'I’m grateful and proud.'	https://apnews.com/article/han-kang-nobel-literature-south-korea-vegetarian-dark-history-e404fdbb3ca2079bf45e03023c6ad3b4	2024-10-10T07:01:07-07:00

The Latest: Harris visiting Nevada and Arizona while Trump speaks in Michigan	As Florida grapples with the effects of Hurricane Milton, presidential campaigning remains in full swing in battleground states across the U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris will attend a Univision town hall in Las Vegas on Thursday afternoon before going to an evening rally in Phoenix while remaining in close contact with the White House and monitoring federal disaster response efforts. Former President Donald Trump, meanwhile, will speak at the Economic Club of Detroit after holding rallies in Pennsylvania on Wednesday. Even amid the hurricane, however, both the Harris and Trump campaigns are using their travel strategically, trying to increase support with key voting blocs who could decide an election expected to be exceedingly close. Former President Barack Obama is also hitting the campaign trail on Thursday night, making his first appearance for Harris at a rally in Pittsburgh. That begins what the Harris campaign says will be a series of campaign stops Obama will make on the vice president’s behalf. Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: UAW chief calls Trump the ‘job-killer-in-chief’ The Harris campaign openly challenged Trump’s economic record ahead of the Republican nominee’s Thursday speech in Detroit, part of a broader effort to chip away at the former president’s credibility. On a call with reporters organized by the campaign, Shawn Fain, president of the United Auto Workers, called Trump the 'job-killer-in-chief.' Despite Trump’s promises to bring back factory jobs, Fain said, 'The reality is Trump never brought back squat.' Back in 2000, Michigan had nearly 900,000 factory jobs. That number nearly halved after the 2008 financial crisis, only to then slowly recover 633,900 jobs in 2018. But factory work in Michigan began to slump in 2019 and then plunged during the pandemic, all during Trump’s term. Labor Department data show that manufacturing work in the state still hasn’t fully recovered with there being 604,800 jobs in the sector as of August.	https://apnews.com/article/harris-trump-election-2024-campaign-rallies-f63c268e981712f7f88da6149a476fc7	2024-10-10T06:31:55-07:00	
UN-backed experts say Israel is destroying Gaza's health sector and both sides have tortured people	A U.N. commission on Thursday accused Israel of destroying Gaza's health care system through 'relentless and deliberate attacks' in its yearlong war with Hamas and said that Palestinian prisoners and Israeli hostages have been tortured and sexually abused. The expert panel was commissioned in 2021 by the U.N.-backed Human Rights Council to look into rights violations and abuses in Israel and the Palestinian areas it controls. Led by Navi Pillay, a former U.N. human rights chief, the panel members are independent experts and do not speak for the world body. There was no immediate comment from Israel, which has long accused the U.N. of being biased against it and has not cooperated with the commission. Israeli forces have raided hospitals in Gaza on several occasions, accusing militants of sheltering there. Palestinian medical officials have denied such allegations and accused Israel of recklessly endangering civilians. Hospitals can lose their protection under international law if they are used for military purposes. The report accused Israel of deliberately killing, detaining and torturing Palestinian medical staff, of targeting their vehicles and of restricting permits for medical evacuations from Gaza. It said those amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity. 'Israel must immediately stop its unprecedented wanton destruction of health care facilities in Gaza,' Pillay said in a statement. 'By targeting health care facilities, Israel is targeting the right to health itself with significant long-term detrimental effects on the civilian population.' The commission said children have borne much of the cost of such actions, pointing to attacks on medical facilities offering pediatric and neonatal care. The panel also said it found that thousands of adults and children detained in Gaza had been subjected to 'widespread and systematic abuse, physical and psychological violence, and sexual and gender-based violence.' It said Israeli security forces had raped male detainees, attacked their genitals and forced them to perform humiliating or strenuous acts while stripped naked. It said children who had been detained had returned to Gaza unaccompanied and deeply traumatized. The commission further said the abuse had been institutionalized by Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir. He has boasted of making conditions in the country's prisons as harsh as possible under Israeli law in what he says is an attempt to deter militant attacks. Israel detained nine soldiers in July over what their defense lawyer said were allegations of sexual abuse of a detainee being held at a shadowy facility where detainees from Gaza have been taken since the start of the war. The lawyer denied the allegations, and their arrest sparked protests by Israeli hard-liners. The commission also said that hostages held by Palestinian militants in Gaza were subjected to physical and sexual violence, forced isolation and threats, and given limited access to water, food and hygiene facilities. It said Palestinian armed groups were also guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity, and called on them to immediately release all the hostages. Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 others. They are still holding around 100 captives, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel's offensive has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not say how many were fighters but say women and children make up more than half of the fatalities. The war has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced around 90% of its population of 2.3 million people. The International Court of Justice is investigating allegations that Israel has committed genocide in Gaza, and the International Criminal Court is considering arrest warrants against Israeli and Hamas leaders. Israel has adamantly denied the accusations and says it abides by international law. ___ Find more of AP’s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-human-rights-un-c75b4db37aa5ade8466e0daa446ad596	2024-10-10T05:20:50-07:00	
Trump and Harris keep campaigning after Milton hits Florida	WASHINGTON (AP) — Vice President Kamala Harris visits Nevada and Arizona while former President Donald Trump talks economic issues in Michigan, as presidential campaigning continues even with Hurricane Milton hitting Florida. Trump was speaking at the Economic Club of Detroit after holding rallies in Pennsylvania on Wednesday. Harris is attending a Univision town hall in Las Vegas and an evening rally in Phoenix while remaining in close contact with the White House and monitoring federal disaster response efforts. President Joe Biden, who said Milton 'is looking like the storm of the century,' postponed a trip to Germany and Angola to cope with its aftermath. He and Harris were huddling with top officials in the Situation Room to discuss disaster response. Even amid the hurricane, however, both the Harris and Trump campaigns are using their travel strategically, trying to increase support with key voting blocs who could decide an election expected to be exceedingly close. Trump has emphasized picking up votes in heavily Hispanic parts of Pennsylvania, including Reading, where he held a rally Wednesday. Harris is out west as her campaign looks to increase support among Hispanic voters there, especially men. Her campaign began a group this week known as 'Hombres con Harris.' Harris' running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, attended an Hombres kickoff event with Arizona Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego, and actor Jaime Camil in Phoenix on Wednesday. Similar gatherings were held elsewhere in Arizona, as well as in Nevada and Pennsylvania. The group is planning to hold upcoming events at Latino-owned small businesses, union halls, barbecues and community events until Election Day. The Harris campaign has also aimed to reach Hispanic voters who may not be closely following the election by doing things like having Julie Chavez Rodriguez, Harris' campaign manager, attend the recent boxing match between Canelo Alvarez and Edgar Berlanga in Las Vegas, and holding events at churches and elsewhere to mark Mexican Independence Day in September. Harris' campaign also announced last month that it was spending $3 million on Spanish-language radio ads and focusing on sport events like baseball games and boxing matches. Meanwhile, former President Barack Obama is also hitting the campaign trail on Thursday night, making his first appearance for Harris at a rally in Pittsburgh. That begins what the Harris campaign says will be a series of campaign stops Obama will make on the vice president's behalf. Biden spent Monday campaigning in suburban Philadelphia, but has made just one joint appearance with Harris, joining her in Pittsburgh on Labor Day, since he announced he was leaving the race and endorsing her in July. Obama was among the key Democrats who were part of a behind-the-scenes effort to encourage Biden, his former vice president, to drop out. Obama and Harris have also been friends for two decades, since he ran for Senate in Illinois. She campaigned for him when he sought the presidency in 2008.	https://apnews.com/article/trump-harris-nevada-michigan-hispanic-voters-milton-2a9db630d1318e78de91efd2df5a16f0	2024-10-10T04:49:01-07:00	
Colombia’s river guardians battle to protect the Atrato amid threats and abandonment	PAIMADO, Colombia (AP) — Sediment and pebbles are all that’s left on the earth around much of Bernardino Mosquera’s small riverside community in northwest Colombia’s Choco region. Just a year ago, healthy shrubs and trees filled this important biodiversity spot teeming with species native to the land. But then illegal miners arrived, using their heavy machinery to dredge the riverbeds for gold. 'It’s just desert here,' said Mosquera. 'Illegal mining affects the ecosystem in every way … it leads to degraded land. There are no trees. The water sources are drying up, it’s polluted by mercury.' Mosquera is a river guardian, a title bestowed upon him and 13 others. The unpaid guardians serve as the eyes and ears of the Atrato River: They liaise with government institutions on environmental and social issues in the face of aggression from armed groups and hope to reverse the devastation they see along the river. But after eight years, they are increasingly disenchanted by the lack of support from institutions and growing threats from armed groups that control the region. Colombia’s constitutional court declared in 2016 that the Atrato River running alongside this 2,500-person town was so important to life, it would have rights equivalent to a human. The region is home to thousands of species, with 25% of its plant and bird species endemic, according to the United Nations Development Programme. The river's legal status was a first for Latin America, and when the guardians were established. 'It’s an unbreakable marriage between its inhabitants and the rivers,' Mosquera, 62, said. 'That’s why we have to defend the Atrato.' Illegal gold mining has become the fastest-growing criminal economy over the past decade in South America. The boom began in Colombia and Peru and expanded to Ecuador, Venezuela and Brazil. In Choco, illegal mining is rife Paimado, like many towns in the Choco region, is an illegal mining hub firmly in the control of the largest criminal organization in the country, known as Gulf Clan. Early each morning, small wooden boats carry plastic gasoline containers to feed the mining machinery dotted along the Atrato, a river that snakes some 750 kilometers (470 miles) through northern Colombian jungles. Dozens of illegal mines pepper the river between Mosquera’s home in Paimado, which lies on Rio Quito, the Atrato River's main tributary, and the state capital Quibdo. Large wooden rafts propped on stilts reach deep into the riverbed to extract material that is sifted through the machine for gold. Deep inside the banks of the river, another type of mining takes place with heavier machinery. It is here that deforestation is glaringly evident. Drone footage taken by The Associated Press shows large patches of empty land which stretch long behind the riverbanks. 'Many people think that because it looks very green there is no deforestation,' said river guardian and agronomist Maryuri Mosquera, 42. High rates of poverty have pushed many into gold mining, work that destroys land and contaminates their river. That destruction then destroys the local economy, making communities even more dependent on mining. Colombia’s human rights ombudsman’s office said in April the government is failing to protect the river, saying 'there is no evidence of any progress' since the river gained personhood. It called on the environment ministry to comply with the 2016 ruling. In a written response, Colombia’s environment ministry said its Minister Susana Muhamad has been coordinating efforts with the Ministry of Defense 'to protect this important ecosystem.' It added that a program will soon begin to work with the communities to restore the Atrato River basin and its tributaries. A community lifeline destroyed The Atrato River has long been an important source of water, food and transport for its rural, mostly Afro-Colombian residents who built communities on the riverbanks. The tiny village of El Arenal along the Atrato is home to river guardian Juan Carlos Palacios, 33, who says that his role is a triumph for the Black communities who fought for the 2016 ruling. 'It makes me feel very sad when I see machinery pass by continually, without any controls. They arrive on our land and we can’t even say anything, because the miners come along with armed actors,' Palacios said. For most of his life, even sometimes now, Palacios has been involved in artisanal gold mining. A short canoe ride to the other side of the river from El Arenal is his mother, bent over with a hoe and a wooden gold sifting pan. This has been her life since she can remember. 'I think that if I stop doing this, I’ll die quickly, because I’m so used to it,' said Ana Palacios Cuesta with a laugh. 'The dredgers have emptied the whole river, so we hardly get anything anymore.' The tiny amounts of gold sediment she collects are sold in the nearby town of Yuto, or in Quibdo, about 40 minutes away. Mercury and arsenic offer the industrial-scale miners a low-tech solution to extract the gold. But they get pumped into the water, poisoning the river and the surrounding lands. The tactic has been killing marine life, changing the natural flow of the river, and further debilitating some of the most vulnerable communities in the country. Palacios, who has a degree in biology, said fish in the river have been 'highly contaminated' by mercury, which gets passed through fish to humans and can cause damage to vital organs. 'Of course we continue to consume them because we have no other option,' he said. Local women and their children stand in the river to wash their dishes and clothes, something only the most rural and needy communities do nowadays over fear of the water’s contamination. Guardians face violence and threats The guardians have a precarious job in an area controlled largely by rebel and criminal armed groups, like leftist guerrillas the National Liberation Army and Gulf Clan. Mining machinery along the banks are overseen by these groups and miners are forced to pay them protection money — known locally as 'vacuna' — to be allowed to operate freely without becoming targets. 'The act of raising awareness and denouncing the situations that the Atrato basin is experiencing means we face certain risks,' guardian Maryuri Mosquera said, especially her guardian colleagues in more rural areas. Guardian Bernardino Mosquera has a bulletproof vest provided by the state after he got multiple death threats over the years, the last one in March. He has been kidnapped by Gulf Clan and had bullet shells placed under his door on several occasions 'as warnings.' He almost quit. 'But I realized that if we pull out of the process, we are giving them strength ... no one is going to want to say what is happening, you’ll end up riddled with bullets,' Mosquera said as the tropical rain lashed the tin roof of his home. 'We must continue to make the process visible. It’s the only way for them (armed groups) to feel that we too are in the territory. So that stopped me and made me carry on ... And here I am.' ___ Follow Steven Grattan on X: @sjgrattan __ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Palestinian officials say an Israeli strike on a Gaza shelter has killed at least 21 people	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — An Israeli strike on a school sheltering displaced people in Gaza killed at least 21 people on Thursday, with the toll likely to rise, Palestinian medical officials said. Israel has continued to strike at what it says are militant targets across the Palestinian enclave even as attention has shifted to its war against Hezbollah in Lebanon and rising tensions with Iran. It launched a large-scale air and ground operation against Hamas in northern Gaza earlier this week. The Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, where the bodies were brought, confirmed the toll from the strike in the central town of Deir al-Balah. It said several other people were wounded in the strike. An Associated Press reporter saw ambulances streaming into the hospital and counted the bodies, many of which arrived in pieces. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. Witnesses said the strike targeted a makeshift post of the Hamas-run police inside the shelter. Israel has repeatedly attacked schools-turned-shelters in Gaza, accusing militants of hiding out there. Hamas has continued to launch attacks on Israeli forces and fire occasional rockets into Israel more than a year after its Oct. 7 attack ignited the war. Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel and rampaged through army bases and farming communities in that attack, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 others. They are still holding around 100 captives, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel’s offensive has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not say how many were fighters but say women and children make up more than half of the fatalities. The war has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced around 90% of its population of 2.3 million people, often multiple times. ___ Find more of AP’s coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-lebanon-hezbollah-10-10-2024-a5e53cdd4fca30be1909506b5c777922	2024-10-10T00:10:39-07:00	
Zelenskyy meeting UK and NATO leaders as he seeks support for Ukraine's peace plan	LONDON (AP) — Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy arrived at 10 Downing St. in London on Thursday for talks with the leaders of Britain and NATO on his 'victory plan' for the war against Russia. Zelenskyy is meeting Prime Minister Keir Starmer and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, before traveling to Paris for talks with President Emmanuel Macron. Zelenskyy says he will also meet the leaders of Germany and Italy this week to discuss the plan. He had been due to present his blueprint at a weekend meeting of Western leaders and defense ministers in Germany, but it has been postponed because U.S. President Joe Biden said he had to stay home to respond to Hurricane Milton’ s landfall in Florida. Zelenskyy said Wednesday he hoped the meeting could be rescheduled soon. The details of Zelenskyy’s plan have been kept quiet but contours have emerged, including the need for fast action on decisions Western allies have been mulling since the full-scale invasion began in 2022. Zelenskyy said Wednesday at a summit in Croatia with leaders of southeastern European states that the plan seeks to strengthen Ukraine 'both geopolitically and on the battlefield' before any kind of dialogue with Russia. 'Weakness of any of our allies will inspire (Russian President Vladimir) Putin,' he said. 'That’s why we’re asking them to strengthen us, in terms of security guarantees, in terms of weapons, in terms of our future after this war. In my view, he (Putin) only understands force.' Kyiv is still awaiting word from Western partners on its repeated requests to use the long-range weapons they provide to hit targets deep inside Russia. While some, including the U.K., are thought to be willing, Biden has held back out of concern it could escalate the conflict. Ukraine’s leader last visited London in July, soon after Starmer’s Labour Party government was elected, when he addressed a meeting of the British Cabinet. Starmer’s spokesman, Dave Pares, said Thursday’s meeting would involve 'broad strategic discussions' on U.K. and allied support for Ukraine during a 'crucial period,' rather than specific decisions.	https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-zelenskyy-europe-allies-c626fb13b60feacfbecf50280bed589b	2024-10-09T23:27:46-07:00	
With roads often blocked by rebels in Congo, boats — the only alternative — have become death traps	GOMA, Congo (AP) — The overcrowded boat that capsized in eastern Congo last week killed eight members of Serge Nzonga’s family along with 70 others. Days later, he was back on the same route that claimed their lives in yet another boat lacking safety measures. Nzonga and hundreds of other passengers, including Associated Press journalists, lined up at the seaport in Goma, eastern Congo’s largest city, getting ready to board a locally made boat bound for Bukavu city on the other side of Lake Kivu, a perilous journey they would rather undertake than travel Congo’s treacherous roads. On Wednesday, as authorities continued to investigate the accident, families of those killed last week protested at the port of Kituku, accusing officials of negligence in failing to address the insecurity in eastern Congo and of delaying rescue operations. The capsizing of overloaded boats is becoming increasingly frequent in this central African nation as more people are abandoning the few available roads for wooden vessels crumbling under the weight of passengers and their goods. The roads are often caught up in the deadly clashes between Congolese security forces and rebels that sometimes block major access routes. Hundreds have already been killed or declared missing in such accidents so far this year. 'This is the only way we can reach our brothers and sisters in the other province of South Kivu,' said Nzonga as his turn to board a locally made boat drew nearer. 'If we don’t take this journey, there is no other route,' he said. 'The road is blocked because of the war and … the roads are not paved in eastern Congo.' In the absence of good roads in this country of more than 100 million, the rivers in Congo have been the only means of transport many here have known — especially in remote areas where passengers usually come from. Among the frequent passengers on the boats and ferries are traders unable to transport their goods along the dangerous roads, some of them spending days or weeks along the rivers. However, several others also board them for various other reasons: It is faster than traveling by road, the roads are in bad shape and families like Nzonga’s can travel at more affordable rates. That leaves boats and ferries frequently overcrowded, and safety measures are hardly implemented, analysts say. The boat that capsized on Congo's Lake Kivu last week was trying to dock just meters away from the port of Kituku when it began to sink, witnesses said. The boat was visibly overcrowded, 'full of passengers (as) it started to lose its balance,' said Francine Munyi, an eyewitness. Authorities often threaten harsh punishments to curb overloading, enforce safety measures and punish corrupt officials, but measures promised to stop the accidents are rarely carried out, analysts say. 'The private sector dominates Lake Kivu … but the boats cannot leave the port without the authorization of the lake commissioner,' said Émile Murhula, an independent analyst, adding that authorities are also supposed to enforce the use of life jackets and remove boats that do not meet the required standards. As the Bukavu-bound boat – named Emmanuel 4 – navigated the waters, the passengers cast worried glances at the lake, many of them without life jackets. Canoes crisscrossed the lake in search of the bodies of victims still missing after the latest accident. At the seaport, dozens of relatives waited patiently for answers that were taking forever to come. Nzonga, the passenger who lost eight relatives, admits it is dangerous to travel without a life jacket. But even those jackets are not provided by the government. 'We’re scared, but it’s the only way we have to get to the other province,' he said. 'I still have to travel, even though we’re used to it (the accidents).' ___ Associated Press journalist Chinedu Asadu in Abuja, Nigeria, contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

The Nobel Prize in literature is being awarded in Stockholm	STOCKHOLM (AP) — After three days of Nobel prizes honoring work in the sciences, the literature award is being announced Thursday by the Nobel Committee at the Swedish Academy. The winner will follow Norwegian writer Jon Fosse, who was honored last year for writing in Nynorsk, one of the two official written versions of the Norwegian language, that prize organizers said gives 'voice to the unsayable.' The literature prize has long faced criticism that it is too focused on European and North American writers of style-heavy, story-light prose. It has also been male-dominated, with just 17 women among its 119 laureates. The last woman to win was Annie Ernaux of France, in 2022. Six days of Nobel announcements opened Monday with Americans Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun winning the medicine prize. Two founding fathers of machine learning — John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton — won the physics prize on Tuesday. On Wednesday, three scientists who discovered powerful techniques to decode and even design novel proteins were awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry. The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced Friday and the economics award on Oct. 14. The prize carries a cash award of 11 million Swedish kronor ($1 million) from a bequest left by the award’s creator, Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel. The laureates are invited to receive their awards at ceremonies on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel’s death. ___ Corder reported from The Hague, Netherlands.	https://apnews.com/article/nobel-literature-prize-e52fdabe9379d351d744e121218bddc5	2024-10-09T22:33:10-07:00	
China will lift 4-year ban on Australian lobster imports, Australia's prime minister says	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — China will resume importing Australian live lobsters by the end of the year, removing the final major obstacle to bilateral trade that once cost Australian exporters more than 20 billion Australian dollars ($13 billion) a year, Australia’s prime minister said Thursday. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese made the announcement after meeting Premier Li Qiang on the sidelines of a Southeast Asian summit in Vientiane, Laos. The ban on lobsters was the last of a series of official and unofficial trade barriers that Beijing has agreed to lift since Albanese’s center-left Labor Party government was elected in 2022. 'I’m pleased to announce that Premier Li and I have agreed on a timetable to resume full lobster trade by the end of this year,' Albanese told reporters. 'This of course will be in time for Chinese New Year and this will be welcomed by the people engaged in the live lobster industry,' he added. Albanese has given assurances that relations with China have been improved without compromising Australian interests. Beijing is unhappy with restrictions Australia has placed on some Chinese investments because of security concerns. 'What’s important is that friends are able to have direct discussions. It doesn’t imply agreement, it doesn’t imply compliance and I’ll always represent Australia’s national interest. That’s what I did today; it was a very constructive meeting,' Albanese said. 'I’m encouraged by the progress that we have made between Australia and China’s relationship in producing stabilization to the benefit of both of our nations and with the objective of advancing peace and security in the region,' Albanese added. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning referred questions about Australian lobsters to trade authorities. 'China stands ready to work with Australia to continue properly resolving issues of each other’s concerns through dialogue and consultation, so as to build more mature and stable bilateral relations for the benefit of the two peoples,' Mao said at a regular media briefing in Beijing. Australian lobster exports to China had been worth AU$700 million ($470 million) in 2019. Beijing ended trade with Australia in 2020 on a range of commodities including lobster, coal, wine, barley, beef and wood as diplomatic relations plumbed new depths. Conservative Prime Minister Scott Morrison had angered Beijing that year by demanding an independent investigation into the origins of and responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. Tom Ryan, a manager at lobster exporter Five Star Seafoods at Port MacDonnell in South Australia state, said he was disappointed that his trade would be the last to resume with China. 'It’s been a long time coming,' Ryan told Australian Broadcasting Corp. of Albanese's announcement. 'Between myself and other people in Port MacDonnell, it’s an absolute relief,' he added. The industry had found new markets for lobster products but at lower profit margins, Ryan said. Li said during a state visit to Australia in June that he had agreed with Albanese to 'properly manage' their nations' differences. Beijing had severed minister-to-minister contacts during the conservatives' nine years in power. ___ Follow AP's Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific	https://apnews.com/article/australia-china-lobsters-trade-laos-6bea24485d2e72a7de9b5aedbcf37c41	2024-10-09T22:03:13-07:00	
Suspected militants shoot police in vehicle in northwest Pakistan, killing 2 officers	PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) — Suspected militants riding on a motorcycle opened fire on a vehicle carrying police officers Thursday in a former stronghold of the Pakistani Taliban, killing two of them and wounding two others, police said. The attack happened in Tank, a city in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan, local police official Sher Afzal said. No group has claimed responsibility, but suspicion is likely to fall on the Pakistani Taliban, known as the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan or TTP, who often target security forces. The TTP are outlawed in Pakistan. They are separate from but a close ally of the Afghan Taliban who control neighboring Afghanistan. The latest violence came a day after at least three people were killed in clashes in the northwestern town of Jamrud between police and supporters of a banned right group Pashtun Protection Movement or PTM, which authorities say supports TTP. The government has also barred PTM from holding rallies in the northwest, allegedly because the demonstrations are against the interests of Pakistan. PTM denies backing the Pakistani Taliban, and tension was growing Thursday after the group vowed to resist the ban on their rallies.	https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-police-killed-northwest-0add0e973471aa6ba6c227bd28f56917	2024-10-09T20:59:34-07:00	
Suspected attacks by Yemen's Houthi rebels target ship in Red Sea	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — A series of suspected attacks by Yemen's Houthi rebels targeted a ship on Thursday in the Red Sea, authorities said. The attack comes as the rebels continue to threaten ships moving through the Red Sea, a waterway that once saw $1 trillion in goods move through it a year, over the ongoing conflicts in the Mideast stemming from the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. A ship in the Red Sea skirting the coast of the East Africa found itself struck first by a projectile that damaged the vessel, but sparked no fire and caused no injuries, the British military's United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center said. The private security firm Ambrey identified the ship as a Liberian-flagged chemical tanker. At least two more projectiles later fell in the waters around the vessel, which was a distance away from Hodeida, the Houthi-controlled port from which many of the rebels' attacks have been launched. The rebels did not immediately claim the attack. However, it can take them hours or even days to acknowledge their assaults. The Houthis have targeted more than 80 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started in October. They seized one vessel and sank two in the campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have included Western military vessels as well. The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the U.K. to force an end to Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran. In Thursday's attack, Ambrey said it 'assessed the vessel to have a strong affiliation with the Houthi targeting profile,' without elaborating.	https://apnews.com/article/red-sea-attacks-yemen-houthi-rebels-israel-hamas-war-961fbf91e97e071011ad3bea9077511a	2024-10-09T20:28:10-07:00	
AP PHOTOS: Human towers rise skyward in Spain's Catalonia as part of cultural pride	TARRAGONA, Spain (AP) — Dozens of people squeeze together, pressing as tight as they can get. The stronger the foundation they build, the less likely their human tower will collapse. As children and others climb, they create eight, nine, even 10 dizzying stories. They tug on sashes wound around torsos, gritting their teeth to keep their backs straight and their legs from buckling. With maximum concentration, they look into each other’s eyes, seeking further support. The tradition of building human towers, or 'castells' in Catalan, dates to the 18th century and forms an essential part of Catalonia’s culture. 'Colles,' or human tower troupes, compete to build the tallest and most complicated towers at festivals often held in village squares across the region in northeastern Spain. For many Catalans, the towers symbolize the pride they feel for their land, language and history. It means they are in it together and, if united, they are capable of amazing feats. As the tower goes up, the ages come down. Graying hair, receding hairlines and the burliest bodies are seen on the ground floor. The increasingly nimble are tasked with creating the final stages. Young men and women, then teenagers, then children ascend in a spidery climb, their arms interlocked, to the very top. The smallest boy or girl, as young as 5 years old, crowns the tower, reaching some 16 meters high (52 feet). Then, as collective strength wavers, the tower often sways. It undoes itself, with each level sliding down the backs of lower ones. Or the tower crashes on the heads and shoulders below. Injuries aren't common, and children wear helmets. Every two years, the most important competition for human towers is held in Tarragona, an old Roman city on the Mediterranean coast. The 'Concurs de Castells' started in 1932. It now invites the 42 best teams to compete. Newcomers and foreigners alike now take part in this practice that's included in UNESCO's list of Intangible Cultural Heritage. Tomoko Sakamoto is from Japan. She, her husband and their two children participate in a human tower troupe. 'It’s changed my life,' she said. 'I am part of Catalan culture and I am proud.' ___ Iain Sullivan in Madrid and Joseph Wilson in Barcelona contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/human-towers-castells-spain-catalonia-0146da4fd9edc44a681acb3944a81fb3	2024-10-09T20:07:00-07:00	
China seeks deeper economic ties with ASEAN at summit talks as South China Sea disputes lurk	VIENTIANE, Laos (AP) — Chinese Premier Li Qiang called for deeper market integration with Southeast Asia on Thursday during annual summit talks, where concerns over Beijing's aggression in the disputed South China Sea was raised. The 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations' meeting with Li followed recent violent confrontations at sea between China and ASEAN members Philippines and Vietnam, that sparked groiwng unease over China's increasingly assertive actions in the disputed waters. Li didn't mention the row in his opening speech at the summit talks but said intensifying trade relations and creating an 'ultra large-scale market' are keys to economic prosperity. 'The global economy is still seeing a sluggish recovery, protectionism is rising and geopolitical turbulence has brought instability and uncertainty to our development,' Li said. 'Strengthening market coordination and synchronization is an important direction for our further cooperation.' ASEAN and China said they expect to conclude negotiations to upgrade their free trade pact next year. Officials said the expanded pact will cover supply chain connectivity, the digital economy and green economy. Since the two sides signed the pact covering a market of 2 billion people in 2010, ASEAN’s trade with China has leaped from $235.5 billion to $696.7 billion last year. China is ASEAN's No. 1 trading partner and its third-largest source of foreign investment — a key reason why the bloc has been muted in its criticisms of Chinese actions in the South China Sea. ASEAN members Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei along with Taiwan have overlapping claims with China, which claims sovereignty over virtually all of the South China Sea. Chinese and Philippine vessels have clashed repeatedly this year, and Vietnam said last week that Chinese forces assaulted its fishermen in the disputed sea. China has also sent patrol vessels to areas that Indonesia and Malaysia claim as exclusive economic zones. Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. made clear to Li during talks Thursday that ASEAN-China cooperation cannot be separated from the sea dispute, according to an ASEAN official who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the discussion. The official said Marcos wants to prioritize negotiations on a code of conduct to govern behavior in the sea to ensure peace. Li responded by saying the South China Sea is 'a shared home' and that China has an obligation to protect its sovereignty, the official said. The Philippines, a longtime U.S. ally, has been critical of other ASEAN countries for not doing more to get China to back away. Talks on the code of conduct have been ongoing for years, hampered by sticky issues including disagreements over whether the pact should be binding. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who arrived in Vientiane on Thursday for the meetings, is expected to raise the issue of China’s aggression in the sea, officials said. The U.S. has no claims but it has deployed navy ships and fighter jets to patrol the waterway and promote freedom of navigation and overflight. China has warned the U.S. not to meddle in the disputes. ASEAN leaders, who held a summit among themselves on Wednesday, also separately met with new Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol before convening an ASEAN Plus Three summit along with China. ASEAN elevated its ties with South Korea to a 'comprehensive strategic partnership' at the summit to boost cooperation. Yoon said the partnership will help both sides 'create a new future together.' Ishiba separately pledged to boost Japan-ASEAN relationship by providing patrol vessels and training on maritime law enforcement, strengthening economic security through financial and other support and bolstering cybersecurity. 'Japan shares principles such as freedom, democracy and the rule of law, and would like to create and protect the future together with ASEAN,' he said. The bloc will also hold individual talks with dialogue partners Australia, Canada, India, the U.S. and the United Nations that will culminate in an East Asia Summit of 18 nations including Russia and New Zealand on Friday. Former ASEAN Secretary-General Ong Keng Yong said that despite challenges in addressing disputes in the South China Sea and the Myanmar civil war, ASEAN's central role in the region is undisputable. 'ASEAN and its diplomatic maneuvers have sustained the relative peace and progress of Southeast Asia to date. ASEAN will continue to be useful in that regard. Big powers cannot do what they wish in the region,' said Ong, who is now deputy chairman of the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. Nearly 6,000 people have been killed and over 3 million displaced in a civil war after the Myanmar army ousted an elected government in 2021. The military has backtracked on an ASEAN peace plan it agreed to in late 2021 and fighting has continued with pro-democracy guerillas and ethnic rebels. Myanmar's top generals have been shut out of ASEAN summits since the military takeover. Thailand will host an informal ASEAN ministerial-level consultation on Myanmar in mid-December as frustration grows in the bloc over the prolonged conflict.	https://apnews.com/article/asean-laos-china-south-china-sea-myanmar-ad1f39ff6d0bc353f07598b06bf214b7	2024-10-09T19:56:59-07:00	
Cambodian fishermen turn to raising eels as Tonle Sap lake runs out of fish	KAMPONG PHLUK, Cambodia (AP) — Em Phat, 53, studies his eel tanks with the intensity of a man gambling with his livelihood. For millennia, fishermen like him have relied on the bounty of the Tonle Sap in Cambodia, Southeast Asia’s largest lake and the epicenter of the world’s most productive inland fishery. But climate change, dams upstream on the Mekong River that sustains the lake, and deforestation in the region have changed everything. There aren't enough fish and living by the lake has become dangerous as storms intensify due to global warming. 'Being a fisherman is hard,' he said. Phat hopes that raising eels — a delicacy in Asian markets like China, Japan and South Korea — will provide a way forward. He raises eels in different tanks: translucent eel eggs bob gently in Small glass aquariums. Voracious glassy larvae swim in plastic tanks. Larger tubs have bicycle tires to provide places for juvenile eels to hide. Raising eels can be profitable but it's risky. Eels are notoriously difficult and expensive to raise. They need constant pure, oxygenated water and special food and are susceptible to diseases. Phat lost many eels when a power cut stopped his oxygen pumps, killing the fish. But he's optimistic about the future. Living on land, instead of on the lake, also means that his wife, Luy Nga, 52, can grow vegetables to eat and sell, so they are making enough money to get by. 'The eels have value and can also be exported to China and other countries in the future,' he said. That fishermen like Phat can no longer rely on the Tonle Sap, literally the 'Great Lake,' for their livelihood reflects how much has changed. The lake used to more than quadruple in size to an area larger than the country of Qatar during the rainy season, inundating native forests and creating the perfect breeding ground for diverse fish to thrive. The 'flood pulse,' a natural process of periodic flooding and droughts in the river system helped make the Mekong Basin the world’s largest freshwater fishery, with nearly 20% of all freshwater fish worldwide caught there, according to the think tank Stimson Center in Washington. More than 3 million people live and fish by the lake: a third of all 17 million Cambodians rely on the fisheries sector and up to 70% of Cambodia’s intake of animal protein is from fish. But dams upstream in China and Laos are cutting the Mekong's flow, weakening that flood pulse. The lakes have been depleted by overfishing and much of the forest surrounding it has been logged or burned for farmland. Cambodian authorities are reluctant to estimate the extent that fish stocks have declined. This year, the flood pulse was delayed by about two months, according to the Mekong Dam Monitor, a research project. In this shattered ecosystem, raising eels or other fish can provide fishermen like Phat with a 'buffer,' said Zeb Hogan, a fish biologist at the University of Nevada who has worked in the region for decades. 'Aquaculture, such as eel farming, is a way for people to take more control over their income source and livelihood,' he said, adding that it also allows them to raise fish that they know will fetch higher prices. Phat is one of more than thousands helped by a program run by the Britain-based nonprofit VSO to boost incomes of people living by Tonle Sap. VSO provides his baby eels and has taught him how to raise them. Eels are in high demand in Cambodia and elsewhere, said Sum Vy, 38, a coordinator at VSO, so they're profitable. When fishermen know how to farm eels and hatch the babies, others can follow. 'Not only can he or she earn the money to support their family, they can share this knowledge and skill with other people,' he said. Expanding aquaculture is helping increase Cambodian exports. Its fish production increased 24-fold in the two decades leading up to 2021 and, unlike its neighbors, most of its fish catch is inland, according to the Food and Agricultural Organization or FAO. Much of it is consumed domestically and exports have grown sluggishly. Earlier this year, the government launched a scheme to improve fish processing technologies and address food safety concerns, hoping to begin exporting more fish to Europe next year. Cambodia has signed trade agreements with China and began shipping frozen eels to Shanghai last year. 'This export will contribute to economic growth, creating jobs for our farmers and fishermen,' Heng Mengty, the export manager of the Cambodian fish exporter told China's official Xinhua news agency. The promised growth can’t come soon enough for Cambodians living in fishing communities around the lake. Some families live in homes that float year round, others on homes built on stilts up to 8-meters-high (26 feet), to keep them above floodwaters during the rainy season. Fishing is the only form of subsistence for many, but signs of decay are evident. Fishing nets catch only very small fish, or worse, nothing at all. Families speak of giant fish that are now rarely seen. The catch is a fraction of what it used to be. Even 10 years ago, Som Lay, a 29-year-old fisherman said, the lake was teeming with fish. But illegal fishing has increased and some families have already given up fishing and are trying to find land where they can grow rice. 'The entire village — my family and others — is facing these difficulties,' he said. ___ Associated Press journalist Sopheng Cheang contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Africans recruited to work in Russia say they were duped into building drones for use in Ukraine	The social media ads promised the young African women a free plane ticket, money and a faraway adventure in Europe. Just complete a computer game and a 100-word Russian vocabulary test. But instead of a work-study program in fields like hospitality and catering, some of them learned only after arriving on the steppes of Russia’s Tatarstan region that they would be toiling in a factory to make weapons of war, assembling thousands of Iranian-designed attack drones to be launched into Ukraine. In interviews with The Associated Press, some of the women complained of long hours under constant surveillance, of broken promises about wages and areas of study, and of working with caustic chemicals that left their skin pockmarked and itching. To fill an urgent labor shortage in wartime Russia, the Kremlin has been recruiting women aged 18-22 from places like Uganda, Rwanda, Kenya, South Sudan, Sierra Leone and Nigeria, as well as the South Asian country of Sri Lanka. The drive is expanding to elsewhere in Asia as well as Latin America. That has put some of Moscow’s key weapons production in the inexperienced hands of about 200 African women who are working alongside Russian vocational students as young as 16 in the plant in Tatarstan’s Alabuga Special Economic Zone, about 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) east of Moscow, according to an AP investigation of the industrial complex. 'I don’t really know how to make drones,' said one African woman who had abandoned a job at home and took the Russian offer. The AP analyzed satellite images of the complex and its internal documents, spoke to a half-dozen African women who ended up there, and tracked down hundreds of videos in the online recruiting program dubbed 'Alabuga Start' to piece together life at the plant. A hopeful journey from Africa leads to ‘a trap’ The woman who agreed to work in Russia excitedly documented her journey, taking selfies at the airport and shooting video of her airline meal and of the in-flight map, focusing on the word 'Europe' and pointing to it with her long, manicured nails. When she arrived in Alabuga, however, she soon learned what she would be doing and realized it was 'a trap.' 'The company is all about making drones. Nothing else,' said the woman, who assembled airframes. 'I regret and I curse the day I started making all those things.' One possible clue about what was in store for the applicants was their vocabulary test that included words like 'factory' and the verbs 'to hook' and 'to unhook.' The workers were under constant surveillance in their dorms and at work, the hours were long and the pay was less than she expected — details corroborated by three other women interviewed by AP, which is not identifying them by name or nationality out of concern for their safety. Factory management apparently tries to discourage the African women from leaving, and although some reportedly have left or found work elsewhere in Russia, AP was unable to verify that independently. A drone factory grows in Tatarstan Russia and Iran signed a $1.7 billion deal in 2022, after President Vladimir Putin invaded neighboring Ukraine, and Moscow began using Iranian imports of the unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs, in battle later that year. The Alabuga Special Economic Zone was set up in 2006 to attract businesses and investment to Tatarstan. It expanded rapidly after the invasion and parts switched to military production, adding or renovating new buildings, according to satellite images. Although some private companies still operate there, the plant is referred to as 'Alabuga' in leaked documents that detail contracts between Russia and Iran. The Shahed-136 drones were first shipped disassembled to Russia, but production has shifted to Alabuga and possibly another factory. Alabuga now is Russia's main plant for making the one-way, exploding drones, with plans to produce 6,000 of them a year by 2025, according to the leaked documents and the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security. That target is now ahead of schedule, with Alabuga building 4,500, said David Albright, a former U.N. weapons inspector who works at the institute. Finding workers was a problem. With unemployment at record lows and many Russians already working in military industries, fighting in Ukraine or having fled abroad, plant officials turned to using vocational students and cheap foreign labor. Alabuga is the only Russian production facility that recruits women from Africa, Asia and South America to make weapons according to experts and the AP investigation. About 90% of the foreign women recruited via the Alabuga Start program work on making drones, particularly the parts 'that don’t require much skill,' he said. Documents leaked last year and verified by Albright and another drone expert detail the workforce growing from just under 900 people in 2023 to plans for over 2,600 in 2025. They show that foreign women largely assemble the drones, use chemicals and paint them. In the first half of this year, 182 women were recruited, largely from Central and East African countries, according to a Facebook page promoting the Alabuga Start program. It also recruits in South America and Asia 'to help ladies to start their career.' Officials held recruiting events in Uganda, and tried to recruit from its orphanages, according to messages on Alabuga's Telegram channel. Russian officials have also visited more than 26 embassies in Moscow to push the program. The campaign gave no reasons why it doesn't seek older women or men, but some analysts suggest officials could believe young women are easier to control. One of the leaked documents shows the assembly lines are segregated and uses a derogatory term referring to the African workers. The factory also draws workers from Alabuga Polytechnic, a nearby vocational boarding school for Russians age 16-18 and Central Asians age 18-22 that bills its graduates as experts in drone production. According to investigative outlets Protokol and Razvorot, some are as young as 15 and have complained of poor working conditions. Surveillance, caustic chemicals — and a Ukrainian attack The foreign workers travel by bus from their living quarters to the factory, passing multiple security checkpoints after a license plate scan, while other vehicles are stopped for more stringent checks, according to the woman who assembles drones. They share dormitories and kitchens that are 'guarded around the clock,' social media posts say. Entry is controlled via facial recognition, and recruits are watched on surveillance cameras. Pets, alcohol and drugs are not allowed. The foreigners receive local SIM cards for their phones upon arrival but are forbidden from bringing them into the factory, which is considered a sensitive military site. One woman said she could only talk to an AP reporter with her manager’s permission, another said her 'messages are monitored,' a third said workers are told not to talk to outsiders about their work, and a fourth said managers encouraged them to inform on co-workers. The airframe worker told AP the recruits are taught how to assemble the drones and coat them with a caustic substance with the consistency of yogurt. Many workers lack protective gear, she said, adding that the chemicals made her face feel like it was being pricked with tiny needles, and 'small holes' appeared on her cheeks, making them itch severely. 'My God, I could scratch myself! I could never get tired of scratching myself,' she said. 'A lot of girls are suffering,' she added. A video shared with AP showed another woman wearing an Alabuga uniform with her face similarly affected. Although AP could not determine what the chemicals were, drone expert Fabian Hinz of the International Institute for Strategic Studies confirmed that caustic substances are used in their manufacture. In addition to dangers from chemicals, the complex itself was hit by a Ukrainian drone in April, injuring at least 12 people. A video it posted on social media showed a Kenyan woman calling the attackers 'barbarians' who 'wanted to intimidate us.' 'They did not succeed,' she said. Workers ‘maltreated like donkeys’ Although one woman said she loved working at Alabuga because she was well-paid and enjoyed meeting new people and experiencing a different culture, most interviewed by AP disagreed about the size of the compensation and suggested that life there did not meet their expectations. The program initially promised recruits $700 a month, but later social media posts put it at 'over $500.' The airframe assembly worker said the cost of their accommodation, airfare, medical care and Russian-language classes were deducted from her salary, and she struggled to pay for basics like bus fare with the remainder. The African women are 'maltreated like donkeys, being slaved,' she said, indicating banking sanctions on Russia made it difficult to send money home. But another factory worker said she was able to send up to $150 a month to her family. Four of the women described long shifts of up to 12 hours, with haphazard days off. Still, two of these who said they worked in the kitchen added they were willing to tolerate the pay if they could support their families. The wages apparently are affecting morale, according to plant documents, with managers urging that the foreign workers be replaced with Russian-speaking staff because 'candidates are refusing the low salary.' Russian and Central Asian students at Alabuga Polytechnic are allowed visits home, social media posts suggest. Independent Russian media reported that these vocational students who want to quit the program have been told they must repay tuition costs. AP contacted the Russian Foreign Ministry and the offices of Tatarstan Gov. Rustam Minnikhanov and Alabuga Special Economic Zone Director General Timur Shagivaleev for a response to the women's complaints but received no reply. Human rights organizations contacted by AP said they were unaware of what was happening at the factory, although it sounded consistent with other actions by Russia. Human Rights Watch said Russia is actively recruiting foreigners from Africa and India to support its war in Ukraine by promising lucrative jobs without fully explaining the nature of the work. Russia’s actions 'could potentially fulfill the criteria of trafficking if the recruitment is fraudulent and the purpose is exploitation,' said Ravina Shamdasani, a spokesperson for the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, noting that Moscow is a party to the U.N. Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime. The AP contacted governments of 22 countries whose citizens Alabuga said it had recruited for the program. Most didn’t answer or said they would look into it. Betty Amongi, Uganda’s Minister for Gender, Labour and Social Development, told AP that her ministry raised concerns with its embassy in Moscow about the Alabuga recruiting effort, particularly over the age of the women, because 'female migrant workers are the most vulnerable category.' The ministry said it wanted to ensure the women 'do not end up in exploitative employment,' and needed to know who would be responsible for the welfare of the Ugandan women while in Russia. Alabuga's Facebook page said 46 Ugandan women were at the complex, although Amongi had said there were none. How accurate are the drones? Bolstered by the foreign recruits, Russia has vastly increased the number of drones it can fire at Ukraine. Nearly 4,000 were launched at Ukraine from the start of the war in February 2022 through 2023, Albright’s organization said. In the first seven months of this year, Russia launched nearly twice that. Although the Alabuga plant's production target is ahead of schedule, there are questions about the quality of the drones and whether manufacturing problems due to the unskilled labor force are causing malfunctions. Some experts also point to Russia’s switching to other materials from the original Iranian design as a sign of problems. An AP analysis of about 2,000 Shahed attacks documented by Ukraine’s military since July 29 shows that about 95% of the drones hit no discernible target. Instead, they fall into Ukraine's rivers and fields, stray into NATO-member Latvia and come down in Russia or ally Belarus. Before July, about 14% of Shaheds hit their targets in Ukraine, according to data analyzed by Albright’s team. The large failure rate could be due to Ukraine's improved air defenses, although Albright said it also could be because of the low-skilled workforce in which 'poor craftsmanship is seeping in,' he said. Another factor could be because Russia is using a Shahed variant that doesn't carry a warhead of 50 kilograms (110 pounds) of explosives. Moscow could be launching these dummy drones to overwhelm air defenses and force Ukraine to waste ammunition, allowing other UAVs to hit targets. Tourism, paintball games and a pitch on TikTok The Alabuga Start recruiting drive relies on a robust social media campaign of slickly edited videos with upbeat music that show African women visiting Tatarstan's cultural sites or playing sports. The videos show them working — smiling while cleaning floors, wearing hard hats while directing cranes, and donning protective equipment to apply paint or chemicals. One video depicts the Polytechnic school students in team-building exercises such as paintball matches, even showing the losing side — labeled as 'fascists' — digging trenches or being shot with the recreational weapons at close range. 'We are taught patriotism. This unites us. We are ready to repel any provocation,' one student says. The videos on Alabuga's social media pages don't mention the plant's role at the heart of Russian drone production, but the Special Economic Zone is more open with Russian media. Konstantin Spiridonov, deputy director of a company that made drones for civilian use before the war, gave a video tour of an Alabuga assembly line in March to a Russian blogger. Pointing out young African women, he did not explicitly link the drones to the war but noted their production is now 'very relevant' for Russia. Alabuga Start's social media pages are filled with comments from Africans begging for work and saying they applied but have yet to receive an answer. The program was promoted by education ministries in Uganda and Ethiopia, as well as in African media that portrays it as a way to make money and learn new skills. Initially advertised as a work-study program, Alabuga Start in recent months is more direct about what it offers foreigners, insisting on newer posts that 'is NOT an educational programme,' although one of them still shows young women in plaid school uniforms. When Sierra Leone Ambassador Mohamed Yongawo visited in May and met with five participants from his country, he appeared to believe it was a study program. 'It would be great if we had 30 students from Sierra Leone studying at Alabuga,' he said afterward. Last month, the Alabuga Start social media site said it was 'excited to announce that our audience has grown significantly!' That could be due to its hiring of influencers, including Bassie, a South African with almost 800,000 TikTok and Instagram followers. She did not respond to an AP request for comment. The program, she said, was an easy way to make money, encouraging followers to share her post with job-seeking friends so they could contact Alabuga. 'Where they lack in labor,' she said, 'that’s where you come in.' ___ Associated Press writers Michael Biesecker in Washington and Jamey Keaten in Geneva contributed to this report.	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-drones-shahed-africans-11602ab837f0ff4635926d884b422185	2024-10-09T19:04:51-07:00	
Taiwan celebrates its National Day holiday against background of Chinese threats	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Taiwan celebrated its National Day holiday Thursday against the background of threats from China, which claims the self-governing island republic as its own territory. The celebration marks the establishment of the Republic of China, which overthrew the Qing Dynasty in 1911 and fled to Taiwan as Mao Zedong’s Communists swept to power on the mainland during a civil war in 1949. Taiwan was run under martial law until transitioning to full democracy in the 1980s and 1990s but maintains the original constitution brought from China and the ROC flag. President Lai Ching-te took office in May, continuing the eight-year rule of the Democratic Progressive Party that rejects China’s demand that it recognize Taiwan is a part of China. The Nationalists adhere to a unification stance that recognizes both sides of the Taiwan Strait as a single nation. Thursday's commemorations were to include speeches by Lai and others, performances in front of the Presidential Office Building in Taipei, including an honor guard, military marching band and overflight by military aircraft, but no display of heavy military equipment as seen in years past. Maintaining its military pressure on Taiwan, China's People's Liberation Army sent 15 planes across the median line in the Taiwan Strait, prompting Taiwan to scramble jets, dispatch ships and activate missile systems.	https://apnews.com/article/taiwan-national-day-c40f5a7f16e9cb1c12f936d489de283a	2024-10-09T17:38:52-07:00	
Stock market today: Asian shares rise after Wall Street rally, and China promises a briefing	TOKYO (AP) — Asian shares mostly rose Thursday, as market optimism got a perk from the record highs set on Wall Street. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 edged up 0.4% in morning trading to 39,439.50. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 rose 0.6% to 8,239.10. South Korea's Kospi added 0.3% to 2,601.66. Hong Kong's Hang Seng jumped 2.4% to 21,127.55, after a previous day of wild swings. Earlier in the week, the index dropped more than 9%, recording its worst loss since the global financial crisis of 2008. The Shanghai Composite surged 2.0% to 3,324.61. After surging on hopes for stimulus to prop up the world’s second-largest economy, Chinese stocks slumped earlier this week on disappointment that more isn’t on the way. One plus was the announcement from China’s Finance Ministry it will hold a briefing Saturday that could provide details on planned government moves. 'There’s still a glimmer of hope that Beijing might swoop in with a fiscal stimulus lifeline in October to reignite growth. In short, the market is hanging in the balance, waiting for the next big move,' said Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management. On Wall Street, the S&amp;P 500 rose 0.7% to top the all-time high it had set last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 431 points, or 1%, to hit its own record, while the Nasdaq composite gained 0.6%. Leading the way were cruise-ship companies, whose customers stand to benefit from the surprisingly strong U.S. job market. Norwegian Cruise Line steamed 10.9% higher after analysts at Citi upgraded its stock and said data suggests growth for the cruise industry 'has real legs' into 2025 and beyond. Carnival rose 7%, and Royal Caribbean Group gained 5.3%. KinderCare Learning rose 8.9% in its debut on the New York Stock Exchange. It has over 2,400 early childhood education centers and before- and after-school sites across the country for kids aged between six weeks and 12 years. They helped offset a 3.4% slump for Boeing. The aerospace giant withdrew a contract offer that would have given striking workers 30% raises over four years following a break down in labor talks. Alphabet also kept the market’s gains in check after the heavyweight stock sank 1.5%. The U.S. Department of Justice is considering asking a federal judge to break up its Google business after its search engine was declared an illegal monopoly. A breakup is one of many possible remedies under review. All told, the S&amp;P 500 rose 40.91 points to 5,792.04. The Dow jumped 431.63 to 42,512.00, and the Nasdaq composite gained 108.70 to 18,291.62. In the oil market, a barrel of Brent crude, the international standard, recovered to rise 34 cents to $73.58 a barrel. It briefly topped $81 early this week. Benchmark U.S. crude gained 34 cents to $76.92 per barrel. Earlier leaps for oil driven by worries about worsening tensions in the Middle East had helped drag the S&amp;P 500 on Monday to its worst loss in a month. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.07% from 4.01% late Tuesday. Treasury yields have swung recently, first sharply downward through the spring and summer and then turning upward in the last week or so. They’ve followed traders’ expectations for what the Federal Reserve is likely to do with overnight interest rates. The central bank has just begun cutting interest rates from a two-decade high, as it widens its focus to include keeping the economy humming instead of just fighting high inflation. That caused the sharp easing of rates through the summer, but recent reports have shown the U.S. economy remains stronger than expected. In currency trading, the U.S. dollar inched down to 149.15 Japanese yen from 149.16 yen. The euro cost $1.0943, up from $1.0945. ___ AP Business Writer Stan Choe contributed.	https://apnews.com/article/stock-market-china-rates-fed-inflation-eed540f0a4a8ca2016f9163fd4b34855	2024-10-09T17:10:06-07:00	
Turkey's navy starts to evacuate its citizens from Beirut as Israel battles Hezbollah	BEIRUT (AP) — Over 2,000 Turkish citizens and some foreign nationals started boarding a Turkish military ship late Wednesday that brought in aid and will take them out of a country being hit by Israeli airstrikes targeting Hezbollah. Zehra Cibbin, an ethnic Arab from the southeastern Turkish city of Mardin who lives in Beirut with her Lebanese husband, got off a bus packed with the other evacuees, her two children in tow and luggage in hand. 'It’s indescribable. They bombed the street below our house. From that moment on, it was over for me, I said I didn’t want to stay in Beirut anymore,' said Cibbin, 46. Cibbin said they decided to leave Beirut out of fear for their lives, putting no thought into what will happen when they arrive in Turkey. She spoke to The Associated Press before getting in line to board the TCG Bayraktar amphibious landing vessel, which along with the TCG Sancaktar will take on evacuees. They are part of a six-ship convoy including escorts that set sail from the southern Turkish port of Mersin early Wednesday, transported 300 tons of humanitarian supplies, including food, hygiene kits, kitchenware, tents, beds and blankets. Besides the Turkish citizens, people from Bulgaria, Romania and Kazakhstan were among those who applied to evacuate on the ships. Officials did not provide numbers. The Associated Press was the only non-government media invited aboard the ships to cover the evacuation operation. 'Israel’s aggression has severely impacted Lebanon and our brothers here,' said Turkish Ambassador to Lebanon Ali Baris Ulusoy, standing in front of the Bayraktar. 'We are carrying out an operation today with two aims: to provide humanitarian aid to our Lebanese brothers and to ensure the safe return of our citizens who are in a difficult situation.' Ulusoy said. Hundreds lined up before the Bayraktar as Turkish soldiers and sailors checked the evacuees’ passports and their luggage was examined by metal detectors and drug-sniffing dogs before they were allowed to board Another Turkish citizen waiting with her family was Abir Gokcimen, who said she left her extended family and husband in Beirut and hopes the war that spread to Lebanon will end soon. She hopes to come back to Lebanon as soon as the danger passes. The journey back to Mersin is expected to take about 10 hours. Turkey's government plans to organize more sea evacuations if necessary and is contemplating charter flights to repatriate citizens. Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, the day after Hamas’ surprise attack into Israel ignited the war in Gaza. Hezbollah and Hamas are both allied with Iran, and Hezbollah says its attacks are aimed at aiding the Palestinians. Israel has carried out airstrikes in response and the conflict steadily escalated, erupting into a full-fledged war last month. Israel has inflicted a punishing wave of blows against Hezbollah in recent weeks and says it will keep fighting until tens of thousands of displaced Israeli citizens can return to their homes in the north. More than 1,300 people have been killed in Lebanon and over a million displaced since the fighting escalated in mid-September. Earlier on Wednesday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan ramped up his rhetoric against Israel during his party’s first meeting of the new legislative year, declaring that Turkey 'has more than enough power to thwart expansionist ambitions' of Israel and doubling down on his claims that Israel would target Turkey after Gaza and Lebanon. ___ AP journalist Suzan Fraser contributed from Ankara. ___ Follow AP's coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/mideast-wars	https://apnews.com/article/mideast-wars-turkey-lebanon-israel-evacuations-cea598e62da5a649095d98e13f84a34a	2024-10-09T16:08:19-07:00	
Climate solution: Form Energy secures $405M to speed development of long-awaited 100-hour battery	Form Energy, a company that is beginning to produce a longer-lasting alternative to lithium batteries, hit a milestone Wednesday with an announcement of $405 million in funding. The money will allow Form to speed up manufacturing at its first factory in Weirton, West Virginia and continue research and development. Manufacturing long-duration energy storage at a commercial scale is seen as essential for lowering carbon emissions that are causing climate change, because it makes clean energy available when the sun isn’t shining or the wind isn’t blowing. 'I’m incredibly proud of how far our team has come in scaling our iron-air battery technology,' Mateo Jaramillo, CEO of Form Energy, said via email. Investment company T. Rowe Price led the funding. GE Vernova, a spin-off of General Electric’s energy businesses, and several venture capital firms were also involved. 'With this new funding ... we’re ready to accelerate multi-day battery deployments to meet the rising demand for a cleaner, and more reliable grid. I’m grateful for our team’s hard work and the trust our partners have placed in us as we push toward our mission of building energy storage for a better world.' Lithium batteries typically last four hours. Form is one of many companies pursuing entirely different chemistries. Its batteries use iron, water and air and are able to store energy for 100 hours, meaning if they work at scale, they could bridge a period of several days without sunlight or wind. Iron is also one of the most abundant elements on Earth, which the company says helps make this technology affordable and scalable. In collaboration with Great River Energy, the company broke ground on its first commercial battery installation in Cambridge, Minnesota in August. It's expected to come online in 2025 and will store extra energy that can be used during times of higher electricity demand. Other Form Energy batteries in Minnesota, Colorado and California are expected to come online next year. There are projects in New York, Georgia and Virginia set for 2026. To date, Form Energy has raised more than $1.2 billion from investors. _____ The last line of this story has been corrected to reflect that the $1.2 billion raised so far is only from investors, not from any government entities. ____ The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Ratan Tata, the former chairman of Indian conglomerate Tata Sons, dies at age 86	NEW DELHI (AP) — Ratan Tata, a former chairman of Indian conglomerate Tata Sons, died at a Mumbai hospital on Wednesday night. He was 86. Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran confirmed Tata’s death and described him in a statement as his 'friend, mentor, and guide.' He did not provide a cause of death. Tata was admitted this week to the Breach Candy Hospital in south Mumbai, the city where he lived. Soon after he was hospitalized, Tata issued a statement on Monday saying there was no cause for concern regarding his health and he was undergoing checkups for age-related medical conditions. Prime Minister Narendra Modi described Tata as a visionary leader, and a compassionate and an extraordinary human being. 'He provided stable leadership to one of India’s oldest and most prestigious business houses. At the same time, his contribution went far beyond boardrooms,' Modi said on X. 'Tata endeared himself to several people, thanks to his humility, kindness and an unwavering commitment to making our society better,' Modi said in his tributes, referring to his philanthropy work. Industrialist Harsh Goenka called him a 'titan.' Google CEO Sundar Pichai, said Ratan Tata left behind an extraordinary business and philanthropic legacy and he was instrumental in mentoring and developing modern business leadership in India. 'My last meeting with Ratan Tata at Google, we talked about the progress of Waymo and his vision was inspiring to hear,' Pichai said on X. 'He deeply cared about making India better,' he said. Mukesh Ambani, chairman and managing director of Reliance Industries, said, 'It is a very sad day for India and India Inc. Ratan Tata’s passing away is a big loss, not just to the Tata Group, but to every Indian.' 'With him gone, all we can do is to commit to emulating his example,' Anand Mahindra, chairman of the Mahindra Group, said on X. Tata received the Padma Bhushan, one of India’s most distinguished civilian awards, in 2000 and ``Padma Vibhushan' in 2008, Tata Group is a sprawling collection of nearly 100 companies, including the country’s largest automaker, the largest private steel company and a leading outsourcing firm. The companies employ more than 350,000 people worldwide. In June 2008, Tata bought Jaguar and Land Rover from Ford for $2.3 billion. Tata pioneered commercial aviation in India when it launched an airline in 1932 that later became Air India. The government later took it over. Tata Group bought state-owned Air India in 2021. It also started a full-service carrier, Vistara, with Singapore Airlines, but recently merged it with Air India. Tata companies include Tata Steel, Tata Motors, Tata Power and the information technology company Tata Consultancy Services. In 2009, the company surprised the automobile industry by launching Tata Nano, a tiny vehicle with a rear engine costing about 100,000 rupees (then $2,000). Publicized as a 'People’s Car,' it could seat up to five adults. Ratan Tata had said it would provide a 'safe, affordable, all-weather form of transport' to millions of middle- and lower-income Indian consumers. However, due to the low sales of the tiny car, the company stopped its production in 2018. Ratan Tata graduated from Cornell University with a bachelor’s degree in architecture. He joined the Tata group in 1961 and succeeded J.R.D. Tata as chairman of Tata Sons upon the latter’s retirement in 1991. In December 2012, Tata retired as chairman of the Tata Sons. He briefly served as interim chairman beginning Oct. 2016, following the ouster of his successor, Cyrus Mistry. He returned to retirement in 2017 when Natarajan Chandrasekaran was appointed chairman of the Tata Group.	https://apnews.com/article/india-ratan-tata-death-06f48744f603ae3797e4f5df395fdd6d	2024-10-09T10:06:11-07:00

Saudi Arabia loses bid for a seat on UN's premier human rights body	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Saudi Arabia was defeated for a seat in the U.N.’s premier human rights body Wednesday after a campaign by rights groups urging the world body's members to reject its bid. The 193-member General Assembly elected 18 new members to serve on the 47-nation Human Rights Council, which allocates seats to regional groups to ensure geographical representation. The Geneva-based council reviews the human rights records of all countries periodically, appoints independent investigators to examine and report on issues like torture and situations in countries like North Korea, Iran and Myanmar, and sends fact-finding missions to investigate rights violations, including in Ukraine. It was created in 2006 to replace a human rights commission discredited because of some members’ poor rights records. But the new council soon came to face similar criticism, including that countries sought seats to protect themselves and their allies. This year, the Asia-Pacific group had the only contested slate in the election, with six candidates for five seats. Thailand received 177 votes, Cyprus and Qatar 167 votes, South Korea 161 votes, Marshall Islands 124 votes and Saudi Arabia 117 votes. Before the vote, Louis Charbonneau, U.N. director at Human Rights Watch, called Saudi Arabia 'unfit to serve on the Human Rights Council.' He pointed to the rights group’s documentation of Saudi border guards opening fire and likely killing hundreds of Ethiopian migrants and asylum seekers trying to cross the Yemen-Saudi border in 2022 and 2023, and the lack of accountability for the 2018 killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. 'Governments that commit crimes against humanity or similar atrocities and ensure impunity for those responsible shouldn’t be rewarded with seats on the U.N.’s top human rights body,' Charbonneau said. Saudi Arabia’s U.N. Mission didn't immediately respond to calls and an email seeking comment. A letter sent last year by Saudi Arabia’s mission to the U.N. in Geneva said that it 'categorically refutes' allegations that the kingdom carries out any 'systematic' killings on the border. Human Rights Watch and other groups also criticized other candidates. United Nations Watch in Switzerland, Human Rights Foundation in the United States and the Raoul Wallenberg Center for Human Rights in Canada called for the General Assembly to oppose Qatar, Bolivia, Congo and Ethiopia, declaring them 'unqualified' because of poor rights records. But all the candidates from other regions where there were no contested slates were elected. The 18 countries will serve three-year terms starting on Jan. 1, 2025. The Africa group’s Benin, Congo, Ethiopia, Gambia and Kenya won seats. So did the Latin America and Caribbean group’s candidates Bolivia, Colombia and Mexico and the Central and Eastern Europe group’s candidates, the Czech Republic and North Macedonia. The three candidates for the so-called Western and others group known as WEOG also won easy election — Iceland, Spain and Switzerland — after the United States announced in late September that it wouldn’t seek a second consecutive term. U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters then that the Biden administration was engaged with its allies 'about the best way to move forward' and said Iceland, Spain and Switzerland would be able to represent American interests and values.	https://apnews.com/article/united-nations-saudi-arabia-human-rights-council-2276e8bce8a1c5de838d250aa968bd64	2024-10-09T08:09:37-07:00	
UN tribunal orders ex-official to repay $58.8 million lost in bad deals while getting perks	UNITED NATIONS (AP) — A U.N. tribunal has ordered a former high-ranking official to repay the United Nations $58.8 million lost in deals he made with a British businessman who showered him with interest-free loans, a Mercedes for his wife and perks for his sons. The three-judge United Nations Dispute Tribunal ruled that evidence 'clearly and convincingly' shows that Vitaly Vanshelboim’s misconduct 'caused massive financial losses' by the U.N. Office for Project Services, which says it provides infrastructure, procurement and project management services and is known as UNOPS. The Geneva-based tribunal said last week that Vanshelboim facilitated multiple financial deals between the U.N. office and British businessman David Kendrick focusing on renewable energy, sustainable housing and the oceans. At the same time, the tribunal said Vanshelboim entered into a series of private arrangements with Kendrick and his businesses stretching back to 2017 — which he never disclosed to the U.N. as required — and 'obtained direct financial and material benefits for himself and his family in the amount of at least $3,133,186.10.' Secretary-General Antonio Guterres 'is pleased by this judgment,' U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Tuesday. 'The U.N. continues to pursue recovery of the funds through other avenues,' he said. 'We are fully committed to ensuring criminal accountability for crimes that may involve U.N. personnel,' he said, adding it would cooperate with national authorities on any investigations. Dujarric did not elaborate. Vanshelboim's lawyer, George Irving, said in an email Wednesday that his client is appealing the decision, and declined to comment. Emails sent to three companies that the tribunal says are connected to Kendrick were not immediately returned, and his previous lawyers in London said he was no longer a client. Other contact information for Kendrick could not be found. The New York Times first reported the ruling. Vanshelboim, a Ukrainian, had been an assistant secretary-general, serving either as UNOPS deputy executive director or director of its sustainable infrastructure impact investments program. He was fired in January 2023 following an internal investigation. The investments by UNOPS, which lost millions of dollars, became public in 2022 with media reports followed by the resignation of Grete Faremo, a former Norwegian minister of justice and public security, as the head of Copenhagen-based UNOPS. The Dispute Tribunal was ruling on Vanshelboim’s appeal of the fine on his dismissal of 12 months' salary and an order for him to pay the U.N. over $63.6 million in losses incurred from the deals, with his U.N. pension withheld until the sum was paid. The judges ruled that Vanshelboim’s failure to disclose any of his financial dealings with Kendrick constituted 'blatant misconduct' and said he 'committed fraud against the organization by leading it into multiple business partnerships with the Kendrick entities, with which he engaged in undisclosed and unauthorized outside activities.' The judgment said Vanshelboim was tasked with identifying potential partners and that UNOPS allocated money 'with the specific intention to develop projects that would attract private investors.' The judges said Vanshelboim did not disclose that his wife was being paid by Kendrick for services, including helping the businessman locate, purchase and renovate an apartment in Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv. Vanshelboim did not disclose that in July 2017 he entered into a tennis sponsorship agreement with Kendrick for his youngest son. The U.N. said the amount was $1.2 million, which Vanshelboim called 'grossly exaggerated.' Nonetheless, the judges said when Vanshelboim's son was told what Kendrick was going to pay him, he wrote: 'this is insane, how is this possible. I’m not even a good tennis player yet.' In reply, his father wrote part 'of my job is to make insane things happen.' The judgment also revealed that Kendrick granted Vanshelboim 'an interest-free revolving loan facility' for five years, with a limit of $500,000 per year and a total cap of $2 million. It said Vanshelboim used Kendrick’s credit cards for his personal expenses between October 2018 and December 2020. In addition, Kendrick paid for repairs to Vanshelboim's property in Mamaroneck, New York, and for custom furniture and home accessories — half for his apartment in Kyiv and half for his son’s apartment, the judgment said. Vanshelboim also purchased a Mercedes Benz luxury vehicle for his wife with funds from Kendrick and his entities, it said. The tribunal said Vanshelboim 'misled the organization by both omitting his blatant conflict of interest with Mr. Kendrick and 'pushing’ UNOPS to enter into highly risky deals with the Kendrick entities, while minimizing concerns and concealing relevant information.' It said he can be held responsible for $58.8 million, the amount that UNOPS lost, minus nearly $4.83 million in interest and fees that it said were less clear. 'However, he may seek contribution elsewhere from any others deemed responsible as well,' the tribunal said.	https://apnews.com/article/un-official-misconduct-tribunal-ruling-1607271b8999dee627c96d62f095d8e4	2024-10-09T07:13:05-07:00	
The Latest: Hurricane Milton threatens to overshadow presidential campaigning	Hurricane Milton is threatening to overshadow presidential campaigning as it menaces Florida. The storm has already scrambled Donald Trump's schedule. He put off a virtual event Tuesday night focused on health care and postpone a Univision town hall in Miami. He was in Pennsylvania on Wednesday. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris denounced the misinformation and disinformation surrounding the federal response to Hurricane Helene, which hit last week and killed more than 220 people. Both singled out Trump as driving much of the falsehoods. Harris plans to head to Nevada and Arizona on Thursday. She spent Tuesday in New York taping interviews on ABC’s 'The View,' with radio personality Howard Stern and on 'The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024. Here’s the latest: Trump talks about Hurricane Milton Trump says he is praying for the people of Florida as Hurricane Milton begins lashing the state. Speaking at a rally in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Trump says he wants to 'send our love to everyone in Florida. They’re going through a big one tonight.' Trump went on to say that he was 'praying for' those in the storm’s path and 'asking God to keep them all safe.' 'I’ve never seen a hurricane like that. So often you know, they talk about it and they talk talk talk because they want you to watch. This is the real deal. This is a bad one,' he said. He added that many of the states expected to be impacted have Republican governors whom he predicted would 'do a phenomenal job.' Walz talks about Hurricane Milton Campaigning in Arizona, where early voting kicked off on Wednesday, Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz, talked about Hurricane Milton moving toward Florida and said, 'Those are Americans. Those are our neighbors. Those are our family members. Those are our friends.' Walz, the Minnesota governor, called unifying across party lines in the face of natural disasters 'critical.' 'It’s not about politics. It’s about basic human decency,' Walz said. 'It’s about leadership and character.' Trump insults Harris at Pennsylvania rally Trump is continuing to insult Harris at a rally in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and says he has no interest in stopping, even if turns some voters off. 'I don’t want to be nice,' Trump said at his first of two rallies of the day in the pivotal battleground state. 'You know, somebody said, ‘You should be nicer. Women won’t like it.’ I said, ’I don’t care.' 'The women want safety and the women want to have a country they can be proud of, I think,' he says. Trump, as usual, is casting Harris as 'an incompetent person,' calling her 'grossly incompetent' and 'totally ill-quipped to do the job of being President of the United States' He also criticized the hosts of 'The View,' where Harris appeared on Tuesday. He called one of the women hosts 'dumber than Kamala. She’s a dummy,' he said. 'That is one dumb woman. Sorry. I’m sorry, women, she’s a dummy.' In-person voting has started in Arizona Early in-person voting has started in Arizona, making it the first of this year’s presidential battleground states where all residents can cast a ballot at a traditional polling place ahead of Election Day. The start of in-person voting on Wednesday in the closely contested state also is drawing the presidential tickets. Both campaigns scheduled visits here this week. Each of Arizona’s 15 counties is required to open at least one site for in-person voting, which runs until the Friday before the Nov. 5 general election. In-person voting begins next week in four more presidential swing states — Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina and Nevada. Marjorie Taylor Greene's suggestions that Democrats control the weather is ‘beyond ridiculous,’ Biden says President Joe Biden is calling 'beyond ridiculous' suggestions by a Republican congresswoman that Democrats are controlling the weather, and might even be directing especially strong storms toward conservative parts of the country. During a briefing at the White House on federal preparations for Hurricane Milton, Biden denounced widespread misinformation about the federal assistance that’s available to victims. He called out Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene by name, saying she was suggesting 'the federal government is literally controlling the weather. We’re controlling the weather. It’s beyond ridiculous. It’s gotta stop.' The president referenced Greene’s comments again later in the briefing, calling them 'off the wall.' 'It’s like out of a comic book,' Biden said Biden discusses FEMA's efforts President Joe Biden has told the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, 'You’re doing a hell of a job.' Biden made the comment to FEMA chief Deanne Criswell during a virtual briefing at the White House with federal authorities bracing for Hurricane Milton’s making landfall in Florida. It was meant as a compliment, but it immediately recalled then-President George W. Bush telling his FEMA director, Michael Brown, 'Brownie, you’re doing a heck of a job.' Bush said that before the extent of the mismanaged federal response to 2005’s Hurricane Katrina had become clear and it later long haunted him. South Dakota kicks 273 people off its voter rolls with voting underway South Dakota’s top elections official has removed hundreds of people from the state’s voter rolls even with voting already underway. Republican Secretary of State Monae Johnson says the move was necessary to defend the integrity of the election. But critics say it violates a federal law and could disenfranchise valid voters who are naturalized U.S. citizens. The American Civil Liberties Union of South Dakota has called for the 273 voters to be reinstated. South Dakota was one of the first states to begin early voting for the November general election. Absentee voting began Sept. 20. Harris warns against price gouging Vice President Kamala Harris warned against jacking up prices on Americans dealing with back-to-back hurricanes. 'Those evacuating before Hurricane Milton or recovering from Hurricane Helene should not be subject to illegal price gouging or fraud — at the pump, airport, or hotel counter,' she said in a statement on Wednesday. Harris said the federal government is tracking allegations and 'will hold those taking advantage of the situation accountable.' President Joe Biden made a similar demand Tuesday. 'I’m calling on the airlines and other companies to provide as much service as possible to accommodate evacuations and not to engage in price gouging, to just do it on the level,' he said at the White House. Biden says Congress needs to step up after Hurricane Helene President Joe Biden says that the destruction from Hurricane Helene is going to cost billions of dollars that victims will need quickly and that 'Congress better be ready to step up to help.' Biden made the comments in excerpts of his interview recorded Tuesday with theGiro. The excerpts were released as Hurricane Milton threatens to unleash new devastation in Florida. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, who replaced him at the top of the Democratic Election Day ticket, have previously criticized former President Donald Trump, now the Republican nominee, for spreading false information about the federal response to Helene. In the interview excerpts, Biden says that, 'A lot of folks are out there spreading lies about what we are not doing, that things are not going well. That we are not responding.' He responded, 'We’ve been completely responsive, and we’ve been ahead of the game.' Trump schedules rally in New York for end of October Donald Trump is returning to New York in the race’s final stretch, scheduling a rally at the city’s iconic Madison Square Garden stadium. Trump is planning his event for Oct. 27, kicking off the final week of campaigning, according to a campaign official familiar with the plans who spoke on condition of anonymity before a formal announcement. It will be Trump’s second rally in the city he grew up in following a stop in the South Bronx in May. Trump has claimed he believes he can win New York, even though it is an overwhelmingly Democratic state and the city even more so. But such an event is likely to draw outsized media attention. The former president is also campaigning this week in other Democratic states, including California and Colorado. — By Jill Colvin	https://apnews.com/article/harris-trump-election-2024-b635227719e4f237fe74b72ccfef1c26	2024-10-09T05:48:34-07:00	
The death toll in a gang attack on a small Haitian town rises to 115, a local official says	PONT-SONDÉ, Haiti (AP) — The death toll in a brutal gang attack last week on a small town in central Haiti has risen to 115, a local official told The Associated Press on Wednesday. The attack on residents of Pont-Sondé on Oct. 3 was one of the biggest massacres that Haiti has seen in recent history. Myriam Fièvre, mayor of the nearby city of Saint-Marc, said Wednesday that the toll had risen to 115 and would likely keep rising because authorities are still looking for bodies and haven’t been able to access certain areas of the town. 'We are working to make sure that the population is protected,' she said in a phone interview. The U.N. had previously said that at least 70 people were killed last week when the Gran Grif gang invaded the town in the central Artibonite region. The victims included babies, young mothers and the elderly, with the gang approaching Pont-Sondé via canoes to catch residents by surprise, according to a local human rights group. Survivors have questioned why authorities did not do anything to stop the attack since the gang had warned in a video posted on social media that it planned to target Pont-Sondé. A day after the attack, officials replaced the police commissioner who oversees the Artibonite region, which has seen a surge of gang violence in recent years, with at least 20 criminal groups operating in the area, according to the U.N. More than 6,200 survivors have fled Pont-Sondé and temporarily settled in the coastal city of Saint-Marc and surrounding areas. A majority of them are staying with relatives, but more than 750 others have nowhere to go and are sleeping on the floors of a church, a school and a public plaza in Saint-Marc, according to the U.N.’s International Organization for Migration. As Saint-Marc struggles with the sudden influx of people, Fièvre warned that the Gran Grif gang is infiltrating nearby communities after attacking Pont-Sondé. Haiti’s National Human Rights Defense Network has said the gang was angry that a local self-defense group was trying to limit gang activity in Pont-Sondé and prevent it from profiting off a makeshift road toll it had recently established nearby. Gran Grif has about 100 members and has been accused of crimes including murder, rape, robberies and kidnappings. It was formed after former legislator Prophane Victor began arming young men nearly a decade ago to secure his election and control of the area, according to the U.N Victor and the Gran Grif leader, Luckson Elan, were sanctioned by the U.S. last month. Elan also was sanctioned by the U.N. Security Council, which noted that Gran Grif 'is the largest and most powerful' gang in Artibonite, committing nine mass kidnappings from October 2023 to January 2024, including that of 157 people. ___ Sanon reported from Port-au-Prince, Haiti	https://apnews.com/article/haiti-gang-attack-pontsonde-gran-grif-1a45faafb929a605f30af4efd8454aeb	2024-10-09T05:11:29-07:00	
Alfonso Cuarón and Cate Blanchett made a television series. 'Disclaimer' is already a triumph	VENICE, Italy (AP) — 'Disclaimer' pulls the rug out from the audience before they’ve had the chance to get settled. There’s no building of empathy for its central character, Cate Blanchett’s Catherine Ravenscroft. There’s no luxuriating in her banal every day, at work or in her plush London home with her snobbish husband (Sacha Baron Cohen) and directionless, resentful adult son (Kodi Smit-McPhee). All we know at the beginning of the seven-part series, which begins rolling out on Apple TV+ Friday, is that she’s an acclaimed documentary filmmaker who is being feted by Christiane Amanpour. But almost immediately her life starts to spiral when she receives an anonymous, self-published book about a young mother on vacation in Italy with her toddler son that’s shockingly familiar. The woman in the book meets a young man who later drowns while trying to save her son. When the police question her, she denies knowing him and returns to London. It’s a memory that Catherine has long kept buried and secret but has now emerged in spectacularly embarrassing, reputation-destroying fashion along with a batch of intimate, provocative photos that the young man, Jonathan (Louis Partridge) took the night before. 'Disclaimer' throws you into the fire; And like everyone else in the show, from strangers reading the book to Catherine’s husband, you start making assumptions about and judging her. Not even Blanchett was immune reading the script. She wondered: Is this woman awful? 'I was shocked at the layers of judgment that I transposed on the character,' Blanchett said. 'The challenge and agony of playing a character like this is that the crisis happens as soon as you meet her. We know nothing about her, only what people are saying about her.' Told in seven chapters, the psychological thriller comes from Oscar-winning director Alfonso Cuarón who read Renée Knight’s book before he’d even made 'Roma.' The filmmaker had never dabbled in longform before, but soon realized while writing the script that it was the only way to tell it in a satisfying way. Instead of getting hung up on the ins-and-outs of making a television show, he decided he would just do it his way: Like a film, or, rather, seven films. After all, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, David Lynch and Krzysztof Kieślowski had done it too. Cuarón had written Catherine with only Blanchett in mind, an actor he knew had the incredible range and sophistication required by the role. He teased that he was also jealous of his friends Alejandro Iñárritu and Guillermo del Toro, who had already had the privilege of directing (and raving about) her. What he didn’t expect, and was pleasantly surprised about, was her complete and total commitment as a producer, even as the shoot stretched on to nearly a year. 'I enjoy collaboration,' Blanchett said. 'I’m interested in the whole thing. And I think you have to know when you are going to be useful and when you need to just sit back and be quiet.' Sometimes, Cuarón said, he’d be on board with her suggestions. Other times he chose a different path and usually regretted it. But they consulted on everything from the smallest details (like prop placement) to the biggest, including the script and casting Kevin Kline as Stephen Brigstocke, the father of the young man Catherine met so many years ago. He’s recently lost his wife too, has retired from his job and has nothing but time to stew about how his happy life became so tragic. Revenge is on his mind. The series plays with form and storytelling, with flashbacks, different perspectives, timelines and narrators dolling out information. Amanpour at the outset, in what is meant to be complimentary to Catherine, frames the whole thing aptly: 'Beware of narrative and form. Their power can bring us closer to the truth, but they can also be a weapon with a great power to manipulate.' In that spirit, Cuarón’s longtime cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki even suggested bringing in another director of photography, Bruno Delbonnel, to add a different visual element as well. Don’t worry if that sounds like you need a film degree to recognize or appreciate the distinction between a Lubezki or a Delbonnel shot. 'It’s not about noticing,' Cuarón said. 'It’s about the experience and following different narratives. We try to approach each one of these narratives with a different language.' 'Disclaimer' debuted like a film too, at the Venice Film Festival last month. Though the festival often hosts auteur-driven series alongside the feature films, they’re not often discussed in the same breath as the competition slate of Oscar hopefuls. 'Disclaimer' hit differently, though. In a lineup that had all forms of ambitious cinematic fare from modern masters, some were even calling the show 'the best film of the festival.' Audiences were shown episodes one through four one day, and the final three on the next. While Cuarón welcomes viewers to manage their own viewing schedule, whether it’s as they drop on Apple TV+ (two episodes on Oct. 11, two on Oct. 18, and one every Friday following) waiting to watch in two batches, divided up as they were in Venice, isn’t a bad idea either. The main thing, Blanchett and Cuarón agree, is that attention is key. Also, it’s something you might find yourself wanting to watch again after the finale airs on Nov. 8. 'Something we talked about was the hope that people went back and watched it again and have an entirely different perspective on things that we take for granted,' Blanchett said. Cuarón went a step further: 'A second view should give you a completely different reading than the first view.'	https://apnews.com/article/cate-blanchett-alfonso-cuaron-series-disclaimer-dad35604feabca8075575d4137b746a0	2024-10-09T03:50:59-07:00	
Germany's economy is on track to shrink for a second straight year	BERLIN (AP) — Germany's government said Wednesday that the country's economy, Europe's biggest, is on track to shrink for a second consecutive year — underlining the unpopular administration's troubles as it heads into a difficult election year. The new forecast that gross domestic product will shrink by 0.2% this year compares with the government's prediction in April of 0.3% growth and brings it into line with economists, who also have forecast a slight contraction. The German economy shrank by 0.3% in 2023. The government forecast growth of 1.1% next year and 1.6% in 2025. Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck, who is also the economy minister, said that the German economy hasn't seen powerful growth since 2018 as the country's own structural problems have been joined by wider global challenges. 'In the middle of the crises, Germany and Europe are squeezed between China and the U.S., and must learn to assert themselves,' he said in a statement. Habeck argued that the government has tackled many of Germany's homemade problems — securing its energy supply, speeding up planning procedures, trimming bureaucracy and trying to address a shortage of skilled workers. The German Chamber of Commerce and Industry said that such measures need to be implemented quickly and more reforms are required to encourage investment. Its chief executive, Martin Wansleben, said that Germany has only once before had two successive years of recession — in 2002 and 2003, when the government at the time launched a series of welfare state reforms — and that GDP is only half a percentage point above its level before the COVID-19 pandemic. 'There has never yet been such a prolonged phase of weakness in the German economy,' he said. Chancellor Olaf Scholz's three-party coalition government has seen its popularity plunge over nearly three years in office. It has become notorious for constant infighting, for instance over next year's budget. The center-right opposition leads polls before a national election scheduled for September, and the far-right Alternative for Germany also has performed strongly in recent state and European Parliament elections.	https://apnews.com/article/germany-economy-gdp-recession-government-a4d30f2e398d12afbd793d69c5ac76de	2024-10-09T03:35:04-07:00	
Zelenskyy will present his Ukraine 'victory plan' to Western leaders but Biden meeting is postponed	DUBROVNIK, Croatia (AP) — Ukraine's president on Wednesday said he intends to present his 'victory plan' to Western leaders this week, but a weekend meeting to discuss it has been postponed as U.S. President Joe Biden said he had to stay home to respond to Hurricane Milton’ s landfall in Florida. Speaking at a summit in Croatia with leaders of southeastern European states, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he hopes his meeting with Biden at the U.S. Ramstein Air Base in Germany, originally scheduled for Saturday, will be rescheduled soon. That meeting was meant to include about 20 Western leaders and defense ministers. 'We will present our victory plan in detail there, the same as we presented it in the White House,' Zelenskyy said. He added that he now planned to meet with the leaders of Britain, France, Italy and Germany this week to present the plan. Zelenskyy said the plan is about strengthening Ukraine 'both geopolitically and on the battlefield' before any kind of dialogue with Russia. 'Weakness of any of our allies will inspire (Russian President Vladimir) Putin,' he said. 'That’s why we’re asking them to strengthen us, in terms of security guarantees, in terms of weapons, in terms of our future after this war. In my view, he (Putin) only understands force.' The specifics of Zelenskyy’s blueprint have been kept quiet but contours of the plan have emerged, including the need for fast action on decisions Western allies have been mulling since the full-scale invasion began in 2022. Kyiv is still awaiting word from Western partners on its repeated requests to use the long-range weapons they provide to hit targets on Russian soil. Some Balkan states have been providing Ukraine with short-range weapons. At a previous summit with southeast European countries in February, Zelenskyy pleaded for more to repel Russian advances. On Wednesday, Zelenskyy signed an agreement with Croatia on further cooperation, particularly regarding humanitarian aid, demining and war crimes prosecution experience that Croatia has from its own 1991-95 war. Besides Croatia, the summit was being attended by premiers, presidents or foreign ministers from Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Greece, Kosovo, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Romania, Serbia, Slovenia and Turkey. Serbia’s President Aleksandar Vucic's government is the only one in Europe that has not imposed sanctions on Russia over its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, although Vucic has repeatedly said that Serbia respects Ukraine’s 'territorial integrity.' Summit participants passed a declaration condemning Russia's aggression against Ukraine and supporting Zelenskyy's peace efforts, Ukraine's membership in NATO and its reconstruction after the war. 'There can be no free, peaceful and prosperous Europe without a free, peaceful and prosperous Ukraine,' the joint declaration said.	https://apnews.com/article/croatia-ukraine-summit-southeast-europe-14888717f7e62179dd5ac9e6dd9274c5	2024-10-09T02:51:10-07:00	
Ukrainian drone strikes another arms depot inside Russia, officials say	KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A Ukrainian drone struck an important arms depot inside Russia, the Ukraine military said Wednesday, three weeks after another drone blasted a major Russian armory and three days after a drone smashed into a key oil terminal in Russia-occupied Crimea. The Tuesday night strike targeted an arsenal in Russia’s Bryansk border region where missiles and artillery munitions were stored, including some that had been delivered by North Korea, a Ukrainian General Staff statement said. Hugely powerful glide bombs that have terrorized civilian areas of Ukraine and bludgeoned Ukrainian army defenses were also kept at the arsenal, located 115 kilometers (70 miles) from the Ukrainian border, and some of the ammunition was stored in the open, it said. 'Striking such arsenals creates serious logistical problems for the Russian army, thus significantly reducing (its) offensive capabilities,' the statement said. Russia is expending enormous amounts of ammunition as it makes its advantage in artillery shells felt on the battlefield in a war of attrition that is approaching its 1,000-day milestone next month. Its slow but relentless drive deeper into Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region is stretching Ukraine’s resources just as some of Kyiv’s key Western partners are being distracted by domestic concerns and Middle East wars. Ukraine is building up its own arms industry, and authorities have identified drones as an important aspect of that. 'Among the key areas identified are drones for our army, and this should be a supply that not only constantly increases in volume, but also evolves and develops in line with the demands of war,' Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a video address late Tuesday about weapons production. The Russian military has also improved its drones’ capabilities and expanded their use. Russian drones targeted Ukraine’s southern Odesa region for the third night in a row on Tuesday, injuring five people, regional Gov. Oleh Kiper said. However, Ukraine’s air defenses have proved resilient against drones. The Ukrainian air force said Wednesday it shot down 21 out of 22 drones that Russia launched over three Ukrainian regions. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine	https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-drone-arms-depot-bryansk-096d0ddf453a9000623a91b29c735e3c	2024-10-09T01:31:46-07:00	
An American once imprisoned in Russia is sentenced in absentia as Ukraine mercenary	MOSCOW (AP) — An American who spent three years behind bars in Russia before being released in a prisoner exchange has been convicted in absentia for fighting as a mercenary in Ukraine, Russia's Investigative Committee said Wednesday. The committee, Russia's primary criminal investigation authority, said in a statement that Trevor Reed was sentenced by a Russian court to 14 1/2 years in prison. Reed was injured in the fighting in eastern Ukraine in 2023 and treated in Germany. His whereabouts at the time of the sentencing were not immediately known. Reed, a former US Marine, was arrested in Moscow in 2019 for allegedly assaulting a police officer while heavily intoxicated. Russian authorities claimed he had grabbed the steering wheel of the police vehicle taking him to a so-called 'drunk tank.' However, police did not produce video evidence from the vehicle's camera and Reed's girlfriend, who was following in a separate car, said she did not see the vehicle swerve. The then-US ambassador, John Sullivan, said the evidence against Reed in the trial was so preposterous that 'even the judge laughed.' Reed was sentenced to nine years in prison. He was released in April 2022 in exchange for Russian drug smuggler Konstantin Yaroshenko. He reportedly joined the Ukraine military as a foreign fighter in November 2022. The announcement of Reed's conviction came two days after a Moscow court convicted 72-year-old American Stephen Hubbard of fighting in Ukraine as a mercenary and sentenced him to nearly seven years. Hubbard was captured by Russia about two months after the Febrruary 2022 start of full-scale fighting in Ukraine.	https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-trevor-reed-russia-389dccc3c8f557bc9c598e29d1429773	2024-10-09T01:05:32-07:00	
Israeli offensive in hard-hit northern Gaza kills dozens and threatens hospitals	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — A large-scale Israeli operation in northern Gaza has killed dozens of people and threatens to shut down three hospitals over a year into the war with Hamas, Palestinian officials and residents said Wednesday. Heavy fighting was underway in Jabaliya, where Israeli forces have carried out several major operations over the course of the war and then returned as militants regroup. The entire north, including Gaza City, has suffered heavy destruction and has been largely isolated by Israeli forces since late last year. The continuing cycle of destruction and death in Gaza, unleashed by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel, comes as Israel expands a weeklong ground offensive against Hezbollah in Lebanon and considers a major retaliatory strike on Iran. A rocket fired from Lebanon killed two people in the northern Israeli town of Kiryat Shmona, and another six people were wounded in a series of stabbings in the city of Hadera on Wednesday, which Israeli police described as a militant attack. Police said the attacker was 'neutralized,' indicating he was killed. Hezbollah claimed the strike on Kiryat Shmona, saying it targeted 'a gathering of enemy forces' with a rocket salvo. Ofir Yehezkeli, the town's acting mayor, said the two people killed were a couple who were walking their dogs when a rocket fell near them. Residents of Jabaliya, an urban refugee camp dating back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation, said thousands of people have been trapped in their homes since the operation began Sunday, as Israeli jets and drones buzz overhead and troops battle militants in the streets. 'It’s like hell. We can’t get out,' said Mohamed Awda, who lives with his parents and six siblings. He said there were three bodies in the street outside his home that could not be retrieved because of the fighting. 'The quadcopters are everywhere, and they fire at anyone. You can’t even open the window,' he told The Associated Press by phone, speaking over the sound of explosions. Dozens have been killed and survivors fear displacement Gaza's Health Ministry said it recovered 40 bodies from Jabaliya from Sunday until Tuesday, and another 14 from communities farther north. There are likely more bodies under rubble and in areas that can't be accessed, it said. An airstrike in Jabaliya early Wednesday killed at least nine people, including two women and two children, according to Al-Ahly Hospital, which received the bodies. Strikes in central Gaza killed another nine people, including three children, according to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah. Residents of Jabaliya fear Israel’s aim is to depopulate the north and turn it into a closed military zone or a Jewish settlement. Israel has blocked all roads except for the main highway leading south from Jabaliya, according to residents. The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees said it was evacuating seven schools that were being used as shelters and that only two of eight water wells in the camp are still functioning. 'We are concerned about the displacement to the south,' Ahmed Qamar, who lives in Jabaliya with his wife, children and parents, said in a text message. 'People here say clearly that they will die here in northern Gaza and and won’t go to southern Gaza.' Hospitals are under threat Fadel Naeem, the director of Al-Ahly Hospital in Gaza City, said it had received dozens of wounded people and bodies from the north. 'We declared a state of emergency, suspended scheduled surgeries, and discharged patients whose conditions are stable,' told AP in a text message. Israel’s offensive has gutted Gaza’s health sector, forcing most of its hospitals to shut down and leaving the rest only partially functioning. Naeem said three hospitals farther north — Kamal Adwan, Awda and the Indonesian Hospital - have become almost inaccessible because of the fighting. The Gaza Health Ministry says the Israeli army has ordered all three to evacuate staff and patients. Meanwhile, no humanitarian aid has entered the north since Oct. 1, according to U.N. data. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the hospitals or the apparent suspension of aid delivery in the north. Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the military spokesperson, said late Tuesday that Israeli forces were operating in Jabaliya to 'prevent Hamas' regrouping efforts' and had killed around 100 militants, without providing evidence. Israel says it only targets militants and blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it fights in residential areas. Israel ordered the wholesale evacuation of northern Gaza, including Gaza City, in the opening weeks of the war, but hundreds of thousands of people are believed to have remained there. Israel reiterated those instructions over the weekend, telling people to flee south to an expanded humanitarian zone where hundreds of thousands are already crammed into squalid tent camps. The war began just over a year ago, when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. They still hold around 100 hostages, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel's offensive has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not say how many were fighters. It has said women and children make up over half of the dead. The offensive has also caused staggering destruction across the territory and displaced around 90% of the population of 2.3 million people, often multiple times. Israel warns Lebanon it could end up like Gaza Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to keep fighting until 'total victory' over Hamas and the return of all the captives. On Tuesday, he warned that Lebanon would meet the same fate as Gaza if its people did not rise up against Hezbollah, which began firing rockets into Israel after the initial Hamas attack. That set in motion a cycle of escalation that ignited a full-scale war last month. 'You have an opportunity to save Lebanon before it falls into the abyss of a long war that will lead to destruction and suffering like we see in Gaza,' Netanyahu said, addressing the Lebanese people. An Israeli strike killed four people and wounded another 10 at a hotel sheltering displaced people in the southern Lebanese town of Wardaniyeh on Wednesday, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry. An Associated Press reporter in a nearby town heard two sonic booms from Israeli jets before the strike. Plumes of smoke rose from the building after the explosion. In recent weeks Israel has waged a heavy air campaign across large parts of Lebanon, targeting what it says are Hezbollah rocket launchers and other militant sites. A series of strikes killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and most of his top commanders. So far, ground operations appear to be focused on a narrow strip along the border, but Israel has warned people to evacuate dozens of cities and towns, many of them north of a buffer zone declared by the United Nations after the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah. Hezbollah's acting leader, Sheikh Naim Kassem, said in a televised statement Tuesday that the group has replaced its slain commanders and was preventing Israeli ground forces from advancing. The militants have extended their rocket fire deeper into Israel, disrupting life but causing few casualties. The Israeli military said Wednesday that Hezbollah has fired more than 12,000 rockets, missiles and drones at Israel since the start of the hostilities last year. Israel is meanwhile considering options for a strike on Iran that could potentially escalate the war on yet another front. Iran, which supports Hezbollah and Hamas, launched a wave of some 180 ballistic missiles at Israel last week in retaliation for the killing of top militants from both groups. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

Nobel Prize in chemistry awarded to 3 scientists for work on proteins, building blocks of life	STOCKHOLM (AP) — Three scientists who discovered powerful techniques to predict and even design novel proteins — the building blocks of life — were awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry on Wednesday. Their work used advanced technologies, including machine learning, and holds the potential to transform how new drugs are made. The prize was awarded to David Baker, who works at the University of Washington in Seattle, and to Demis Hassabis and John Jumper, who both work at Google DeepMind, a British-American artificial intelligence research laboratory based in London. Heiner Linke, chair of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry, said the award honored research that unraveled long-standing scientific mysteries. 'That was actually called a grand challenge in chemistry, and in particular in biochemistry, for decades. So, it’s that breakthrough that gets awarded today,' he said. What is the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for? Proteins are complex molecules with thousands of atoms that twist, turn, loop and spiral in a countless array of shapes. The shape of a protein determines its biological function. For decades, scientists have dreamed of being able to efficiently design and build new proteins. Baker, whose work has received funding from the National Institutes of Health since the 1990s, created a computer program called Rosetta that helped analyze information about existing proteins in comprehensive databases in order to build new proteins that don't exist in nature. 'It seems that you can almost construct any type of protein now with this technology,' said Johan Åqvist of the Nobel committee. Hassabis and Jumper created an artificial intelligence model that has been able to predict the structure of virtually all the 200 million proteins that researchers have identified, the committee added. The duo 'managed to crack the code. With skillful use of artificial intelligence, they made it possible to predict the complex structure of essentially any known protein in nature,' Linke said. Why this work matters? The ability to custom design new proteins — and better understand existing proteins — could enable researchers to create new kinds of medicines and vaccines. It could also allow scientists to design new enzymes to break down plastics or other waste materials, and to design fine-tuned sensors for hazardous materials. 'I think there’s fantastic prospects for making better medicines — medicines that are smarter, that only work in the right time and place in the body,' Baker told The Associated Press. One example is a potential nasal spray that could slow or stop the rapid spread of specific viruses, such as COVID-19, he said. Another is a medicine to disrupt the cascade of symptoms known as cytokine storm. 'That was always the holy grail. If you could figure out how protein sequences folded into their particular structures, then it might be possible to design protein sequences to fold into previously never seen structures that might be useful for us,' said Jon Lorsh of the NIH. Baker said Hassabis and Jumper's artificial intelligence work gave his team a huge boost. 'The breakthroughs made by Demis and John on protein structure prediction really highlighted to us the power that AI could have. And that led us to apply these AI methods to protein design and that has greatly increased the power and accuracy,' he said. How the winners reacted Baker told the AP he found out he won the Nobel during the early hours of the morning alongside his wife, who immediately started screaming. 'So it was a little deafening, too,' he said. Hassabis said in a statement that 'receiving the Nobel Prize is the honor of a lifetime.' One of Britain’s leading tech figures, he co-founded the AI research lab DeepMind in 2010, which was later acquired by Google. DeepMind’s breakthroughs include developing an AI system that mastered the Chinese game of Go and was able to defeat the game’s human world champion much faster than expected. Jumper said in the same statement that it was an honor to be 'recognized for delivering on the long promise of computational biology to help us understand the protein world and to inform the incredible work of experimental biologists.' 'It is a key demonstration that AI will make science faster and ultimately help to understand disease and develop therapeutics,' Jumper said. More about the Nobels Baker gets half of the prize money of 11 million Swedish Kronor ($1 million) while Hassabis and Jumper share the other half. It’s the second Nobel prize that has gone to someone with links to Google. Physics prize winner Geoffrey Hinton also previously worked at the tech company, but later quit so he could speak more freely about the potential dangers of artificial intelligence. Last year, the chemistry award went to three scientists for their work on quantum dots — tiny particles just a few nanometers in diameter that can release very bright colored light and whose applications in everyday life include electronics and medical imaging. Six days of Nobel announcements opened Monday with Americans Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun winning the medicine prize. Two founding fathers of machine learning — Hinton and John Hopfield — won the physics prize. The awards continue with the literature prize on Thursday. The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced Friday and the economics award on Oct. 14. The prize money comes from a bequest left by the award’s creator, Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel. The laureates are invited to receive their awards at ceremonies on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel’s death. ___ Corder reported from The Hague, Netherlands, and Larson reported from Washington, D.C.

Middle East latest: Dozens killed as Israeli troops pound central and northern Gaza	Israel’s bombardment of central and northern Gaza has killed dozens of people and trapped thousands in their homes, Palestinian officials said Wednesday, as the death toll in the yearlong war passed 42,000. Gaza’s Health Ministry said it recovered 40 bodies from Jabaliya from Sunday until Tuesday, and another 14 from communities farther north. The toll is likely higher as there are bodies buried under the rubble and in areas that can’t be accessed, it said. Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the military spokesperson, said that Israeli forces were operating in Jabaliya to prevent Hamas from regrouping and had killed about 100 militants, without providing evidence. Israel says it only targets militants and blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it fights in residential areas. A year ago, Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel’s security fence and stormed into army bases and farming communities, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. They are still holding about 100 captives inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel is now at war with Hamas in Gaza and its ally Hezbollah in Lebanon, which began firing rockets at Israel on Oct. 8, 2023. ___ Here is the latest: Airstrike kills 5 Lebanese Civil Defense paramedics, officials say BEIRUT — An Israeli airstrike hit a Lebanese Civil Defense center in the town of Dardghaya in southern Lebanon, killing five members stationed there Wednesday, civil defense spokesperson Elie Khairallah told The Associated Press. The Lebanese Health Ministry also confirmed the news in a statement, saying Israel has 'renewed its targeting of rescue and ambulance crews tonight, disregarding international laws, norms and humanitarian conventions.' There was no immediate statement from the Israeli military. Among the victims was Abdullah Al-Moussawi, head of the Tyre regional civil defense center, Khairallah said. The health ministry said teams continued to search for survivors in the rubble. Before Wednesday’s strike, six civil defense members had been killed since last October, Khairallah said. As of last Thursday, the health ministry reported that more than 100 paramedics had been killed by Israeli airstrikes since last October and 225 wounded, with significant damage to emergency infrastructure, including 128 ambulances and fire trucks destroyed, as well as damage to nine hospitals and 45 medical centers. Just last week, Al-Moussawi, spoke with the Associated Press, saying the Israeli airstrikes had made his team increasingly nervous, but that they were hopeful that the international protection guaranteed to medics would extend to them as well. 'We put international protection (tag) on our vehicles along with the (national) Civil Defense flag and we wear the yellow vests,' he said. Video shows what appears to be Israeli soldiers raising flag in Lebanon TEL AVIV, Israel — Video verified by The Associated Press shows what appears to be a group of Israeli soldiers raising an Israeli flag in a village in southern Lebanon. In the video, which appears to have been filmed in Maroun A-Ras, three soldiers are seen hoisting a flag atop a pile of debris. A soldier off camera speaks in Hebrew and refers to the nearby Israeli village of Avivim. It was not clear when the video was recorded. Israeli troops have been operating in Maroun a-Ras, where they have taken up positions inside a public garden on the edge of the village. The video follows other similar acts that took place throughout Israel’s ground offensive in Gaza. The Israeli military had no immediate comment. Israeli strike on Iran would be ‘lethal,’ defense minister says JERUSALEM — Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said Wednesday that an Israeli strike on Iran in response to its recent missile attack would be 'lethal' and 'surprising.' 'Our attack will be lethal, precise and above all surprising. They will not understand what happened and how it happened,' Gallant said during a speech to Israeli troops. Iran fired dozens of missiles at Israel last week in an escalation of the conflict between the two countries. Israel has vowed to respond to the missile attack but has not outlined what this retaliation would entail. The ballistic missile attack came weeks after Israel’s military intensified its airstrikes across Lebanon wiping out the majority of Hezbollah’s high ranking commanders including its leader, Hassan Nasrallah. In July, a strike in Tehran assassinated Hamas’ political leader, Ismael Haniyeh, and Iran blamed Israel. Israel has not confirmed or denied it was behind his killing. Iran is the main sponsor of the Lebanese militant group and Hamas in Gaza. Third Brazilian repatriation flight leaves Beirut RIO DE JANEIRO — Brazil’s third repatriation plane left Beirut for Brazil on Wednesday, carrying 218 passengers including 11 infants, as well as five pets, according to a statement from Brazil’s foreign ministry. The flight is set to land in Sao Paulo on Thursday morning local time after a stop to refuel in Lisbon. The Brazilian government has evacuated 674 people and 11 pets from Lebanon in five days, the foreign ministry said. The aircraft also delivered Brazil’s second donation of health supplies to Lebanon. About 21,000 Brazilians live in Lebanon, which is home to the largest community of Brazilians in the Middle East. Two Brazilian adolescents have been killed by Israeli bombardments in Lebanon. Biden and Netanyahu have first phone conversation in weeks WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday held their first call in seven weeks, a conversation that comes as Israel expands its ground incursion into Lebanon and considers how to respond to Iran’s recent ballistic missile attack. Vice President Kamala Harris joined the call, according to the White House. Meanwhile, Netanyahu’s office confirmed that the prime minister had recently spoken with former President Donald Trump. The Republican, who is the midst of a close White House race against Harris, called Netanyahu last week and 'congratulated him on the intense and determined operations that Israel carried out against Hezbollah,' according to Netanyahu’s office. 22 killed and 80 wounded in past 24 hours, Lebanon's health ministry says BEIRUT — Lebanon’s crisis response unit announced Wednesday that 22 people were killed and 80 wounded in the past 24 hours, raising the total toll over the past year of conflict between Israel and Hezbollah to 2,141 killed and 10,099 wounded, according to Lebanese Health Ministry. The report also recorded 70 airstrikes and incidents of shelling in the past day, mostly concentrated in southern Lebanon, the southern suburbs of Beirut and the Bekaa Valley. Some 1,000 centers — including educational complexes, vocational institutes, universities and other institutions — are sheltering 185,400 people displaced by the Israeli offensive in Lebanon, the report said. Half of those displaced are housed in facilities concentrated in Beirut and Mount Lebanon. Among these shelters, 807 have reached full capacity. Overall, the total number of displaced individuals in Lebanon stands at 1.2 million. Additionally, 15,000 displaced individuals have received medical treatment and medication. Despite a major border crossing between Lebanon and Syria being out of commission after an Israeli strike hit the road last week, crowds have continued to flow across the border seeking relative safety in Syria. Between Sept. 23 and Wednesday, Lebanese General Security recorded 311,034 Syrian citizens and 108,672 Lebanese citizens crossing into Syria, the report said. Palestinian militants killed by Israeli forces in West Bank, officials say JERUSALEM — The Palestinian Health Ministry said four Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces in the northern West Bank city of Nablus on Wednesday. A militant group later said the slain men were its fighters. Commenting on the incident, the Israeli police said its forces killed five militants, including a local commander in Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, an armed offshoot of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas’ Fatah party. The Associated Press was not immediately able to reconcile the conflicting death tolls. The military said the slain men were planning attacks against Israeli troops and civilians. Violence has surged in the West Bank since the Israel-Hamas war erupted 12 months ago. Over that time, more than 740 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire in the West Bank according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. Nablus and other northern cities have seen some of the territory’s worst violence. Palestinian journalist killed and another wounded in a Gaza airstrike JERUSALEM — A Palestinian journalist was killed and at least one other injured in an Israeli airstrike in northern Gaza on Wednesday, Palestinian health authorities said. Mohammed Tanani, a cameraman working with the Hamas-affiliated Al-Aqsa TV station, was killed in a blast at Abu Shrekh roundabout in the Jabaliya area, the Palestinian Red Crescent and Hamas-affiliated outlet said. Another Palestinian reporter from the TV station was wounded, the network said. The Committee to Protect Journalists, a media freedom organization, say 128 journalists have been killed since the Israel-Hamas war erupted last October. They include 123 Palestinian, two Israeli and three Lebanese media workers. 2 killed in a rocket attack on northern Israel TEL AVIV, Israel — Israeli first responders say a man and a woman were killed by a rocket fired from Lebanon. The Magen David Adom rescue service said the two were killed Wednesday when a rocket struck the northern town of Kiryat Shmona. Lebanon’s Hezbollah militant group has fired hundreds of rockets into Israel in recent days as Israel has ramped up its airstrikes in Lebanon and pushed ahead with a ground incursion. Most of the rockets have been intercepted or landed in open areas, but the barrages have grown more intense and have reached deeper into Israel, disrupting daily life. Hezbollah began firing rockets, missiles and drones into Israel after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack from Gaza into Israel ignited the war. Hezbollah and Hamas are both allied with Iran, and Hezbollah said the attacks were in support of the Palestinians. Israel retaliated with airstrikes, and the conflict escalated into a full-blown war last month. At least 4 killed in an Israeli strike in southern Lebanon BEIRUT — The Lebanese Health Ministry said at least four people were killed in an Israeli strike on a hotel-turned-shelter for displaced people in southern Lebanon. Ten others were wounded in the strike that hit the building in Wardaniyeh in Lebanon’s Chouf province. An Associated Press reporter in a nearby town heard two sonic booms and an explosion from Israeli jets before the strike, followed by plumes of black and white smoke rising from the building. At least 6 people stabbed and wounded in an attack in northern Israel TEL AVIV, Israel — At least six people were stabbed and wounded in northern Israel in what police say was a militant attack. Police said the assailant stabbed people in multiple locations in the northern city of Hadera on Wednesday before fleeing on a motorbike. Police said they shot and 'neutralized' the attacker, later clarifying that he was arrested. They did not provide the name or nationality of the assailant. Five of the people who were attacked were in critical or severe condition, while the sixth was moderately wounded, according to the nearby Hillel Yaffe Medical Center. Palestinians have carried out scores of stabbing, shooting and car-ramming attacks against Israelis in recent years, and tensions have spiked over the war in Gaza. Philippine president orders preparations for evacuation from Lebanon MANILA, Philippines — Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. ordered government agencies Wednesday to prepare to evacuate Filipinos 'by whatever means' from Lebanon. Marcos held a virtual meeting with key Cabinet members while attending a summit of Southeast Asia leaders in Laos, underscoring the urgency as Israel intensified attacks against the militant group Hezbollah. 'We are now going to evacuate our people by whatever means — by air, or by sea,' Marcos said, adding that any ship to be used has to be positioned near Beirut so Filipinos could immediately leave. About 11,000 Filipinos live and work in Lebanon, including many house helpers, but Philippine Foreign Affairs officials say many are hesitant to leave their jobs. Only about 171 Filipinos in Lebanon were ready for immediate repatriation, they said. Turkish navy ships bring humanitarian aid to Beirut and evacuate citizens BEIRUT — Turkish navy ships docked at a port in Beirut on Wednesday as a part of a mission to bring humanitarian aid to Lebanon and evacuate Turkish citizens. Two of the ships, which can accommodate up to 2,000 passengers, were carrying up to 300 tons of humanitarian aid consisting of food, tents and blankets, according to a statement from the Turkish Defense Ministry. Rear Adm. Nihat Baran, commander of the evacuation mission, said the trip was ordered by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan 'to ensure that our citizens living in Lebanon are transferred to Turkey safely.' Citizens of Bulgaria, Romania and Kazakhstan also applied for the evacuation, the ministry said. The two ships are part of a larger six-vessel convoy that departed the southern port of Mersin early Wednesday. The Turkish Foreign Ministry said additional evacuations would be organized if necessary. Gaza death toll passes 42,000 Gaza’s Health Ministry says the Palestinian death toll from the war in Gaza has passed 42,000. The ministry does not differentiate between fighters and civilians in its count, but has said women and children make up more than half of those killed. It said Wednesday that 42,010 Palestinians have been killed and 97,720 wounded since the start of the war, which was ignited by Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack into Israel. German police close pro-Palestinian protest camp Greta Thunberg planned to visit BERLIN — German police say they dissolved a pro-Palestinian protest camp in the western city of Dortmund after organizers told them that Swedish activist Greta Thunberg was planning to visit the camp. Dortmund police said late Tuesday the decision was made, among other reasons, because Thunberg’s appearance would probably have drawn more people to the protest camp than originally permitted. The dismantling of the camp, which had been in existence for months, was accepted without resistance, police said. Seven protesters were present at the camp on Tuesday, but Thunberg did not appear, German news agency dpa reported. On Monday, Thunberg participated in a pro-Palestinian protest in Berlin. 18 dead after Israeli strikes in Gaza DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Palestinian officials say Israeli strikes in central and northern Gaza killed at least 18 people, including five children and two women. Two strikes hit tents for displaced people in the urban Nuseirat and Bureij refugee camps in central Gaza early Wednesday. The bodies of nine people, including three children, were brought to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the nearby town of Deir al-Balah. An Associated Press journalist saw the bodies at the morgue. In northern Gaza, an Israeli strike hit a family home in the Jabaliya refugee camp, killing at least nine people, according to the Civil Defense, a rescue agency operating under the Hamas-run government. The dead were taken to the Al-Ahly Hospital, which said two women and two children were among those killed. Footage shared by the Civil Defense showed first responders recovering dead bodies and body parts from under the rubble. Israel launched an air and ground operation earlier this week in Jabaliya, a densely populated urban refugee camp dating back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation. Israel has carried out several previous operations in Jabaliya, and its forces have repeatedly returned to other areas of Gaza after militants have regrouped.	https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-hamas-latest-mideast-9-october-2024-753c6e5ca57cd79c248fede09283ba33	2024-10-08T22:19:10-07:00	
Ishiba dissolves Japan's lower house to set up an Oct. 27 parliamentary election	TOKYO (AP) — Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba dissolved Japan's lower house of parliament Wednesday to set up an Oct. 27 snap election and seek a mandate from voters for his 9-day-old government. Ishiba took office last week as Fumio Kishida resigned after leading the governing Liberal Democratic Party for three years as it was dogged by corruption scandals. With the early election, Ishiba is seeking to secure a majority in the lower house for his governing party while he is still fresh and before the congratulatory mood fades. The move has been criticized as prioritizing an election rather than policies and for allowing little debate. But Japan's opposition has remained too fractured to push the governing party out of power. Ishiba announced his plans for an election even before he won the party leadership vote and became prime minister. His Cabinet planned later Wednesday to formally announce the election date and the start of campaigning next Tuesday. Ishiba and his Cabinet will stay in office until they win the election and are reappointed. The speaker of the house, Fukushiro Nukaga, announced the dissolution of the lower, more powerful of the two parliamentary chambers at a plenary session. All 465 lawmakers stood up, cheered 'banzai' and rushed out of the assembly room. 'We will act fairly and squarely in order to win the people’s endorsement for the current administration,' Ishiba told reporters. 'Even while the lower house is dissolved the Japanese government must fully function' in tackling national security, disaster response and deflation, he said. 'We will devote all our body and soul for the people.' Ishiba planned to explain the election plans at a news conference late Wednesday, just before heading to Laos to make his diplomatic debut at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit. Opposition leaders have criticized him for rushing to hold an election allowing only three days of parliamentary debate on his policies and before achieving any results. Even though opposition parties are too fractured to topple the governing party's almost uninterrupted postwar rule, the first public support ratings for Ishiba as prime minister were only about 50% or even lower, the lowest levels for a new leader, according to Japanese media. Ishiba is increasingly seen as backpedaling on a number of proposals he previously advocated so as not to create controversy ahead of the election. In his first policy speech at parliament Friday, he did not touch on his goal of establishing a stronger regional military framework and a more equal Japan-U.S. security alliance, a dual surname option for married couples, and other issues seen as controversial or opposed by conservatives within the governing party. Ishiba is unaffiliated with factions led and controlled by party heavyweights, which some experts say could make his tenure as party leader unstable. None of his Cabinet ministers is from the late Shinzo Abe’s faction that has been linked to damaging misconduct. He also plans to not endorse some members of the Abe faction in the upcoming election to show his determination for cleaner politics. Opponents have said that’s still too lax, but Ishiba is getting backlash within the party for being too strict. ___ Follow AP’s Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific	https://apnews.com/article/japan-politics-ishiba-pariament-dissolution-election-6e7ffd74ff17e263b8aea1283f0afbe8	2024-10-08T22:07:19-07:00	
A kitchen staffed by trans women is a refuge for Mexico City’s LGBTQ+ community	MEXICO CITY (AP) — Karolina Long Tain González Rodríguez plops another corn cake into the piping hot oil of a large pan. As she grabs a set of tongs to flip them one by one, she yells across the kitchen realizing she’s pressed for time. 'We open in 15 minutes!' she shouts over the cumbia music playing in the background. At Casa Lleca, an LGBTQ+ shelter in Mexico City’s Peralvillo neighborhood, a community kitchen was founded two months ago to provide employment opportunities to transgender women — and serve surrounding residents in the area. As González, 36, reaches over for more of the corn cakes to fry, Thalia Trejo busies herself stuffing shredded pork into small masses of dough. While they've only worked together for a short time, González says she runs a kitchen based on mutual respect and communication. 'We know how to talk to each other… and we know how to find a solution. We’re a really united trans community, we’re really understanding,' she said. The community kitchen was born after Casa Lleca received approval from city authorities to open through a social welfare program, as many trans women in the shelter were having trouble finding work. Casa Lleca's founder and human rights activist Victoria Sámano, 30, had brought up the idea to González, who came from a culinary background. 'She (Victoria) saw the opportunity to employ our friends who arrived unhoused and gave them dignified work,' González said. Much of the funding for the kitchen came from the women themselves, who purchased appliances, chairs and tables to create an authentic dining experience. González, a native of Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca, arrived at Casa Lleca seven months ago seeking refuge and a fresh start as a trans woman. She had studied cooking in middle and high school, but then dropped out, and after working in a kitchen in Oaxaca, she left for Mexico City to begin her transition. Once in the capital, she was recommended to a plastic surgeon who gave her faulty breast implants and, after one of them ruptured, he refused to give her a warranty — or operate her again. That's when she said her life began to spiral. 'I acquired lots of bad vices, lots of bad habits, and that took me to a lot of dark places,' she recalled. 'But God always has a plan for us.' When she arrived at Casa Lleca, things began to turn around. Sámano approached her after noticing her active involvement in the shelter and strong work ethic. She thought González could be a good fit to lead the kitchen. Along with her other helpers, González runs a tight crew. All kitchen employees are up by 7 a.m. to bathe and drink coffee. They start cooking at 8:30 a.m. and prepare for customers’ arrival at 1 p.m. For González, the kitchen has become a safe space where she can also use all of her culinary knowledge. 'Now that I found this kitchen, this project and this rhythm of life, I’ve found a way to fulfill my dreams as a young person,' she said. Though the kitchen initially began as an idea to serve and employ their community, as soon as it opened, residents in the surrounding neighborhood started to flock in. Out in front of Casa Lleca, Sámano guides customers into the small dining room set up for the community kitchen. Etched onto a whiteboard hung on a steel door, the menu reads in big black letters, 'chicharrón gorditas, soup, beans and dessert.' A full meal for only 11 pesos (about 50 cents). They cook lunch for up to 150 people a day, including workers like 31-year-old Alan Olivares, who has become a regular. Olivares, a cleaner who works in the nearby Cuauhtemoc neighborhood, has been eating at the kitchen for the past couple of weeks. 'In addition to saving some money, the food is delicious,' he said, adding that he was happy to see the shelter thriving in its new business. 'Mexico needs to have a more open mind, we’re all human and it’s part of our diversity,' he said. Sámano founded Casa Lleca in 2020, right in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, in an effort to help LGBTQ+ folks and sex workers who were unhoused or at risk of losing their homes. As hotels remained shut down, many had been left without a home or workplace. She said many of the shelters that were opened by the government at that time didn’t know how to address the needs of the LGBTQ+ community. 'When they arrive in these spaces, they are often violated or discriminated against,' said Sámano. 'In part by other residents, but (also) by the staff who don’t know where to place them because of their gender identity.' 'One day, when we leave this place, we’re going to say ‘thank you, Casa Lleca’ for showing me how to live,' said González. 'Thank you for showing me new progress in my life.' Still, many trans individuals like González are not given the space and support to embrace who they are, and are often vulnerable to dangerous situations. Mexico’s trans community continues to face challenges, and transgender individuals continue to be killed, sparking protests and anger. So far this year, 36 trans people have been killed in Mexico, according to an August report from the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. Some progress has been made. At least 20 Mexican states have passed legislation to protect trans people. Mexico City in July passed the Paola Buenrostro law, named after a trans woman and sex worker killed in 2016, making transfemicides a crime punished by a prison sentence of up to 70 years. Sámano believes adopting laws to support trans individuals is crucial. She points at laws passed recently in Spain and Colombia that cover everything, from access to medical services to labor protections for trans people. '(These laws) address many areas of life for a trans person, and put emphasis on the tools for them to overcome and — in some cases — to survive,' said Sámano. For residents of Casa Lleca, the community kitchen has also helped to raise awareness about who they are and what role they play in the neighborhood. 'Now that they’ve tried the food, and they saw we opened the kitchen with a really nice atmosphere, people started to approach us,' said González. 'How should I refer to you all? They ask… ‘We’re trans women,’ I would tell them. People have been really accepting.' ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america	https://apnews.com/article/mexico-city-trans-women-community-lgbtq-3f5aecc86dd8e5843374d2abe8f73dbf	2024-10-08T19:04:44-07:00	
Climate change boosted Helene's deadly rain and wind and scientists say same is likely for Milton	Human-caused climate change boosted a devastating Hurricane Helene 's rainfall by about 10% and intensified its winds by about 11%, scientists said in a new flash study released just as a strengthening Hurricane Milton threatens the Florida coast less than two weeks later. The warming climate boosted Helene's wind speeds by about 13 miles per hour (20.92 kilometers per hour), and made the high sea temperatures that fueled the storm 200 to 500 times more likely, World Weather Attribution calculated Wednesday from Europe. Ocean temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico were about 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) above average, WWA said. 'Hurricane Helene and the storms that were happening in the region anyway have all been amplified by the fact that the air is warmer and can hold more moisture, which meant that the rainfall totals — which, even without climate change, would have been incredibly high given the circumstances — were even higher,' Ben Clarke, a study co-author and a climate researcher at Imperial College London, said in an interview. Milton will likely be similarly juiced, the authors said. The scientists warned that continued burning of fossil fuels will lead to more hurricanes like Helene, with 'unimaginable' floods well inland, not just on coasts. Many of those who died in Helene fell victim to massive inland flooding, rather than high winds. Helene made landfall in Florida with record storm surge 15 feet (4.57 meters) high and catastrophic sustained winds reaching 140 miles per hour (225.31 kilometers per hour), pummeling Georgia, the Carolinas, Tennessee and Virginia. It decimated remote towns throughout the Appalachians, left millions without power, cellular service and supplies and killed over 230 people. Search crews in the days following continued to look for bodies. Helene was the deadliest hurricane to hit the mainland U.S. since Katrina in 2005. Helene dumped more than 40 trillion gallons of rain — an unprecedented amount of water — onto the region, meteorologists estimated. That rainfall would have been much less intense if humans hadn’t warmed the climate, according to WWA, an international scientist collaborative that runs rapid climate attribution studies. 'When you start talking about the volumes involved, when you add even just a few percent on top of that, it makes it even much more destructive,' Clarke said. Hurricanes as intense as Helene were once expected every 130 years on average, but today are about 2.5 times more likely in the region, the scientists calculated. The WWA launched in 2015 to assess the extent which extreme weather events could be attributed to climate change. The organization’s rapid studies aren’t peer-reviewed but use peer-reviewed methods. The team of scientists tested the influence of climate change on Helene by analyzing weather data and climate models including the Imperial College Storm Model, the Climate Shift Index for oceans and the standard WWA approach, which compares an actual event with what might have been expected in a world that hasn't warmed about 1.3 degrees Celsius since pre-industrial times. A separate analysis of Helene last week by Department of Energy Lawrence Berkeley National Lab scientists determined that climate change caused 50% more rainfall in some parts of Georgia and the Carolinas, and that observed rainfall was 'made up to 20 times more likely in these areas because of global warming.' That study was also not peer-reviewed but used a method published in a study about Hurricane Harvey. Kim Cobb, director of the Institute at Brown for Environment and Society, wasn't involved in either study. She said there are uncertainties in exactly how much climate change is supercharging storms like Helene, but 'we know that it’s increasing the power and devastation of these storms.' She said Helene and Milton should serve 'as a wake up call' for emergency preparedness, resilience planning and the increased use of fossil fuels. 'Going forward, additional warming that we know will occur over the next 10 or 20 years will even worsen the statistics of hurricanes,' she said, 'and we will break new records.' Analysis is already indicating climate change made possible the warmed sea temperatures that also rapidly intensified Milton. Clarke said the two massive storms in quick succession illustrates the potential future of climate change if humans don't stop it. 'As we go into the future and our results show this as well, we still have control over what trajectory this goes in as to what risks we face in the future, what costs we pay in the future,' he said. 'That just hinges on how we change our energy systems and how many more fossil fuels we burn.' ___ Read more of AP’s climate coverage at http://www.apnews.com/climate-and-environment ___ Alexa St. John is an Associated Press climate solutions reporter.

Trump has long blasted China's trade practices. His 'God Bless the USA' Bibles were printed there	WASHINGTON (AP) — Thousands of copies of Donald Trump’s 'God Bless the USA' Bible were printed in a country that the former president has repeatedly accused of stealing American jobs and engaging in unfair trade practices — China. Global trade records reviewed by The Associated Press show a printing company in China’s eastern city of Hangzhou shipped close to 120,000 of the Bibles to the United States between early February and late March. The estimated value of the three separate shipments was $342,000, or less than $3 per Bible, according to databases that use customs data to track exports and imports. The minimum price for the Trump-backed Bible is $59.99, putting the potential sales revenue at about $7 million. The Trump Bible’s connection to China, which has not been previously reported, reveals a deep divide between the former president’s harsh anti-China rhetoric and his rush to cash in while campaigning. The Trump campaign did not respond to emails and calls seeking comment. Trump says his Bibles would help America The largest and most recent load of 70,000 copies of Trump’s Bible arrived by container vessel at the Port of Los Angeles on March 28, two days after Trump announced in a video posted on his Truth Social platform that he’d partnered with country singer Lee Greenwood to hawk the Bibles. In the video, Trump blended religion with his campaign message as he urged viewers to buy the Bible, inspired by Greenwood’s ballad, 'God Bless the USA.' The Bible includes copies of the U.S. Constitution, Declaration of Independence, Bill of Rights and Pledge of Allegiance. 'This Bible is a reminder that the biggest thing we have to bring back in America, and to make America great again, is our religion, Trump said. Judeo-Christian values, he added, are 'under attack, perhaps as never before.' Trump didn’t say where the 'God Bless the USA' Bibles are printed, or what they cost; a copy hand-signed by the former president sells for $1,000. Trump also didn't disclose how much he earns per sale. A version of the $59.99 Bible memorializes the July 13 assassination attempt on the former president in Pennsylvania. Trump’s name is on the cover above the phrase, 'The Day God Intervened.' The wording appears to have been stamped on after the Bible was produced. Trump said Saturday his would-be assassin did not succeed 'by the hand of providence and the grace of God.' The Bibles are sold exclusively through a website that states it is not affiliated with any political campaign nor is it owned or controlled by Trump. A photo posted on the website shows Trump sitting at his desk in the Oval Office with Greenwood standing beside him. In another photo, the former president smiles broadly while holding a copy of the Bible. Trump's name and image are licensed The website states that Trump’s name and image are used under a paid license from CIC Ventures, a company Trump reported owning in his most recent financial disclosure. CIC Ventures earned $300,000 in Bible sales royalties, according to the disclosure. It’s unclear what period that covers or how much Trump received in additional payments since the disclosure was released in August. AP received no response to questions sent to an email on the Bible website and to a publicist for Greenwood. For years, Trump has castigated Beijing as an obstacle to America’s economic success, slapping hefty tariffs on Chinese imports while president and threatening even more stringent measures if he’s elected again. He blamed China for the COVID-19 outbreak and recently suggested, without evidence, that thousands of Chinese immigrants are flooding the U.S. to build an 'army' and attack America. But Trump also has an eye on his personal finances. Pitching Bibles is one of a dizzying number of for-profit ventures he’s launched or promoted, including diamond-encrusted watches, sneakers, photo books, cryptocurrency and digital trading cards. The web of enterprises has stoked conflict of interest concerns. Selling products at prices that exceed their value may be considered a campaign contribution, said Claire Finkelstein, founder of the nonpartisan Center for Ethics and the Rule of Law and a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania. 'You have to assume that everything that the individual does is being done as a candidate and so that any money that flows through to him benefits him as a candidate,' Finkelstein said. 'Suppose Vladimir Putin were to buy a Trump watch. Is that a campaign finance violation? I would think so.' Selling Bibles, she added, 'strikes me as a profoundly problematic mixing of religion and state.' Potential conflicts of interest As president, Trump would be in a position to influence policies and markets to benefit businesses in which he and his family have financial stakes. While president, his administration exempted Bibles and other religious texts from tariffs imposed on billions of dollars of Chinese goods. There’s a potentially lucrative opportunity for Trump to sell 55,000 of the 'God Bless the USA' Bibles to Oklahoma after the state’s top education official ordered public schools to incorporate Scripture into lessons for grades 5 through 12. Oklahoma plans to spend $3 million on Bibles that initially matched Trump’s edition: a King James Version that contains the U.S. founding documents. The request was revised Monday to allow the U.S. historical documents to be bound with the Bible or provided separately. Oklahoma’s Department of Education did not answer AP’s questions about whether the Bibles must be printed in the United States or if any department officials have discussed the proposal with Trump or his representatives. 'There are hundreds of Bible publishers and we expect a robust competition for this proposal,' said department spokesman Dan Isett. Chinese printing company confirms shipments China is one of the world’s leading producers of Bibles, so it’s not unusual for the Trump-endorsed version to be printed there. The first delivery of Trump Bibles was labeled 'God Bless USA,' according to the information from the Panjiva and Import Genius databases. The other two were described as 'Bibles.' All the books were shipped by New Ade Cultural Media, a printing company in Hangzhou that describes itself as a 'custom Bible book manufacturer.' They were sent to Freedom Park Design, a company in Alabama that databases identified as the importer of the Bibles. Tammy Tang, a sales representative for New Ade, told AP all three shipments were 'God Bless the USA' Bibles. She said New Ade received the orders via the WhatsApp messaging service and confirmed they were from Freedom Park Design. The books were printed on presses near the company’s Hangzhou office, she said. Tang did not disclose the sales price or other details, citing customer confidentiality. 'They didn’t come to meet us,' Tang said by telephone. 'We just do the production.' She declined further comment and referred interview requests to Freedom Park Design. Freedom Park Design was incorporated in Florida on March 1, according to business registration records. An aspiring country singer named Jared Ashley is the company’s president. He also co-founded 16 Creative, a digital marketing firm that uses the same Gulf Shores address and processes online orders for branded merchandise sold by entertainers and authors. Ashley hung up on a reporter who called to ask about the Bibles. Greenwood is a client of 16 Creative, according to the firm’s website. He launched the American-flag emblazoned Bible in 2021. His song, 'God Bless the USA,' was released 40 years ago and is a staple at Trump rallies. Greenwood has also appeared at the former president’s campaign events. Critics call Trump Bible a ‘toxic mix’ The King James Version used in the Trump Bible is in the public domain. Greenwood had initially planned to use the best-selling New International Version licensed in North America by HarperCollins Christian Publishing. But the publisher abandoned the arrangement amid pressure from religious scholars and authors who denounced the merger of Scripture and government documents as a 'toxic mix' that would fuel Christian nationalism sentiments in evangelical churches. Christian nationalism is a movement that fuses American and Christian values, symbols and identity and seeks to privilege Christianity in public life. Christian nationalists are likely to believe the U.S. Constitution was inspired by God and that the federal government should declare the U.S. a Christian nation. Other critics called the Trump Bible blasphemous. 'Taking what has long been understood as a global message religiously and stamping it with the flag of one nation is the type of thing that for centuries theologians would call heresy,' said Brian Kaylor, a Baptist minister and president of the Christian media company Word&amp;Way. ‘Love of money’ Tim Wildsmith, a Baptist minister who reviews Bibles on his YouTube channel, said he quickly noticed the signs of a cheaply made book when his 'God Bless the USA' Bible arrived wrapped in plastic inside a padded mailer. It had a faux leather cover, and words were jammed together on the pages, making it hard to read. He also found sticky pages that ripped when pulled apart, and there was no copyright page or information about who printed the Bible, or where. 'I was shocked by how poor the quality of it was,' Wildsmith said. 'It says to me that it’s more about the love of money than it is the love of our country.' ___ Kang reported from Beijing.
